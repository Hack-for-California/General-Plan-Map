PURPOSE
                         State General Plan law requires jurisdictions to prepare a Circulation
                         Element which addresses “…the general location and extent of existing
                         and proposed major thoroughfares, transportation routes, terminals, any
                         military airports and ports, and other local public utilities and facilities, all
                         correlated with the land use element of the plan.”
                         The Circulation Element addresses how people, goods and resources move
                         throughout the community. The proper planning of these movements
                         ensures an efficient community that provides the services to those in need.
                         This element primarily addresses the City’s street network which
                         establishes the existing conditions of streets and a Circulation Plan for
                         expanding the street network to service the land uses planned for in the
                         Land Use Element. The basis for the Circulation Plan is a comprehensive
                         traffic analysis based on the Land Use Plan and regional plans. This will
                         serve as a guide to new development on the necessary street improvements
                         to serve specific development. The Circulation Element also addresses
                         public transportation concerns, the City’s trails network, and major utility
                         corridors.

BACKGROUND
RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
                        The Circulation Element is written in conjunction with all other elements
                        of the General Plan, most notably the Land Use, Open Space and Safety
                        Element. One of the goals of the Circulation Element is to provide
                        alternative forms of transportation. The goals of the Open Space Element
                        echo this concern by identifying the need to provide a trail system for
                        health and recreational benefits for the community. Similarly, areas
                        specified in the Safety Element such as emergency evacuation routes are
                        repeated in circulation.
                        Table CI-1 shows the other General Plan Elements which have provisions
                        complementing those in this Circulation Element.

                 CIRCULATION
     SETTING/CONTEXT
                    The City of Twentynine Palms is a desert community, which has seen
                    relatively little development in the past. The recent housing boom in
                    Southern California brought new development to the City, primarily
                    residential development. The City’s commercial development is located
                    primarily along the City’s major corridors which are Twentynine Palms
                    Highway and Adobe Road and within the City’s Downtown area.
                    Currently, there is a minimal amount of industrial development in the
                    City, primarily located southeastern of Downtown and along Adobe Road.
                    It is estimated that only 15% of the City has been developed.
                    Existing streets within the City boundaries vary in improvement and
                    condition. Most of the City’s primary streets are two-lane paved streets.
                    Twentynine Palms Highway and Adobe Road are four-lane paved streets.
                    The majority of Twentynine Palms’ local streets are dirt streets.
                    The City’s previous Circulation Plan as amended January 27, 2009
                    included 8-Lane and 6-Lane Expressways, Arterials, Secondaries,
                    Collectors, and Local Commercial and Industrial Streets. Only designated
                    General Plan streets are shown on the previous Circulation Plan. Those
                    streets not shown on the previous Circulation Plan are either local or rural
                    local streets; these streets are classified as Non-General Plan streets. The
                    City’s previous circulation system is generally laid out in a grid pattern.
     Major Thoroughfares
                    East/west corridors are extremely important to the City because of the
                    City’s location in relation to the Joshua Tree National Park (south of the
                    City) and the Marine Base (north of the City) as these corridors provide
                    the primary circulation linkages beyond the City’s boundary. The
                    National Park and Marine Base limit any possible north or south
                    connections beyond the City’s boundary, as streets cannot be constructed
                    through these facilities. The City’s primary east/west corridors include:
                          Twentynine Palms Highway
                          Two Mile Road
                          Amboy Road

                              Baseline Road
                         While the City’s east/west corridors provide for more regional
                         transportation, the north/south corridors act as branches to distribute traffic
                         from the regional streets to more local streets. The City’s primary
                         north/south corridors include:
                              Adobe Road
                              Utah Trail
                              Lear Avenue
                              Mesquite Springs Road
Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center
                         The Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center (MCAGCC or Marine
                         Base) is located north of the City. Access to the Marine Base is through
                         the base’s main entrance on Adobe Road, its rear entrance on Condor
                         Road as well as an entrance on Morongo Road that is outside the City’s

                         Travel of military convoys is limited to the General Plan designated
                         military routes as described in the Special Transportation Routes section
                         below. The military routes are generally located along the City’s northern,
                         eastern, and western boundaries.
Joshua Tree National Park
                         The Joshua Tree National Park is located south of the City. According to
                         United States Park Service, a total of 1,397,553 persons visited the
                         National Park in 2008, of which 22.9% of park visitors accessed the
                         National Park through the City of Twentynine Palms.

                   CIRCULATION
                      Accessibility to the National Park is extremely important to the area’s
                      tourism industry. As of 2009, there are three access points to the National
                      Park through the City, the main entrance is located on Utah Trail, a second
                      entrance is located on Indian Cove Road, and a third entrance is located on
                      Canyon Road (Fortynine Palms Canyon Road). The Canyon Road
                      entrance ends on a trail staging area located at the National Park’s
                      northern boundary. The Indian Cove Road entrance provides vehicular
                      access only to the Indian Cove Campground. The Utah Trail entrance
                      provides full access to the National Park. All streets leading up to the
                      National Park entrances are improved.
     Sphere-of-Influence
                      Similar to street conditions within the City, the primary circulation streets
                      within the City’s Sphere-of-Influence consist of two-lane paved streets
                      with the majority of local streets being dirt streets. The County of San

AREAS OF CONCERN
STREET CIRCULATION PLAN
                         The street system in Twentynine Palms serves three key functions: streets
                         1) facilitate movement of people and goods, 2) connect neighborhoods,
                         and 3) create statements of civic pride and beauty. While the primary
                         purpose of the street network is to facilitate movement within and through
                         Twentynine Palms, streets lend identity to neighborhoods and business
                         districts. To better understand the function identified in the Circulation
                         plan, a review of the City’s street functional classifications is included
                         below.
STREET CLASSIFICATIONS AND DESIGN
                         The design of streets within Twentynine Palms is important to improve the
                         City’s circulation system while still preserving the City’s desert and rural
                         nature. The design or sizing of street facilities is associated with the
                         anticipated traffic to be created by the land uses proposed by the General
                         Plan’s Land Use Element. The determination of the appropriate street
                         sizes also helps the City identify areas needing substantial improvement
                         and the impacts development has on the existing street system.

  Expressway
                           The function of an Expressway is to transport large volumes of inter-
                           and intra-city traffic or to distribute traffic to the Arterial network.
                           Within the City, Twentynine Palms Highway and Amboy Road are the
                           primary expressways. The following standards are applicable to streets
                           designated as Expressways:
                                   A 120-foot right-of-way consisting of a minimum of six traffic
                                    lanes, two 10-foot parking lanes and a 12-foot wide continuous
                                    left turn lane and/or median strip.
                                   Traffic signals are located at major intersections meeting
                                    specified warrants.
                                   Parking restrictions generally apply within 100 feet of
                                    intersections.
                                   Curb, gutters and sidewalks are required along all Expressways.
                                   Limited Access, preferably intersections on Section Lines as the
                                    ideal limitation; intersections on half-sections as generally
                                    acceptable; and intersections on quarter-sections or three quarter-
                                    sections as minimally tolerable. Individual lot access is to be
                                    prohibited where legally possible.
                                   Modified sections may be approved by the City Engineer where
                                    there is existing development or natural hazards, such as

      Arterial
                  Arterials transport large volumes of intra-city traffic. An Arterial
                  provides circulation within a defined geographic area, providing access
                  and connections between other Arterials and/or Expressways. These
                  streets distribute traffic to Collectors within the City and provide
                  efficient access to nearby destinations. Some vehicles may use Arterials
                  as through routes, but the primary function of an Arterial is to route local
                  traffic from Expressways to their destination and vice versa. The
                  following standards are applicable to streets designated as Arterials:
                         A 104-foot wide right-of-way consisting of a minimum of four
                          traffic lanes, two parking lanes and 12-foot wide continuous left
                          turn lane and/or median strip.
                         Traffic signals may be located at major intersections.
                         Parking restrictions may be applied within 100 feet of
                          intersections.
                         Curbs, gutters and sidewalks are required along all Arterials.
                         Access to be limited to quarter section, half-section, three-
                          quarter-section and section line street intersections, individual lot
                          access to be restricted where possible and reasonable.
                          Commercial driveways should be combined, limited, and
                          adequately spaced.

      LEVEL OF SERVICE AND STREET CAPACITY
                    Level of Service (LOS) is a measure of efficiency as it relates to traffic
                    movement. The 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) is the current
                    technical guide used to evaluate traffic movement utilized by the City of
                    Twentynine Palms. The HCP defines LOS as a qualitative measure
                    which describes operational conditions within a traffic stream, generally
                    in terms of factors such as speed and travel time, freedom of maneuver,
                    traffic interruptions, comfort and convenience, and safety.

                                                                    CIRCULATION
                           The criteria used to evaluate LOS conditions vary based on the type of
                           street and whether the traffic flow is considered uninterrupted or
                           interrupted. According to the 2000 HCM, the definitions of LOS for
                           uninterrupted flow (flow unrestricted by the existence of traffic control
                           devices) are:
                                   LOS “A” – Represents free flow. Individual users are virtually
                                    unaffected by the presence of others in the traffic stream.
                                   LOS “B” – Is in the range of stable flow, but the presence of
                                    other users in the traffic stream begins to be noticeable. Freedom
                                    to select desired speeds is relatively unaffected but there is a
                                    slight decline in the freedom to maneuver.
                                   LOS “C” – Is in the range of stable flow, but marks the
                                    beginning of the range of flow in which the operation of
                                    individual users becomes significantly affected by interactions
                                    with others in the traffic stream.
                                   LOS “D” – Represents high-density but stable flow. Speed and
                                    freedom to maneuver are severely restricted and the driver
                                    experiences a generally poor level of comfort and convenience.
                                   LOS “E” – Represents operating conditions at or near the
                                    capacity level. All speeds are reduced to a low but relatively
                                    uniform value. Small increases in flow will cause breakdowns in
                                    traffic movement.
                                   LOS “F” – Is used to define forced or breakdown flow. This
                                    condition exists wherever the amount of traffic approaching a
                                    point exceeds the amount which can traverse the point. Queues
                                    form behind such locations.
                           The definitions of Level of Service for interrupted traffic flow (flow
                           restrained by the existence of traffic signals and other traffic control
                           devices) differ slightly depending on the type of traffic control. The
                           HCM expresses LOS at an intersection in terms of average delay as
                           shown in Table CI-2.

      TWENTYNINE PALMS HIGHWAY
                    Twentynine Palms Highway represents a constraint on the City’s
                    circulation system as it divides the City in two. Crossing the highway is
                    a challenge, particularly for pedestrians. Maintenance and highway
                    improvements must be coordinated through Caltrans as Twentynine
                    Palms Highway is part of the State Highway System. Even though
                    Twentynine Palms Highway represents a constraint on the City’s
                    circulation system, it also serves as the City’s only access route as there
                    are no other access alternatives besides the highway.
                    Due to the highway’s role as the main thoroughfare in and out of the
                    City, it receives a high volume of traffic. In the interest of preserving
                    the downtown environment, the highway is downgraded from an
                    Expressway to an Arterial between Larrea Avenue and Utah Trail for a
                    narrower street and reduced traffic speeds. In addition, alternate parallel
                    routes are available primarily for local traffic to offset the reduced
                    speeds and traffic levels on the highway within the downtown area.

  DOWNTOWN CIRCULATION AND PARKING
                           In 2008, the City of Twentynine Palms began preparing a specific plan
                           for the Downtown area. As part of the Downtown Specific Plan effort,
                           parking provisions and standards have been developed to better address
                           the parking needs of the Downtown district. The City of Twentynine
                           Palms owns several properties in the Downtown area and plans to
                           improve some of these properties as parking facilities. The parking
                           facilities will be constructed as dictated by the Specific Plan and as
                           necessitated by development in the area.
  SPECIAL STUDY AREAS
  Adobe Road
                           Adobe Road is designated as an Expressway in the Circulation Plan.
                           However, this street crosses through the City’s downtown and core areas
                           of the City. A typical expressway would be developed with six lanes
                           with a total right-of-way of 120 feet. This study area is intended to
                           evaluate an alternative street and parkway design through the downtown
                           area and connecting to the Marine Base that is compatible with the
                           pedestrian environment desired for the City’s downtown and core areas
                           and accommodates the anticipated traffic for Adobe Road.
  Mesquite Springs Road/Two Mile Road/Larrea Avenue
                           Currently Mesquite Springs Road and Two Mile Road intersect at a
                           four-way stop and Larrea Avenue intersects Two Mile Road
                           approximately 250 feet west of this intersection. At the current traffic
                           level, this alignment presents few issues. However, upon buildout of the
                           City’s proposed land uses, the level of traffic anticipated may result in
                           stacking at the intersection that would block Larrea Avenue and possibly
                           create unsafe intersections and traffic movements. The study area is
                           designated to analyze how the intersection and/or Larrea Avenue could
                           be redesigned to accommodate anticipated future traffic conditions.

                  CIRCULATION
      Twentynine Palms Highway/Larrea Avenue/Morongo Road
                     Currently a traffic signal has been installed at Twentynine Palms
                     Highway and Larrea Avenue. Morongo Road represents a substantial
                     north-south street connecting Amboy Road to Twentynine Palms
                     Highway in the Circulation Plan. Morongo Road currently does not
                     connect to Twentynine Palms Highway, but it is aligned to connect close
                     to the intersection with Larrea Avenue. In order to accommodate
                     Morongo Road’s north-south connection to Twentynine Palms Highway,
                     it is anticipated that Morongo Road connect to Larrea Avenue prior to its
                     intersection with Twentynine Palms Highway (as shown on the
                     Circulation Plan). The study area is designated to analyze the specific
                     alignment of this realignment and connection to Larrea Avenue or other
                     potential alternatives.
      Two Mile Road/Lear Avenue
                     As discussed further in the following Special Transportation Routes
                     section, military convoy routes are designated to bypass the core area of
                     the City utilizing Amboy Road, Two Mile Road, and Lear Avenue to
                     connect westerly to Twentynine Palms Highway. In order to further
                     facilitate these routes, this study area is designated to analyze potential
                     additional left turning lanes from westerly Two Mile Road to southerly
                     Lear Avenue and additional right turning lanes from northerly Lear
                     Avenue to easterly Two Mile Road beyond the standard improvement
                     requirements. The right turning lanes may bypass a 90-degree turning
                     movement at the intersection and instead provide a more efficient “free”
                     turning movement that maintains vehicle speeds and limits idling.
      Twentynine Palms Highway/Lear Avenue
                     This study area is similar to the Two Mile Road/Lear Avenue study area
                     in purpose, but would analyze potential additional right turning lanes
                     from southerly Lear Avenue to westerly Twentynine Palms Highway
                     and additional left turning lanes from easterly Twentynine Palms
                     Highway to northerly Lear Avenue beyond the standard improvement
                     requirements. The right turning lanes may bypass a 90-degree turning
                     movement at the intersection and instead provide a more efficient “free”
                     turning movement that maintains vehicle speeds and limits idling.

                                                                    CIRCULATION
  STREET IMPROVEMENTS
                           Street improvements typically involve the grading and paving of a street.
                           A property served by improved streets have a greater ease of access to
                           use the site, whether that site be residential, commercial, industrial or
                           recreational in use compared to a property served by an unimproved
                           street. Improved streets also allow for greater vehicle speeds, thus
                           increasing circulation system efficiency. In addition, impacts to noise,
                           air quality from fugitive dust, and community aesthetics are typically
                           reduced with quality improved streets.
                           Road improvements in the City of Twentynine Palms are very limited.
                           Most, if not all, streets in the City are not improved to the ultimate
                           improvement standard. The vast majority of local streets are dirt streets.
                           Typical street improvements include two-lanes of pavement, one-lane of
                           pavement on each direction. Aside from Twentynine Palms Highway
                           and Adobe Road, even the City’s primary corridors are generally only
                           improved to the two-lane pavement standard.
                           The primary reason that most streets are not improved is because street
                           construction is extremely costly. The lack of street improvements is also
                           attributed to the fact that the City is fairly large in terms of geographical
                           area, which requires more streets to provide an adequate level of service
                           to City residents.
                           For areas already developed with non-standard, non-maintained streets,
                           citizens may form a Street Improvement Assessment District for
                           construction of streets. Streets in a Street Improvement Assessment
                           District are constructed and the cost assessed to the property owners
                           within the District. The cost is divided among the property owners by
                           evaluating the benefits to each property. Payments are made along with
                           the owners’ property tax and may be spread out over many years.
                           Financing is generally provided by the issuance of municipal bonds.

                   CIRCULATION
      Street MaintEnance
                      Over time, improved streets deteriorate and require resurfacing or
                      repaving streets or patching potholes. Regular maintenance is also
                      necessary for curbs and gutters as well as landscape maintenance along
                      parkways within street right-of-ways. These maintenance activities
                      allow for efficient travel movement along streets, reduce noise impacts
                      of traffic and improve the aesthetics of the City’s streets.
                      Upon incorporation, the City inherited a maintenance system from the
                      County in which some streets were maintained and others were not.
                      Streets that were built to the County’s standard were in the maintained
                      system, but the maintained system assumed from the County also
                      included unpaved, substandard streets. Repair and maintenance of these
                      streets by the City has continued.
                      In the City of Twentynine Palms, street maintenance is provided by the
                      City’s Public Works Department. The lack of resources limits the
                      ability to perform street maintenance throughout the City. Typically
                      maintenance is only provided to streets improved to City’s standards;
                      however, during emergencies, street maintenance is provided to all City
                      streets. The City’s existing circulation system will continue to strain the
                      City’s ability to provide adequate street maintenance to all City streets,
                      as the system programs over 150 linear miles of General Plan streets at
                      system build-out.
      FLOOD CONTROL CHANNEL CROSSINGS
                      Flooding hazards are a major physical hazard that impacts the City’s
                      circulation system. Streets constructed within floodplains and washes
                      are typically severely impacted by floods during storms. Floodplains
                      can significantly impact the City’s circulation system as access can be
                      hindered during an emergency.
                      According to FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Maps, the area generally
                      located south of the City’s drainage channel between Encelia Avenue on
                      the west and Bullion Mountain Road on the east, is located within a 100-
                      Year Floodplain. The floodplain area extends north of Twentynine
                      Palms Highway along both sides of Utah Trail up to Raymond Drive.
CI-22                                                       City of Twentynine Palms General Plan 2012

                                                                  CIRCULATION
                           The most evident flooding constraint on the circulation system is the
                           drainage channel that bisects the City. The channel begins east of the
                           commercial center, south of Twentynine Palms Highway and east of
                           Lupine Avenue, and ends on the northeastern section of the City, at the
                           intersection of Bagdad Highway and Raymond Drive. The earthen
                           drainage channel splits the City in two. The impacts of the channel on
                           the circulation system are more evident during storm events as several
                           north/south bound streets are closed during storm events. The channel
                           poses a significant risk to the City’s circulation system as the system is
                           laid out on a grid pattern causing several streets to cross the channel at
                           grade. There are only a limited number of all-weather crossings in the
                           City, the all-weather crossings are located at:
                                   Twentynine Palms Highway, east of Lupine Avenue.
                                   Mariposa Avenue, north of Twentynine Palms Highway.
                                   Larrea Avenue, north of Twentynine Palms Highway.
                                   Mesquite Springs Road, north of Twentynine Palms Highway.
                                   Adobe Road, between Buena Vista Drive and Civic Center
                                    Drive.
                                   Utah Trail, south of Joe Davis Drive.
                                   Amboy Road, east of Utah Trail.
                           During a flooding emergency, such as the storm of 2008, north/south
                           bound access is limited as most streets that cross the channel are closed.
                           The challenge of crossing the channel is multiplied by the fact that
                           several streets cross the channel. To provide all-weather crossings for
                           all of those streets would be extremely costly.

                       largest military facilities in the United States, is located north of the
                       City. To avoid circulation conflicts between residents and the transport
                       of military personnel and equipment, the General Plan designates
                       specific routes for military use. The Marine Base uses the military
                       convoy routes to ensure that City streets are not impacted by the military
                       transports. The military convoy routes are shown on Exhibit CI-7. The
                       military convoy routes are located along the City’s western, northern,
                       and eastern boundaries, thus avoiding streets located within the City’s
                       central area. All streets designated as military convoy routes are
                       improved.

Truck Routes
                         To ensure that the City’s circulation system is not severely impacted by
                         large commercial trucks, the General Plan designates specific streets for
                         commercial truck use. The truck routes are shown on Exhibit CI-8. Truck
                         access in the City of Twentynine Palms is limited to major streets. All
                         streets designated as truck routes are improved except for Amboy Road,
                         from Twentynine Palms Highway to Adobe Road, and Bullion Mountain
                         Road, from Twentynine Palms Highway to Amboy Road. The Circulation
                         Plan calls for all truck routes to be improved.
Emergency Access
                         Access to the City in the event of a major disaster is critical for the
                         delivery of emergency personnel and supplies. Access to the community
                         may be impacted by natural and man-made barriers, and each major
                         ground route in the area is potentially subject to significant damage from
                         earthquakes and flooding. As an alternative means of access to the City,
                         the Twentynine Palms Airport provides airplane and helicopter services
                         and is located just outside the City’s boundaries. There are also multiple
                         heliports available on the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center for
                         use in situations of emergency. In order to improve ground access to the
                         City in the event of a major disaster, it is crucial that all-weather and
                         earthquake-resistant bridges and culverts are developed as the City
                         continues to grow.
                         The following goals and implementation               policies   outline the
                         implementation of the circulation plan.

                CIRCULATION
      PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION
                   Promoting the use of transit within, to, and from Twentynine Palms is a
                   sustainable practice that reduces the number of vehicles on the street and
                   the amount of fossil fuels consumed by commuters. By using transit, we
                   reduce traffic congestion, reduce the need for costly street improvement
                   projects, improve air quality, and encourage a healthier population. Also,
                   many Twentynine Palms residents cannot drive or choose not to drive.
                   Pre-teen and teenage youth, the elderly, and disabled persons rely on
                   public transit to go shopping, visit doctors, and attend community
                   activities and events.
                   Transit service in the Morongo Basin, including the City of Twentynine
                   Palms, is provided by the Morongo Basin Transit Authority (MBTA).
                   Transit service in Twentynine Palms is limited to bus service only, as
                   there are no other modes of public transportation in the City. As of 2009,
                   the City is served by four regular fixed bus routes operated by MBTA.
                   The only other transit service that MBTA provides aside from the fixed
                   bus service routes is a program called “Ready Ride”. The Ready Ride is a
                   reservation based specialized transit program designated for the elderly
                   and handicapped offering discount rates and point to point service.
                   As of 2010, MBTA constructed a transit center in Twentynine Palms. The
                   transit center is located east of Adobe Road and south of Cactus Avenue,
                   just south of the City’s Senior Community Center. The facility includes
                   four (4) bus bays and accompanying bus shelters.
                   The following goal and implementation policies outline the provision of
                   public transportation services in the City.

NON-MOTORIZED TRANSPORTATION
                         Walkability, access, convenience, connections and facilities are necessary
                         components of a circulation system that easily and specifically
                         accommodates to non-motorized modes of transit. Non-motorized
                         transportation routes, typically referred to as trails, serve as a recreational
                         amenity for people to exercise and to experience their community outside
                         of the confines of an automobile via hiking, biking or horse riding.
                         Beyond their practical use for people to get around, trails are an important
                         amenity to the community for recreation. Trails also provide greater
                         function of a city’s street system by accommodating a wider range of users
                         instead of just motorized vehicles.

                   As of 2009, the Morongo Basin Open Space Group (MBOSG), with
                   assistance from the U.S. National Park Service, is developing a regional
                   trails system for the entire Morongo Basin. As part of this effort, the
                   MBOSG is working with the Twentynine Palms Community Services
                   Department to further develop the City’s trail system by incorporating
                   pedestrian, equestrian, and multi-purpose trails as part of the City’s trail

      SCENIC CORRIDORS
                   Scenic corridors provide motorists with views of distinctive natural
                   characteristics that are unique and have high aesthetic value. The intent of
                   distinguishing a scenic corridor is to conserve scenic resources along
                   scenic highways or streets and to manage development along such
                   corridors so that it will preserve and compliment the area's natural
                   characteristics.
                   The City of Twentynine Palms is set at the bottom of a valley between the
                   mountains and hills of Joshua Tree National Park to the south and the
                   Bullion Mountains to the north. This location offers the City and its
                   highways and streets spectacular views of these great natural features.
                   Protection of these views is important when planning the City’s circulation
                   system and adjacent land uses.

AVIATION
                         Airports provide facilities for alternative forms of long distance traveling
                         from automobiles. Most such travel is accommodated by larger public
                         airports in the region such as Palm Springs International Airport or
                         Ontario International Airport. Within and surrounding Twentynine Palms,
                         airports are available for private owned airplane use either for travel or as
                         a hobby or leisure activity purposes. One publicly owned airport, one
                         military airport, and four private airstrips are located in the vicinity of
                         Twentynine Palms. All airport and airstrip facilities are shown on Exhibit
                         CI-10.
Airports
Twentynine Palms Municipal Airport
                         The Twentynine Palms Municipal Airport is located south of Twentynine
                         Palms Highway approximately 1.5-miles east of the City’s eastern
                         boundary. The airport is a public use facility operated by the County of
                         San Bernardino. The airport does not have a control tower. Airport
                         communication is conducted via a CTAF/UNICOM 122.8 system. Fuel is
                         available at the airport for purchase.
                         According to the FAA, the airport consists of two paved lighted runways.
                         Runway 8/26, an east/west runway, is 5,531 feet long by 75 feet wide.
                         Runway 17/35, a north/south runway, is 3,797 feet long by 50 feet wide.
                         As of 2009, the airport is base to 16 aircrafts, which includes 11 single-
                         engine airplanes, one multi-engine airplane, and four glider airplanes. The
                         airport can accommodate virtually all general aviation aircraft with a
                         maximum takeoff weight of 12,500 pounds or less. As of 2006,
                         approximately 18,000 annual operations (inbound and outbound flights)
                         take place at the airport. Due to limited access to water resources, there
                         are no anticipated plans for expansion or additional improvements to the
                         airport.

                      CIRCULATION
                         The Twentynine Palms Municipal Airport improves the efficiency of the
                         City’s circulation system, as the airport provides a second means of access
                         to the City in the event of an emergency. Direct impacts on City streets
                         are minimal as the airport is located beyond the City’s boundary and is
                         only accessible via Twentynine Palms Highway, thus minimizing impacts
                         on local City streets.
      Twentynine Palms Strategic Expeditionary Landing Field (SELF)
                         The Twentynine Palms Expeditionary Airfield is a military airport located
                         on the Marine Base, beyond the City limits. The airport is located
                         approximately seven miles northwest of the City’s northwestern boundary.
                         The Twentynine Palms Expeditionary Airfield does not impact the City’s
                         circulation system as the airport is located beyond the City’s boundary and
                         is only used for military missions. Access to the airport is provided
                         through the Marine Base.
      Private Airstrips
                         There are four private airstrips in the vicinity of Twentynine Palms. One
                         of the private airstrips is located within the City and the other three private
                         airstrips are located within a half-mile of the City’s boundaries. The
                         private airstrips exhibit the following similar characteristics:
                                All airstrips are privately owned and operated.
                                None of the airstrips have a control tower.
                                Airstrip communication is limited, only the Dick Dale Skyranch
                                 Airport uses a communication system.
                                The runways at all airstrips are unpaved (dirt surface), except for
                                 one (1) of the Dick Dale Skyranch Airport runways, which is
                                 partially paved.
                                Runway lighting is not available at any of the airstrips.
                                Fuel is not available at any of the airstrips.
CI-42                                                              City of Twentynine Palms General Plan 2012

                                                                  CIRCULATION
                         More detailed characteristics for each one of the airstrips is provided
                         below. Air travel out of the airstrips consists of private use. As such,
                         impacts on the City’s circulation system are minimal, as use of the
                         airstrips is relatively low. All airstrips are served by paved streets. Direct
                         access to the airstrips is primarily via major streets, thus impacts on local
                         City streets is minimal.
                         Cones Field Airport

Heliports
                         There is one heliport facility located at the Robert E. Bush Naval Hospital.
                         The hospital is located on the Marine Base which is part of the area that
                         was annexed to the City in 2000. The heliports located on the base,
                         including the heliport at the Robert E. Bush Naval Hospital, do not impact
                         the City’s circulation system as these facilities are located on the Marine
                         Base and are only used for military purposes.

 CONSERVATION AND OPEN SPACE
PURPOSE
                          State General Plan law requires jurisdictions to prepare a Conservation
                          Element which addresses “…water and its hydraulic force, forests, soils,
                          rivers and other waters, harbors, fisheries, wildlife, minerals, and other
                          natural resources.” In addition, State law requires cities to prepare an
                          Open Space Element which addresses “…open space for the preservation
                          of natural resources including, but not limited to, areas required for the
                          preservation of plant and animal life, … for the managed production of
                          resources,… for outdoor recreation,… for public health and safety,… in
                          support of the mission of military installations”.
                          Twentynine Palms has decided its interests are best served by preparing an
                          optional element dealing with recreation. This relieves the City of the
                          need to incorporate discussion of recreation issues within the Open Space
                          Element, leaving the Open Space Element to discuss primarily natural
                          resources.
                          Such natural resources are also generally discussed in a conservation
                          element, but from a different perspective. However, the State General
                          Plan Guidelines allow for the consolidation of elements when there is
                          significant overlap in the issues they are addressing. With the issues
                          dealing with recreation being discussed in a separate element, the City has
                          decided to combine the Conservation Element with the Open Space
                          Element in this single element.
                          The purpose of this Conservation/Open Space Element is to provide the
                          public, decision makers and staff a guide to set policy that will:
                                  Provide the background for and details the City’s plans to preserve
                                   natural areas and resources;
                                  Identify resources that should be preserved;
                                  Set the foundation for preservation of these resources;
                                  Promote sustainability and environmental integrity;
                                  Establish the City's priorities as they relate to natural, historical
                                   and paleontological resources and outline the means for their
                                   preservation;
 City of Twentynine Palms General Plan 2012                                                              CO-1

     CONSERVATION AND OPEN SPACE
             Preserve existing open space and other undeveloped natural
              resources;
             Identify specific criteria in the future selection of open space;
             Help mitigate the conflict between development and construction
              with the preservation and use of natural resources and
             Develop policies that will better preserve and manage its natural
              resources as the City continues to grow.
       The Conservation/Open Space Element is intended to identify various
       kinds of resources which have value for the City. Such resources define
       the community and help to preserve the natural integrity of the
       community. Additionally, the identification of natural resources will help
       determine the on-going sustainability and viability of a Twentynine Palms.

                         identifies seven mandatory elements in a General Plan, including
                         Conservation. This Section defines the element and resources to be
                         analyzed, including water, hydraulic force, forest, soils, rivers, harbors,
                         fisheries, wildlife, minerals, and other natural resources. All applicable
                         resources have been identified and discussed in this section.
                         Government Code 65560 et seq. requires cities and counties to prepare and
                         adopt an open space element categories such as preservation of natural
                         resources, the managed production of resources, outdoor recreation, public
                         health and safety, support of military operations, and coordination with
                         Native American practices and religion.
                         This combined Conservation/Open Space Element addresses all mandates
                         of State Law and has been prepared in accordance with the 2003 State
                         General Plan Guidelines as issued by the Governor’s Office of Planning
                         and Research.
RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER ELEMENTS
                         The Conservation/Open Space Element is written in conjunction with all
                         other elements of the General Plan, most notably the Land Use,
                         Recreation, Circulation and Safety Element. The primary goal of this
                         Element is the identification and preservation of resources deemed
                         sensitive or important to the City. This goal relates to the Land Use
                         Element closely as it similarly identifies areas to limit or restrict
                         development as well as to the Safety Element which identifies hazardous
                         geological areas or areas of flooding to limit or restrict development and
                         preserve as natural open space. The Recreation Element and Circulation

                CONSERVATION AND OPEN SPACE
                   Element are both closely tied to this element as it relates to the location of
                   trails and parks and their connections to natural open space areas and other
                   resources.
                   Table CO-1 shows the other General Plan Elements which have provisions
                   coordinating with those in this Conservation/Open Space Element.

       SETTING/CONTEXT
                   The City of Twentynine Palms is located in the Morongo Basin which
                   forms the southwestern corner of the Mojave Desert. This basin includes
                   Joshua Tree National Park and the Marine Corps Ground Air Combat
                   Center, which visitors pass through Twentynine Palms to reach. The
                   Mojave Desert is separated from the Sonoran desert to the south by the
                   Little San Bernardino and Eagle Mountains, which are extensions of the
                   Transverse Ranges. The western Mojave Desert is a flat, sparsely
                   vegetated region that is interspersed with mountain ranges and dry lakes.

CONSERVATION AND OPEN SPACE
AREAS OF CONCERN
BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES
                         With its rich and varied landscape, the Morongo Basin accommodates
                         several ecological habitats that are home to numerous flora and fauna.
                         Preserving habitat not only aids in sustaining species survival, but also
                         maintains the quality of life in the Valley and promotes tourism.
West Mojave Plan
                         The West Mojave Plan is a multiple species planning effort that
                         encompasses 9.4 million acres in the Mojave Desert. The plan area
                         extends from Olancha in Inyo County in the north to the San Gabriel and
                         San Bernardino Mountains in the south, and from the Antelope Valley in
                         the west to the Mojave National Preserve in the east. Approximately one
                         third of the planning area is private land; another third of the land is within
                         military bases; and the final third consists of public lands managed by the
                         BLM. The plan focuses on the federally and State-listed desert tortoise
                         and the State-listed Mohave ground squirrel, but also addresses 100 other
                         special status plant and wildlife species. Twenty-eight participating
                         federal, state, and local agencies and jurisdictions have teamed in this
                         planning effort. The purpose of the West Mojave Plan is to provide
                         regional or area-wide protection of natural areas and to promote
                         perpetuation of natural wildlife diversity while allowing compatible
                         development and growth. Twentynine Palms is located in the southeastern
                         portion of the West Mojave Plan Area.

                   CONSERVATION AND OPEN SPACE
                       Preparation of the West Mojave Plan began in 1992 with a series of
                       scoping meetings, which continued over a period of ten years. The
                       Biological Opinion to amend the BLM California Desert Conservation
                       Area Plan was issued by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in January
                       2006. As of 2009, the HCP for non-federal lands is not yet complete; the
                       covered species, boundaries of the conservation areas, survey
                       requirements, funding requirements, and implementing conservation
                       actions for each species require a more detailed description for the local
                       governments to obtain Incidental Take Permits (ITPs) under the Federal
                       and State Endangered Species Acts. Until the Implementation Agreement
                       is signed, the West Mojave Plan will not be in effect on non-federal lands
                       in the planning area.
     Special Status Species
                       In lieu of the implementation of the West Mojave Plan on non-federal
                       lands, all applicable regulations from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
                       (USFWS) and California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) apply to
                       the City and their permitting of development proposals. These agencies
                       and private conservation organizations develop lists of “special status
                       species” that may be of concern due to a documented or perceived decline
                       in a species population.
                       A federally endangered species is one facing extinction throughout all, or
                       a significant portion of, its geographic range. A federally threatened
                       species is one likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future
                       throughout all or a significant portion of its range. The presence of any
                       federally threatened or endangered species on a project site generally
                       imposes severe constraints on development, particularly if development
                       would result in “take” of the species or its habitat.

      Habitat and Vegetation
                         While the desert environment may seem harsh and uninhabitable, many
                         species have made this their preferred habitats where they are allowed to
                         thrive. As habitats diminish in size or quality, the viability of a species
                         dependent on that habitat also diminishes. Protection of the area’s desert
                         habitats is key to the preservation of special status species previously
                         discussed.
                         Habitat for plants and animals is provided by the vegetation of the area,
                         which includes the landforms, soils and plants typically native to the area.
                         Vegetation may be considered as special status if they support
                         concentrations of special status plant or wildlife species, are of relatively
                         limited distribution, or are of particular value to wildlife. Twenty-one
                         vegetation types and other areas occur in the City as shown in Exhibits
                         CO-2 through CO-7. One special status vegetation type, desert fan palm
                         oasis, is located within the eastern area of the City. Oases provide water,
                         palm fruit, and shade to desert wildlife species during the long, hot desert
                         summers.
                         Although limited due to the desert environment, the few riparian areas
                         provide temporary areas for unique species of the desert. Various
                         watercourses outlet into the City from the surrounding mountains and
                         hills. The majority of these watercourses drain to the central portion of the
                         City and then further east. Most of the City’s watercourses do not reach a
                         larger body of water, but instead dissipate from either percolation into the
                         soil or from evaporation. Multiple dry lake beds dot the City, most
                         notably Mesquite Lake, Cones Lake, and Shortz Lake.                        These
                         watercourses rarely accommodate regular water flow outside of seasonal
                         storm events. The protection of these watercourses is important to provide
                         for the unique riparian habitats that exist in the desert.
                         One of the more important riparian areas lies in the western portions of the
                         City and the unincorporated area northwest of the City which drains in a
                         northeasterly direction towards the Mesquite Dunes, which lie west of
                         Adobe Road near the Marine Base. The Mesquite Dunes includes the
                         Mesquite Dunes Bosque and Playa Lakebed. The Playa Lakebed is a
                         wetland habitat riparian area containing fairy shrimp, clam shrimp, tadpole
                         shrimp, and water fleas.

Plants
                         Plants both provide the much desired shade and refuge for wildlife in the
                         desert environment but also provide a source of food to a variety of
                         wildlife. Sixteen special status plants are known to or may potentially
                         exist within the City. None are listed as either endangered or threatened
                         by the USFWS or the CDFG, but are listed by the California Native Plant
                         Society. These are listed in Table OS-2 Open Space Technical Report in

Wildlife
                         The City and surrounding area are home to a wide variety of mammals
                         and reptiles in particular as well as other wildlife that have adapted to the
                         desert environment. Of these wildlife, 36 are listed as special status that
                         are known to or may potentially exist within the City. These are listed in
                         Table OS-3 in the Open Space Technical Report in the Technical
                         Appendix
                         The wildlife species of most importance within the City and surrounding
                         area is the desert tortoise, which is listed as a threatened species by the
                         USFWS and the CDFG. Another wildlife species of note is the
                         swainson’s hawk, which is listed by the CDFG as threatened. The least
                         bell’s vireo, listed as endangered by the USFWS and CDFG, has potential
                         to occur within the City, but is unlikely due to an absence of suitable
                         habitat.
Wildlife Corridors
                         Wildlife corridors link together areas of suitable wildlife habitat that are
                         otherwise separated by rugged terrain, changes in vegetation, or human
                         disturbance. The fragmentation of open space areas by urbanization
                         creates isolated “islands” of wildlife habitat. In the absence of habitat
                         linkages that allow movement to adjoining open space areas, some
                         wildlife species, especially the larger and more mobile mammals, will not
                         likely persist over time in fragmented or isolated habitat areas because
                         they prohibit the infusion of new individuals and genetic information.
                         As a result of a state interagency workshop, the Joshua Tree-Twentynine
                         Palms Connection was designated within and near the City. The
                         connection occurs in an ecological transition zone between the Mojave
                         and Sonoran desert eco-regions. The linkage connects areas of open space
                         in Joshua Tree National Park and the Marine Base. The distance between
                         Joshua Tree National Park and the Marine Base varies from approximately
                         9 to 22 miles. These two areas support a large diversity of species.

      CONSERVATION AND OPEN SPACE
        The connection includes 307,807 acres, of which approximately 71
        percent currently receives some level of conservation protection. The
        majority of the City is outside the connection area. However, some
        residential areas on the outskirts of the City are within the area.
        Generally, four linkages occur across the City: two in the west, one in the
        north, and one in the east as shown on Exhibit CO-3
        The following goals and implementation policies outline the preservation
        and protection of endangered and specials status species and their habitats.

      CULTURAL RESOURCES
                        The identity of a community is, in part, derived from its past. By
                        preserving historic structures, places, and landmarks in Twentynine Palms,
                        that identity can be preserved. There are many cultural resource sites
                        within the City and its sphere of influence (SOI) area. The City is also
                        home to the 29 Palms Historical Society, which is active in preservation of
                        cultural resources within the City and surrounding area.
      Cultural History of the City and Surrounding Area
      Pre-History
                        The project area is situated within the area historically occupied by Native
                        American groups generally referred to as the Serrano and the Chemehuevi.
                        The Serrano language is part of the Serrano division of a branch of the
                        Takic family of the Uto Aztecan linguistic stock. The Chemehuevi spoke
                        languages that belong to the Numic branch of the Uto-Aztecan family.
                        The Serrano occupied an area in and around the San Bernardino
                        Mountains. Their territory extended west into the Cajon Pass, east as far as
                        Twentynine Palms, north past Victorville, and south to the Yucaipa
                        Valley. Their habitation sites required year-round water sources and
                        tended to be located out on the desert floor, at the base of the mountains,
                        and up into the foothills. Cremation of both the body and the deceased’s
                        possessions was practiced prior to Spanish occupation of Serrano land.

                                     CONSERVATION AND OPEN SPACE
                         Most Serrano lived within small villages, in domed houses constructed of
                         willow branches and tule thatching, located near water sources. A single
                         extended family possibly comprising a husband, wife (or wives), children,
                         grandparents, and perhaps a widowed aunt or uncle occupied each house.
                         Additional structures within a village might include a ceremonial house,
                         used both as a religious center and the residence of the lineage leaders,
                         granary, and a large circular subterranean sweathouse. The sweathouses
                         were typically built along streams or pools.
                         The Chemehuevi arrived in the Twentynine Palms area at the Oasis of
                         Mara probably around 1870. The Chemehuevi are Southern Paiutes whose
                         territory extended off the lower Colorado toward the west. The people
                         often settled as matrilocal groups comprised of two or three families.
                         The Morongo Band of Mission Indians of the Morongo Reservation was
                         established through presidential executive orders in 1877 and 1889. Since
                         then, most Serrano have lived either on the Morongo or San Manuel
                         reservations. The reservation includes both Cahuilla and Serrano that
                         totaled 1,097 tribal members in 2004. The reservation covers 32,718 acres.
History
                         The effects of mission influence upon the local native populations were
                         devastating. The reorganization of their culture alienated them from their
                         traditional subsistence patterns and social customs. European diseases,
                         against which the natives had no immunities, reached epidemic
                         proportions and populations were decimated.
                         Twentynine Palms was purportedly named for the palm trees located at the
                         Oasis of Mara. Due to the abundance of fresh water and foliage, the oasis
                         attracted people over a long period of time. When Colonel Henry

                         arrived in 1855, primarily the Chemehuevi occupied the Oasis. The gold
                         prospectors who followed in the 1870s used the Oasis as a campsite.
                         Because of the area’s clean dry air and elevation, Dr. James B. Luckie
                         established a retreat for people afflicted with respiratory and heart
                         problems in the 1920s. Twentynine Palms was incorporated as a City in
                         1987, and currently has a population of over 30,000 people, and
                         encompasses 58.8 square miles.

               CONSERVATION AND OPEN SPACE
                  The City serves as the gateway to Joshua Tree National Park, which was
                  designated a national monument in 1936 and a national park in 1994. The
                  park area was originally inhabited by the native Serrano, Chemehuevi, and
                  Cahuilla and later used for cattle graving and mining. The park includes
                  501 archaeological sites and 88 historic structures and contains 123,253
                  items within its museum collection.
      ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESOURCES
                  Archaeological resources are those resources that originate from people
                  associated with prehistoric times. In the Twentynine Palms area, these are
                  typically associated with the indigenous Serrano and the Chemehuevi that
                  inhabited the area.
                  Various archaeological resources have been identified within the City’s
                  boundaries. Many of them have been located around the Oasis of Mara
                  and the sand dunes in the northern portion of the City.
                  State law requires cities and counties to contact, and consult with,
                  “California Native American Tribes” before adopting or amending a
                  General Plan, or when designating land as Open-Space, for the purpose of
                  protecting Native American Cultural Places. This process originates with
                  a request from the Native American Heritage Commission (NAHC) for a
                  list of Most Likely Descendents (MLD) in a project area. The MLDs
                  (tribes) are notified to respond within 90 days to request consultation
                  between the local jurisdiction and the tribe. The legislation and California
                  Government Code provides general guidelines on meaningful and timely
                  consultation with tribes. The Native American Heritage Commission has
                  identified eight Native American tribes that may have traditional lands and
                  cultural places within the City and its SOI.
                  The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires consultation
                  with tribes during the environmental review to determine if any potentially
                  significant archaeological resources are identified on a project site. The
                  applicable tribe assists in determining the significance of the resource and
                  determining mitigation measures if such are found.

Historical Resources
                         Twentynine Palms has a diverse and lengthy history that is evidenced
                         through various existing historic resources, of which many are listed on
                         historic registers. Historic resources associated with the area’s more
                         recent history are evidenced by buildings and structures that still exist.
                         Most of these are associated with the area’s early settlement and
                         development in the late 1800’s and early 1900’s.
                         The City of Twentynine Palms has numerous historic structures that still
                         exist. The most important of these are listed below in Table CO-2. The
                         Keys Ranch (within Joshua Tree National Park) is noteworthy. It is the
                         location of Thirty (30) of the listings, which include structures, a dam and
                         water tower, windmill, ore hopper, mill, and crane. A Russian immigrant,
                         Bill Keys, who arrived in Twentynine Palms in 1910, built the Keys
                         Ranch. He had begun work at the Desert Queen Mine as a custodian and
                         ore assayer. Upon the Mine owners’ death, Keys became owner in lieu of
                         the back wages he was owed. In 1917, he acquired an 80-acre parcel
                         where he and his wife Frances established a homestead that ended up
                         including their ranch house, outhouses, corral, cement dam and lake,
                         windmill, 2 schoolhouses and a home for the teacher, cemetery, irrigation
                         system, and rock retaining walls. Among other properties listed are the
                         Cow Camp Chimney and Dam, the Barker Dam and Barker Dam Wooden
                         Watering Trough, and the original auto shop in Twentynine Palms.

      PALEONTOLOGICAL RESOURCES
                               Paleontological resources are the fossilized biotic remains of ancient
                               environments. They are valued for the information they yield about the
                               history of the earth and its past ecological settings. In general, San
                               Bernardino County has an extensive record of fossil life starting in
                               Jurassic time, 150 million years ago.
                               The Los Angeles County Natural History Museum paleontological records

                               area. Fossilized remains are expected to occur within areas containing
                               finer-grained fluvial, lacustrine, or aeolian deposits. The elevated areas
                               around the western and southern portions of the City, composed of
                               igneous and metamorphic rocks, as well as the portions of the City lying
                               below hills containing coarser fluvial deposits are not expected to contain
                               fossilized remains.

      Water Resources
                      Managing and conserving water resources is critical in sustaining cities
                      and population, and this is especially true for the desert City of
                      Twentynine Palms whose annual rainfall is less than five inches a year.
CO-36                                                     City of Twentynine Palms General Plan 2012
                                     CONSERVATION AND OPEN SPACE
                         Guaranteeing continued water supply and high standards for water quality
                         will help ensure the City’s future in attracting residents and tourism.
                         Established in 1954, the Twentynine Palms Water District (District)
                         supplies water to an approximate area of 86 square miles encompassing
                         the City of Twentynine Palms and parts of unincorporated area of San
                         Bernardino County. The District largely serves single-family residences,
                         with some multi-family residential units, commercial properties, and
                         minor light industry. There is no community sewage system and waste
                         water is disposed of through individual septic tanks and tile field disposal
                         systems. The district’s sole water source is groundwater pumped from
                         eleven (11) different wells within the City.
                         Watercourses
                         Twentynine Palms is located at the base of the Copper, Bullion, Valley,
                         Little San Bernardino and Pinto ranges which outlet various watercourses
                         onto the City. The majority of these watercourses drain to the central
                         portion of the City and then further east. The western portions of the City
                         and the unincorporated area northwest of the City drain in a northeasterly
                         direction towards Mesquite Lake, which lies just northeast of the Marine
                         Base Adobe Road entrance. Most of the watercourses do not reach a
                         larger body of water, but instead dissipate from either percolation into the
                         soil or from evaporation. Multiple dry lake beds dot the City, most
                         notably Mesquite Lake, Cones Lake and Shortz Lake. The watercourses
                         also act as flood corridors during major storm events. Although the
                         FEMA designated floodplains for these watercourses expand widely
                         across the central portion of the City, regular storm events are typically
                         accommodated within the naturally defined watercourses. Improvements
                         to control flooding are more fully discussed in the Safety Element.
                         In addition to being of biological importance, these watercourses also
                         allow the percolation of water for groundwater recharge. As stated above,
                         the quantity and quality of the area’s groundwater is vitally important,
                         since this is the City’s primary source of potable water. Some of the
                         City’s watercourses have already been converted to channels that have
                         eliminated the potential for groundwater recharge. As the City continues
                         to grow and pave over pervious surfaces, it becomes more important to
                         protect and enhance the existing watercourses ability to provide for natural
                         groundwater recharge where possible.

      CONSERVATION AND OPEN SPACE
        Groundwater Pollutants
        Groundwater pollutants in Twentynine Palms can generally be categorized
        as either urban runoff or septic tank wastewater migration.
        The Federal Water Pollution Control Act prohibits the discharge of any
        pollutant to navigable waters from a point source unless the discharge is
        authorized by a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
        (NPDES) permit. NPDES permit requirements were established in 1987
        with the passage of the Water Quality Act. The NPDES permit program
        controls water pollution by regulating point sources that discharge
        pollutants into so-called waters of the United States.
        In Twentynine Palms, NPDES permits are issued by the California
        Regional Water Quality Control Board, Colorado River Basin (RWQCB)
        as part of its Storm Water Program. The NPDES program coordinates the
        actions of all incorporated cities and the unincorporated portions of San
        Bernardino County within this region to regulate and control storm water
        and urban runoff within the Colorado River basin.
        In support of the permit and the obligation to keep waterways clean by
        reducing or eliminating contaminants from storm water and dry-weather
        runoff, the City complies with the California Regional Water Quality
        Control Board’s Monitoring and Reporting Program. The City requires
        the use of “best management practices” in many residential, commercial
        and development-related activities to reduce runoff.
        The quality of water in the District and the City is typically good, besides
        a few areas with fluoride and total dissolved solids levels, per the
        Twentynine Palms Water District Urban Water Management Plan
        (UWMP). Another contaminant to groundwater quality is effluent from
        septic tanks which is used throughout the City due to a lack of a
        centralized sewer system. The effluent is discharged into permeable leach
        fields or shallow soil where they are treated by biological organisms or
        degrade by natural processes. Concentrations of ammonia, chloride,
        phosphorus, sodium, potassium, boron, volatile organic compounds, and
        bacteria are found in septic effluent and can have a significant impact on
        groundwater quality if the septic system fails.

                         Projected Water Supply
                         The City’s only source of water is from the underlying groundwater
                         basins. Most of the District service area is directly underlain by
                         Quaternary alluvium which is deposits of sand, gravel, silt and clay. The
                         bedrock beneath the alluvium is primarily composed of crystalline igneous
                         and metamorphic rock types which do not transmit or store significant
                         quantities of groundwater except in major fault areas. There are several
                         fault areas located in the District such as the Pinto Mountain, Mesquite,
                         Surprise Spring and Calico Faults. These faults significantly restrict the
                         migration of groundwater from moving north, east and south. The City of
                         Twentynine Palms is located in two (2) major groundwater basins; the
                         Twentynine Palms Valley Groundwater Basin and Joshua Tree
                         Groundwater Basin. These basins are further divided into subbasins,
                         including the Indian Cove subbasin, Eastern subbasin, Fortynine Palms
                         subbasin and Mesquite Lake subbasin
                         Water supply reliability for the District and the City of Twentynine Palms
                         depends on the safe yield, which is the maximum quantity of water that
                         can be continuously withdrawn from a ground water basin without adverse
                         effect. Overdraft occurs when pumping of ground water exceeds the
                         amount of water replenishing the basin. Significant groundwater overdraft
                         can result in adverse impacts such as ground surface subsidence, degraded
                         water quality, falling water table and increased pumping costs. The
                         Department of Water Resources has identified Twentynine Palms Valley
                         Basin of having an overdraft on its groundwater. The lack of recharge,
                         which is the natural process of replenishing the groundwater supply by
                         rainfall, coupled with an increase in water demand due to population
                         growth can have a significant impact on water supply reliability.
                         The recharge of a basin occurs when rainfall is collected in areas that
                         percolate through the soil into an aquifer. The primary mechanism of
                         groundwater recharge is surface runoff from mountains and infiltration
                         into alluvial fans and fractured bedrock. This process of recharging
                         aquifers is more efficient than direct rainfall, as any precipitation onto the
                         basins will be absorbed by the soil and rapidly evaporates. The
                         groundwater basins within the City are recharged by stormwater flows
                         across the alluvial fans that extend out to the desert floor and collecting in
                         dry lakebeds east of the City where it percolates into the groundwater
                         table. However, the soils in this area have naturally elevated levels of

        fluoride which is dissolved in the groundwater during percolation. Without
        any treatment, the elevated fluoride levels render the groundwater
        unusable for drinking purposes. In addition, part of the groundwater is
        returned back to the subbasin through infiltration or percolation of
        irrigation water and septic tank discharges.
        As of 2009, there are eleven (11) wells, a fluoride removal water treatment
        plant and nine (9) reservoirs within the District totaling 17.32 million
        gallons capacity. At this time, there are no opportunities for water
        recycling, and no programs that deal with recycled water due to the lack of
        sewer and wastewater treatment plant facilities. The District does not
        receive water from a wholesaler, nor does it supply its water to retail
        buyers. It is too costly for the District to import water from nearby
        facilities. The Metropolitan Water District facilities are located forty-five
        (45) miles southwest of the District, and Mojave Water Agency facilities
        twenty-three (23) miles west of the District.
        Water shortage can occur from natural occurrences such as drought,
        earthquakes, fires, system failures and water quality contamination.
        Studies in the 2005 Urban Water Management Plan Update (UWMPU)
        have shown that the District’s water supply is reliable in the case of a
        multi-year drought, although there is a possibility that production capacity
        may be limited by some of the other previously mentioned natural
        occurrences. As of 2009, the District does not have a Water Shortage
        Contingency Plan that includes actions and mitigations to deal with
        potential future water shortage scenarios. In lieu of adopting a contingency
        plan, the UWMPU has recommended that the District consider
        implementing its own version of a modified contingency plan, outlining
        various strategies to deal with emergency water shortage situations. When
        faced with a water shortage, the URWPU plan’s goal is to reduce water
        demand by 50% through three stages:
                Stage 1. 5-15% voluntary reduction in production capacity.
                Stage 2. 15-30% mandatory reduction in production capacity.
                Stage 3. 30-50% mandatory reduction in production capacity.
        The first stage includes voluntary reduction measures such as public
        awareness campaigns and requests from the Twentynine Palms Water
        District to limit water usage. The second and third stage includes

                         mandatory reductions measures such as water allowance, water curfews,
                         no spray irrigation and fines for those who exceed their water allowance.
                         The District currently serves 7,030 metered connections, of which
                         approximately 93% are residential connections. Residential development
                         makes up the largest land use and water demand sector in the District with
                         79% or 2,305 AFY being used. Commercial connections account for
                         approximately 5%, where landscape irrigation and non-potable
                         connections, and fire protection connections make up the remaining
                         connection.
                         The most recent estimated population for the District was in 2004 at
                         15,700 with a population project of 25,570 in 2030. This does not include
                         the population associated with the U.S Marine Corps Air Ground Combat
                         Center (Marine Base). The Marine Base provides its own water supply to
                         their facility and is not associated with any of the numbers and projects in
                         the 2005 UWMPU. The District compared the supply and demand of
                         water resources for future use and has determined that there is sufficient
                         water supply to meet water demands through 2030. The District also
                         determined there is sufficient water capacity to continue providing service
                         until between the years 2045 and 2050.
                         Landscaping and Irrigation
                         The City currently does not have an adopted landscape ordinance and is
                         using the “Let’s Go Native…with our Landscaping” guidelines developed
                         by Twentynine Palms Groundwater Guardian Team. The guidelines
                         recommend the planting of climate appropriate drought tolerant
                         landscaping to minimize water usage for landscaping throughout the City.
                         Recycled Water
                         Recycled water (sometimes called reclaimed water) is wastewater that is
                         treated to remove solids and certain impurities so that it can be reused. In
                         most cases the water is sent back through the water system via separate
                         pipes for use as non-potable water. Approximately seventy percent (70%)
                         of the recycled water is used for landscape irrigation.

      CONSERVATION AND OPEN SPACE
        Recycled water is not currently available from Twentynine Palms Water
        District. Since wastewater within the City is handled through individual
        sewer package treatment plants, the ability to develop a system to treat
        sewer water and redistribute it throughout the City is problematic and
        likely infeasible.

      AIR QUALITY AND CLIMATE CHANGE
                   The City of Twentynine Palms is located within the Mojave Desert Air
                   Basin (MDAB). The MDAB includes the desert regions of San
                   Bernardino, Riverside, Los Angeles and Kern counties. The MDAB is an
                   assemblage of mountain ranges interspersed with long broad valleys that
                   often contain dry lakes. Many of the lower mountains which dot the vast
                   terrain rise from 1,000 to 4,000 feet above the valley floor. Prevailing
                   winds in the MDAB are out of the west and southwest. These prevailing
                   winds are due to the proximity of the MDAB to coastal and central regions
                   and the blocking nature of the Sierra Nevada mountains to the north; air
                   masses pushed onshore in southern California by differential heating are

                         channeled through the MDAB. The MDAB is separated from the southern
                         California coastal and central California valley regions by mountains,
                         whose passes form the main channels for these air masses. The Mojave
                         Desert is bordered in the southwest by the San Bernardino Mountains,
                         separated from the San Gabriel Mountains by the Cajon Pass and a lesser
                         channel between the San Bernardino Mountains and the Little San
                         Bernardino Mountains into the Morongo Valley where the City of
                         Twentynine Palms lies.
Pollutants
                         Air pollutants are generally classified in two categories, primary and
                         secondary. Primary pollutants are those that are a direct consequence of
                         energy production and utilization, while secondary pollutants are those
                         that undergo chemical changes after emission. Primary pollutants
                         typically affect only local areas and do not undergo chemical modification
                         or further dispersion. Secondary pollutants do disperse and undergo
                         chemical changes under conditions of high ambient temperatures and high
                         rates of solar insulation. Primary sources and their pollutants are a direct
                         consequence of the combustion of petroleum and other fuels resulting in
                         the production of oxides of carbon, sulfur, nitrogen and a number of
                         reactive hydrocarbons and suspended particulates. Principal secondary
                         pollutants are termed oxidants and include ozone (O3), peroxynitrates,
                         nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and chemical aerosols.
                         Of most concern in the Twentynine Palms area is PM10. PM10 comes
                         mostly from locally generated fugitive dust. A naturally occurring
                         contributor to PM10 is what is commonly referred to as blowsand, sand
                         deposits naturally eroded by wind and deposited elsewhere on the ground
                         or dispersed in the air. Particularly during the spring months, persistent
                         and strong winds carry sand in a southeasterly direction through the center
                         of the Valley. Man-made activities, such as site disturbance and grading
                         activities, can worsen PM10 by lifting particles into the air, allowing them
                         to be suspended.        PM10 is associated with adverse health effects,
                         including reduced lung function.
Standards for Pollutants
                         Under the Federal Clean Air Act (FCAA), the U.S. EPA has established
                         National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for six major
                         pollutants; ozone (O3), respirable particulate matter (PM10), fine
                         particulate matter (PM2.5), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide
                         (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), as well as lead. These six air pollutants are

      CONSERVATION AND OPEN SPACE
        often referred to as the criteria pollutants. The NAAQS are two tiered:
        primary, to protect public health, and secondary, to prevent degradation to
        the environment (i.e., impairment of visibility, damage to vegetation and
        property).
        Under the California Clean Air Act (CCAA), the California Air Resources
        Board has established California Ambient Air Quality Standards
        (CAAQS) to protect the health and welfare of Californians. State
        standards have been established for the six criteria pollutants as well as
        four additional pollutants; visibility reducing particles, sulfates, hydrogen
        sulfide, and vinyl chloride. Table CO-3 presents the state and national
        ambient air quality standards.

      CONSERVATION AND OPEN SPACE
        The primary agencies responsible for regulations to improve air quality in
        this region are the MDAQMD and the California Air Resources Board
        (CARB). The Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG)
        is an important partner to the MDAQMD, as it is the designated
        metropolitan planning authority for the area and produces estimates of
        anticipated future growth and vehicular travel in the District which are
        used for air quality planning. The MDAQMD sets and enforces
        regulations for non-vehicular sources of air pollution in the District and
        works with SCAG to develop and implement Transportation Control
        Measures (TCM). TCM measures are intended to reduce and improve
        vehicular travel and associated pollutant emissions.
        CARB was established in 1967 by the California Legislature to attain and
        maintain healthy air quality, conduct research into the causes and solutions
        to air pollution, and systematically attack the serious problem caused by
        motor vehicles, which are the major causes of air pollution in the State.
        CARB sets and enforces emission standards for motor vehicles, fuels, and
        consumer products. It sets the health based California Ambient Air
        Quality Standards (CAAQS) and monitors air quality levels throughout
        the state. The board identifies and sets control measures for toxic air
        contaminants. The board also performs air quality related research,
        provides compliance assistance for businesses, and produces education
        and outreach programs and materials. CARB provides assistance for local
        air quality Districts, such as MDAQMD.
        The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) is the primary
        federal agency for regulating air quality. The EPA implements the
        provisions of the Federal Clean Air Act (FCAA). This Act establishes
        national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) that are applicable
        nationwide. The EPA designates areas with pollutant concentrations that
        do not meet the NAAQS as non-attainment areas for each criteria
        pollutant.     States are required by the FCAA to prepare State
        Implementation Plans (SIP) for designated non-attainment areas. The SIP
        is required to demonstrate how the areas will attain the NAAQS by the
        prescribed deadlines and what measures will be required to attain the
        standards. The EPA also oversees implementation of the prescribed
        measures. Areas that achieve the NAAQS after a non-attainment
        designation are redesignated as maintenance areas and must have
        approved Maintenance Plans to ensure continued attainment of the
        NAAQS.

                         The MDAQMD has established significance thresholds to assess the

                         daily value and an annual value, so that multi-phased project (such as
                         project with a construction phase and a separate operational phase) with
                         phases shorter than one year can be compared to the daily value. A project
                         with daily emission rates below these thresholds are considered to have a
                         less than significant effect on regional air quality throughout the District.

      Sensitive Receptors
                        The potential hazards from pollutants are of concern to the entire
                        population. There are certain sectors of the population that are deemed to
                        be sensitive receptors due to their condition. The region’s high median
                        age is of particular concern since elderly are more at risk to hazards from
                        pollutants due to degenerated respiratory and cardio-pulmonary
                        conditions. Certain uses, such as hospitals and nursing homes are
                        classified as sensitive receptors for similar reasons and the concentration
                        of the population. Schools and parks are also sensitive receptors due to
                        the concentration of children that may be exposed to pollutants at a young
                        age that over time may cause health problems.
      GREENHOUSE GASES AND CLIMATE CHANGE
                        One of the City’s emerging concerns is related to greenhouse gas
                        emissions that the State has declared as contributing to global warming
                        and climate change. Global warming and climate change are largely due
                        to an increase in the level of greenhouse gases emitted throughout the
                        world. These two terms, global warming and climate change, have subtly
                        different meanings. Global warming relates directly to the greenhouse
                        effect, which is an increase in temperature as a result of carbon dioxide
                        and other greenhouse gases trapping the sun’s warmth within our
                        atmosphere. This process then contributes to rising sea levels, as water
                        stored in the form of icecaps, icebergs and glaciers begins to melt at
                        accelerated rates. Climate change is a broader effect of global warming,
                        and can include changes in rainfall patterns and increased intensity and
                        frequency of extreme weather events. Some expected changes in climate
                        due to global warming include water scarcity in some regions and
                        increased precipitation in others, changes in mountain snowpack, adverse
                        health effects from warmer temperatures and effects on the natural
                        ecosystem, agriculture and other food production.
                        Greenhouse gases are made up of a variety of different gases, including
                        carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. Carbon dioxide is the gas of
                        most concern, as it represents approximately eighty-five percent (85%) of
                        the U.S.’s greenhouse gas emissions. Concentrations of carbon dioxide,
                        methane and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere have increased significantly
                        as a result of human activities over the past few centuries, and now exceed
                        amounts emitted during pre-industrial times. The global increase in carbon

                         dioxide concentrations is due primarily to fossil fuel combustion and land-
                         use changes, while those of methane and nitrous oxide are primarily due to
                         agriculture, including livestock. In urban areas, methane emissions from
                         landfills are another source of greenhouse gas.
                         The State of California has stated that “global warming poses a serious
                         threat to the economic well-being, public health, natural resources, and the
                         environment of California.” The state is in the process of defining the
                         first-ever statewide cap on global warming pollution, requiring that the
                         State’s global warming emissions be reduced to 1990 levels by 2020 as
                         passed by what is commonly referred to as Assembly Bill 32 (AB32). The
                         California Air Resources Board is responsible for determining the level of
                         greenhouse gases emitted in 1990 and developing mitigation measures to
                         reach that level. The state law requires the adoption of actions which will
                         culminate in an eighty percent (80%) reduction of greenhouse gases from
                         1990 levels by the year 2050.
                         The California Air Resources Board (CARB) is the lead agency for
                         implementing AB32. In October 2008, CARB published a Proposed
                         Scoping Plan, in coordination with the Climate Action Team (CAT), to
                         establish a comprehensive set of actions designed to reduce overall
                         greenhouse gas emissions in California. The measures in the Scoping plan
                         approved by the Board will be developed over the next two years and be in
                         place by 2020.
                         Significant progress can be made toward the 2020 goal includes existing
                         technologies, and improving the efficiency of energy use. Other solutions
                         involve improving our state’s infrastructure, transitioning to cleaner and
                         more secure sources of energy, and adopting 21st century land use
                         planning and development practices.
                         In addition to the Proposed Scoping Plan, CARB released the Preliminary
                         Draft Staff Proposal (Staff Proposal) on October 24, 2008 with the
                         objective of developing interim significant thresholds for commercial and
                         residential projects. CARB has already proposed a threshold of 7,000
                         annual MT for industrial operational sources. However, the Staff Proposal
                         has not yet developed thresholds applicable for residential and commercial
                         sources.
                         Under CARB’s Staff Proposal, recommended approaches for setting
                         interim significance thresholds for GHG under the CEQA are underway.

      CONSERVATION AND OPEN SPACE
        CARB staff proposes to define certain performance standards (e.g., for
        energy efficiency) by referencing or compiling lists from existing local,
        state or national standards. For some sub-sources of GHG emissions (e.g.,
        construction, transportation, waste), CARB staff has not identified
        reference standards.
        The California Air Resources Board (CARB) has tasked each
        Metropolitan Planning Organization, such as the Southern California
        Association of Governments (SCAG), to develop Sustainable Community
        Strategies (SCS) through integrating transportation and land use planning
        to attain the mandated GHG reduction levels. These are further being
        implemented on the local level in the form of Climate Action Plans, such
        as the one being developed by the San Bernardino Association of
        Governments (SANBAG), which the City of Twentynine Palms is
        participating in.
        The primary avenues to address climate change in urban areas are by
        lowering transportation emissions and encouraging energy conservation
        and efficiency. In addition, cities should address the urban heat island
        effect resulting from land use patterns, and encourage recycling, which
        reduces the amount of trash sent to landfills, lowering methane emissions.
        Recycling also reduces the amount of energy needed to produce products.
        According to the U.S. Department of Energy’s Smart Communities
        Network, buildings account for thirty-five percent (35%) of greenhouse
        gas emissions across the country. The most emission-producing activities
        in buildings are related to heating and cooling and electricity consumption.
        As such, developing strategies to create and retrofit buildings to be more
        energy efficient is one of the primary ways to combat global warming.
        Cities can begin by addressing their own public buildings to serve as
        examples of green building practices. Local governments can also save
        money and energy by purchasing energy-efficient office equipment. In
        Twentynine Palms, the City government will act as a leader and example
        in sustainability and reduction in greenhouse gas production. The City will
        pursue business in the most greenhouse gas sensitive way possible,
        promoting resource efficiency and conservation in buildings and office
        equipment.
        The Department of Energy also estimates that approximately one-third of
        the greenhouse gases emitted in the United States derive from
        transportation sources, including trucks and personal automobiles.

                         Twentynine Palms currently has few options for alternative forms of
                         transportation aside from the four bus lines that are operated by Morongo
                         Basin Transit Authority through the City. In addition, pedestrian and
                         bicycle paths are currently limited and do not form an expansive system
                         that support or encourage walking or biking.
Measuring GHG
                         Global GHG emissions are measured in million metric tons of carbon
                         dioxide equivalent (MMT CO2EQ) units. A metric ton is approximately
                         2,205 lbs. Some GHGs emitted into the atmosphere are naturally
                         occurring, while others are caused solely by human activities. The
                         principal GHGs that enter the atmosphere because of human activities are:
                                 Carbon dioxide (CO2) enters the atmosphere through the burning
                                  of fossil fuels (oil, natural gas, and coal), agriculture, irrigation,
                                  and deforestation, as well as the manufacturing of cement.
                                 Methane (CH4) is emitted through the production and
                                  transportation of coal, natural gas, and oil, as well as from
                                  livestock.     Other agricultural activities influence methane
                                  emissions as well as the decay of waste in landfills.
                                 Nitrous oxide (N2O) is released most often during the burning of
                                  fuel at high temperatures. This greenhouse gas is caused mostly by
                                  motor vehicles, which also include non-road vehicles, such as
                                  those used for agriculture.
                                 Fluorinated Gases are emitted primarily from industrial sources,
                                  which often include hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and
                                  sulfur hexafluoride. Though they are often released in smaller
                                  quantities, they are referred to as High Global Warming Potential
                                  Gases because of their ability to cause global warming.
                                  Fluorinated gases are often used as substitutes for ozone depleting
                                  substances.
                         These gases have different potentials for trapping heat in the atmosphere,
                         called global warming potential (GWP). For example, one pound of
                         methane has 21 times more heat capturing potential than one pound of
                         carbon dioxide. When dealing with an array of emissions, the gases are

        Consumption of fossil fuels in the transportation sector was the single
        largest source of California’s GHG emissions in 2004, accounting for 40.7
        percent of total GHG emissions in the state (California Energy
        Commission 2006a). This category was followed by the electric power
        sector (including both in-state and out-of-state sources) (22.2 percent) and
        the industrial sector (20.5 percent) (California Energy Commission
        2006a). A byproduct of fossil fuel combustion is CO2. Processes that
        absorb and accumulate CO2, often called CO2 “sinks,” include absorption
        by vegetation and dissolution into the ocean. Methane, a highly potent
        GHG, results from off-gassing associated with agricultural practices and
        municipal solid waste landfills.
        Temporary, or short term, impacts will result from construction activities.
        The primary source of GHG emissions generated by construction activities
        is from use of diesel-powered construction equipment and other
        combustion sources (i.e., generators, worker vehicles, materials delivery,
        etc.). The GHG air pollutants emitted by construction equipment would
        primarily be carbon dioxide. The General Plan update does not involve
        specific construction activity. However, construction activities that
        implement land use policies associated with the General Plan over the

                         construction details are developed. Construction emissions are generally
                         considered to be a short-term impact and would be minor in comparison to
                         the long-term operation of the project.
                         Long-term impacts are associated with the buildout condition for the
                         General Plan. The primary source of GHG emissions generated by the
                         proposed project will be from motor vehicles. Other emissions from the
                         project will be generated from the combustion of natural gas for space and
                         water heating, as well as off-site GHG emissions from the generation of
                         electricity consumed by the project.
                         To calculate the GHG emissions produced from the project, the proposed
                         land uses and daily vehicle trips were utilized. The General Plan is
                         projected to be built out by year 2050 or beyond.                 However,
                         URBEMIS2007 provides emission factor projections for year 2040 and
                         before, but not after 2040. As a result, year 2040 emission factors is
                         utilized in the analysis for buildout projections. The development capacity
                         of the General Plan consists of 28,268 dwelling units, and 38,917,800
                         square feet of commercial and industrial space. The development capacity
                         for the City’s Sphere of Influence (SOI) area is estimated at approximately
                         2,624 dwelling units, and 875,295 square feet of commercial and
                         industrial space. The results of the analysis are presented below in Table
                         CO-6.
                         The most notable greenhouse gases (GHG) are CH4 and CO2. N2O is
                         another greenhouse gas. However, emission rates for most sources of
                         N2O are not available and they appear to be minuscule (account for only
                         0.1% or less of the greenhouse gas emissions for this type of project). As
                         a result, N2O emissions are not included in this report.

                         Table CO-6 presents the annual GHG emissions (as expressed in CO2
                         equivalents) for the Baseline (Existing 2010), Previous General Plan and
                         Proposed General Plan. The GHG emissions are projected to be 145,732
                         metric tons (MT) for the Baseline, 1,226,096 MT for the Existing GP, and
                         1,265,409 MT for the proposed GP Update. The data reveals that the
                         proposed General Plan results in net emission increases 1,080,363 MT
                         when compared to the Baseline, and 39,313 MT when compared to the
                         Previous General Plan. Table CO-6 shows that over 88% of the GHG
                         emissions associated with the Proposed General Plan are projected to be
                         from motor vehicles. Natural gas consumption accounts for about 11% of
                         the GHG emissions, and other area source emissions are negligible. The
                         Proposed General Plan net increases in emissions are above the 100,000
                         MT threshold that CARB has set for transportation projects. Because the
                         Proposed General Plan is an areawide project, similar to most
                         transportation projects, the 100,000 MT CARB threshold is the most
                         relevant.
                         The analysis presents GHG emissions for the buildout year which is
                         projected to be 2050, or beyond. The emissions projected in Table CO-6
                         are likely a conservative estimate as newer and more fuel-efficient models
                         of automobiles are released in the coming years. Neither the U.S. EPA
                         nor CARB currently regulate CO2 emissions, and therefore, the likely
                         potential reductions are not included in the forecasts.
                         Table CO-7 compares the GHG emissions from the project to total
                         emissions in California, the United States, and globally. This comparison
                         shows that the project represents a very small fraction of total GHG
                         emissions.

      CONSERVATION AND OPEN SPACE
        The emissions generated by this project will contribute a miniscule
        amount to the overall climate change issue. By way of comparison, the
        global data from the United Nations indicates that the project would
        contribute less than 0.0038% to the GHG burden for the planet. Even
        when compared to California’s GHG emissions, the contribution from any
        of the equivalency programs would be miniscule, less than 0.3% of 2004
        California emissions. Therefore, for the purposes of this analysis, global
        climate change impacts will be considered at the cumulative level to
        consider whether any potential increase in GHG emissions that may be
        associated with the project over the current physical baseline, should be
        considered significant on a cumulative basis.
        According to the comment letter issued by the California Attorney
        General, Jerry Brown, on the Coyote Valley Specific Plan, cumulative
        impacts should be considered. The letter states, “Global warming is a
        quintessentially cumulative impact, caused by the added effects of
        countless individual projects at the local, regional, state, national, and
        international level.” If this project is considered in more of the regional
        context, it must be asked whether the project will in fact, generate new
        emissions or whether it actually results in a more efficient regional land
        use plan.
        No regulations have yet been promulgated as a result of AB 32. So far,
        CARB’s indication is that the first wave of regulations will address
        emissions from major industrial and agricultural sources. CARB is also
        very likely to promote requirements for motor vehicles, via new emission
        controls and increased fuel economy that would significantly lower GHG
        emissions in future years. CARB is not considering restrictions on growth
        or new development. Since this project would, of course, comply with
        any regulations promulgated by the CARB and since CARB is not putting
        any restrictions on growth, this project cannot be seen as interfering with
        “California’s ability to achieve its GHG reduction requirements.”

MINERAL RESOURCES
                         The history of Twentynine Palms has long been intertwined with mining
                         operations, in particular gold mining activities during the late 1800s and
                         early 1900s. Today, although not as colorful or legendary, Twentynine
                         Palms provides a source for California’s most valuable mineral

      CONSERVATION AND OPEN SPACE
        commodity – construction aggregate, which is commonly used in the
        manufacturing of concrete. According to the California Geological
        Survey (CGS), the demand for aggregate is increasing as the State’s
        population grows, and as infrastructure is maintained and expanded. At
        the same time, permitted aggregate resources are decreasing. In fact, the
        CGS estimates that as of 2006, several areas in central and northern
        California have less than ten years of permitted aggregate resources
        remaining. Since most aggregate is hauled by truck, it is important
        economically and environmentally to mine these resources relatively close
        to the growing communities where they are used.
        The California Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975 (SMARA)
        requires that all cities consider mapped mineral resources designations (as
        defined by the State Mining and Geology Board) in long-term planning
        efforts. SMARA was enacted to promote the conservation and sensitive
        use of significant mineral deposits. The law ensures that significant
        aggregate resources are recognized and considered before land use
        decisions are made that may compromise the long-term availability of
        these resources.
        The State of California Department of Conservation, Division of Mines
        and Geology publishes reports and maps detailing the potential mineral
        deposits located in a given area. Areas are generally classified into the
        following categories for potential for mineral resources:
               MRZ-1: Areas where adequate information indicates that no
                significant mineral deposits are present, or where it is judged that
                little likelihood exists for their presence.
               MRZ-2: Areas where adequate information indicates that
                significant mineral deposits are present, or where it is judged that a
                high likelihood for their presence exists.
               MRZ-3: Areas containing mineral deposits, the significance of
                which cannot be evaluated from available data.
        Neither the State nor San Bernardino County has officially identified
        Twentynine Palms as a mineral resource area of significance. Not all
        areas of the State have been mapped and classified, however. For
        instance, prior to 1991, the State and Mining Geology Board designated
        fifteen (15) areas within California as having regionally significant

                         minerals resources. No additional areas have been designated since that
                         time, largely due to lack of funding.
                         There are no other known significant minerals within the City or Sphere of
                         Influence.
                         The following goals and policy implementation measures address the

SOIL RESOURCES
                         The City of Twentynine Palms is located within an arid region of alluvial
                         fans, desert plains, dry lakebeds and scattered mountain ranges. The City’s
                         geology is mostly made up of water-laid sand, silt and gravel. The
                         materials in these soils are often used in construction practices and the
                         manufacturing of concrete, as discussed in the previous Mineral Resources
                         section. In some areas of the City, these soils are susceptible to geologic
                         hazards such as slope instability and collapsible soils. These hazards can

                   geologic hazards are also discussed in the Safety Element of this General
                   Plan.
                   The City receives great quantities of runoff from the surrounding
                   mountain ranges during storms and heavy rains, resulting in flooding,
                   erosion and property damage. These hazards are often responsible for
                   flooding out roads with water and debris, making navigating the City
                   during these periods difficult. Such flooding hazards are also discussed in
                   the Safety Element of this General Plan.
      AGRICULTURAL RESOURCES
                   Agricultural production is not significant in the region generally, nor in the
                   City of Twentynine Palms. However, small agricultural operations are
                   allowed in the Rural Living land use district, which comprises
                   approximately 40% of the City’s total land area. The Land Use Element
                   of this General Plan deals with this issue.
      NIGHTTIME VIEWS
                   Preservation of the nighttime views, to perpetuate the view of the stars in
                   the evening, is identified as a valuable community resource. Light
                   pollution, trespass and unnecessary glare will be avoided and shielding
                   methods will be required. Outdoor lighting is to be designed and installed
                   in a manner that confines the direct light rays to the property upon which
                   the lighting is installed.

ENERGY RESOURCES
                         The Mojave Desert is characterized by hot summer temperatures,
                         averaging over 100 degrees Fahrenheit [°F], and low annual precipitation,
                         approximately five (5) inches. The difference between daily high and low
                         temperatures can fluctuate up to forty (40) degrees and the average daily
                         temperature can vary twenty-nine (29) degrees. Seasonal temperatures
                         range from twenty (20) to sixty (60) degrees Fahrenheit in the winter and
                         from eighty (80) to 110 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer.              These
                         extremes in temperature contribute to substantially different utility use
                         than are typical for most Southern California households.
Electricity
                         Based on the California Department of Energy, for its climate zone, the
                         average household in Twentynine Palms uses 7,068 kilowatt-hours of
                         electricity per year. Electricity services are provided by Southern
                         California Edison (SCE). In order to reduce energy consumption,
                         Southern California Edison offers residential users various programs as
                         incentives to reduce electrical consumption. SCE also provides both
                         incentives and technical assistance to businesses and industry to help them
                         reduce their consumption as well.

      Natural Gas
                       Natural gas service is available to residential, commercial and industrial
                       users in the City from Southern California Gas Company. Natural Gas is
                       mainly utilized for water heaters and heating of homes. Commercial and
                       industrial uses utilize it for a broad range of equipment. Similar to
                       Southern California Edison, the Southern California Gas Company also
                       offers equipment and a variety of programs to reduce consumption.
      Alternative Energy
                       The Twentynine Palms climate provides great potential for alternative
                       energy options. While the City does not provide either electricity or
                       natural gas to its residents, the City has building codes and zoning codes
                       that encourage the use of such alternative sources by individual property
                       owners as well as conservation of energy. Implementation policies
                       dealing with this are provided in the section of this Element dealing with
                       sustainable practices.
      SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES
                       While the conservation of resources can be accomplished on an individual
                       resource basis, it can be more productive to consider measures to conserve
                       a wide range of resources.           Since developing communities like
                       Twentynine Palms will consume a large amount of resources as it grows,
                       conservation of resources and providing for the reduction and
                       conservation of energy it is important to limit, as much as possible, the
                       impact of this growth.
      Solid Waste Generation and Recycling
                       California State Law requires local agencies to adopt policies and
                       programs to reduce, recycle and reuse solid waste generated in that city.
                       Specifically, the Law requires jurisdictions to divert fifty percent (50%) of
                       solid waste from landfill disposal through recycling or source reduction
                       programs, as well as to oversee the disposal of household hazardous
                       wastes. The State continues to refine program goals and work toward
                       preserving land resources for productive uses, not landfills.

                                     CONSERVATION AND OPEN SPACE
                         Waste is measured by weight, and construction and demolition materials
                         represent a significant part of the waste stream. Recycling or reusing waste
                         from construction and demolition job sites can often reduce project costs
                         and create jobs, as well as benefit the environment and help meet waste
                         diversion goals. Reuse and recycling of construction and demolition
                         materials is one component of a larger, holistic practice of sustainable or
                         “green” building construction. The efficient use of resources is a
                         fundamental tenet of sustainable construction practices. This means
                         reducing, reusing and recycling most, if not all, materials that remain after
                         a construction or renovation project.
                         Common construction and demolition materials include lumber, drywall,
                         metals, masonry (brick, concrete, etc.), carpet, plastic, pipe, rocks, dirt,
                         paper, cardboard and green waste related to land development. Of these,
                         metals are the most commonly recycled material, while lumber makes up
                         the majority of construction debris deposited in landfills.
Sustainable Building Practices
                         Buildings in the United States consume land, energy, water and natural
                         materials resources. The activities associated with constructing and
                         operating buildings are a major source of pollution, contributing to
                         decreased air quality in urban areas and also heightened carbon dioxide
                         levels, a major contributor to climate change. According to the U.S.
                         Department of Energy’s Smart Communities Network, buildings produce
                         thirty-five percent (35%) of the country’s carbon dioxide emissions.
                         Sustainable (green) building practices use natural resources in more
                         efficient and ecological manners than traditional buildings. Sustainable
                         building practices include designing, constructing and operating buildings
                         and landscapes to incorporate energy efficiency, water conservation, waste
                         minimization, pollution prevention, resource-efficient materials and high
                         standards of indoor environmental quality in all phases of a building's life.
                         Green approaches to building design involve an integrated,
                         interdisciplinary approach to design and construction, together with
                         investments in energy- and resource-efficient materials and technology.

PURPOSE
                         The City of Twentynine Palms is a unique community with numerous
                         natural resources. The City municipal limits encompass 58.8 square
                         miles, which includes 3.9 square miles of the Marine Corps Air Ground
                         Combat Center. A total of 30.5 square miles of unincorporated area have
                         been designated as part of the City’s “Sphere of Influence” for possible
                         future expansion of the City limits. Together, the 89.3 square mile area
                         comprises the General Plan’s planning area, as shown in Exhibit LU-1.
                         Given the City’s location in relationship to the region, Twentynine Palms
                         enjoys exceptional weather, good air quality, dark skies, vast open lands
                         and stunning scenic views/vistas. Major national landmarks and facilities
                         such as the Joshua Tree National Park and Marine Corps Air Ground
                         Combat Center (Marine Base) are located within the City, which adds to
                         the exceptional economic opportunities of Twentynine Palms. The overall
                         vision of the General Plan is to protect and preserve existing natural
                         resources for future generations while enhancing and promoting the
                         economic development of Twentynine Palms.
                         This Land Use Element of the General Plan describes the general location,
                         type and intensity of development. It also identifies the distribution of
                         land uses throughout the City. Land uses such as residential, commercial,
                         industrial and public are planned to meet the existing and long-term needs
                         of residents, support the City’s economic/fiscal goals and provide for the
                         orderly development of the City.
                         This Element contains a map and text depicting the City's long-range plans
                         for development within its incorporated boundaries and sphere of
                         influence (SOI) areas. The Land Use Map identifies the preferred
                         distribution and extent of residential, commercial, industrial and public
                         uses. The text contains the City's land use goals and policies, on which
                         the map designations are based. The purpose of this document and
                         accompanying Land Use Map is to comply with State law requirements
                         and to establish land use policies for the City of Twentynine Palms that
                         can adequately guide future development.

LAND USE
BACKGROUND
RELATIONSHIP TO STATE LAW
                         State planning law requires that the Land Use Element designate "the
                         proposed general distribution and general location and extent of the uses
                         of the land" within the City. Specifically, Section 65302(a) of the
                         California Government Code requires that the Land Use Element address
                         the following issues, to the extent each is relevant to the City:
                                 Distribution of housing, business and industry.
                                 Distribution of open space, including agricultural land.
                                 Distribution of mineral resources and provisions for their
                                  continued availability.
                                 Distribution of recreation facilities and opportunities.
                                 Location of educational facilities.
                                 Location of public buildings and grounds.
                                 Location of future solid and liquid waste facilities.
                                 Identification of areas subject to flooding.
                                 Other categories of public and private uses of land.
                         To provide guidance in implementing its goals, the Land Use Element also
                         defines the relationship between General Plan land use policy and the
                         Twentynine Palms Development Code, which provides the primary means
                         for implementing this Element’s land use goals. The Land Use Element,
                         in combination with the updated Land Use Map and the other General
                         Plan Elements, will work toward the City’s goal of achieving a high
                         quality of life through a balanced mix of attractive residential
                         neighborhoods, economically prosperous commercial and industrial
                         districts, well-maintained parks and superior public services.
City of Twentynine Palms General Plan 2012                                                         LU-5

             LAND USE
     RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
                  The Land Use Element provides the broad framework for all topics
                  addressed in the General Plan, since the manner in which land is used in
                  Twentynine Palms affects the City’s circulation system, economic
                  development activities, parks and open space resources, and public safety.
                  For example, different land uses generate various trip demands, which
                  influence the capacity and service levels of Twentynine Palms street
                  system. The Circulation Element responds by planning for transportation
                  services and routes that will meet the demands of existing and future
                  development.
                  This Element also designates areas to be used for open spaces, parks and
                  recreation facilities. Goals and policies regarding the preservation and
                  maintenance of these areas are also addressed in the Conservation & Open
                  Space and Recreation Elements. Safety and noise abatement issues also
                  relate to land use. To address noise concerns associated with uses such as
                  the airport, land use designations have been established reflective of the
                  noise contour maps in the Noise Element. To mitigate or avoid damage
                  and injury from natural and man-made hazards, hazards maps in the Safety
                  Element are also consistent with the Land Use Element.
                  The Land Use Element is intricately related to the Housing Element and
                  the Housing Element must be consistent with the Land Use Element. The
                  Land Use Element sets the framework for the City’s residential
                  environment by laying out the land designations for residential
                  development and indicating the type and density permitted by the City.
                  Working within this framework, the Housing Element identifies goals and
                  policies for the next five (5) years that directly address the housing needs
                  of Twentynine Palms residents.

SETTING/CONTEXT
Land Use Trends/Development Patterns
                        Twentynine Palms has historically been a rural desert residential
                        community. The area’s original inhabitants were the Chemehuevi Indians,
                        followed by gold miners, then World War I veterans, who were the first
                        modern settlers of the City.
                        Development in Twentynine Palms has consisted primarily of residential
                        development, mostly within the central core of the City. However, in
                        recent years there has been an increase in the amount of commercial
                        development in the City, most focused along Twentynine Palms Highway,
                        west of Downtown. Conversely, there has been limited industrial
                        development in the City.
City of Twentynine Palms General Plan 2012                                                                                       LU-7

               LAND USE
     Twentynine Palms Development Code
                     The Twentynine Palms Development Code serves as the primary
                     implementation tool for the General Plan. Whereas the General Plan is a
                     policy document and sets forth direction for land use policy-level
                     decisions, the Development Code is a regulatory document that establishes
                     specific standards for the use and development of all properties in the
                     City. The Twentynine Palms Development Code includes the City’s
                     Zoning Ordinance and Subdivision Ordinance, both of which carry out the
                     goals and policies stated in this General Plan.
                     Twentynine Palms utilizes a “one-map” system, in which the City’s
                     General Plan Land Use Map also serves as the City’s official Zoning Map.
                     This type of system allows for greater land use and zoning consistency,
                     because every General Plan land use designation has a single zoning
                     classification. Furthermore, the various General Plan Overlays are also
                     mirrored by the City’s Development Code, which provides detailed use
                     and development standards for every General Plan Overlay shown on the
                     Land Use Map.
     Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center
                     The Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center (Marine Base), a federal
                     military facility, is located north of the City of Twentynine Palms. The
                     base encompasses approximately 935 square miles. The vast majority of
                     the Marine Base property is outside of the City boundaries and is used
                     primarily as military training grounds. The Base’s main facilities (or
                     Mainside), including the Base’s headquarters, residential facilities and
                     support services were annexed to the City of Twentynine Palms on
                     January 19, 2000. The annexed portion of the Base totals 3.9 square
                     miles.
                     As part of the Base’s annexation, the City of Twentynine Palms and the
                     Marine Corps entered into an agreement in which the City granted the
                     Marine Corps authority to conduct any action on Base necessary to
                     accomplish the Marine Corps federal purpose, military purpose and
                     national mission. As such, land use and growth authority within the
                     Marine Base is the responsibility of the United States Department of
                     Defense.

Sphere of Influence
                         California State law permits local jurisdictions in cooperation with the
                         appropriate Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) to establish a
                         sphere of influence. A city’s sphere of influence is an area that has been
                         designated by a city as an area of possible future city expansion and legal
                         annexation. State law allows local jurisdictions to pre-zone the areas
                         within a city’s sphere of influence to ensure consistent land use and zoning
                         regulations between the city’s incorporated area and its sphere of
                         influence.
                         Twentynine Palms Sphere of Influence (SOI) encompasses 30.5 square
                         miles.     The City’s Sphere of Influence extends to the northern,
                         northeastern and eastern sections of the City (see Exhibit LU-1 above).
                         The vast majority of the SOI is vacant land.
                         The Land Use Element identifies the land use designations and
                         descriptions to be applied within the City's Sphere of Influence which, as
                         provided for in State law, will:
                             1. Serve as a guide for City recommendations to San Bernardino
                                  County regarding development proposals within this area.
                             2. Serve as a basis for pre-zoning of sphere areas prior to annexation.
                             3. Serve as a guide to master planning of infrastructure within City
                                  and sphere areas.
                             4. Serve as a means of planning for orderly annexation to the City.

          The City’s SOI is served by the Twentynine Palms Fire Department and
          San Bernardino County Fire Department. The County’s Fire Department
          operates a fire station east of the City at 80526 Amboy Road, Twentynine
          Palms, California (South Desert Division – Wonder Valley Fire Station

                         Center located at 6601 White Feather Road, Joshua Tree, California.
                         However, the Robert E. Bush Naval Hospital located on the Marine Base
                         also provides medical services, if medical emergencies warrant.
                         Schools
                         Public educational services for the entire Morongo Basin, including the
                         City of Twentynine Palms, are provided by the Morongo Unified School
                         District (MUSD). Currently, the District serves the City with four (4)
                         elementary schools, one (1) junior high school, one (1) high school and
                         one (1) continuation high school. Table LU-2 shows the student
                         enrollment and capacity for the various schools operated by MUSD.
                         Based on projections provided by the MUSD, there is available capacity at
                         most of their schools except for the Monument Continuation High School,
                         which currently exceeds capacity. Construction of additional schools and
                         facilities might be necessary in the future if student enrollment exceeds
                         capacity.

Utility Infrastructure
                         Utility infrastructure in Twentynine Palms is provided by independent
                         purveyors as noted below.
                         Water
                         The Twentynine Palms Water District is the water purveyor for the City of
                         Twentynine Palms and its SOI. The District is an independent agency that
                         serves an 87 square mile area. The District’s water supply is obtained
                         entirely from local groundwater. The District serves and maintains
                         approximately 7,300 meter services, 200 miles of pipeline and 17 million
                         gallons of water storage capacity. Additional information on water supply
                         and demand is provided in the Conservation & Open Space Element.
                         Wastewater Facilities
                         Sewer service is currently not available in the City of Twentynine Palms
                         or its SOI. Wastewater is treated through private septic systems or
                         package treatment plants. Commercial development and large residential
                         projects have been required to construct package treatment plants, which
                         are regulated by the Colorado River Basin Regional Water Quality Control
                         Board and San Bernardino County Division of Environmental Health
                         Services.
                         Storm Water Drainage System
                         Twentynine Palms storm drain and flood control systems are administered
                         by the City’s Engineering Department. New residential and commercial
                         development has been required to construct detention basins and storm
                         drain systems to mitigate increased run-off as a result of the new
                         development.
                         The San Bernardino County Flood Control District is responsible for
                         providing flood control and related services throughout the County,
                         including the incorporated area within the City of Twentynine Palms. In
                         Twentynine Palms, the Flood Control District has developed an earthen
                         channel, a detention basin and several road crossings to help intercept and
                         convey flood flows through and away from the major developed areas of
                         the City.

                  Utility services for the City of Twentynine Palms are provided by outside
                  vendors as noted below. Because of the infrastructure requested for
                  utilities, a change in the franchisees is not expected.
                  Electricity
                  Southern California Edison is the City’s electrical service purveyor.
                  Natural Gas
                  The Southern California Gas Company is the City’s natural gas service
                  purveyor.
                  Solid Waste
                  The County of San Bernardino contracted Burrtec Waste Industries, Inc. to
                  operate and maintain the County’s solid waste disposal facilities. Burrtec
                  is the City’s solid waste service purveyor.

LAND USE
AREAS OF CONCERN
                         Twentynine Palms is a desert community that values and seeks to preserve
                         its small-town character, while encouraging orderly growth and economic
                         development. Twentynine Palms is located between the Joshua Tree
                         National Park, a world recreational destination, and the Marine Base, the
                         largest Marine Corps military facility in the world. Its proximity to these
                         two facilities makes Twentynine Palms a world destination.
                         The Land Use Element serves as the community’s blueprint for growth
                         and development by outlining the community’s land use goals and
                         policies. The primary focus of the Land Use Element is to promote
                         growth that can strengthen the local economy, encourage high quality
                         development and preserve the area’s natural and cultural resources
                         through sustainable and adaptable growth principles.
LAND USE MAP AND LAND USE DISTRIBUTION
                         Twentynine Palms Land Use Map graphically represents the planned
                         distribution and intensity of land use citywide (see Exhibit LU-3). The
                         colors shown on the maps correspond to land use designations that
                         describe the types of uses established and planned in Twentynine Palms.
                         To ensure land use and zoning consistency, Twentynine Palms uses a
                         “single map system,” in which the City’s Land Use Map also serves as the
                         City’s official Zoning Map.
                         The City of Twentynine Palms encompasses a total of 37,642.84 acres
                         (58.82 square miles) and the City’s Sphere of Influence covers an area
                         totaling 19,539.85 acres (30.53 square miles). The Land Use Map
                         includes a total of 23 land uses, which are grouped into four (4) land use
                         categories as discussed in the Land Use Designations Section. The Land
                         Use Map graphically illustrates the planned distribution of land uses in the
                         City and its Sphere of Influence

District Area Requirements
                         In order to ensure logical land use areas, to prevent conflicts between and
                         among land uses and to provide for sustainable growth and development
                         patterns, minimum sizes for various Land Use Districts are established and
                         are noted in Table LU-5. The minimum District Area Requirements also
                         serve as a mechanism to help avoid “spot zoning” by ensuring that
                         proposed General Plan Amendments are consistent with the character of
                         the Community and discourage inconsistent development patterns. Spot
                         zoning is defined as the zoning of an isolated parcel in a manner which is
                         inconsistent or incompatible with surrounding zoning or land uses,
                         particularly if done to favor a particular landowner.

      DENSITY AND INTENSITY
                    This General Plan differentiates one land use area from another by the
                    principal use allowed within that District, such as homes (residential),
                    shops and restaurants (commercial), industrial businesses (industrial), and
                    parks or schools (public). To describe the intensity of use – how much
                    development exists on a property or could be built (and presumably, what
                    the associated activity level is) – the General Plan uses density and
                    intensity quantitative measures.
                    Density and intensity are commonly used in General Plans as a way to
                    meet legislative requirements, to define parameters of development and to
                    quantify standards of building intensity for each land use designation.
                    State General Plan guidelines require that these standards define the most
                    intensive use that will be allowed under each designation.
                           The term density applies to residential uses and refers to the
                            population and development capacity of residential land. Density
                            is described in terms of the number of dwelling units allowed per
                            gross acre (du/ac), inclusive of streets and public rights-of-way.
                            For example, the density of a residential development of 40
                            dwelling units occupying 10 gross acres of land is 4.0 dwelling
                            units per gross acre. A dwelling unit is a building or a portion of a
                            building designated, occupied or intended for human occupancy
                            with cooking, sleeping and sanitary facilities, and may vary
                            considerably in size.
                           The term intensity describes the degree to which a commercial,
                            industrial and other non-residential use can be developed on a
                            given site. The Twentynine Palms General Plan uses floor-area
                            ratio (FAR) to measure non-residential intensity. The FAR ratio is
                            determined by dividing the gross floor area of all buildings on a
LU-26                                                        City of Twentynine Palms General Plan 2012

                                                                      LAND USE
                                  parcel by the net land area of that parcel, exclusive of streets and
                                  public rights-of-way. FAR and factors such as building square
                                  footage, building height and the percent of lot coverage are all
                                  interrelated. For example, a 10,000-square-foot building on a
                                  20,000 square-foot parcel yields an FAR of 0.5. This 0.5 FAR can
                                  accommodate a single-story building that covers half the parcel or
                                  a two-story building with reduced lot coverage. Examples of
                                  methods to achieve different FAR provisions are shown on Exhibit
                                  LU-4.

                         The determination of development density or intensity at which a
                         proposed project can occur is a function of General Plan policies intended
                         to:
                                 Maximize public safety.
                                 Achieve high-quality site planning and design.
                                 Retain significant natural resources.
                                 Ensure compatibility between uses and development standards.
                         General Plan permitted densities and intensities are noted in Table LU-6.

                         intensity ranges. Development that does not meet the minimum or that
                         exceeds the maximum allowable density and intensity shall be redesign to
                         be consistent with the General Plan. The City’s General Plan provides
                         density and intensity policy direction. The City’s Development Code
                         contains more detailed development standards that will ultimately guide
                         the site, architectural, and landscape design of development proposals.

LAND USE DESIGNATIONS
                         Four (4) broad land use categories have been established to better guide
                         development in the City of Twentynine Palms. Each of these has
                         subcategories, determined by density, intensity and use. The General Plan
                         includes the following broad land use categories:
                                 Residential
                                 Commercial
                                 Industrial

Residential Land Use Districts
                         The differing residential land use districts vary primarily through
                         development densities as well as the street improvements required in each
                         district. The highest residential densities occur within the City’s center
                         core. The lowest residential densities are largely located in the City’s
                         outlaying areas, particularly the western and eastern sections of the
                         community.
                         The Residential Land Use category is divided into five (5) land use
                         districts, including Single-Family Residential, Multi-Family Residential,
                         High Density Residential, Rural Living and Open Space Residential.
                         Each of these require development to be residential in nature, although
                         they also permit accessory units and non-residential uses such as schools,
                         parks, child day care, and religious and charitable organizations in
                         residential districts, consistent with State law and the Twentynine Palms
                         Municipal Code.
                         Tables LU-8 through LU-11 describes the City’s residential land use
                         districts in more detail. Each table provides descriptions, development
                         densities and minimum lot size requirements applicable to each land use
                         designation within the residential district. The City’s Development Code
                         provides more detailed land use and development standards to further the
                         implementation of the General Plan.

Agricultural Land Use Designations
                         Twentynine Palms arid environment makes agricultural activities, such as
                         farming, considerably impractical. Commercial agricultural activities are
                         non-existent in the City. According to the California Department of
                         Conservation, Prime Farmlands, Farmlands of Statewide Importance,
                         Unique Farmlands, Farmlands of Local Importance and Grazing Lands are
                         non-existent in the City of Twentynine Palms or its Sphere of Influence.
                         The California Department of Conservation also notes that there are no
                         Williamson Act contract lands in the City or surrounding communities.
                         As such, given the practicality of farming in the City’s arid environment,
                         the General Plan does not include any agricultural land use designations.
                         However, limited agricultural uses and activities are permitted in the
                         following land use districts:
                                 Single-Family Residential

      Specific Plans
                       A Specific Plan is a detailed plan for the development of a particular
                       geographic area. Specific Plans are intended to provide specifications for
                       the types of uses to be permitted, development standards (setbacks,
                       heights, landscape, architecture, etc) to be allowed, and circulation and
                       infrastructure improvements necessary for the planning area, which are
                       typically broadly defined by the General Plan. California State law
                       requires that Specific Plans be consistent with the City’s General Plan.
                       In the City of Twentynine Palms, six (6) Specific Plans have been adopted
                       as shown on Exhibit LU-5, Adopted Specific Plans and Redevelopment
                       Project Area Specific Plans #1 through 4 were adopted to bring into
                       compliance a zoning classification that was inconsistent with the City’s
                       previous General Plan. Specific Plan #10 was adopted to better guide the
                       development of an area of special interest to the community, as this area
                       serves as one of the primary entrances to the Joshua Tree National Park

                                                                     LAND USE
                         The City of Twentynine Palms has undergone a major planning effort to
                         revitalize its Downtown. The result of this planning effort is the
                         Downtown Economic Revitalization Specific Plan, which incorporates
                         major land use changes to the Downtown planning area. The Specific
                         Plan also addresses circulation and infrastructure concerns for Downtown.
                         The Downtown Specific Plan will guide the development and
                         improvement of Downtown. The Specific Plan seeks to transform
                         Downtown into a safe, pedestrian friendly active destination that can serve
                         as an economic development catalyst for the City as a whole.
                         The land use designations for SP #1 through #4 and SP #10 are shown on
                         the City’s Land Use Map. However, the land use designations for the
                         Downtown Specific Plan are not shown on the City’s Land Use Map. The
                         land use designations for the Downtown Specific Plan are shown on the
                         Downtown Economic Revitalization Specific Plan document.
                         All six (6) adopted Specific Plans in the City are to be developed as
                         outlined in each Specific Plan document. A brief description for each one
                         of the City’s adopted Specific Plans is provided in Table LU-15, Adopted
                         Specific Plans.

                          New Specific Plans
                          The General Plan serves as a blueprint for the development of the City;
                          however, in areas of Twentynine Palms that require special consideration,
                          Specific Plans may be prepared, as allowed by State law. New Specific
                          Plans or amendments to existing Specific Plans need to demonstrate that
                          they meet the goals of the General Plan and further its vision. All new
                          proposed Specific Plans or amendments to existing Specific Plans shall be
                          consistent with the City’s General Plan.
                          Pursuant to State law, Specific Plans establish land use regulations for
                          those areas covered by the Specific Plan and once adopted, its standards
                          and regulations govern the uses and development of properties within the
                          planning area. Specific Plans should address the following; including all
                          other items as required by State law:
 City of Twentynine Palms General Plan 2012                                                         LU-53

                  LAND USE
                            List permitted uses.
                            Provide specific development standards, including site design,
                             architectural and landscape guidelines.
                            Address open space, scenic vistas and corridors, and the economic
                             viability of the Specific Plan.
                            Provide detailed regulations that are responsive to unique local
                             conditions.
                            Include a detailed implementation program for the development of
                             private and public facilities, including facility phasing and funding.
                            Allow flexibility for long range planned community projects.
                         It is the intent of the General Plan to allow Specific Plans to be
                         prepared, where deemed appropriate, which can incorporate more
                         flexible land use and design standards than the stricter standards
                         allowed by the Development Code. The increased design flexibility
                         within a comprehensive planning framework allows for mixed-use,
                         enhanced architecture and use of special development standards and
                         criteria, which address the particular features and attributes of a site.
                         Once adopted, Specific Plans serve as the primary land use regulation
                         for the planning area they cover.
      Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center
                         The Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center (Marine Base), a
                         federal military facility, is located within the northern edge of the City
                         of Twentynine Palms. The Marine Base encompasses approximately
                         935 square miles. The vast majority of the Marine Corps property is
                         outside of the City boundaries and is used primarily as training
                         grounds. The Marine Corps main facilities (or Mainside), including
                         the Base’s headquarters, residential facilities and support services,
                         were annexed to the City on January 19, 2000. The area that was
                         annexed totals 3.9 square miles.
                         As part of the Base’s annexation, the City of Twentynine Palms and
                         the Marine Corps entered into a Pre-Annexation Agreement in which
                         the City agreed not to exercise its police power on Marine Corps
                         property to protect and allow the Marine Corps to meet their federal
                         purpose, military purpose and national mission. The City’s General
                         Plan and Development Code designate the portion of the Marine Base
                         that is located within City limits as Military (M). Any land use

GENERAL PLAN OVERLAYS
                         The City of Twentynine Palms is home to a number of unique natural
                         resources, such as scenic vistas, open spaces and the hillsides of the
                         Joshua Tree National Park. The City is also subject to a number of natural
                         hazards, including flooding and fault hazards. Several overlays are
                         incorporated as part of the General Plan with the intent of preserving the
                         City’s natural resources as well as protecting the public’s health, safety
                         and general welfare. The overlays add additional flexibility to land
                         development while maintaining other community goals and priorities.
                         The General Plan Land Use Overlays are shown on Exhibits LU-6 and
                         LU-7.

      LAND USE
        The intent/purpose of each General Plan Overlay is noted in Table LU-16,
        General Plan Overlays. There are underlying land use designations for all
        properties within the General Plan Overlays. Development consistent with
        the allowable uses and standards of the overlays and the underlying
        designations are permitted. In the event the overlay standards differ from
        those of the underlying land use designation, the more restrictive standards
        shall apply. The City’s Development Code provides more specific
        development standards for each one of the General Plan Overlays.

  Mesquite Dunes &                       The Mesquite Dunes and Bosque (MDB) provide an excellent
  Bosque (MDB)                           natural buffer for the Marine Base and is a scenic resource for
                                         the City. The MDB includes Mesquite Lake Playa and
                                         Mesquite Springs and are all part of the same hydrological and
                                         biological system. The Bosque is one of two (2) wetland
                                         habitats in the planning area and is classified as a sensitive
                                         natural community. The Playa is a wetland habitat with riparian
                                         vegetation along its edge (see EIR Pg. 4.4-32 through 34) The
                                         eastern edge of the MDB is defined by the Mesquite Fault, the
                                         hydrologic barrier separating the Mesquite Lake Sub basin from
                                         the Dale Sub basin to the east. Within the basin, groundwater
                                         flows toward Mesquite Dry Lake from all directions. This
                                         MDB is an important component of the Twentynine Palms
                                         Water District regional plan for the future (see Twentynine
                                         Palms Water District 2010 Groundwater Study for the Mesquite
                                         Lake Sub-basin) The MDB is the terminus for the Indian
                             626.21      Cove/Mesquite Drainage Area (Safety Overlay). This surface
                                         water is important for the maintenance of the existing plant and
                                         animal life in the MDB. The dominant mesquite is also
                                         responsible for holding the dunes in place. Loss of the mesquite
                                         will further reduce air quality in the planning area.
                                         The intent of the Mesquite Dunes & Bosque Overlay is to
                                         preserve and protect the Mesquite Dunes by discouraging
                                         development within the Dunes or minimize development
                                         impacts to the maximum extent feasible.               Development
                                         proposed within the Mesquite Dunes Overlay shall incorporate
                                         alternative site design standards, such as limiting the amount of
                                         clearing and grading in order to protect the existing natural
                                         habitat and preserve the biological and scenic resources of the
                                         Mesquite Dunes. Additional policies regarding the Mesquite

                                 Floodplain. The 100-year floodplain area is defined by FEMA
                                 by reviewing the long-term average period between floods of a
                                 certain size and identifying the size of a flood that has a 1

                                 Technical Report). The City’s existing Master Plan of Drainage
                                 requires a fairly expansive flood control system for the

                                         terrain in the southern and northern sections of the City. The
                                         intent of the Hillsides Overlay is to preserve and protect the
                                         area’s scenic resources and vistas and protect development from
                                         earthquake induced slope failure by prohibiting development on
                                         top of ridgelines and on extremely hilly terrain. Development
                                         proposed on hillsides that exhibit a slope greater than 25% shall
                                         be prohibited. Construction of structures on ridgelines and
                                         structures that extend beyond a ridgeline shall be prohibited.
                           11,620.73 Grading on hillsides shall be limited to the maximum extent
                                         feasible to minimize impacts on scenic resources. Hillside
                                         development shall follow the natural contours of the land and
                                         minimize the amount of land alteration. Project design shall not
                                         affect the integrity of hillside topography, destroy prominent
                                         ridgelines or hillside features. Site-specific geotechnical studies
                                         may be required prior to development approval to assess the
                                         potential for permanent ground displacement for projects

      GENERAL PLAN BUILD-OUT (POPULATION GROWTH)
                  The General Plan will guide the orderly growth and development of
                  Twentynine Palms for the next 15 to 20 years. Even though ultimate
                  build-out of the General Plan is not expected within this timeframe, it is
                  important to determine the development capacity of the General Plan to
                  adequately address a balance of development and infrastructure needs. The
                  projected growth is based upon the amount of land designated for each
                  land use with a projected average intensity of development. This analysis
                  was intended to provide information to determine if the planned
                  infrastructure would support the amount of projected development for the
                  land use designations provided in the General Plan. The projected growth
                  was estimated based upon average intensities of development for similar
                  desert communities and actual growth may be greater or less than
                  projected. The projected development reflects the amount of land
                  designated for various uses, not on a market or economic analysis. Full
                  development of the City is anticipated to be many decades in the future
                  and economic conditions are likely to change over such an extended
                  timeframe.
                  To determine the overall projected build-out of the General Plan, a build-
                  out analysis was conducted by multiplying the total acreage of each land
                  use designation by its projected average density/intensity. The General
                  Plan build-out for the City of Twentynine Palms is noted in Table LU-17.
                  The General Plan build-out for the City’s Sphere of Influence is noted in
                  Table LU-18.
                  Planned infrastructure improvements, long-term public facility and service
                  needs, and use of resources set forth in the other General Plan Elements
                  were reviewed to determine if they were adequate to support the growth
                  projections identified by the General Plan Build-Out Analysis. The City
                  will continue to monitor development and projected growth versus actual
                  conditions, and to adjust General Plan policies, implementation programs,
                  and planned infrastructure accordingly.

Residential Build-Out and Population Growth
                         According to the build-out analysis, as noted in the General Plan Build-
                         Out tables, a total of 27,940 dwelling units could ultimately be constructed
                         in the City of Twentynine Palms and an additional 2,489 dwelling units
                         could ultimately be constructed in the City’s Sphere of Influence. The
                         General Plan build-out was determined by multiplying the total acreage of
                         each land use designation by its projected average density. The projected
                         average density equates to 80% of the maximum allowable density. The
                         projected average density takes into account site constraints that can
                         potentially limit the density of development. Constraints include
                         topographic, natural hazards and natural resources, which ultimately yield
                         lower development densities.
                         Based on the projected number of dwelling units that could ultimately be
                         constructed in Twentynine Palms and its Sphere of Influence, a total of
                         103,275 persons could ultimately reside in Twentynine Palms, which
                         includes 22,500 residents on the Marine Base. A total of 7,197 residents
                         could ultimately reside in the City’s Sphere of Influence. The population
                         projections were derived by multiplying the projected number of dwelling
                         units that could be developed in the City and its Sphere of Influence by
                         2.891 persons per household, as determined by the California Department
                         of Finance for 2009 baseline conditions (the most current baseline
                         conditions available).
                         The California Department of Finance estimates the City’s 2010
                         population, including the Marine Base, to be 30,649; this population
                         equals to 29.4% of the projected General Plan build-out population. The
                         Southern California Association of Governments 2008 Regional
                         Transportation Plan forecasts that Twentynine Palms total population will
                         increase to 49,991 by 2020 and 63,488 by 2030, which is the planning
                         horizon for this General Plan.

                   LAND USE
      Non-Residential Build-Out and Potential Employment Count
                       According to the build-out analysis, as noted in the General Plan Build-
                       Out tables, a total of 37,161,084 square feet of commercial and industrial
                       development could be constructed in the City of Twentynine Palms and an
                       additional 875,295 square feet could be constructed within the City’s
                       Sphere of Influence.        The projected General Plan build-out was
                       determined by multiplying the total acreage of each non-residential land
                       use designation by its projected average intensity. Based on current non-
                       residential development trends, it was determined that a significant
                       number of properties will not be built to the maximum allowable intensity
                       because of site constraints, the desert character of the City, and market
                       conditions. Desert communities, such as Twentynine Palms, tend to
                       develop at lower intensities than urban areas because of the availability of
                       land and construction cost, which makes building out more cost effective
                       than building up at higher intensities.
                       The development capacity analysis projects that a total of 38,578 jobs
                       could be created within the City of Twentynine Palms and an additional
                       752 jobs could be created in the City’s Sphere of Influence. The potential
                       number of jobs was determined by multiplying the total acreage of each
                       non-residential land use designation by somewhat modified San
                       Bernardino Associated Governments (SANBAG) employment projections
                       factors for San Bernardino County.
                       The projected development capacity for non-residential development at
                       General Plan build-out is significant; however, the projections
                       incorporated in this section are full General Plan build-out calculations.
                       Complete build-out of the General Plan is not expected for a great number
                       of years, primarily because of market conditions. Goals and policies to aid
                       the development of non-residential uses and creation of employment
                       opportunities in the City are included in the Redevelopment and Economic
                       Development Section.
                       The following goal and implementation policies will guide the City as it
                       develops towards build-out.

SUSTAINABILITY
                         The Twentynine Palms General Plan is based on sustainability and
                         adaptability principles. Sustainability requires the ability of meeting
                         existing needs without compromising the ability of future generations to
                         meet their own needs. Adaptability requires the ability of adapting
                         community activities to the natural environment rather than changing the
                         natural environment to meet community activities. Sustainability calls for
                         cities to become better stewards of the environment and preserve a high
                         quality of life for future generations.
City of Twentynine Palms General Plan 2012                                                            LU-81

      LAND USE
        The Land Use Element serves as a tool to plan for the future development
        of the City of Twentynine Palms and to set development goals and policies
        that address sustainability principles, including development types,
        location and character. Planning for tomorrow includes understanding that
        natural resources are limited and that these natural resources must not be
        consumed faster than they can be replenished. However, sustainability
        does not preclude development, growth and advancement. Sustainability
        can promote positive economic growth and can stimulate technological
        innovation, advance competitiveness and improve resident’s quality of
        life.
        A sustainable future for Twentynine Palms, under this General Plan,
        utilizes various strategies to conserve and enhance local resources and
        safeguard the environment. The concept of sustainability is used
        throughout this General Plan; however, it is primarily discussed in the
        Land Use and Conservation & Open Space Elements. The Land Use
        Element addresses sustainability and environmental conservation through
        goals and policies that promote site and building design elements in new
        developments that reduce or better distribute travel demand, improve
        development design, promote sustainable green building practices and
        amenities, and promote mixed-use developments that encourage
        placement of employment and commercial offerings near residential
        districts. The Conservation & Open Space Element includes goals and
        polices that promote community sustainability and effective management
        of renewable and non-renewable natural resources through energy and
        water conservation, solid waste management, recycling, water runoff
        reduction and sustainable green building practices, including low impact
        development practices which mimic a site’s pre-development hydrology
        by using design practices and techniques that effectively capture, filter,
        store, evaporate, detain and infiltrate runoff close to its source.
        The following goal and implementation policies will serve as a guide to
        the City in ensuring it moves towards a sustainable future.

WASTE FACILITIES
                         Adequate treatment of liquid and solid waste is essential to preserve a
                         community’s high quality of life. Waste treatment is highly regulated
                         because of the potential environmental impacts associated with waste
                         disposal. The General Plan addresses liquid and solid waste in the
                         following sections.
Liquid Waste
                         The City of Twentynine Palms and its Sphere of Influence are currently
                         not served by a centralized wastewater system. In Twentynine Palms,
                         wastewater is addressed through private septic systems or package
                         treatment plants.      Newer developments are required to construct
                         wastewater package treatment plants to address wastewater disposal.
                         Private wastewater systems are regulated by the Colorado River Basin
                         Regional Water Quality Control Board and the San Bernardino County
                         Division of Environmental Health Services.
                         As the City grows, construction of additional private wastewater systems
                         could have an environmental impact on the area’s groundwater, which is a
                         significant concern, as local groundwater is the City’s only source for
                         potable water. The lack of a centralized wastewater system also impacts
                         economic development opportunities in the City. As part of its efforts to
                         address groundwater quality and to enhance the economic opportunities in
                         Twentynine Palms, the City anticipates studying various alternatives to
                         address the construction and operation of a centralized wastewater system.
                         A Wastewater Treatment Plant Joint Use Study was prepared by Winzler
                         and Kelly in 2008, updating a previous 2003 Study. The 2008 Study
                         examined several alternatives, including a separate centralized facility for
                         the City, but recommended against a Joint Use facility and that the City
                         utilize decentralized treatment (package plants) due to costs and lack of
                         information that there was a problem with on-site septic systems. Based
                         on this study, if a centralized treatment plant was desired the area
                         exhibiting the greatest potential is approximately 640 acres in size and is
                         located in the northeastern section of Twentynine Palms. The area is
                         located south of Mesa Drive, west of Bullion Mountain Road, north of
                         Amboy Road and east of Utah Trail (see Exhibit LU-8). The vast majority
                         of the area is vacant with scattered residential in the vicinity. The Land
                         Use Map designates this area as RL-2.5, RS-2 and CT; however, only five

                  LAND USE
                    (5) single-family homes have been constructed to date in the area. If a site
                    is desired to be constructed, a centralized wastewater treatment plant only
                    needs to be approximately 80 acres. The preferred site would be selected
                    through a more extensive engineering process to ensure that the site will
                    be adequate to serve the planned centralized treatment plant and that it will
                    not impact adjacent land uses.
                    The construction of a centralized wastewater treatment plant would help
                    the City achieve the vision and goals identified by the Downtown
                    Economic Revitalization Specific Plan for the Downtown area, as it
                    envisioned that a wastewater system would serve the commercial district
                    in Downtown Twentynine Palms. A centralized wastewater system could
                    also create additional economic development opportunities in the City
                    through the development of a larger industrial base and employment
                    center.
      Solid Waste
                    In July 2001, the County of San Bernardino contracted Burrtec Waste
                    Industries, Inc. to operate and maintain the County’s solid waste disposal
                    facilities, including both active and closed landfills, transfer stations and
                    community collection centers. Burrtec provides solid waste services to the
                    City of Twentynine Palms. Burrtec provides recycling programs to reduce
                    the amount of waste being deposited in the County’s landfills and assists
                    communities achieve State mandated diversion goals. The City and
                    Burrtec co-sponsor semiannual Community Clean Up Days in Twentynine
                    Palms, in which community groups are asked to help collect trash
                    throughout the community. Cash rewards are offered to groups that
                    collect the most amount of waste. Recent Community Clean Up efforts
                    have yield from 44 up to 54 tons of waste collected.
                    Waste collected in the City is taken to the Twentynine Palms Transfer
                    Station, which is located one-mile east of the City’s eastern boundary
                    within the City’s Sphere of Influence at 7501 Pinto Mountain Road (one-
                    mile south of Twentynine Palms Highway). The City’s Land Use Map
                    designates the Transfer Station site as OSR-20, properties north of the
                    Station are designated RL-5 and properties east, south and west of the
                    Station are designated OSR-20.
                    The area in the vicinity of the Transfer Station is mostly vacant and the

                         Highway and the Transfer Station; however, none of the homes are located
                         adjacent to the Transfer Station. Uses to the east include vacant land and
                         the Twentynine Palms Municipal Airport, located 1/2-mile northeast of the
                         Transfer Station. The area south of the Transfer Station is public Bureau

                         vacant land and a sand and gravel mine, which is located 1/2-mile west of
                         the Transfer Station.
                         Waste taken to the Twentynine Palms Transfer Station for processing is
                         ultimately deposited at the Landers Landfill, which is located in Landers,
                         California. The County of San Bernardino Solid Waste Management
                         Division (SWMD) is responsible for the operation and management of the

      LAND USE
        State planning law restricts land use densities and intensities within a two
        (2) mile radius of public airports and it requires that local land use
        regulations conform to adopted airport land use plans. However, it does
        not impose similar restrictions on private airstrips or heliports; as air
        traffic and impacts associated with airstrips and heliports are not
        anticipated to be significant. Private airstrips and heliports located in
        Twentynine Palms or its vicinity are not anticipated to pose significant
        impacts on adjacent land uses. Therefore, as permitted by State law, land
        use designations, including permitted uses and development
        densities/intensities, for properties located adjacent to private airstrips or
        heliports shall be consistent with the General Plan Land Use Map.
        The Twentynine Palms Strategic Expeditionary Landing Field (SELF) is a
        military facility located seven (7) miles northwest of the City of
        Twentynine Palms; as such, it is not within the range outlined by State law
        to significantly impact properties within the City of Twentynine Palms, as
        it relates to land use planning.
        The Twentynine Palms Municipal Airport is located 1.5-miles east of the
        City’s eastern boundary within the City’s Sphere of Influence. The airport
        is operated by the County of San Bernardino. As required by State law,
        properties within two (2) miles of the airport are subject to more stringent
        land use and density/intensity requirements. In May 1992, the County of
        San Bernardino adopted the Twentynine Palms Airport Comprehensive
        Land Use Plan for the area surrounding the municipal airport. The current
        Airport Land Use Plan does not cover the entire two (2) mile radius; as
        outlined by State law, it only includes a 1-mile radius around the airport
        boundaries. City incorporated properties are not located within the
        boundaries of the Airport Land Use Plan. As such, the Airport Land Use
        Plan does not impact land use designations and development
        densities/intensities for properties located within the City of Twentynine
        Palms.
        To provide consistent land use regulation for the properties located within
        the Airport Land Use Plan, the City’s Land Use Map incorporated San
        Bernardino County’s land use designations for the properties located in
        proximity to the Twentynine Palms Municipal Airport. The City’s Land
        Use Map designates properties located within the boundaries of the
        Airport Land Use Plan as RL-5, OSR-20 (San Bernardino County
        designation of Resource Conservation ‘RC’) and CS.

                         The San Bernardino County land use designations have been found to be
                         consistent with the Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan. Therefore,
                         City land use designations are considered consistent with the Airport Land
                         Use Plan, as they are similar to the County’s designations. To provide
                         additional protection for properties located in proximity to the airport and
                         to ensure land use consistency with the County of San Bernardino, the
                         City’s General Plan also incorporated the County’s Airport Safety Overlay
                         and Noise Hazard Overlay (see General Plan Overlays Section for goals
                         and policies regarding City Overlays). City imposed land use designations
                         and overlays for these properties shall serve as a guide for development, as
                         properties located with the Airport Land Use Plan have not been
                         incorporated to the City of Twentynine Palms and therefore development
                         proposed on these properties is subject to the County of San Bernardino
                         General Plan and Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan.
                         The following goal and implementation policies will guide development

                 LAND USE
     REDEVELOPMENT AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
                   Quality of life in Twentynine Palms is strongly tied to the economic
                   success of its residents and businesses. Twentynine Palms seeks to take a
                   strong proactive approach to redevelopment and economic development
                   efforts to meet the needs of its residents, while protecting the small-town
                   character of the community. Economic development efforts in the City of
                   Twentynine Palms are primarily headed by the City’s Redevelopment
                   Agency; however, the City continues to explore additional opportunities to
                   expand its economic development efforts through partnerships with local
                   businesses and organizations.
     Redevelopment
                   Redevelopment is a tool used in many cities in California to spur
                   economic activity and investment in focus areas that have experienced
                   economic decline. Because of economic incentives, redevelopment is one
                   of the most effective and sometimes only method to reinvigorate
                   distressed neighborhoods and districts. Redevelopment is a process
                   created by the State of California to assist local governments in
                   eliminating blight and revitalizing designated project areas.
                   Redevelopment provides communities with the ability to obtain funding to
                   make infrastructure improvements, acquire property and otherwise bring
                   about desired development, reconstruction and rehabilitation. A portion of
                   redevelopment funds must also be used to promote affordable housing
                   opportunities in the community.           The ability to fund economic
                   development activities can aid in encouraging private businesses to do the
                   same.
                   The California Health and Safety Code provides the basis for
                   redevelopment activities (starting at Section 33000, also known as the
                   Community Redevelopment Law). Section 33037 states that the basic
                   goal of redevelopment is the removal of blight. Blight is a term used to
                   describe a variety of physical and economic conditions, some of which
                   may not fit the public's general perception of blight. Examples of physical
                   blight include buildings that are deteriorating, aging or poorly maintained.
                   Blight may also describe buildings that are in good condition but need
                   design or configuration improvements to meet current business needs.
                   Economic blight can be characterized by vacant buildings or land, high

                                                                       LAND USE

                         retain businesses in a particular area.
                         The Twentynine Palms Redevelopment Agency was created in 1991. In
                         1993, the City Council adopted the “Four Corners Redevelopment Plan”
                         and established the Redevelopment Project Area (see Exhibit LU-5,
                         Adopted Specific Plans and Redevelopment Project Area).                   The
                         Redevelopment Plan is in effect until 2033.             The Four Corners
                         Redevelopment Project Area is the City’s only Redevelopment Project
                         Area. The Project Area is bounded by Amboy Road, Siesta Drive and
                         Mesa Drive to the north, Utah Trail to the east, Sullivan Road, Foothill
                         Drive and Hatch Road to the south, and Morongo Road to the west. The
                         Project Area encompasses 5,017.57 acres (7.8 square miles) and it
                         includes Downtown Twentynine Palms and the City’s primary commercial
                         corridors, which are located along Twentynine Palms Highway and Adobe
                         Road. Currently, most of the parcels within the Redevelopment Project
                         Area are vacant. Properties located within the Redevelopment Project
                         Area are subject to the land use regulations outlined in the City’s General
                         Plan and Land Use Map.
                         The Redevelopment Agency works in conjunction with City departments
                         to achieve the goals set forth by the Redevelopment Plan. The Agency
                         uses a process called tax increment financing to carry out its goals. When
                         an area is designated as a Redevelopment Project Area by the City
                         Council, the properties within the boundaries of the Project Area have a
                         certain total property tax value. If this total assessed valuation increases
                         due to redevelopment efforts, most of the taxes that are derived from the
                         increase go to the Redevelopment Agency. These "tax increments" can be
                         used only in the same Redevelopment Project Area where they were
                         generated, except for residential projects, which benefit low-and
                         moderate-income households.
Economic Development
                         The City of Twentynine Palms is located adjacent to the Joshua Tree
                         National Park, a world tourist destination, and the Marine Base, the largest
                         Marine Corps military facility in the world. A substantial number of
                         visitors stop and/or pass by the City everyday. Twentynine Palms
                         economic development efforts are guided by the following principles:
                                 Develop a healthy and balanced community.
                                 Develop a strong local economy.

PURPOSE
                         The Noise Element of a General Plan is a comprehensive program for
                         including noise management in the planning process. It is a tool for local
                         planners to use in achieving and maintaining land uses that are compatible
                         with environmental noise levels. The Noise Element identifies noise
                         sensitive land uses and noise sources, and defines areas of noise impact for
                         the purpose of developing programs to ensure that Twentynine Palms
                         residents will be protected from excessive noise intrusion. The current
                         Noise Element of the General Plan for the City of Twentynine Palms was
                         adopted in 2002. That Element identified roadways as the most significant
                         source of noise in the City. Aircraft, construction and industrial noise
                         were also identified as contributing to the noise environment. Traffic
                         noise is still the major noise source in the City. The City is projected to
                         experience considerable growth in the upcoming years. Although noise is
                         not a critical issue at this time, it will become more important as the City
                         becomes more developed. Thus, the decision was made by the City to
                         update the Noise Element as part of the Comprehensive General Plan
                         update to more effectively protect and plan for the residents of the City.
                         The Noise Element follows the revised State guidelines (“General Plan
                         Guidelines,” Governors Office of Planning and Research, 2002), and State
                         Government Code Section 653021(f). The Element quantifies the
                         community noise environment in terms of noise exposure contours for
                         both near and long-term levels of growth and traffic activity. The
                         information will become a guideline for the development of land use
                         policies to achieve compatible land uses and provide baseline levels and
                         noise source identification for local noise ordinance enforcement.

     BACKGROUND
     RELATIONSHIP TO STATE LAW
                              Section 65300 et seq. of the State of California Government Code
                              identifies seven mandatory elements in a General Plan, including Noise.
                              A Noise Element as well as other general plan policies and implementing
                              ordinances (zoning codes, noise ordinances, etc.) are effective tools in
                              noise reduction and mitigation. Section 65302(g) of the California
                              Government Code requires that each city have a noise element as part of
                              the General Plan. The Twentynine Palms Noise Element follows the
                              guidelines adopted by the Office of Noise Control, pursuant to Section
                              46050.1 of the Health and Safety Code.
                              State guidelines are very specific about the content of a General Plan
                              Noise Element. The Government Code (Section 65302(F)) states that the
                              noise element should be prepared according to guidelines established by
                              the Department of Health Services. At a minimum, the Government Code
                              requires the element to analyze noise levels for the following:
                                      Highways and freeways;
                                      Primary arterial and major local streets;
                                      Passenger and freight railroad operations and ground rapid transit
                                       systems;
                                      Commercial, general aviation, heliport, helistop, and military
                                       airport operations, aircraft overflights, jet engine test stands, and
                                       all other ground facilities and maintenance functions related to
                                       airport operation;
                                      Local industrial plants, including but not limited to railroad
                                       classification yards; and
                                      Other ground sources identified by the local agencies as
                                       contributing to the community noise environment.

       RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER ELEMENTS
                   This Noise Element is directly related to other elements of this General
                   Plan, most specifically the Land Use, Circulation, Housing and Safety
                   Elements. It covers a variety of issues such as the impact of noise on
                   various land uses and which land uses create noise which may be
                   incompatible with other land uses (Land Use Element); the impact of
                   noise from vehicular and other traffic (Circulation Element); the effect of
                   noise on residential areas (Housing Element) and the noise generated by
                   aircraft (Safety Element). Several issues dealing with noise have a direct
                   influence on policies and programs in these other elements of this General
                   Plan.
                   Table NS-1 details the issues discussed in this Noise Element and
                   identifies other elements which include discussions which also address
                   these issues.

       INFORMATION ON NOISE
                   This section contains a detailed description of the current and projected
                   noise environment within the City. This description of the noise
                   environment includes identification of noise sources and noise sensitive
                   land uses, a community noise measurement survey and noise contour
                   maps.
NS-4                                                     City of Twentynine Palms General Plan 2012
                                                                            NOISE
                         To define the noise exposure, this section of the report defines noise
                         terminology, describes the noise measurement results and identifies the
                         major sources of noise in the community. The sources of noise in
                         Twentynine Palms include: motor vehicles, aircraft, construction,
                         commercial areas, and general neighborhood noises. To completely assess
                         the noise environment in the City, noise sensitive receptors must also be
                         identified. As mandated by the State, noise sensitive receptors include,
                         but are not limited to, areas containing residential uses, schools, hospitals,
                         rest homes, long-term medical or mental care facilities, or any other land
                         use area deemed noise sensitive by the local jurisdiction.
                         Based upon the identification of the major noise sources and the location
                         of sensitive receptors, a noise measurement survey was conducted. The
                         survey has two (2) functions. The first is to determine the existing noise
                         levels at noise sensitive land uses and at other areas of interest. A second
                         function is to obtain an accurate description of the ambient noise levels in
                         various neighborhoods throughout the City.
                         Noise contours for all of the major noise sources in Twentynine Palms
                         were developed. The traffic noise contours were based upon traffic mix,
                         traffic levels and vehicle speed. The contours are expressed in terms of
                         the Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL).
Definitions
                         Sound is technically described in terms of the loudness (amplitude) and
                         frequency (pitch) of the sound. The standard unit of measurement of the
                         loudness of sound is the decibel (dB). Since the human ear is not equally
                         sensitive to sound at all frequencies, a special frequency-dependent rating
                         scale has been devised to relate noise to human sensitivity. The A-
                         weighted decibel scale (dBA) performs this compensation by
                         discriminating against frequencies in a manner approximating the
                         sensitivity of the human ear.
                         Decibels are based on the logarithmic scale. The logarithmic scale
                         compresses the wide range in sound pressure levels to a more usable range
                         of numbers in a manner similar to the way that the Richter scale is used to
                         measure earthquakes. In terms of human response to noise, a sound 10
                         dBA higher than another is judged to be twice as loud; and 20 dBA higher
                         four times as loud; and so forth. Everyday sounds normally range from 30

     NOISE
       dB (very quiet) to 100 dB (very loud). Examples of various sound levels
       in different environments are shown in Exhibit NS-1.
       Noise has been defined as unwanted sound and it is known to have several
       adverse effects on people. From these known effects of noise, criteria
       have been established to help protect the public health and safety and
       prevent disruption of certain human activities. This criteria is based on
       such known effects of noise on people as hearing loss (not generally a
       factor with community noise), communication interference, sleep
       interference, physiological responses and annoyance. Each of these
       potential noise impacts on people are briefly discussed in the following
       narratives:
       HEARING LOSS is, in general, not a concern in community noise
       problems. The potential for noise-induced hearing loss is more commonly
       associated with occupational noise exposures in heavy industry or very
       noisy work environments with long-term exposure. The Occupational
       Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) identifies a noise exposure
       limit of 90 dBA for 8 hours per day to protect from hearing loss. Noise
       levels in neighborhoods, even in very noisy airport environments near
       major international airports, are not sufficiently loud to cause hearing loss.
       It is significant to note that in recent years hearing loss is being caused
       more and more by recreational exposure to noise, such as off-road vehicle
       riding, loud music, target and skeet shooting, etc.
       COMMUNICATION INTERFERENCE is one of the primary concerns in
       environmental noise problems. Communication interference includes
       speech interference and activities such as watching television. Normal
       conversational speech is in the range of 60 to 65 dBA and any noise in this
       range or louder may interfere with speech. There are specific methods of

     NOISE
       SLEEP INTERFERENCE is a major noise concern in noise assessment
       and, of course, is most critical during nighttime hours. Sleep disturbance
       is one of the major causes of annoyance due to community noise. Noise
       can make it difficult to fall asleep, create momentary disturbances of
       natural sleep patterns by causing shifts from deep to lighter stages and
       cause awakening. Noise may even cause awakening, which a person may
       or may not be able to recall.
       Extensive research has been conducted on the effect of noise on sleep
       disturbance. Recommended values for desired sound levels in residential
       bedroom space range from 25 to 45 dBA. The lower noise level
       recommendations are generally for continuous noise sources such as
       heating and ventilating systems and the higher part of the recommended
       range is for intermittent noise such as outdoor noise event intrusion into
       the sleeping area.
       PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES are those measurable effects of noise on
       people, which are realized as changes in pulse rate, blood pressure, etc.
       While such effects can be induced and observed, the extent is not known
       to which these physiological responses cause harm or are sign of harm.
       Generally, physiological responses are a reaction to a loud short term
       noise such as a rifle shot or a very loud jet overflight.
       ANNOYANCE is the most difficult of all noise responses to describe.
       Annoyance is a very individual characteristic and can vary widely from
       person to person. What one person considers tolerable can be quite
       unbearable to another of equal hearing capability. The level of annoyance,
       of course, depends on the characteristics of the noise (i.e.; loudness,
       frequency spectra, time and duration), and how much activity interference
       (e.g. speech interference and sleep interference) results from the noise.
       However, the level of annoyance is also a function of the attitude of the
       receiver. Personal sensitivity to noise varies widely. It has been estimated
       that two (2) to ten (10) percent of the population is highly susceptible to
       noise not of their own making, while approximately twenty percent (20%)
       are unaffected by noise. Attitudes are affected by the relationship between
       the person and the noise source. (Is it our dog barking or the neighbor's
       dog?) Whether we believe that someone is trying to abate the noise will
       also affect our level of annoyance.

                         Community noise is generally not a steady state and varies with time.
                         Under conditions of non-steady state noise, some type of statistical metric
                         is necessary to quantify noise exposure over a long period of time.
                         Several rating scales have been developed for describing the effects of
                         noise on people. They are designed to account for the above known
                         effects of noise on people.
                         These scales are: the Equivalent Noise Level (LEQ), the Day Night Noise
                         Level (LDN), the Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL), and
                         percentile noise levels (L%). These scales are described in the following
                         paragraphs.
                         LEQ is the "energy" average noise level during the time period of the
                         sample. It is a number that represents a decibel sound level. This constant
                         sound level would contain an equal amount of energy as a fluctuating
                         sound level over a given period of time. LEQ can be measured for any
                         time period, but is typically measured for 15 minutes, 1 hour or 24 hours.
                         LDN is a 24 hour, time-weighted annual average noise level. Time-
                         weighted refers to the fact that noise which occurs during certain sensitive
                         time periods is penalized for occurring at these times. In the LDN scale,
                         those events that take place during the night (10 p.m. to 7 a.m.) are
                         penalized by 10 dB. This penalty was selected to attempt to account for
                         increased human sensitivity to noise during the quieter period of a day,
                         where sleep is the most probable activity.
                         CNEL is similar to the LDN scale except that it includes an additional 5
                         dBA penalty for events that occur during the evening (7 pm to 10 pm)
                         time period. Either LDN or CNEL may be used to identify community
                         noise impacts within the Noise Element. Example noise environments in
                         terms of the CNEL metric are shown in Exhibit NS-2.

      NOISE
        L(%), Lmax and Lmin are statistical methods of describing noise which
        accounts for variance in noise levels throughout a given measurement
        period. L(%) is a way of expressing the noise level exceeded for a
        percentage of time in a given measurement period. For example since five
        (5) minutes is twenty-five percent (25%) of twenty (20) minutes, L(25) is
        the noise level that is equal to or exceeded for five minutes in a twenty-
        minute measurement period. It is L(%) that is used for most Noise
        Ordinance standards. Lmax represents the loudest noise level that is
        measured. The Lmax only occurs for a fraction of a second with all the
        other noise less than the Lmax level. Lmin represents the quietest noise
        level during a noise measurement.            All other noise during the
        measurement period is louder than the Lmin.

      Noise Measurements
                     Twenty-one (21) sites were selected for measurement of the noise
                     environment in Twentynine Palms. Several criteria were used in the site
                     selection process including, but not limited to, the proximity of a
                     measurement site to sensitive land uses as well as its proximity to
                     significant noise generators. To provide noise measurement coverage of
                     the area, measurement sites were chosen within the confines of the City
                     and its sphere of influence. Measurement locations were selected
                     throughout the City. The measurement locations are depicted in Exhibit
                     NS-3.
                     Noise measurements were made of the short-term Leq values. These
                     measurements provide a short ‘snapshot’ view of the noise environment.
                     The noise measurements were made at a normal receptor height of about
                     five (5) feet above the ground. Measurements were made on May 20, 21
                     and 22, 2009. The measurements were made with a Brüel & Kjaer Type
                     2260 Sound Level Meter, and calibrated on a regular basis. These noise
                     measurement systems meet the American National Standards Institute
                     “Type 1” specifications, which is the most accurate for community noise
                     measurements. The meter and calibrator have current certification
                     traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
                     The results of the noise measurements are shown in Exhibits NS-4 through
                     NS-6. These figures also depict the date and time of the measurement.
                     The cause of the loudest event is identified and the most predominant
                     noise source(s) are identified. The quantities measured were the
                     Equivalent Noise Level (Leq), the maximum noise level (Lmax) and the
                     minimum noise levels (Lmin).

                                                                            NOISE
                         The data presented are intended to identify noise levels over a broad range
                         of sites within and around the City and are not an assessment of impacts at
                         these sites. In almost all cases, the major sources of noise are motor
                         vehicles. The noise levels measured cover a wide range of noise exposure
                         throughout the City. The quietest environment was on a road well away
                         from any major noise sources, where noise levels were often below thirty
                         (30) dBA. The loudest environments were those areas where buses and
                         trucks were present, causing noise levels into the low to mid eighties (80s)
                         dBA range. In general, aircraft noise, industrial noise and commercial
                         noise sources did not contribute significantly to the noise levels measured.
                         (A detailed discussion of the noise measurement results can be found in
                         the noise assessment prepared for the General Plan update.)
Sources of Noise
                         The main source of noise in Twentynine Palms is motor vehicle traffic.
                         Other sources of noise in the City that can be of concern include aircraft.
                         Industrial and commercial sources probably add to the noise environment
                         on an intermittent basis. While we observed industrial and commercial
                         activities, none were generating significant levels of noise during our
                         observations.
                         Access to the City of Twentynine Palms is primarily by Twentynine Palms
                         Highway (State Route 62). This highway, which runs in an east west
                         direction, is the major source of noise in the City. Adobe Road services
                         the downtown area and the military facility to the north. Adobe Road is
                         the main north south roadway in the City. Other roadways in the City that
                         are significant noise sources include Utah Trail, Lear Avenue, Mesquite
                         Springs Road, 2 Mile Road and Amboy Road.
                         Noise from commercial land uses can be a problem. Noise is generated by
                         parking areas, delivery trucks and music from bars and restaurants, and
                         can impact nearby residents. Currently this does not appear to be a
                         problem, but as the City continues to develop it is likely that conflicts
                         between these uses will arise.

      NOISE
        Aircraft noise in the City generally is the result of either general aviation
        operations or military overflights originating from or destined to the
        Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center (Marine Base). Twentynine
        Palms Airport is located within the City’s Sphere of Influence, two (2)
        miles east of the City. It is open to public use and is classified by the
        Federal Aviation Administration as a Category B, Group 1 airport.
        There are two (2) paved, lighted runways; the east/west runway is 75 feet
        wide and 5,531 feet long. The north/south runway is 50 feet wide and
        3,797 feet long.
        There are several private landing strips or airports in the vicinity that
        provide for private aviation needs. These facilities include:
               Cones Field, located east of Adobe Road, south of Amboy Road.
                Cones Field has three (3) unpaved, unlighted runways; the longest
                is 1,400 feet in length.
               Crosswinds Airport, located just outside the City’s easterly limits,
                south of Amboy Road on the west side of Prairie Dog Avenue.
                Crosswinds Airport has two (2) unpaved, unlighted runways; the
                longest is 2,500 feet in length.
               Dale Sky Ranch, located along Bullion Mountain Road, north of
                Amboy Road. Two (2) graded runways, the longest is 3,500 feet
                in length, has a partial concrete surface.
               Bauer, located north of the City. It has one (1) dirt runway that is
                1,300 feet in length.
        Noise emanating from aircraft is regulated through Federal and State
        regulations. Federal regulation is through the Environmental Protection
        Agency (EPA), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the
        Department of Transportation (DOT).

                                                                             NOISE
                         The Twentynine Palms Expeditionary Airfield (EAF), located aboard
                         Marine Base (outside the City limits), is for military aviation only. The
                         Airfield has one (1) 8,015 foot, aluminum matting runway. The EAF's
                         runway and facilities are adjacent to Camp Wilson and are the site of
                         military aircraft operations associated with training exercises. The EAF is
                         the largest expeditionary airfield operated by the Marine Corps. The
                         runway can accommodate the largest aircraft in the military inventory.
                         The runways, taxiways and aircraft parking areas are constructed entirely
                         of AM-2 aluminum matting. The EAF is a full service airfield, providing
                         essential services required for flight operations in an austere expeditionary
                         environment. A Military Operations Area (MOA) for the base extends
                         south from the base to about Indian Trail. A MOA simply is a type of
                         Special Use Airspace (SUA) that warns private pilots that military aircraft
                         commonly perform local operations in this area.
                         None of the aircraft facilities discussed above have sufficient operations to
                         generate noise contours (in terms of the CNEL noise scale) that would
                         extend into the City or impact noise sensitive land uses. However, persons
                         located near these facilities, particularly the military facility, could
                         experience an occasional loud overflight and or periods of intensive
                         aircraft activity. During the noise measurement program, no significantly
                         loud aircraft operations were measured or observed.
Noise Contours
                         The noise contours for the City of Twentynine Palms are presented in
                         Exhibits NS-7 and NS-8 for existing and future conditions, respectively.
                         (Wall size exhibits are also available for viewing at the City and additional
                         shape files were provided to the City to be used in the GIS/Land Use
                         Mapping system.) The existing contours are based on the existing
                         conditions of traffic volumes and other sources of noise in the community.
                         The future contours represent the buildout of the proposed General Plan.

      NOISE
        The noise contours were generated using a mathematical model developed
        by the Federal Highway Administration ("FHWA Highway Traffic Noise
        Prediction Model," FHWA-RD-77-108, December 1978 including the
        noise characteristics of a typical California population of motor vehicles as
        published by Caltrans - Calveno Noise Curve). The FHWA model uses
        traffic volume, vehicle mix, average vehicle speed, roadway geometry and
        sound propagation path characteristics to predict hourly A-weighted Leq
        values adjacent to a road. Vehicle mix is reported in terms of the number
        of automobiles, medium trucks and heavy trucks. The truck categories are
        defined in the FHWA model by number of axles and weight. Caltrans
        conducts periodic traffic counts on freeways and publishes them on the
        internet (www.dot.ca.gov/hq/traffops/saferesr/trafdata/).
        Noise contours represent lines of equal noise exposure, just as the contour
        lines on a topographic map are lines of equal elevation. The contours
        shown on the map are the 55, 60, 65 and 70 dB CNEL noise level. The
        noise contours presented can be used as a guide for land use planning.
        The 55 CNEL contour defines the Noise Referral Zone. This is the noise
        level for which noise considerations should be included when making land
        use policy decisions.
        The contours presented in this report are a graphic representation of the
        noise environment. Topography and intervening buildings or barriers
        have a very complex effect on the propagation of noise. To present a
        worst-case estimate, the topographic effect is not included in these
        contours to present a worst-case projection.               However, most of
        Twentynine Palms is relatively flat and the topographic effects are
        minimal. Exhibit NS-7 presents the CNEL noise contours for existing
        conditions and Exhibit NS-8 presents estimated contours for buildout
        conditions.

AREAS OF CONCERN
                         The City of Twentynine Palms currently has very low noise levels typical
                         of a rural area. The City adopted a Noise Plan of the General Plan Noise
                         Element in 2002. The document provided a minimal description of
                         existing and future noise levels in the City, but did not provide a
                         comprehensive set of Goals, Policies and Programs. The City is expected
                         to grow considerably in the upcoming years and with that growth will
                         come additional traffic noise and other noise associated with higher
                         density development. The main focus of this Noise Element is to insure
                         that proper programs are in place to minimize noise impacts in the ensuing
                         years. The process of updating the Noise Element included a review of
                         existing City policies concerning environmental noise and identifying
                         additional programs that will be needed. A review of the key noise issues
                         facing the City follows.
                         City Noise Standards. The traffic noise levels and other sources of noise
                         will increase considerably in future years. Noise standards are designed to
                         insure that new sensitive land uses are designed and constructed so that the
                         noise environment will be acceptable for that land use. For example, most
                         cities have an outdoor noise standard for rear yards of single-family
                         residential uses of 65 CNEL. This requires that when new residences are
                         constructed that soundwalls, berms, setbacks or other features be used that
                         will result in the rear yards meeting a 65 CNEL noise level now and for
                         future traffic projections. Currently, the City does not have any noise
                         standards, which are normally contained in the Noise Element of the
                         General Plan. The City does have some “desired maximum noise levels”
                         (Table 1 of the 2002 Noise Plan), but they fall short of being
                         implementable standards. (Noise standards should not be confused with
                         the noise regulations contained in the Municipal Code.) The City does
                         enforce the State Building Code (Chapter 12, Section 1208A) which
                         requires that “new hotels, motels, dormitories, apartment houses and
                         dwellings other than detached single-family dwellings” be designed and
                         constructed so as to achieve an indoor noise level of 45 CNEL or less
                         when constructed and at least ten (10) years into the future.
City of Twentynine Palms General Plan 2012                                                            NS-29

      NOISE
        The standard protects these dwellings from exterior noise sources such as
        highways, county roads, city streets, railroads, rapid transit lines, airports
        and industrial areas. Cities are allowed to develop noise standards for
        other uses as they see fit.
        In addition to protecting new construction from obtrusive noise levels,
        City noise standards also provide criteria by which to evaluate the impact
        of new projects on existing residential areas and other noise sensitive
        areas. For example, assume that the City adopts a 65 CNEL for residential
        land uses. If a new project is proposed which will generate significant
        traffic, it can be determined if the 65 CNEL level will or will not be
        exceeded at existing residential areas. If exceeded, then the project would
        be determined to have a significant impact without further mitigation.
        Programs 1.1.8 and 1.1.9 (see Section 5.0) propose standards for
        residential and other land uses. These standards ensure that new
        developments will be adequately protected from noise, and provide a
        consistent criteria with which to assess certain impacts generated by new
        projects.
        Noise Compatibility Guidelines. The City currently has a set of Noise
        Compatibility Guidelines which are presented later as Exhibit NS-9. The
        guidelines identify the general acceptability of noise exposures for various
        land use categories in the City. The guidelines are based on the State of
        California “General Plan Guidelines.” It should be noted that the
        compatibility guidelines are simply guidelines, and do not represent
        standards.     The guidelines provide an initial evaluation of the
        compatibility between a land use and noise environment.
        Noise Ordinance. Residential land uses and areas identified as noise
        sensitive must be protected from excessive noise from non-transportation
        sources including commercial activities, construction noise, late-night
        entertainment, spa and pool equipment and air-conditioner noise to name a
        few.      These impacts are most effectively controlled through the
        enforcement of an effective City Noise Ordinance. A noise ordinance is
        designed to control noise generated on private property and impacting
        another parcel of property. A noise ordinance is not designed to control
        traffic on public streets, aircraft noise, train noise and other public
        transportation noise. The noise ordinance is part of the Municipal Code,
        and is not contained in the Noise Element of the General Plan. However,
        as part of a Noise Element update the noise ordinance is often reviewed

                                                                           NOISE
                         and recommendations made for changes if needed.             The key noise
                         ordinance related issues are discussed below.
                         Currently the City does not have a noise ordinance, but does have a few
                         sections of the Municipal Code that addresses noise. The Municipal Code
                         only contains a few sections that limit noise. Chapter 8.01 – Limits noise
                         for pets and kennels to levels that are not “excessive” or “offensive.”
                         Chapter 10.01 – Hazardous Waste Facility Siting requires an analysis of
                         noise for the siting of these facilities. Chapter 10.04 – Solid Waste
                         Collection and Disposal Services requires that collection equipment not
                         exceed seventy-five (75) dBA at a distance of twenty-five (25) feet from
                         the collection truck. Chapter 12.16 – Skateboards and Other Wheeled
                         Toys prohibits persons from causing “loud or unreasonable noises” when
                         skateboarding. The Municipal Code does not contain specifically a Noise
                         Ordinance that would provide more comprehensive protection from any
                         noise source generated on private property. Many communities have
                         developed Noise Ordinances based on the California Model Noise
                         Ordinance. It contains specific noise limits that are enforceable. Program
                         1.2.4 would require the development of a Noise Ordinance.
                         Construction Noise. Construction noise is commonly addressed in a noise
                         ordinance. Currently the municipal code limits the hours and days of
                         week that construction can occur to 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. excluding Sundays
                         and Federal holidays. During the summer months, May through
                         September, construction activities are allowed to begin at 6 a.m.
                         Military Overflights. A Military Operations Area (MOA) for the
                         MCGCC extends south from the base to about Indian Trail. A MOA
                         simply is a Special Use Airspace (SUA) that warns private pilots that
                         military aircraft commonly perform local operations in this area.
                         Operations in this area are not so frequent that a significant noise impact
                         occurs, but rather high levels of aircraft noise can occasionally occur
                         which are startling to residents and business owners. The military has
                         been requesting on some new developments that proper notifications
                         should be given by the City to the new owners to avoid conflicts. A
                         notification program for new developments is a common method for
                         reducing noise conflicts, and a notification program would be beneficial
                         both to the military and City.
City of Twentynine Palms General Plan 2012                                                           NS-31

               NOISE
      FINDINGS
                 The predominant noise sources in Twentynine Palms, as in many other
                 communities, come from traffic noise. Twentynine Palms Highway and
                 arterial roadways expose the City to varying noise levels. Aircraft
                 operating in the area are not a consistent, major contributor of noise in the
                 area, but can cause intermittent high levels. Similarly, industrial noise in
                 the City is minimal and isolated from noise sensitive receptors.
                 Noise affects all types of land uses and activities, although some are more
                 sensitive to high noise levels than others. Land uses identified as noise
                 sensitive include residences of all types, hospitals, rest homes, places of
                 worship and schools.
                 As described in Section 1.4, the noise environment for Twentynine Palms
                 can be described using noise contours developed for the major noise
                 sources within the City. The noise contours are used to identify areas of
                 existing or potential noise impacts. The contours are developed for
                 existing conditions and future buildout conditions. The 55, 60, 65, and 70
                 CNEL contour levels are shown. Any existing or proposed land use
                 within a 65 CNEL contour should be considered for noise mitigation
                 programs. For example, within the 55 CNEL contour, which represents a
                 "Noise Referral Zone," any proposed noise sensitive land use should be
                 evaluated on a project specific basis and the project may require
                 mitigation to meet City or State standards. The 65 CNEL represents zones
                 where residential development should be carefully reviewed to ensure that
                 proper mitigation is included as part of the project to ensure that no private
                 outdoor yard or patio areas are exposed to noise levels above 65 CNEL.
                 The sources of noise in Twentynine Palms can be divided into two (2)
                 basic categories, transportation sources and non-transportation sources. A
                 local government has little direct control of transportation noise at the
                 source because of preemption by the State and Federal Government. State
                 and Federal agencies have the responsibility to control the noise from the
                 source, such as vehicle noise emission levels. The most effective method
                 the City has to mitigate transportation noise is through reducing the impact
                 of the noise onto the community. Measures that can be used to reduce
                 noise include, but are not limited to noise barriers, land use planning, site
                 design review, circulation improvements and truck access restrictions.
NS-32                                                    City of Twentynine Palms General Plan 2012
                                                                            NOISE
                         Mitigation through the design and construction of a noise barrier (wall,
                         berm or combination wall/berm) is the most common way of alleviating
                         traffic noise impacts for new development. The effect of a noise barrier is
                         critically dependent on the geometry between the noise source and the
                         receiver. A noise barrier’s effect occurs when the "line of sight" between
                         the source and receiver is penetrated by the barrier. A greater penetration
                         results in a greater noise reduction. It is difficult and often impossible to
                         retrofit such noise barriers into existing neighborhoods. Most of the
                         homes in developed areas have curb cut access from the roadway making
                         noise barrier construction impractical or impossible (a space in the noise
                         barrier for the curb cut access would render the noise barrier ineffective).
                         The Land Use/Noise Compatibility Matrix shown in Exhibit NS-9 is used
                         in the land planning stage of the development process. It is used to
                         identify project opportunities and constraints. In conjunction with the
                         Noise Contour Maps (Exhibits NS-7 and NS-8), this matrix may be used
                         to determine whether a certain type of land use is appropriate in a
                         particular CNEL zone. For example, a residential use in a 60-70 CNEL
                         zone would only be appropriate with certain mitigation. This matrix is
                         particularly helpful to assist in the layout and design of large mixed-use
                         projects because it identifies the noise sensitivities of various land use
                         types. Such consideration permits the location and layout of noise
                         sensitive uses in lower noise exposure areas.
                         Interior and Exterior Noise Standards are recommended and are shown in
                         Table NS-2. These standards are the actual design standards to be used in
                         the project design stage. Compliance with these standards should be
                         required in the Conditions of Approval or other project requirements and
                         evaluated as part of City Development Review and Building Permit plan
                         check.
                         The most effective method to control community noise impacts from non-
                         transportation noise sources is through application of the Community
                         Noise Ordinance. The City of Twentynine Palms has some noise
                         restrictions within the Municipal Code, but does not have a comprehensive
                         Noise Ordinance. A Noise Ordinance is designed to protect quiet
                         residential areas from noise sources on private property. The noise levels
                         encouraged by an ordinance are usually typical of a quiet residential area.
                         A new program (Program 1.2.4) has been included in the Noise Element to
                         develop a Noise Ordinance.

        The following goal is established for the Noise Element. To facilitate the
        goal, implementation policies are established.
         Minimize Noise Impact
                           Noise levels will be addressed prior to the
                           City taking actions on land use proposals
          Goal NS-1        and potential conflicts will be avoided or
                           mitigated so that noise levels will not
                           exceed acceptable levels.
                           Noise generation impacts will be considered prior to
                           any land use designation change and/or any land use
                           intensification and uses will be located in a manner
                           that minimizes noise impacts. Prior to approval of
                           projects, which may result in significant noise
                           pollution, the City will require noise analysis to
          Implementation ensure that noise levels do not exceed acceptable
          Policy NS-1.1    levels as defined by the City’s Development Code.
                           The City will require special design standards for
                           proposed projects with the potential to exceed the
                           noise level requirements. In cases where special
                           design standards are required, the City will require
                           mitigation plans to be certified by a registered
                           acoustician.
                           The City will limit the establishment of land uses in
          Implementation

PURPOSE
                         While the General Plan State guidelines provide for the discussion of
                         recreation policies within the Open Space Element, the guidelines allow
                         for them to be provided for in a separate element. Because of the
                         importance of recreation activities to the City of Twentynine Palms, the
                         City has chosen to prepare and adopt a separate Recreation Element as
                         part of its General Plan.
                         This Recreation Element provides the background for and details the
                         City’s plans to provide parks and other recreational resources for its
                         residents. The City recognizes that recreation is an important aspect
                         contributing to the economic prosperity, quality of life and environmental
                         sustainability of the Twentynine Palms community.
                         Parks, open spaces and recreation facilities significantly contribute to the
                         economic prosperity of the community by increasing adjacent property
                         values, as well as improving the attractiveness of the community. Other
                         important socio-economic benefits as a result of parks include business
                         relocation into the area, improvement of physical health, prevention of
                         crime and social interaction in the community.
                         Improving human development and the quality of life of residents is
                         another important benefit that parks and recreation can provide to the
                         community. It encourages and promotes an active lifestyle in communities
                         in response to the growing issues of obesity-related illnesses. Parks also
                         provide a sense of place for social events and interaction that strengthens
                         communities by bringing its residents closer which helps to reduce crime
                         and improve student success in school.
                         Parks contribute to environmental sustainability by preserving natural
                         open space and habitat areas, as well as providing for natural processes
                         such as providing clean air, gather and filter rainwater for groundwater
                         aquifer recharge and support flood control measures.

     RECREATION
       This element will identify the broader issues upon which the City bases its
       recreational goals and policies in order to continue to provide recreational
       activities and facilities for Twentynine Palms.
       The purpose of this Recreation Element is to provide the public, decision
       makers and staff a guide to implementing policies to continue the current
       trend of providing excellent recreational facilities and programs to the
       Twentynine Palms community. This element is intended to help mitigate
       the conflict between the population and the provision of recreational
       activities and facilities, a conflict which has challenged the City to develop
       policies that will better provide for recreation opportunities as the City
       continues to develop.

BACKGROUND
RELATIONSHIP TO STATE LAW
                         California Government Code Section 65302(e) requires all cities and
                         counties to adopt a General Plan for the physical development of the City,
                         and requires certain elements to be addressed within the plan. Recreation
                         is not a mandatory element that needs to be addressed within the General
                         Plan, however, the creation of optional elements are permitted. The City of
                         Twentynine Palms believes that recreation is a vital component of the
                         community and that it warrants its own element in the General Plan.
RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
                         This Recreation Element is directly related to other elements of this
                         General Plan, most specifically the Land Use, Circulation and Open Space
                         Element. It covers a variety of issues like land use designations for parks,
                         recreation and open space areas (Land use Element); planning for trail
                         networks (Circulation Element); and, preserving areas of environmental
                         and recreational significance (Open Space Element). Recreation issues
                         have a direct influence on policies and programs in these other elements of
                         this General Plan.
                         Table RE-1 shows the relationship and coordination of this Recreation
                         Element to the Other Elements of this General Plan.

AREAS OF CONCERN
                         The City of Twentynine Palms has 175 acres of recreational opportunities
                         made up of parks, special use areas and passive use areas provided by
                         different sources including the City of Twentynine Palms, the Morongo
                         School District and the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center. The
                         demand for these facilities is analyzed in this element in order to
                         determine the current and future supply of recreational opportunities in the
                         City. This element also discusses planned park and facilities
                         improvements to ensure enhanced recreation opportunities throughout the
                         City.
RECREATIONAL INVENTORY
                         Parks and recreation facilities provide opportunities for people to exercise
                         and enjoy outdoor activities. It is important that the City continues to
                         provide for park and recreation uses to keep up with the demands of a
                         growing population. Recreational parks, facilities and activities in the City
                         are provided by different organizations, each with the common goal to
                         make available recreational opportunities for the Twentynine Palms
                         community. This section explores the existing recreational parks, facilities
                         and activities provided by these organizations.
City of Twentynine Palms
                         Administration of the City’s parks and recreation services was taken over
                         by the City of Twentynine Palms and assumed ownership of all park
                         districts in 1993. Parks and recreation services in Twentynine Palms are
                         coordinated by the Community Services Department, which is charged
                         with administering recreation programs and working with the Public
                         Works Department to ensure that parks are developed and maintained.
                         The City’s existing recreational facilities and parks are located throughout
                         Twentynine Palms (Exhibit RE-1), with each type of park serving a
                         different function and providing a wide range of recreation experience.

     RECREATION
          Community Park - Community parks provide active and
           structured recreation opportunities, as well as passive and non-
           organized opportunities, for individuals and families. Community
           parks include facilities that attract people from throughout the
           community, and generally require support facilities such as parking
           and restrooms. These types of parks often have sports fields or
           similar facilities as a central focus of the park, and vary in size
           from five (5) acres to twenty plus (20+) acres.
          Neighborhood Park - Neighborhood parks provide non-
           supervised, non-organized recreation opportunities. These types of
           parks are generally small in size and are intended to serve nearby
           residents for local residential needs. The sizes of these parks
           generally range between one (1) and five (5) acres.
          Special Use Areas - Special Use Areas are defined as stand-alone
           recreation sites designed to support a specific, specialized use.
           Some of the facilities in this classification are sports field
           complexes, community centers, senior centers, aquatic centers and
           public plazas.
          Passive Use Areas - These areas are intended to preserve local
           environments, native vegetation and unique physical formations.
           These areas may include passive recreational amenities such as
           walking trails, cycling trails, trail heads, rest areas and vista
           viewing points.
          Undeveloped Land - This is land owned by the City which has
           been planned for future park use.

                         Parks – The City has five (5) parks ranging in various sizes and
                         recreational activities. Luckie Park (27-acre) is the biggest and most used
                         park in the City. Knotts Sky Park (19-acre) and Pioneer Park (18-acre) are
                         the next largest, with Pioneer Park being partially developed. Bucklin Park
                         (0.4-acre) and Veteran’s Park (6.4-acre) are the smallest parks in the City.
                         Sizes and amenities found at each recreational facility are illustrated in
                         Table RE-2.

      RECREATION
        Scenic Resources - The City of Twentynine Palms has numerous natural
        and man-made scenic resources that create and define the attractiveness
        and diversity of the City. A combination of scenic highways, open space
        lands, scenic and panoramic view sheds and desert landscape are such
        natural features that are inherent in the City. The City also has man-made
        scenic attractions that enhance the scenic value of the community. The
        Oasis of Murals program consists of painting historical and cultural murals
        on the facades of community walls and buildings in the City. The overall
        success of the murals have significantly increased the aesthetics in the
        area, as well as promoting historical and cultural awareness, and spurred
        downtown revitalization and economic growth through increased tourism
        and business. The program created by Action Council for 29 Palms, Inc,
        has currently completed twenty-five 25 murals.
        Trails – The use of trails for recreation and travel provide the residents of
        Twentynine Palms a sustainable alternative method of transportation
        between important areas in the City. Trails provide a necessary connection
        between people and recreational facilities and areas of interest. They also
        provide opportunities for passive recreational activities. Trails can be
        developed along travel corridors to establish alternate modes of
        transportation. They can also be developed along rivers, streams, washes
        and similar open space amenities to promote passive recreation, and
        preserve and utilize natural scenic areas. The selection of trails should be
        developed as a network and used to connect popular destinations. The
        network should allow for exercising as well as transportation and should
        take advantage of natural features in the City. Trail activities were
        identified as one of the more popular forms of recreation in the City by
        walkers, hikers, equestrians, joggers, and bicyclists. As such, the City has
        provided an integrated trail system comprising of multi-purpose,
        pedestrian, equestrian and bicycle trails that provides for a safe and
        convenient alternative mode of transportation around town (Exhibit RE-2).
        Identified on the trails plan are important connection routes used for
        commuting and other forms of recreational activity (Exhibit RE-2). These
        trails are significant and important everyday routes and corridors that are
        used to connect people to destinations. The proposed corridors provide a
        contiguous environment for recreational users to move from one
        destination to another. Exhibit RE-2 identifies five (5) significant
        connections in the City;
                Base-Park Connection,

                         Route to School” program. This program provides a safe and convenient
                         path of travel for students to walk or ride to and from school. The Safe
                         Routes trails are located in center portion of the City and directly connect

                                                              RECREATION
Joshua Tree National Park (Federal)
                         Joshua Tree National Park is located on the southern boundary of the City.
                         The park was declared a National Park in 1994 by Congress, and had been
                         a National Monument since 1936. The park encompasses approximately
                         800,000 acres and has over one million visitors a year. The park appeals to
                         diverse groups offering many different forms of recreational activities
                         such as nature walks, hiking, mountain biking, horseback riding, camping,
                         rock climbing, bird watching and educational programs. Along with the
                         park’s headquarters and visitor’s center, park facilities also include nine
                         (9) campgrounds with tables, fire pits and toilets. There are three (3)
                         primary entrances to the park, one of which is located in Twentynine
                         Palms on Utah Trail. Direct access to the park from the City greatly
                         increases the recreational opportunities provided for the residents of
                         Twentynine Palms.
Bureau of Land Management (Federal)
                         The Bureau of Land Management has extensive holdings in the
                         Twentynine Palms area, much of which is open for uses such as camping
                         and wildlife watching. Off-road vehicle access is specifically allowed at
                         the Bureau’s Johnson Valley site, near Yucca Valley. The Bureau also
                         owns more than 200 acres of undeveloped land within the City limits and
                         north of Joshua Tree National Park.
Other
                         Located within the region of the City are the San Bernardino National
                         Forest, Mojave National Preserve and Mount San Jacinto State Park.
                         These natural areas provide a scenic environment for passive forms of
                         recreation for the residents of Twentynine Palms which includes hiking,
                         camping and nature watching.

                  RECREATION
      RECREATION NEEDS
                     It is not only important to provide adequate recreation facilities for the
                     present population in Twentynine Palms, it is vital that park and recreation
                     areas are planned and set aside for based on the projected needs of the
                     future population. A Recreation Needs Assessment has been prepared as
                     part of the General Plan Update which identifies the community’s demand
                     for recreation opportunities. These recreation needs are defined in terms of
                     parkland standards, geographic service areas, planned facilities, and
                     specific individual facilities. These needs are addressed in the following
                     sections.
      Parkland Needs
                     It is important for the City to continue to provide diverse recreational
                     opportunities for the residents of the City of Twentynine Palms. The
                     community needs for parks was determined by evaluating the current level
                     of service provided within the City, identifying gaps in service and
                     recommending a level of service that meets public expectations. The 1975
                     Quimby Act authorizes jurisdictions to require developers to set aside land
                     for open space or pay in-lieu fees for park improvements. The goal of the
                     Quimby Act is to require developers to help mitigate the impacts of
                     property improvements. This ensures that jurisdictions adopt Quimby Act
                     standards and provide three to five (3 to 5) acres of open space per 1,000
                     persons. The City’s existing General Plan park standard is four (4) acres of
                     parkland per 1,000 persons. The goal of the City’s Parks and Recreation
                     Master Plan 2008 is to maintain the level of service of 4.2 acres of
                     parkland per 1,000 persons, and strive for a level of service of 4.8 acres of
                     parkland per 1,000 persons.
                     The City currently has 174.9 acres of parkland, which includes parks,
                     special use areas, undeveloped parkland sites and a park ratio of 4.2 acres
                     of parkland per 1,000 persons. Based on the goals and policies of this
                     General Plan, the City and surrounding areas have an excess amount of
                     parkland for present use (Table RE-4). The City will start experiencing a
                     reduction in parkland per resident in the near future, and will need to find
                     an alternate source of parkland funding to keep up with the growing
                     population and its need for additional parks. Currently, the City does not
                     have a park fee collection program that is used to acquire additional
                     parkland.

Service Areas
                         It is not only important to provide recreational opportunities to the City,
                         but it is vital that recreational opportunities are easily and equally
                         accessible by all in the community. The Needs Assessment analyzed how
                         successful the existing parks were serving the residents of Twentynine
                         Palms, with the criteria of providing parks within two (2) miles of every
                         resident. It was identified that Highway 62 and Adobe Road are significant
                         barriers for park access, and that Luckie Park and Knott’s Sky Park serve
                         most of the developed portions of the City. Portions of the City that are
                         not being served include the southeast and northeast areas. In addition,
                         parks will be needed on the west side of the City in anticipation of serving
                         new planned developments in that area.
Planned Facilities
                         New parks are proposed in order to serve those residents in the City who
                         have difficulty accessing nearby parks and also to serve the projected
                         future growth of the City. The City’s Master Plan of Parks and Recreation
                         has identified five (5) potential future park sites and one (1) special use
                         area that will provide access to park facilities for the entire community
                         (Exhibit RE-4). The recommendations for the facilities to be provided at
                         each of these future park areas are described in Table RE-5.

Improvements
                         The City provides a diverse range of recreational facilities. However, as
                         the population continues to grow in the City, there will be an
                         intensification of the level of service on these facilities. In addition to
                         building new parks to keep up with the demand for recreational
                         opportunities, the Twentynine Palms Parks and Recreation Master Plan
                         outlines several upgrades and expansions to the existing recreational
                         infrastructure. This is divided into parks and recreational facilities.

            RECREATION
      Parks
              Luckie Park – Serving as a community hub for the City, Luckie Park is
              the oldest and most developed park in the City. Most of the City’s
              recreational programs and activities occur at this park. The aim is to
              reduce the demand of recreational activities on this park to alleviate
              overcrowding, and spread park demand among other park sites. Upgrading
              the facilities at this park includes:
                     On-going improvements so the park remains the centerpiece of the
                      community park system.
                     Planting of new trees to add to the existing tree canopy system in
                      the park will help provide shade in the future.
                     Adding new aquatic elements to the swimming pool such as a
                      water slide or water play area.
              Knott’s Sky Park – As the second largest developed park in the City,
              Knott’s Sky Park is planned for additional recreational amenities to help
              alleviate recreational demand at Luckie Park. Some of the improvements
              planned for this site include:
                     Upgrading the baseball/softball fields.
                     Provide permanent restrooms.
                     Scheduling community events.
                     Horseshoe pits.
                     Skate park.
                     Basketball courts.
                     Tennis courts.
                     Soccer fields.
                     Trail system.

                         Pioneer Park – Most of Pioneer Park is undeveloped with the only
                         developed portion of the park being used by Theatre 29. The vision of the
                         site is to develop it as a center for community and regional activity. Plans
                         for this site include:
                                 Continued use by Theatre 29 for their community plays and
                                  activities.
                                 Prepare a feasibility study outlining potential park uses.
                         Veteran’s Park – Located between City Hall and the County Library, this
                         site contains few recreational amenities. The vision for this site is to serve
                         as a community gathering place and be integrated with the civic center.
                         Improvements to this site include:
                                 Plaza areas for community events.
                                 Shaded turf areas.
                                 Public art.
                                 Interactive water feature or fountain.
                         Bucklin Park – Bucklin Park serves as a focus to the downtown business
                         area. Strategies to encourage usage of the park includes outdoor
                         programming options with local businesses and arts groups, and the
                         provision of paved parking and restroom facilities.
Recreational Facilities
                         Indoor Facilities – There is a huge demand for an indoor recreation center
                         given the location of the City and the extreme outdoor temperature it
                         experiences. A multi-purpose indoor center is ideal as the space for indoor
                         gymnasiums in the City for both recreation activities and community
                         programs are becoming extremely limited. Such activities that could take
                         place in this facility include; dance, fitness, flexible classroom space,
                         indoor sports, social gathering and social programs. A proposed location
                         for this facility could be established at the existing Community Services
                         building site. In addition, senior and youth programs can be tailored into
                         this new center, and the existing centers repurposed.
City of Twentynine Palms General Plan 2012                                                              RE-29

      RECREATION
        Community Pool Facilities – Due to the extreme high temperatures there
        is a need to stay cool in the City. The implementation of aquatic features
        like splash pads and interactive fountains at parks, and water play features
        and slides at existing swimming pools, would provide comfort and relief
        for those recreating outdoors. The City should upgrade the swimming pool
        at Luckie Park, and water playgrounds in new community parks and
        Veteran’s Park to incorporate desired aquatic play opportunities.
        Sports Fields and Courts – The need for sports fields and courts in the
        City stems from the evolving and growing nature of field sports that
        residents are involved in including basketball, baseball, softball, soccer
        and football. Meeting this need will require large amounts of contiguous
        land in order to continue to provide for sporting facilities that caters to the
        City’s diverse recreational activities. The two (2) main outdoor sports in
        the City are baseball/softball and soccer/football. In part of keeping up
        with the growing demand of these sports, the City should:
                Continue to provide sporting leagues and programs for both youth
                 and adults.
                Provide fields for the population (1 per 4,600 people for
                 baseball/softball, 1 per 6,900 people for soccer/football).
                Fields should be lighted for nighttime use as most of the activities
                 occur at night due to extreme temperatures during the day.
                Continue to provide basketball courts in the design of new parks.
        In addition to outdoor sports, the City has a large demand for indoor sport
        programs and facilities due to the extreme outdoor weather. Such sporting
        programs include youth basketball, arena soccer, volleyball and other
        activities. Due to limited spacing, each of these activities share the indoor
        area and are often limited on time. Expansion or establishing a new indoor
        facility such as the proposed multi-purpose center will help alleviate over-
        crowding at these indoors venues at the Parks and Recreation
        Administration Building and Community Services Building.

                                                                 RECREATION
                         Trails – The only existing trails plan outlined by the City is a bicycle trails
                         map as part of the Circulation Element in the current General Plan. The
                         network provides a limited service mostly around the downtown area and
                         parts connecting the Marine Base and Joshua Tree National Park. The City
                         has recently held public workshops to discuss the overall trails system, and
                         in particular, the addition of a community trails plan that offers designated
                         routes for walking, hiking and equestrian riding. There is an opportunity to
                         provide several community trails in the City, in particular, on Utah Trail
                         that will work in tandem with the existing bicycle trail. This will provide a
                         trail system for both bicyclists and pedestrians that connect the Marine
                         Base at the north end of town, to Joshua Tree National Park on the south
                         end of town. This community path could also serve as a training route for
                         Base related activities. The planning of these community trails should be
                         integrated with the facilities already existing in the City such as parks,
                         schools, Civic Center and other important facilities. In addition, Exhibit
                         RE-2 (Connection Routes), and Exhibit RE-3 (Safe Routes to School)
                         shows proposed trails designed to help facilitate the movement of people
                         through non-motorized forms of transportation throughout the City.
                         Skate Park and Features – Skating is a very popular activity in the City
                         as evidenced by the constant use of skating facilities at Luckie Park. A
                         low-cost alternative to providing a new skate park are skate features such
                         as grind rails, benches or modular ramps, and can be implemented in most
                         recreational setting. Skate parks or features should be strongly considered
                         in the development of new parks.
                         Off-Leash Dog Area – Not all recreational activities require a lot of
                         physical participation. A dog park that is designed to accommodate both
                         dog and owner is an amenity that is overlooked by many communities. An
                         off-leash dog area can be implemented as either a stand-alone facility or as
                         an amenity in a park. An amenity such as this would benefit the dog
                         enthusiast community in the City.
                         Other Facilities - Other recreational facilities that the City should
                         consider are: BMX track facilities, camping facilities taking advantage of
                         the open space areas and Joshua Tree National Park, off-road vehicle
                         facilities and equestrian facilities. Each of these activities has a strong
                         interest within the community and the City should consider implementing
                         these facilities as an addition to a park, or as a stand-alone facility.

               RECREATION
      Programs
                 As stated previously in the Recreation Inventory section of this element,
                 the City has a multitude of recreational programs ranging from sporting
                 activities to educational classes. Approximately 1,000 people participate
                 annually in sports-related programs offered by the Community Services
                 Department and more than 3,000 people participate annually in other types
                 of programs. Space for recreation is often at high demand due to the sheer
                 number of people participating in these programs.
                 Currently the City is experiencing overcrowding in its parks and
                 recreational facilities, in particular Luckie Park and in its indoor
                 recreational facilities. In order to alleviate overcrowding, the City needs to
                 provide additional facilities and programs that will distribute people
                 throughout the community. This would increase the level of enjoyment as
                 people are able to recreate longer as there are less people waiting to use
                 the facility.
                 Similar to the goals and policies for providing recreational facilities and
                 parks to meet the demands of the community, the City should continue to
                 expand and provide recreational programs in response to the needs of the
                 community.

                      Policy RE-1.3        may arise in the future, each opportunity should be

PURPOSE
                         Twentynine Palms’ City Council recognizes that a safe environment is
                         required for building and maintaining a sustainable and prosperous City.
                         While the City cannot be able to prevent many of these hazards from
                         occurring, it can set forth policies that can help reduce or minimize their
                         effects, or that minimize exposure to them. This Safety Element sets forth
                         policies designed to minimize threats from natural and human-caused
                         hazards. By implementing the policies within this Safety Element, the
                         City of Twentynine Palms can also provide timely emergency service
                         delivery and focus on the expansion of such services throughout the City.
                         Section 65302 of the State of California Government Code identifies
                         seven mandatory Elements in a General Plan, including Safety. Section
                         65302 (g) defines the hazards that are required to be identified and
                         addressed. These include:
                            1)       Seismic hazards, including strong ground shaking, surface fault
                                     rupture, and seismically induced ground failure, such as
                                     liquefaction and slope failures;
                            2)       Geologic hazards, including slope instability due to non-seismic
                                     causes, and subsidence;
                            3)       Flood hazards, including storm-induced flooding, inundation
                                     resulting from the failure of water reservoirs, dams, and levees,
                                     and areas vulnerable to flooding after wildfires; and
                            4)       Fire hazards, including both wildland fires and structure fires in
                                     the urban area.
                         Also included within this Element are wind hazards, the management of
                         hazardous materials and policies for dealing with disaster preparedness,
                         response and recovery.

BACKGROUND
RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
                         The Safety Element is written in conjunction with, and is designed to
                         support the other elements of the General Plan, most notably the
                         Conservation/Open Space, and Land Use and Circulation Elements. The
                         Land Use Element limits the range of land uses allowed in hazardous areas
                         so as to reduce the number of people, buildings and infrastructure exposed
                         to risk. The Conservation/Open Space Element identifies and preserves
                         natural open space with the purpose of protecting sensitive environments
                         and preserve natural amenities such as water springs, canyons, washes and
                         the sand dunes in the City. Many of these features worthy of conservation
                         for their biologic and aesthetic value were formed by active, ongoing
                         geomorphic and geologic processes that have the potential to cause
                         damage to the built environment, and are therefore best left undeveloped
                         Table SF-1 identifies the issues discussed in this Safety Element and
                         identifies other elements which include discussions which also address
                         these issues.

AREAS OF CONCERN
SEISMIC HAZARDS
Earthquakes
                         Twentynine Palms, like most of southern California, is located in a
                         seismically active region. Several earthquakes have been felt in the
                         Twentynine Palms region in the last 150 years, since settlers in what is
                         now San Bernardino and Riverside counties started to keep records.
                         Those most strongly felt at Twentynine Palms would include the M6.5
                         Desert Hot Springs earthquake of 1948, the M6.1 Joshua Tree earthquake
                         of 1992, the M7.3 Landers earthquake of 1992, and the M7.1 Hector Mine
                         earthquake of 1999. Two faults that extend through the City, namely the
                         Mesquite Lake and Pinto Mountain faults, have the potential to generate
                         very strong ground shaking in Twentynine Palms.
Ground Shaking
                         Strong ground shaking causes the majority of earthquake damage.
                         Earthquakes are typically classified by the amount of damage reported, or
                         by how strong and how far the shaking was felt. An early measure of
                         earthquake size still used today is the seismic intensity scale, which is a
                         qualitative assessment of an earthquake’s effects at a given location. The
                         most commonly used measure of seismic intensity is called the Modified
                         Mercalli Intensity (MMI) scale, which has 12 damage levels (see Table
                         SF-2).

           None.                                                                        0.0017 – 0.014
      III. Felt quite noticeably indoors, especially on upper floors of buildings, but
           many people did not recognize it as an earthquake. Standing
           automobiles may have rocked slightly. Vibration like passing of truck.
           Duration estimated. Damage potential: None.
     IV. During the day felt indoors by many, outdoors by few. At night some
           awakened. Dishes, windows, doors disturbed; walls made creaking
           sound. Sensation like a heavy truck striking building. Standing               0.014 - 0.039
           automobiles rocked noticeably. Damage potential: None. Perceived
           shaking: Light.
       V. Felt by nearly everyone; many awakened. Some dishes, windows, and
           so on broken; plaster cracked in a few places; unstable objects
           overturned. Disturbances of trees, poles, and other tall objects               0.039-0.092
           sometimes noticed. Pendulum clocks may have stopped. Damage
           potential: Very light. Perceived shaking: Moderate.
     VI. Felt by all; many frightened and ran outdoors. Some heavy furniture
           moved few instances of fallen plaster and damaged chimneys. Damage             0.092 -0.18
           slight. Damage potential: Light. Perceived shaking: Strong.
     VII. Everybody ran outdoors. Damage negligible in buildings of good design
           and construction; slight to moderate in well-built ordinary structures;
           considerable in poorly built or badly designed structures; some chimneys 0.18 - 0.34
           broken. Noticed by persons driving cars. Damage potential: Moderate.
           Perceived shaking: Very strong.

 Modified from Bolt (1999); Wald and others (1999)
                         Seismologists find that the most meaningful factor in determining the size
                         of an earthquake is the amount of energy released when a fault ruptures.
                         This measure is called the seismic moment (abbreviated Mw), and most
                         moderate to large earthquakes today are reported using moment
                         magnitude. Seismic moment scales are logarithmic; thus, each one-point
                         increase in magnitude represents a ten-fold increase in amplitude of the
                         waves as measured at a specific location, and a 32-fold increase in energy.
                         That is, a Richter magnitude 7 earthquake produces 100 times (10 x 10)
                         the ground motion amplitude of a magnitude 5 earthquake. Similarly, a
                         moment magnitude 7 earthquake releases approximately 1,000 times more
                         energy (32 x 32) than a moment magnitude 5 earthquake. Any given
                         earthquake will have one moment and, in principle, one magnitude.

     SAFETY
        The Mesquite Lake fault is thought capable of generating an earthquake of
        magnitude 7.3 if it ruptures with other faults to the north. The Pinto
        Mountain fault is thought capable of generating a magnitude 7.2
        earthquake. An earthquake on either of these two (2) faults would be a
        worst-case scenario for the City. The San Andreas fault is thought capable
        of generating an earthquake of magnitude between 7.2 and 8.0, depending
        on how many segments of the fault rupture together during a single event.
        Given its distance from the City, however, an earthquake on the San
        Andreas fault is not expected to cause substantial damage in Twentynine
        Palms. With the exception of the Eureka Peak and Burnt Mountain faults,
        most other faults within about 62 miles of the City of Twentynine Palms
        can generate earthquakes as large or larger than the Mw 6.7 Northridge
        earthquake, the most-expensive earthquake yet to impact the United
        States.
        Exhibit SF-1 shows the location of those earthquake faults within or near
        the City of Twentynine Palms. Table SF-3 identifies the peak ground
        accelerations and Modified Mercalli intensities anticipated to be measured
        in Twentynine Palms as a result of an earthquake on any of several
        seismic sources (faults).

Surface Fault Rupture
                         The break or fracture between moving blocks of rock is called a fault, and
                         such differential movement produces a fault rupture. Few faults are
                         simple, planar breaks in the Earth. They more often consist of smaller
                         strands, with a similar orientation and sense of movement. A strand is
                         mappable as a single, fairly continuous feature. Sometimes geologists
                         group strands into segments, which are believed capable of rupturing
                         together during a single earthquake. The more extensive the fault, the
                         bigger the earthquake it can produce. Therefore, multi-strand fault
                         ruptures produce larger earthquakes.
                         Two major active faults zoned by the State bisect the City: the Mesquite
                         Lake fault in a southeasterly direction, and the Pinto Mountain fault in a
                         westerly direction. The short Airfield and East Airfield faults in the
                         Marine Base have also been zoned as active. Other active or potentially
                         active faults not yet zoned by the State, including the West and East
                         Bullion Mountain faults, the southern sections of the West Calico, Hidalgo
                         and Copper Mountain faults, and the Dog Wash fault, extend into the
                         Twentynine Palms General Plan area (see Exhibit SF-1). All of these
                         faults are potential sources of strong ground shaking and surface fault
                         rupture.
Ground Failure
                         Earthquake shaking can cause several types of ground failure that can
                         cause substantial damage to the built environment. The most destructive
                         of these failures include liquefaction and slope failure.
                         Liquefaction typically occurs in the uppermost fifty (50) feet of the ground
                         surface, in areas where fine- to medium-grained sandy to silty soils and
                         shallow groundwater occur together. The shaking during a moderate to
                         strong earthquake causes the saturated sediments to behave like a liquid or
                         semi-viscous substance, with total or substantial loss of shear strength.
                         This can cause buildings to topple or sink, pools and underground storage
                         tanks to pop out of the ground, and roads and pipelines to fail as a result of
                         lateal spreading. Lateral spreading, a type of liquefaction-induced failure
                         is the lateral displacement of surficial blocks of soil atop a liquefied layer.
                         Lateral spreads are often described as shallow landslides, with failure
                         typically occurring on gentle slopes with the mass of soil moving down-

      SAFETY
         slope, toward a cut slope or free face such as a river channel or canal.
         Other types of liquefaction-related ground failures include flow failures,
         ground oscillations and ground lurching.
         Liquefaction features have been observed in trenches excavated across
         both the Pinto Mountain and Mesquite Lake faults, in Twentynine Palms.
         Therefore, this hazard has occurred in the City before, and has the
         potential to occur again, during a future earthquake on either of these two
         (2) faults, if shallow groundwater is present. Areas underlain by young,
         unconsolidated sediments where shallow groundwater has been reported
         historically are shown on Exhibit SF-1. Geotechnical studies to evaluate
         the potential for liquefaction-induced differential settlement are
         recommended in these areas. Although groundwater levels have dropped
         significantly in the last three to four decades as a result of water pumping
         from wells, water levels could rise again if several wet years occurred
         back to back, or if the City started to rely on imported water instead.
         Other areas in the City that could be susceptible to liquefaction if the
         groundwater table rises are shown on Figure 4-10 in the Technical
         Background Report. Geotechnical studies to assess the liquefaction-
         susceptibility in these areas may be appropriate prior to the development
         of critical facilities.
         Strong ground shaking can worsen existing unstable slope conditions. The
         most widespread type of earthquake-induced slope failure consists of
         shallow failures involving the surficial soils and the uppermost weathered
         rock in moderate to steep hillside terrain. These are called disrupted soil
         slides. Rockfalls and rock slides are also common on very steep slopes.
         In some areas, the re-activation of deep-seated landslides can also occur.
         A combination of geologic conditions leads to landslide vulnerability.
         These include high seismic potential; rapid uplift and erosion resulting in
         steep slopes and deeply incised canyons; highly fractured and folded rock;
         and rock with inherently weak components, such as silt or clay layers.
         The orientation of the slope with respect to the direction of the seismic
         waves (which can affect the shaking intensity) can also control the
         occurrence of landslides. Ground water conditions at the time of the
         earthquake also play an important role in the development of seismically
         induced slope failures.

                         Given that most of the developed area in the City of Twentynine Palms
                         has low relief, the hazard of seismically induced slope failure in the City
                         proper is low. However, slopes are common in Twentynine Palms’s
                         Sphere of Influence and along some of the City’s edges. In these areas
                         (see Exhibit SF-1), earthquake-induced slope instability could lead to
                         rockfalls with the potential to impact houses or vehicles at the base of the
                         slopes, especially if and as these areas are developed in the future. Slope
                         damage in the San Bernardino Mountains and foothills to the west, outside
                         of the City’s limits, could impact the highways and roads that provide
                         access to Twentynine Palms, with substantial impacts to Twentynine
                         Palms residents and businesses that depend on these roads on a daily basis.
                         Strong ground shaking can also cause the densification of some soils,
                         resulting in local or regional settlement of the ground surface.           Put
                         simply, as loose, granular soils are shaken, the soil grains become more
                         tightly packed, resulting in a reduction of the thickness of the soil column.
                         The resulting differential settlement can damage structures placed atop
                         these sediments, whereas regional settlement can damage pipelines by
                         changing the flow gradient. Areas of Twentynine Palms underlain by
                         young alluvial sediments, aeolian (wind) sediments, and artificial fill may
                         be susceptible to earthquake-induced settlement.
                         Wedges of artificial fill on the sides of natural slopes used to create
                         roadways or level building pads may deform in response to strong ground
                         shaking. Deformation may include ground cracks at the cut/fill contact,
                         differential settlement of the fill wedge, and bulging of the slope face.
                         Deformation of sidehill fills may occur locally in Twentynine Palms,
                         possibly along the approaches to the bridges that extend across the
                         Twentynine Palms Flood Control Channel, and in the hills and mountains
                         in or adjacent to the City, on lots where grading involved the placement of
                         fill to make a level building pad.
                         Ridgetop fissuring and shattering was reported in rugged terrain following
                         the 1971 San Fernando, 1989 Loma Prieta, and 1994 Northridge
                         earthquakes. Structures built on these ridges were damaged severely.
                         Linear, fault-like fissures on ridge crests that make the surf ace look as if it
                         was plowed characterize this phenomenon. Ridgetop shattering may occur
                         locally in the mountains bordering the Twentynine Palms area.

      Tsunami/Seiche
                        A tsunami is a sea wave caused by any large-scale disturbance of the
                        ocean floor that occurs in a short period of time and causes a sudden
                        displacement of water. Given Twentynine Palms’ inland location, the

                        A seiche is defined as a standing wave oscillation in an enclosed or semi-
                        enclosed, shallow to moderately shallow water body or basin. Given the
                        lack of large bodies of water in Twentynine Palms, seiches as a result of
                        ground shaking are not anticipated in the study area. Water in swimming
                        pools is known to slosh during earthquakes, but in most cases, the sloshing
                        does not lead to significant damage.
      GEOLOGIC HAZARDS
      Slope Instability
                        Gravity is an effective geologic agent that alone, or in combination with
                        other agents, such as running water, wears away the topographic highs at
                        the Earth’s surface. Slope failures occur in a variety of forms, and there is
                        usually a distinction made between gross (or “global”) failures and
                        surficial failures. Gross failures include deep-seated or relatively thick
                        slide masses, such as landslides, whereas surficial failures can range from
                        minor soil slips to destructive mud or debris flows. Failures can occur on
                        natural or man-made slopes.
                        Landslides are movements of relatively large landmasses, either as nearly
                        intact bedrock blocks, or as jumbled mixes of bedrock blocks, fragments,
                        debris and soils. Some of the most important factors in slope instability
                        include slope height, slope steepness, shear strength and orientation of
                        weak layers in the underlying geologic unit, as well as pore water
                        pressures. Joints and shears, which weaken the rock fabric, allow
                        penetration of water leading to deeper weathering of the rock along with
                        increased pore pressures, increased plasticity of weak clays, and increased
                        weight of the landmass. For engineering of earth materials, these factors
                        are combined in calculations to determine if a slope meets a minimum
                        safety standard. The generally accepted standard is a factor of safety of
                        1.5 or greater (where 1.0 is equilibrium, and less than 1.0 is failure).
                        Natural slopes, graded slopes or graded/natural slope combinations must

                                                                          SAFETY
                         meet these minimum engineering standards where they impact planned
                         homes, subdivisions or other types of developments.
                         Surficial failures typically occur in drainage swales and in the thick
                         colluvial sediments and deeply weathered bedrock near the base of steep
                         slopes. Surficial failures happen most often during particularly heavy
                         and/or prolonged rainfall. The most common types of surficial instability
                         include slope creep, soil slip, debris flows and rockfalls.
                         Debris flows are the most dangerous and destructive of all types of slope
                         failure. A debris flow (also called mudflow, mudslide and debris
                         avalanche) is a rapidly moving slurry of water, mud, rock, vegetation and
                         debris. Larger debris flows are capable of moving trees, large boulders
                         and even cars. Watersheds that have been recently burned typically yield
                         greater amounts of soil and debris than those that have not burned.
                         Rockfalls are free-falling to tumbling masses of bedrock that have broken
                         off steep canyon walls or cliffs. The debris from repeated rockfalls
                         typically collects at the base of extremely steep slopes in cone-shaped
                         accumulations of angular rock fragments called talus. Rockfalls can
                         happen wherever fractured rock slopes are over steepened by stream
                         erosion or man’s activities. Large boulders that perch precariously on
                         slopes pose a rockfall hazard to areas adjacent to and below these slopes.
                         Rockfalls can occur suddenly and without warning, but are more likely to
                         occur in response to earthquake-induced ground shaking, during periods of
                         intense rainfall, or as a result of man’s activities, such as grading and
                         blasting.
                         The natural hillsides in Twentynine Palms are vulnerable to the types of
                         slope instability mentioned above, mostly in the form of surficial failures.
                         The potential for slope instability to occur in Twentynine Palms is

Compressible, Collapsible and Expansive Soils
                         Compressible soils are typically geologically young (Holocene age)
                         unconsolidated sediments of low density that may compress under the
                         weight of proposed fill embankments and structures. The settlement
                         potential and the rate of settlement in these sediments can vary greatly,
                         depending on the soil characteristics (texture and grain size), natural
                         moisture and density, thickness of the compressible layer(s), the weight of
                         the proposed load, the rate at which the load is applied and drainage. In
                         Twentynine Palms, geologic units that are generally susceptible to this
                         hazard include young alluvium, and the upper, weathered part of older
                         alluvium.
                         Soil collapse (or hydroconsolidation) typically occurs in Holocene-age
                         soils that were deposited in an arid or semi-arid environment. Soils prone
                         to collapse include wind-deposited sands and silts, and alluvial fan or
                         debris flow sediments deposited during flash floods. These soils are
                         typically dry and contain minute pores and voids. The soil particles may
                         be partially supported by clay, silt or carbonate bonds. When saturated,
                         collapsible soils undergo a rearrangement of their grains and a loss of
                         cementation, resulting in substantial and rapid settlement under relatively
                         light loads. An increase in surface water infiltration, such as from
                         irrigation, or a rise in the groundwater table, combined with the weight of
                         a building or structure, can initiate rapid settlement and cause foundations
                         and walls to crack. Typically, differential settlement of structures occurs
                         when landscaping is heavily irrigated in close proximity to the structure’s
                         foundation. The young alluvial fan and aeolian sediments in the
                         Twentynine Palms area are locally susceptible to this hazard due to their
                         granular nature, generally dry condition in their upper section, and as a
                         result of having been deposited rapidly.
                         Expansive clay minerals may occur in fine-grained soils such as silts and
                         clays. These minerals can undergo significant volumetric changes as a
                         result of changes in moisture content. The upward pressures induced by
                         the swelling of expansive soils can have significant harmful effects upon
                         structures and other surface improvements.
                         The valley areas in Twentynine Palms are underlain primarily by silty
                         sand, sand and gravel. Such units typically have a low expansion
                         potential, although pockets of fine-grained expansive soils may occur
City of Twentynine Palms General Plan 2012                                                            SF-19

                   SAFETY
                       within these units. Playa deposits generally contain very fine-grained silts
                       and clays that are likely to be expansive. Silt and clay beds within the
                       older alluvium are potentially expansive. Argillic (secondary clay from
                       weathering) soil profiles that have developed on the older fan deposits
                       probably fall in the moderately expansive range. Volcanic ash deposits,
                       although rare, are present within the older alluvium. This type of material
                       may weather to clays with a very high expansion potential. The rock units
                       in Twentynine Palms are generally not expansive, except where they have
                       been chemically altered (by natural processes), are very weathered, or
                       contain clayey sheared zones.
      Subsidence due to Groundwater Withdrawal
                       Land subsidence is the gradual settling or sinking of the ground surface
                       with little or no horizontal movement. Most ground subsidence is man-
                       induced, typically as a result of fluid (water or oil) extraction by pumping.
                       Ground-surface effects related to regional subsidence can include earth
                       fissures, sinkholes or depressions, and disruption of surface drainage.
                       Damage is generally restricted to structures sensitive to slight changes in
                       elevations, such as canals, levees, underground pipelines and drainage
                       courses; however, significant subsidence can result in damage to wells,
                       buildings, roads, railroads and other improvements. Subsidence due to the
                       overdraft of groundwater can also result in the permanent loss of aquifer
                       storage capacity.
                       In the Twentynine Palms region, groundwater occurs in sediment-filled
                       basins that are floored by crystalline rock, and bounded on their sides by
                       faults or rock – both of which act as barriers to groundwater movement.
                       For the most part, groundwater replenishment (recharge) in the aquifers
                       occurs naturally by infiltration of stormwater runoff that percolates into
                       the alluvial sediments. During the last few decades, the rate of
                       groundwater extraction has exceeded the natural replenishment, resulting
                       in declining water levels and overdraft of the groundwater supply in more
                       densely populated areas. This condition has prompted the development
                       locally of artificial recharge. The closest recharge sites to Twentynine
                       Palms are percolation ponds in the Yucca Valley-Joshua Tree area that
                       receive water from the California Aqueduct via the Morongo Pipeline.
                       Twentynine Palms currently does not import water.

                         Recognizing the potential for declining water levels to induce land
                         subsidence, the United States Geological Survey (USGS), in cooperation
                         with the Mojave Water Agency (MWA), has been conducting geologic
                         and hydrologic studies in portions of the high desert region, including the
                         detection and measurement of subsidence. To date, subsidence has not
                         been studied or detected in Twentynine Palms; the closest known
                         subsidence area to Twentynine Palms is Lucerne Valley, approximately
                         fifty (50) miles to the northwest. However, the thick alluvial deposits
                         comprising these aquifers may be susceptible to compaction (with
                         resulting subsidence at the surface) should rapid groundwater withdrawal
                         occur beneath the area in response to the water needs of the City’s
                         growing population.
Soil Erosion
                         Erosion is the gradual wearing away of landmasses through the action of
                         wind, water, gravity and other geologic processes. Topographic relief
                         makes erosion and sedimentation an important issue for communities built
                         on alluvial fans and within hillside areas. Sediments forming the alluvial
                         fans in Twentynine Palms are mantled with dry, loose, sandy soils that are
                         highly susceptible to erosion, particularly the youngest, unconsolidated
                         materials. Flooding due to infrequent but violent thunderstorms can result
                         in severe erosion, especially if flows are concentrated. Thunderstorms that
                         follow a season of mountain wildfires can transport great volumes of
                         sediment onto the low-lying areas below. The natural erosion processes
                         mentioned above are often accelerated through man’s activities. Erosion
                         is a significant hazard in Twentynine Palms.

FLOOD HAZARDS
Storm Flooding
                         Twentynine Palms and the surrounding areas are, like most of southern
                         California, subject to unpredictable seasonal rainfall. The flood hazards in
                         Twentynine Palms can be classified into two (2) general categories: (1)
                         flash flooding down natural and man-made channels and (2) sheet
                         flooding across the alluvial fans, plains and valleys upon which most of
                         the development in the City currently lies.
                         Twentynine Palms has no rivers or perennial streams. When a storm
                         arrives, the normally dry rocky canyons of the adjacent mountains
                         disperse runoff into broad desert washes or onto alluvial fans and plains –
                         all of which are laced with a complex and dynamic drainage network that
                         ultimately terminates in desert playas (dry lakebeds). Drainage channels
                         in the local mountains are well incised; however, they lose their strong
                         definition upon reaching the valley floor, where sediment-laden water
                         typically spreads out into braided ephemeral stream channels and sheet
                         flow. Channels that are dry most of the year can quickly become
                         dangerous torrents of water, sand, mud and rocks, capable of transporting
                         boulders, trees and even cars. The southern part of the City receives runoff
                         from numerous small to large canyons in Joshua Tree National Park
City of Twentynine Palms General Plan 2012                                                            SF-23

                 SAFETY
                    (National Park), and from the Pinto Mountains to the east. The most
                    significant drainages with respect to flood impacts on existing
                    development are Fortynine Palms Canyon and canyons to the east, as well
                    as Twentynine Palms Wash, the broad drainage that lies between the
                    National Park and the Pinto Mountains. Indian Cove and Dog Wash, as
                    well as smaller unnamed drainages in the Pinto Mountains, also have the
                    potential to carry flash floods; however, downstream development in these
                    areas is currently minimal.
                    Drainages in the western part of Twentynine Palms currently flow
                    northward from the mountain front, then trend eastward toward the
                    Mesquite Dunes and Mesquite Lake (via the Mesquite Lake Wash).
                    Drainage in the central part of the City flows northward towards two (2)
                    small depressions (Cones Lake and Shortz Lake). Drainage flow in the
                    eastern part of Twentynine Palms is generally eastward, eventually
                    reaching Dale Lake, about eleven (11) miles to the east of the City’s
                    Sphere of Influence. Transport across the valley floor is generally by
                    sheet flow or within shallow gullies and rills, except where it is diverted
                    around low hills.
                    Most of the existing development in Twentynine Palms has been
                    completed without significant alteration to the natural terrain. As a result,
                    natural drainage courses pass through developed or semi-developed areas.
                    Small channels pass through private yards, and some structures are built
                    within the flow paths of shallow drainages. Most streets, many of which
                    are unpaved, follow the natural contours of the land, crossing arroyos and
                    gullies without culverts or bridges. These crossings can quickly become
                    filled with high velocity floodwaters, trapping vehicles or washing them
                    downstream. Floodwaters can also overflow these natural channels
                    sending water, sand, mud and debris into streets, homes and businesses.
                    Where flows are concentrated or obstructed, the sandy soils that are
                    prevalent can easily erode, forming new gullies and undermining
                    structures.
      FEMA Flood Mapping
                    The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is mandated by the
                    National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 and the Flood Disaster Protection
                    Act of 1973 to evaluate flood hazards. Flood Insurance Rate Maps
                    (FIRMs) prepared by FEMA illustrate the extent of flood hazards in a
SF-24                                                      City of Twentynine Palms General Plan 2012

                                                                          SAFETY
                         flood-prone community. These maps delineate Special Flood Hazard
                         Areas (SFHAs), areas subject to inundation by a “base flood” which
                         FEMA sets as a 100-year flood. A 100-year flood is defined by looking at
                         the long-term average period between floods of a certain size, and
                         identifying the size of flood that has a one (1) percent chance of occurring
                         during any given year. This base flood has a twenty-six percent (26%)
                         chance of occurring during a thirty (30)-year period, the length of most
                         home mortgages. However, a recurrence interval such as “100 years”
                         represents only the long-term average period between floods of a specific
                         magnitude; rare floods can in fact occur at much shorter intervals or even
                         within the same year.
                         The base flood is a regulatory standard used by the National Flood
                         Insurance Program (NFIP) as the basis for insurance requirements
                         nationwide. The Flood Disaster Protection Act requires owners of all
                         structures in identified SFHAs to purchase and maintain flood insurance as
                         a condition of receiving Federal or federally related financial assistance,
                         such as mortgage loans from federally insured lending institutions. FEMA
                         uses the concept of “floodway” (river channel or watercourse that must be
                         kept free of encroachment in order to discharge the base flood without
                         cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation above a certain height)
                         as the basis for floodplain management. Communities are responsible for
                         prohibiting encroachments into a designated floodway unless analyses
                         indicate that the proposed development will not increase the flood levels
                         downstream.
                         The City of Twentynine Palms has participated as a regular member in the
                         NFIP since 1995 (Community ID No. – 060734#). The City’s FIRM maps
                         date from April 1995, with revisions in March 1996 and August 2008. For
                         unincorporated areas, the County of San Bernardino also participates in
                         the NFIP (Community ID No. 060270#). Because the City of Twentynine
                         Palms and the County are participating members of the NFIP, flood
                         insurance is available to any property owner in the Twentynine Palms
                         area. In fact, to secure financing to buy, build or improve structures in
                         SFHAs, property owners are required to purchase flood insurance.
                         Lending institutions that are federally regulated or federally insured must
                         determine if the structure is located in a SFHA and must provide written
                         notice requiring flood insurance. FEMA recommends that all property
                         owners purchase and keep flood insurance.              Keep in mind that

                         The FIRMs that cover the Twentynine Palms area show that the flood
                         areas identified generally cover the low-lying parts of the City that are
                         most heavily populated, in addition to several washes that carry runoff to
                         and from these populated areas (see Exhibit SF-2). It is important to note
                         that FEMA did not study the entire General Plan area, and thus, the flood
                         zones identified are potentially incomplete.
                         Many storms smaller than the estimated 100-year events have caused
                         localized flooding and sedimentation problems in Twentynine Palms,
                         including areas outside of the mapped FEMA zones. Damage to structures
                         occurs mostly in older buildings that are not adequately elevated above the
                         ground surface, and/or have inadequate floodproofing. The Twentynine
                         Palms area still has many unpaved roads in residential areas, and these,
                         along with the natural drainage channels, are vulnerable to erosion and
                         sedimentation. Sediment loads are deposited when the stream velocity
                         slows down, resulting in property damage, or in some cases, parts of the
                         community being temporarily isolated due to eroded or flooded access
                         roads.
                         Residential areas that have experienced recurrent flooding are the Hansen
                         Tract, located in the middle of the broad wash that lies between Joshua
                         Tree National Park and the Pinto Mountains, and the Smoke Tree area that
                         lies within the outwash plain of several canyons along the base of the
                         mountains. Both of these areas are built out as small, single-family lots.
                         Low-lying commercial areas along Twentynine Palms Highway and
                         Adobe Road south of the flood control channel have also been subject to
                         flooding, although placement of a dry well near the intersection of these
                         two (2) roads has helped to alleviate the problem at that location. Adobe
                         Road commercial areas north of the Twentynine Palms Channel are
                         generally outside of the flood zone, however localized low spots have
                         been subject to flooding in recent years. Flooding also occurs on many
                         streets and major roads that cross natural drainages and at depressions
                         such as Shortz Lake and Cones Lake, or on sections of roadway that
                         convey floodwater during storms, such as Utah Trail, north of the Hansen
                         Tract.
                         The only major drainage structure in the City is the Twentynine Palms
                         Channel, constructed between 1958 and 1972 to provide protection for the
                         business district. The channel is a graded, sand-bottom trapezoidal-shaped
                         open channel, with walls locally reinforced with rail and wire revetment.
City of Twentynine Palms General Plan 2012                                                           SF-29
                  SAFETY
                      Starting near the intersection of Hatch Road and Twentynine Palms
                      Highway, the channel passes through the central, most densely populated
                      part of the City, eventually releasing water into a natural wash near
                      Bagdad Highway, north of Amboy Road. A tributary channel of similar
                      construction skirts the southwest side of Campbell Hill. This channel is
                      the northernmost section of a longer proposed channel named Pinto Cove.
                      The 49 Palms Spreading Grounds, a triangular-shaped catchment area
                      framed by small levees at the mouth of Fortynine Palms Canyon, is
                      designed to retain a portion of the floodwaters for percolation into the
                      groundwater basin. The remaining flow is directed into the Twentynine
                      Palms Channel. Donnell Basin, a smaller, but better-defined graded basin
                      adjacent to the channel, is also designed for recharge as well as flood
                      protection. These basins, as well as the flood control channel, are owned
                      and maintained by the County of San Bernardino.
      Dam Inundation/Failure
                      Seismically induced inundation refers to flooding that results when water
                      retention structures, such as dams, fail due to an earthquake. Given that,
                      currently, there are no dams in or near the Twentynine Palms area that
                      could impact the City, the hazard of dam inundation is considered nil.
                      Seismically induced inundation can also occur if strong ground shaking
                      causes structural damage to aboveground water tanks. If a tank is not
                      adequately braced and baffled, sloshing water can lift a water tank off its
                      foundation, splitting the shell, damaging the roof and bulging the bottom
                      of the tank. Movement can also shear off the pipes leading to the tank,
                      releasing water through the broken connections. These types of damage
                      occurred during southern California’s 1992 Landers, 1992 Big Bear and
                      1994 Northridge earthquakes. As a result of lessons learned from recent
                      earthquakes, new standards for design of steel water tanks were adopted in
                      1994 (Lund, 1994). The new tank design includes flexible joints at the
                      inlet/outlet connections to accommodate movement in any direction.
                      The Twentynine Palms Water District maintains ten (10) aboveground,
                      steel tank water reservoirs, ranging in capacity from 0.532 million gallons
                      to 5.81 million gallons. All the tanks are located within City limits except
                      for the Desert Heights Reservoir, which is located north of the Sphere of
                      Influence. Two (2) of the tanks were constructed in 2007, whereas the
                      older tanks were constructed twenty (20) years or more ago, before the
SF-30                                                         City of Twentynine Palms General Plan 2012

                         located on Donnell Hill, was built in 1957. According to the District, all
                         the older tanks have been retrofitted to resist damage from earthquakes.

      WIND HAZARDS
                       Windstorms in the Twentynine Palms area have the potential to impact
                       life, property, utilities, infrastructure and transportation systems, causing
                       damage to trees, power lines, utility poles, road signs, cars, trucks,
                       building roofs and buildings. Uprooted trees and downed utility poles can
                       also fall across the public right-of-way disrupting transportation. These
                       events can be major hindrances to emergency response and disaster
                       recovery. A windstorm also has the potential to displace residents, which
                       may require the City to provide short-term and/or long-term shelters to
                       accommodate these individuals, in addition to providing for other
                       emergency response activities such as cleanup and repair.

                         preferentially during the summer, fall and winter months, although the
                         historical record shows that the City can be impacted by strong winds
                         anytime. Tornadoes have been reported in the lower Mojave Desert area,
                         including at least one tornado or macroburst that damaged three (3)

                         impacted, on average, by two (2) to seven (7) windstorm events per year.
                         Tornado activity is less consistent, with some years seeing several

                   SAFETY
      FIRE HAZARDS
      Urban Fires
                      Based on 2006 data, structure fires in the City of Twentynine Palms
                      represent a very small percentage of the annual emergency calls that the
                      Fire Department receives and responds to. The structure fires that
                      occurred in 2006 were for the most part confined to the room of origin,
                      resulting in an overall low dollar loss. At least twenty-five percent (25%)
                      of the residential structures in the City date from before 1970 and are,
                      therefore, not likely to be fitted with internal sprinklers. Some of the
                      older, high-occupancy apartment complexes are most likely also not
                      sprinklered, nor are they likely built of fire-resistant materials, making
                      these high probability/high consequences target hazards.
      Wildland Fires
                      Wildland and vegetation fires within City limits are not well documented.
                      The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CDF) database
                      does not include any fires within the City. The National Park Service has
                      mapped several fires up to ten (10) acres in size and one fire up to 99.9
                      acres in size (the 29 Palms Inn fire in 1964) along the southern portion of
                      the City between 1948 and 2009. However, National Fire Incident
                      Reporting system data for the year 2006 alone includes seven (7) brush
                      fires within City limits that are not included in either the CDF or the
                      National Park Service databases. This suggests that wildland fires in
                      Twentynine Palms are more common than the data indicate, but are
                      generally small in size, possibly due to the scant vegetation in the valley,
                      and the effective response by the Twentynine Palms Fire Department.
                      The CDF considers the City’s wildland fire threat as moderate for the most
                      part (see Exhibit SF-2), although some portions, mostly in the southern
                      portion of the City and its Sphere of Influence, and in the Mesquite Dunes
                      area, are mapped as having a high fire threat. Immediately south of the
                      City, the CDF has mapped some sections of the Joshua Tree National Park
                      as having a very high fire threat. Both the City and the Marine Base are
                      included in the list of Communities at Risk due to their location adjacent
                      to or within federal responsibility areas with a high fire hazard. The
                      National Park Service indicates that the potential future arrival of invasive,
                      non-native grasses, such as buffelgrass, could result in a substantial
SF-34                                                         City of Twentynine Palms General Plan 2012

                         change in the fire regime of the region, with an increase in the number and
                         size of wildland fires, and an increase in the fire danger due to the high
                         temperatures at which these grasses burn.
Fires after Earthquakes
                         History shows that earthquake-induced fires have the potential to be the
                         worst-case fire-suppression scenarios for a community because an
                         earthquake typically causes multiple ignitions distributed over a broad
                         geographic area, with the potential to severely tax the local fire
                         suppression agencies. Furthermore, if fire fighters are involved with
                         search and rescue operations, they are less available to fight fires. Fire
                         suppression efforts can also be limited by a water distribution system that
                         has been impaired by the earthquake. Thus, many factors affect the
                         severity of fires following an earthquake, including ignition sources, types
                         and density of fuel, weather conditions, functionality of the water systems
                         and the ability of firefighters to suppress the fires. The principal causes of
                         earthquake-related fires are open flames, electrical malfunctions, gas leaks
                         and chemical spills. Downed power lines may ignite fires if the lines do
                         not automatically de-energize. Unanchored gas heaters and water heaters
                         are common problems, as these readily tip over during strong ground
                         shaking (State law now requires new and replaced gas-fired water heaters
                         to be attached to a wall or other support).
                         An earthquake centered in Twentynine Palms, either on the Pinto
                         Mountain or Mesquite Lake fault, has the potential to cause substantial
                         damage to the City’s water distribution system, with a resultant reduction
                         in water availability immediately after the earthquake. The two (2) fire
                         stations in the Twentynine Palms area are located very near to faults that
                         have the potential to cause surface fault rupture and other types of ground
                         failure during an earthquake. This in turn can result in structural damage
                         to the fire stations and to the surrounding roads, impacting the stations’
                         emergency response capabilities. Structure fires caused by an earthquake,
                         the result of electric malfunctions, gas leaks or toppled-over heat or flame
                         sources, can occur simultaneously at several different locations throughout
                         the City. The multiple ignitions could severely tax the Fire Department,
                         especially if their own buildings and equipment have been damaged.

HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
Sites
                         The use, storage, transport and disposal of hazardous materials are
                         controlled by several Federal and state laws. The San Bernardino County
                         Fire Department, Hazardous Materials Division (SBCFD-HMD) oversees
                         those businesses in Twentynine Palms that handle hazardous materials.
                         The SBCFD-HMD is the Local Certified Unified Program Agency
                         (CUPA). All businesses that handle a specified amount of hazardous
                         materials or extremely hazardous materials are required to submit a
                         Hazardous Materials Business Plan to the CUPA.
                         As of June 2009, there were eleven (11) facilities in the Twentynine Palms
                         area that are small-quantity generators of hazardous materials, and two (2)
                         other facilities whose classification as small- or large-quantity generators
                         was unspecified. The Twentynine Palms Marine Corps Base, however, is a
                         large-quantity generator of hazardous materials. According to the Toxic
                         Release Inventory (TRI) database, substances released onsite or offsite
                         from the Base include copper, lead compounds, mixed isomers, ethylene
                         glycol, nitroglycerin and phosphorus.
                         According to EPA data, there are no Superfund sites in Twentynine Palms,
                         nor have there ever been in the past. The EPA reports, however, that there
                         is one (1) Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
                         Liability Information System (CERCLIS) site in the area, namely the
                         Twentynine Palms Marine Corps Base. Approximately sixty-five (65)
                         sites within the base are known or suspected to have released contaminant
                         to the environment, typically the result of past land use practices. The
                         contaminants involved include diesel, waste/fuel/motor oil, benzene,
                         toluene and other compounds found in petroleum hydrocarbons, lead,
                         PCBs, insecticides and pesticides, arsenic and other metals. In most cases,
                         the only media impacted was soil, and after cleanup, many of the sites
                         have been closed, as they have been deemed to not pose a risk to human
                         health or to the environment. The Lahontan Regional Water Quality
                         Control Board is overseeing those cases still open that are undergoing
                         further investigation and/or remediation.
                         According to data from GeoTracker, fifteen (15) leaking underground
                         storage tank (LUST) facilities have been reported in Twentynine Palms
City of Twentynine Palms General Plan 2012                                                            SF-37

                       between about 1986 and February of 2009. Eleven (11) of the LUST sites
                       have been remediated and closed, leaving only four (4) still active. Most
                       of the leaks impacted only soil, but two (2) of the sites are listed as under
                       investigation, and one of the sites is known to have impacted non-drinking
                       groundwater and soil vapor. The California Regional Water Quality
                       Control Board (CRWQCB), in cooperation with the Office of Emergency
                       Services provides oversight and conducts inspections of all underground
                       tank removals and installation of new ones.
                       At least seven (7) wells have been drilled in or around the City of
                       Twentynine Palms to look for petroleum. Most of these wells were drilled
                       in the 1950s and 1960s, were dry or economically non-productive, and
                       have since been abandoned. It is unknown whether the drilling and
                       pumping of these wells resulted in contamination of the immediate area
                       surrounding the wells. Oil-stained soils, heavy metals used in the drilling
                       muds, and spilled refined fuels, may be found locally around some of
                       these wells.
      Household Hazardous Waste
                       Hazardous materials are also used in residential applications: paints,
                       thinners, bleach, ammonia, Drano and other similar products, in addition
                       to motor oil, batteries and spent fluorescent light bulbs, to mention a few.
                       If not disposed of properly, such substances can impact the environment.
                       There are several facilities in and around the City of Twentynine Palms
                       that receive and recycle used materials, including household hazardous
                       waste. Twentynine Palms is a “Zero Waste Community of San
                       Bernardino County,” and as such, residents have several drop-off options
                       for their used motor oil, batteries and other waste.
      Releases Due to Transportation Accidents and Pipeline Failures
                       There are no registered transporters of hazardous waste in the Twentynine
                       Palms area, but hazardous waste may be transported through the City, as
                       there are several routes in the area that are prescribed or permitted to carry
                       hazardous materials and explosives. Releases of hazardous materials from
                       trucks can occur during an accident. The California Highway Patrol is the
                       responding agency in the event of a spill on the freeways, but local
                       emergency response agencies, such as the police and fire departments, are
                       responsible for additional enforcement and routing assistance. All

                                                                          SAFETY
                         transportation of hazardous materials needs to be conducted under strict
                         regulations established by State and Federal agencies.
                         There is a pipeline that extends through the City that carries high-pressure
                         natural gas. The pipeline could be damaged within the study area if either
                         the Pinto Mountain or Mesquite Lake faults rupture causing an
                         earthquake.
Earthquake-Induced Releases of Hazardous Materials
                         In an earthquake, hazardous materials spills can occur even when the
                         building housing the materials does not suffer significant damage.
                         Hazardous material containers not properly secured and fastened can
                         easily be punctured and/or tipped over, pipelines may rupture, and storage
                         tanks may fail. Containers may also explode if subject to high
                         temperatures, such as those generated by a fire. Improperly segregated
                         chemicals could react, forming a toxic gas cloud. In a worst-case
                         scenario, several hazardous materials releases could occur simultaneously.
                         Chemical substances are often unstable under high temperatures. Other
                         chemicals are reactive to water or oxygen and can self-ignite if exposed to
                         water or air.
                         In the event of a fire involving hazardous materials, special attention,
                         including special handling and evacuation procedures, are often necessary.
                         These by-products include the “smoke plume” and water run-off from the
                         fire-extinguishing process. The smoke plume has the potential to pose a
                         severe hazard to those exposed to it: Depending on the types of chemicals
                         involved in the fire, an evacuation of the immediate area and especially of
                         those areas down-wind should be conducted.
                         If water is used to fight a fire, the runoff could include chemicals or
                         substances that pose a hazard to the environment. Therefore, the runoff
                         should be contained to prevent it from flowing into storm drains or leach
                         fields. Containing the water runoff from a fire is difficult but possible,
                         especially if the special equipment to do so is available.
                         At present, several hazardous materials sites identified in Twentynine
                         Palms are located within the 500-year or 100-year flood zones, and
                         adjacent to fault zones. Many of the sites at the Marine Base are located
                         in an area potentially susceptible to liquefaction.

      Drinking Water Supply
                      The Twentynine Palms Water District provides drinking water to many of
                      the residents of Twentynine Palms (with the exception of those residents
                      that have their own water wells) and the USMC – 29 Palms provides
                      drinking water to the Marine Base from their own wells. Only one of the
                      small well producers, the Twentynine Palms Inn, which provides water to
                      twenty-five (25) or more individuals, is required to satisfy the legal water
                      standards, including testing and reporting. All three (3) of these water
                      purveyors rely on groundwater as their primary water source.
                      According to the EPA Safe Drinking Water Violation Report, the
                      Twentynine Palms Water District has not had any violations reported in at
                      least the last ten (10) years, an excellent record, with the exception of The
                      Twentynine Palms Inn which had several monitoring violations, typically
                      assessed when the sampling is not conducted in a timely manner.
                      However, the most recent violation dates to the first quarter of 2004. The
                      USMC – 29 Palms has had three (3) health violations in which the
                      concentration for Total Coliform exceeded the Maximum Contaminant
                      Level (MCL). The most recent of these occurred in March 2008.
                      Perchlorates at concentrations between 0.08 and 0.47 parts per billion
                      (ppb), considerably lower than the California-defined maximum
                      contaminant level of 6 ppb, has been detected in some groundwater
                      samples from the Twentynine Palms Marine Corps Base. These
                      concentrations are low enough that the California EPA has declared that
                      No Further Action is necessary.
                      Given that there are no permanent surface waters in the Twentynine Palms
                      area, and that all wastewater in the region is disposed through individual
                      septic tank or tile field disposal systems, National Pollutant Discharge
                      Elimination System (NPDES) permits are not required in the City.
                      However, anyone who is discharging or proposes to discharge wastewater
                      onto land must file a report with the Regional Water Board which can
                      impose waste discharge requirements on these individuals or facilities,
                      based upon the review of these reports. Furthermore, all discharges, with
                      the exception of small, residential, on-site systems, are required to
                      complete and submit to the Board a Report of Waste Discharge.

      PUBLIC SAFETY
      Fire Services
                       The Twentynine Palms Fire Department, a subsidiary agency to the
                       Twentynine Palms Water District, provides fire prevention, fire
                       suppression and public education programs. Their coverage area is very
                       large (approximately eighty (80) square miles in addition to the City
                       boundaries), and the population in the area has doubled in the last decade,
                       at times hindering the Fire Department’s response time to emergency
                       calls.
                       Mutual aid agreements with neighboring communities to the west, San
                       Bernardino County Fire Department, Joshua Tree National Park and with
                       the Marine Base Fire Department, help with the response times, but
                       additional fire resources will be necessary as the City continues to grow.
                       Fire-fighting resources in Twentynine Palms include two (2) fire stations:
                       Station 421 (main) located at 6560 Adobe Road, and Station 422 at 3834
                       Lear Avenue.
                       The Twentynine Palms Fire Department constantly monitors for fire
                       hazards in the City and has ongoing programs for public education and the
                       investigation and mitigation of hazardous situations. Such hazards include
                       emergency response calls, vegetation and structure fires, vehicle accidents,
                       public assistance and false alarms. The fire stations are staffed by
                       administration, fire fighters and paramedic personnel.
                       Fire protection services for the areas of the City’s Sphere of Influence,
                       which are not served by the Twentynine Palms Fire Department, are
                       provided by the San Bernardino County Fire Department (SBCFD) -
                       South Desert Fire Protection Division.             The SBCFD provides
                       administration and support for this and other fire districts serving
                       unincorporated areas, along with other services such as hazardous
                       materials regulation, dispatch communication and disaster preparedness.
                       There is one fire station located within the Wonder Valley plan area:
                       Wonder Valley Station 119 located at 80526 Amboy Road, Twentynine
                       Palms.
                       The Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center Fire Department, known as

                                                                          SAFETY
                         organization that provides fire and emergency medical services to both
                         military and civilian personnel on the base, and also to the surrounding
                         local communities. The CCFD responds to emergency calls in the City of
                         Twentynine Palms and surrounding areas as part of mutual joint response
                         agreements with other Fire Departments.
                         Fire protection planning is a key consideration in new and modified
                         developments in Twentynine Palms. For all discretionary applications and
                         most administrative applications, including building permit applications, a
                         description of the project and/or plans are sent to the Twentynine Palms
                         Fire Department for comment and clearance. Developments within
                         Twentynine Palms are required to comply with all applicable County and
                         State fire codes to reduce the opportunities for fires to start and/or spread,
                         provide for evacuation of occupants and provide access for firefighters to
                         extinguish the fire.
                         The Fire Department also enhances fire safety in the community through
                         coordination of education programs designed to increase community
                         involvement. The CCFD provides public education by teaching children
                         home fire safety and what to do in the event of a fire. It also provides
                         monthly training in First Aid and CPR, and free EMT recertification
                         classes to the public.
Police Services
                         Police protection is provided through contract with the San Bernardino
                         County Sheriff’s Department. Service is provided from the Morongo
                         Basin station at 6527 White Feather Road in Joshua Tree and Sheriff’s
                         Department personnel are provided a satellite office at Twentynine Palms
                         City Hall on Adobe Road. Police services are dispatched from the
                         Communications Center in Victorville but the satellite office is centrally
                         located for efficient response. There are currently approximately ten (10)
                         patrol officers assigned to the City from the Morongo Basin Sheriff's
                         Station to provide dedicated, community-based policing. The Morongo
                         Basin station is equipped with twelve (12) police vehicles, which includes
                         five (5) marked vehicles, one (1) unmarked vehicle, two (2) off-highway
                         motorcycles, three (3) citizen patrol units, and one (1) radar trailer.
                         The Sherriff’s Office provides various crime reducing projects such as
                         Operation Clean Sweep, Choices Youth Program, Juvenile Crime

                       Operation Clean Sweep is designed to address problems at local schools,
                       which are not of a significant criminal nature, and allows school personnel
                       to write citations for such violations. Choices Youth Program is an
                       activity/education program for at-risk youth administered by the City’s
                       Community Services Department in cooperation with the Sheriffs’
                       Department. The Juvenile Crime Reduction Plan allows teams of officers
                       to "adopt" local schools to reduce campus-related crime and develop site-
                       specific Safe Schools Plans. The Citizens on Patrol Unit supplements the
                       City's uniformed patrol officers with more than two dozen trained
                       residents who donate thousands of volunteer hours each year. They patrol
                       the neighborhoods acting as an "extra" set of eyes and ears for the City's
                       patrol officers. They also assist with crowd control, traffic control,
                       community events and the Public Safety Office at City Hall.
                       Numerous grant-funded special operations beyond normal patrol activity
                       are conducted routinely within the City. These operations include
                       parole/probation/sex registrant compliance sweeps, traffic safety
                       checkpoints and traffic safety saturation patrols. City patrol officers also
                       conduct juvenile alcohol and tobacco stings along with problem-oriented
                       policing projects throughout the City. The Off-Highway Vehicle
                       Enforcement Team has been very successful in reducing the number of
                       off-road vehicle complaints received within the City limits.
      Medical Services
                       Hospitals in the Twentynine Palms area include the Robert E. Bush Naval
                       Hospital within the Twentynine Palms Marine Base for military personnel
                       and their families, and the High Desert Medical Center located at 6601
                       White Feather Road, in Joshua Tree. The two (2) medical facilities
                       combined have a total bed capacity of 158 beds. However, both facilities
                       have the capacity to expand their bed counts, with the High Desert
                       Medical Center providing up to 179 beds, and the Naval Hospital, 37 beds,
                       for a combined total of 216 beds. It is possible that the regional hospital
                       (the High Desert Medical Center in Joshua Tree) will not be able to meet
                       the demand for medical care in the aftermath of an earthquake in the area.
                       Although only a few residents from Twentynine Palms are anticipated to
                       require medical help, a larger number of casualties could result from

                         a higher percentage of older construction types. If the Pinto Mountain
                         fault breaks, surface fault rupture could hinder access to the hospital,
                         given its location on the south side of the fault.
                         Medical response and ambulance services in the City of Twentynine
                         Palms are provided by the Morongo Basin Ambulance Association
                         (MBA), a community-based, non-profit, non-tax supported association.
                         The MBA has two (2) units in Twentynine Palms at their station
                         immediately south of the main Fire Station on Adobe Road. When an
                         emergency call is dispatched through to the Fire Station, the MBA is also
                         notified at the same time. The two (2) ambulance units in Twentynine
                         Palms are manned twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week,
                         with emergency response personnel that are State-certified. The MBA
                         have two (2) additional ambulance units manned full time in the Morongo
                         Basin area; and an additional four (4) ambulances that can be manned in
                         short order as needed. Air ambulance service, if necessary to airlift a
                         patient to a hospital, is provided in the area by Mercy Air Service.
DISASTER PREPAREDNESS, RESPONSE AND RECOVERY
                         A disaster is a sudden and dramatic emergency. When a disaster occurs,
                         the threatened community strives to: 1) protect its residents to the extent
                         possible; 2) care for victims; and 3) restore basic services as soon as
                         possible. To do this, a community needs to respond quickly and
                         dynamically, and as effectively as possible. This requires preparation at all
                         levels, from the Federal government (for large-scale disasters) down to
                         individual neighborhoods, families and businesses.
                         Issues pertaining to emergency response, disaster preparedness and
                         disaster recovery require an assessment of the hazards, identification of
                         functions and resources to handle both short-term and long-term response,
                         and development of recovery procedures. Coordination between all levels
                         of responders is critical. Direct, clear updates on the situation, provided in
                         a timely manner by public officials, are important; this engenders
                         cooperation from the public. Emergency preparedness includes having an
                         alerting system that can be put to use immediately to warn the community
                         of impending danger, and to transfer information post-disaster. It is also
                         essential to have provisions in place to deal with handicapped individuals,
                         and people that do not understand or speak English and need to be notified
City of Twentynine Palms General Plan 2012                                                              SF-47

                     of the disaster preparedness, response and recovery efforts in their native
                     language. Recognizing and being sensitive to cultural differences are also
                     important for effective emergency preparedness and response in multi-
                     ethnic communities.
                     The City of Twentynine Palms has a main Emergency Operations Center
                     (EOC) at City Hall, and two (2) alternate EOCs: 1) at the City’s Parks,
                     Recreation and Community Services office building in Luckie Park
                     (74362 Joe Davis Drive), and 2) at the Senior Community Center (6539
                     Adobe Road). These locations are all located within about 1 to 1-1/2
                     miles of the two (2) main faults that extend across the City, and in or next
                     to the FEMA-designated flood zones.
      Emergency Planning
                     The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) encourages the
                     development and regular update of emergency preparedness documents by
                     providing grant money to communities that have approved and adopted
                     Local Hazard Mitigation Plans. Since January 1, 2008, jurisdictions have
                     been required to adopt their Local Hazard Mitigation Plan (or Disaster
                     Mitigation Plan) as part of their Safety Element. The City of Twentynine
                     Palms participated in the development of the San Bernardino County
                     Operational Area Multi-Jurisdictional Hazard Mitigation Plan (HMP),
                     adopted in April 2005. FEMA requires that these types of documents be
                     reviewed on a yearly basis, and updated every 5 years. Data provided in
                     the Technical Background Report to the Safety Element can be used to
                     update the City’s portion of the County’s HMP.
                     The revised HMP should be adopted as an addendum to the Safety
                     Element. The State of California also encourages the maintenance of
                     HMPs: California, through the California Disaster Assistance Act, limits
                     the State share for an eligible project that is in response to a fire disaster to
                     no more than seventy-five percent (75%) of total state eligible costs,
                     except if the local agency has adopted a Local Hazard Mitigation Plan as
                     part of their Safety Element, and complies with several requirements
                     imposed by the State Fire Marshal (Senate Bill 1764, 2008). If the
                     community complies with all requirements, the state share may be up to
                     100% of the cost.

                                                                          SAFETY
Evacuation Routes
                         Evacuation refers to the movement of people that are at risk of being
                         impacted by a disaster to a safer location, using routes that do not pose a
                         significant danger to the evacuees. Thus, both the destination and the
                         route need to be scrutinized, preferably before the evacuation orders are
                         issued. This involves making a decision as to which of the potential
                         temporary shelters in the City be opened, based on the shelters’ locations
                         relative to the approaching disaster, and their ease of accessibility from the
                         routes identified as safest.
                         The Police Department typically serves as the lead organization in
                         carrying out evacuations, supported by the Fire Department as appropriate.
                         The Public Works Department typically assists in the identification of the
                         best evacuation routes and in barricading the evacuated areas.
                         Exhibit SF-3 identifies several potential evacuation routes in Twentynine
                         Palms. Which routes should be used will depend on the specific disaster:
                                 Earthquakes occur suddenly and for the most part without warning.
                                  Evacuation may be necessary post-disaster if the ground shaking or
                                  fault rupture causes a secondary disaster, such as the failure of a
                                  water reservoir or the release of a toxic cloud from ruptured
                                  containers of hazardous materials. Post-earthquake fires may also
                                  require the evacuation of certain areas, but these are generally
                                  localized areas with a limited number of affected individuals.
                                  Which evacuation routes to use will depend on which area is at risk
                                  from any of these secondary hazards.
                                 Fires in the Twentynine Palms area have historically occurred in
                                  the mountains and foothills to the south, in and adjacent to Joshua
                                  Tree National Park. If the prevailing winds fan a fire so that it
                                  moves north and into the urban-wildland fire interface, then
                                  evacuation of the potentially affected neighborhoods may be
                                  required. In general, evacuees would take roads leading north and
                                  west, toward Twentynine Palms Highway and the more developed
                                  areas in the City.
                                 Flooding in Twentynine Palms will impact the southern and central
                                  portions of the City preferentially. Localized flooding due to
City of Twentynine Palms General Plan 2012                                                              SF-49

                   SAFETY
                               storm events can occur throughout the planning area, typically
                               where low spots in the topography obstruct the flow of
                               floodwaters. The appropriate evacuation routes to use in the event
                               of this disaster will therefore depend on where localized flooding is
                               more severe, and on the destination (i.e., shelter location).
                               Evacuation may involve merely getting out of the low spots and
                               onto higher ground.
                              Releases of hazardous materials, either as a result of a leak in one
                               of the facilities that handle these substances in the area, or as a
                               result of an accident-caused spill on the highway or roadways,
                               generally will require the evacuation of a relatively small area,
                               generally within a 1- to 2-mile radius of the release. The
                               evacuation routes to follow would be designated by the Sheriff
                               Department based on an assessment of the leak location, prevailing
                               wind directions, traffic flow and location of the emergency shelter,
                               if any, opened for that event.
      Potential Emergency Shelters
                       Earthquakes, flooding, wildland fires and other disasters can cause loss of
                       function or habitability of buildings that provide housing. Displaced
                       households may need alternative short-term shelter provided by family,
                       friends, temporary rentals or public shelters established by relief
                       organizations such as the Red Cross or Salvation Army in facilities around
                       the City.
                       Potential shelter locations in Twentynine Palms include parks, schools and
                       churches. These locations are generally ideal as shelters because they
                       have: 1) open space where tents can be set up; 2) restroom facilities and
                       possibly kitchens; and 3) fairly large parking lots where displaced families
                       can park their cars and, if they have them, their recreational vehicles,
                       which can be used for housing.
                       Given that not all of these facilities may be available or fully functional
                       after a disaster, having several options is ideal. Table SF- 5 includes the
                       potential shelter locations in the City. These locations were selected so as
                       to avoid as much as possible the areas in the City most susceptible to
                       natural hazards. Nevertheless, the selection of which sites to open during
                       an emergency should be made after consideration of the hazard involved,
SF-50                                                            City of Twentynine Palms General Plan 2012

                         and the potential for that hazard to progress (such as a northward-moving
                         wildfire) into the area where a shelter has been established. The parks
                         included herein have restroom facilities; those parks in the City that do not
                         have restrooms were not considered. These are short-term shelter facilities
                         to be used for a few hours to a few days. Long-term alternative housing
                         may require import of manufactured homes, occupancy of vacant units,
                         net emigration from the impacted area, or, eventually, the repair or
                         reconstruction of new private and public housing.

Mutual Aid Agreements
                         Although the Twentynine Palms Fire Department is tasked with the
                         responsibility of fire prevention and fire suppression in the City, in reality,
                         fire-fighting agencies team up and work together during emergencies.
                         These teaming arrangements are handled through automatic and mutual
                         aid agreements, which obligate fire departments to help each other under
                         pre-defined circumstances. Automatic aid agreements obligate the nearest
                         fire company to respond to a fire regardless of the jurisdiction. Mutual aid
                         agreements obligate fire department resources to respond outside of their
                         district upon request for assistance.
                         The City of Twentynine Palms is one of twenty-four (24) cities and towns
                         that make up the San Bernardino County Operational area. The
                         Operational Area is part of the Standardized Emergency Management
                         System (SEMS) that promotes effective disaster management, response
                         and cooperation across jurisdictional boundaries. As a result of being part
                         of an Operational Area group, all of the jurisdictions have mutual aid
                         agreements that allow them to obtain additional emergency resources, as
                         needed, from non-affected members in the group. Given its geographic
                         location, Joshua Tree is the first responder to mutual aid requests from the
                         City of Twentynine Palms. Furthermore, each of these cities is signatory
                         to a Joint Powers Agreement that provides for the joint use and operation
                         of machinery, equipment, vehicles and personnel in the event of a fire,
                         disturbance or other local emergency that cannot be met solely by the
                         requesting City.
                         Numerous other agencies are available to assist the Twentynine Palms Fire
                         Department if needed. These include the City’s Police Department and
                         California Highway Patrol, who, depending on the location of the incident,
                         would provide support during evacuations and to discourage people from
                         traveling to the incident area to observe Fire Department operations, as
                         this can hinder fire suppression and emergency response efforts.
                         Several State and Federal agencies have roles in fire hazard mitigation,
                         response and recovery, depending on the type of incident and its location.
                         These agencies include the Office of Emergency Services, Office of
