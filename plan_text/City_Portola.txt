1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 GENERAL PLAN UPDATE
    The City of Portola General Plan 2020 recommends review at regular intervals to ensure that the document is true to the
    original vision and principles of the City. Periodic adjustments to the General Plan may occur from time to time, as
    development opportunities emerge.
    The Planning Commission began its review of the 2020 General Plan on February 17, 2009. It was agreed that the
    themes of the General Plan (technology, recreation, and tourism) remain critical issue in Portola. The importance of
    community activities, façade improvement, improved alleyways, emphasis on the Railroad museum and downtown
    activities, improved signage to downtown attractions, increased tourism, and improved businesses will all be the focus
    of this General Plan Update.
    The original 2020 General Plan was a comprehensive update to the General Plan adopted by the City of Portola in 1983,
    and the Housing Element, adopted in 1992. In 1997, the City Council recognized the need for a new plan to anticipate
    the potential for development in the City and surrounding area. The City Council re-established the Planning
    Commission and charged it with preparing an update to the General Plan. A consultant team was selected in mid-1998
    and commenced preparation of the General Plan with the Planning Commission which served as the advisory
    committee for development of the plan concepts and principles.
1.2 WHAT IS A GENERAL PLAN?
    The general plan links community values, visions, and objectives with decisions that affect the physical development of
    the community, such as subdivisions and public works projects. It is a comprehensive policy document that defines the
    type, amount, and location of future growth and development within the city and forms the base for the city’s planning
    activities and its decisions regarding development proposals. Each city and county in California must prepare a
    comprehensive, long-term general plan to guide its future (California Office of Planning and Research, 2003 General
    Plan Guidelines).
    State law requires that subdivisions, capital improvements, development agreements, and many other land use actions
    must be consistent with the adopted general plan. Zoning and specific plans are also required to conform to the general
    plan.
    The process of preparing, adopting, implementing, and maintaining the general plan serves to:
        Identify the community’s land use, circulation, environmental, economic, and social goals and policies as they
         relate to land use and development.
        Provide a basis for local government decision-making, including decisions on development approvals and
         exactions.
        Provide citizens with opportunities to participate in the planning and decision-making processes of their
         communities.
        Inform citizens, developers, decision-makers, and other cities and counties of the ground rules that guide
         development within a particular community.
    A General Plan is required to:
        BE COMPREHENSIVE It should incorporate the City’s entire planning area, look at the region as a whole, and
         encompass a broad range of issues.
        BE INTERNALLY CONSISTENT All of the elements have equal status. Consistency is required between and
         within elements, among text and diagrams, and among any area plans.
        HAVE A LONG-TERM PERSPECTIVE
1.3 PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN THE GENERAL PLAN UPDATE PROCESS
    The Planning Commission began the General Plan Update process in February 2009 at regularly-scheduled Planning

    Commission meetings, during noticed Public Forums. Regular monthly meetings were held throughout 2009 and 2010
    to review individual elements; March 17, 2009; April 20, 2009; May 19, 2009; June 16, 2009; July 21, 2009; August
    18, 2009; September 22, 2009, October 20, 2009; November 17, 2009; January 19, 2010; May 18, 2010; June 15, 2010;
    November 16, 2010; and May 25, 2011. A public Hearing was scheduled before the City Council on June 8, 2011
    regarding the General Plan Update (to be updated based on City-Council directed public process and the timeline of the
    project).
1.4 AUTHORITY AND STATUTORY PURPOSES
    All cities and counties in California are required to prepare a general plan. California Government Code Section 65300
    requires that the General Plan be a comprehensive, long-term document for the physical development of the City. The
    General Plan must weave together the many threads of individual and civic life that make up a community. The
    fundamental goal is to describe how a complex set of circumstances will function collectively to achieve a workable
    plan for the future.
    The General Plan provides direction for development.
    Consistency with the General Plan
    The General Plan links community values, visions and objectives with decisions that affect the physical development of
    the community, such as subdivisions and public works projects. State law requires that subdivisions, capital
    improvements, development agreements, and many other land use actions must be consistent with the adopted general
    plan.
1.5 TIME HORIZON FOR THE GENERAL PLAN
    This General Plan looks forward to the year 2020. In that time dramatic changes will occur in Portola. The pace of
    growth is expected to increase sharply, and the fundamental economy will shift from basic industries to tourism and
    new businesses that rely on telecommunications. The twenty-year horizon is necessary to provide a context for
    planning major new road and infrastructure elements (such as water and sewer systems) that require a long time frame
    for planning, funding, and development.
1.6 THE VISION OF THE FUTURE
    This General Plan will guide the City of Portola through an era of substantial change. Although Portola is a relatively
    small community and isolated from the large population centers of California, the City will be affected by economic
    and technologic changes far beyond its borders. These changes include an increase in the retired population, more
    leisure time and affluence to enjoy attractive communities, and technologic advances that enable certain types of
    employment to locate in relatively isolated locations.
    An increase in retired population brings a higher demand for second homes and recreation-oriented retirement
    communities. Increased leisure time and affluence enables more people to visit communities such as Portola. This will
    enhance the local economy and lead to more diverse employment opportunities. More employment opportunities lead
    to population growth and housing demand.
    New technologies and demographic trends will change the way people work, communicate, travel, and shop. These
    changes will provide many new choices for individuals and provide new opportunities that will affect where people
    choose to live. Company decision makers will select the location for company expansions and relocations largely on
    the quality of life available to themselves and their employees. Small communities with a high level of natural
    amenities and near to larger supporting metropolitan areas will attract new businesses and enjoy sustained economic
    development. The challenge will be to accommodate and derive the benefits of economic development without
    diminishing the natural amenities and small town environment that the current residents treasure.
    This General Plan envisions Portola as the economic hub of the east Plumas County region. The industries that
    sustained the community for more than a century: timber, mining, ranching and the railroad, have endured a steady
    decline due to changes in the national economy. However, a promising future lies in embracing and managing the
    population growth and economic development that will be attracted by the high level of amenity.
    Quality of life and the preservation of the existing environment are essential to realize this vision. The type of new
    economic growth anticipated in this plan is totally dependent on retaining and enhancing the environmental quality
    found in the community today. The new residents and businesses that will be attracted to this community have choices
    to locate virtually anywhere they please. Retirees, small business entrepreneurs and those who choose the mountain
    setting, small community life-style and recreation opportunities have the choice of many communities. Portola will
    grow and prosper in the future only to the extent that it:
    (1) protects and sustains the natural amenities it currently offers,
    (2) manages the effects of growth, affordably maintains public services and infrastructure, and
     (3) provides opportunities for quality economic development.
1.7 FEATURES OF THE GENERAL PLAN VISION
    The General Plan vision of the future of Portola includes the following characteristics and features. All of these
    elements contribute to the overall success of the community, the quality of life for residents, and the quality of the
    experience for visitors to the community.
    Environmental Protection
    Portola enjoys a high-quality, natural environment. The General Plan will contribute to protecting this environment by
    limiting the intensity of development within, and directing inappropriate development away from, environmentally
    sensitive areas.
    Employment Growth
    Employment opportunities will come with growth in tourism, local services and new businesses, and growth in the
    residential community. The Land Use Element will facilitate job growth by providing suitable land area for new
    employers that is well located with adequate services and access.
    Enhanced Retail Opportunities and Services for Residents
    New retail and services for area residents will come with new population growth in the eastern Plumas County region.
    This will enhance the convenience and quality of life for residents and will reduce the need to travel outside the region
    for shopping and service needs. As the commercial hub for east Plumas County, Portola will be the center for new
    businesses and services. This will occur if there are suitable sites for the new businesses in an attractive setting.
    Clear Sense of Community and Place
    The City will retain the distinct sense of place distinguished by the compact form centered on the Feather River.
    Creating a “sense of place” is less tangible than most characteristics, but it is important to the social and aesthetic
    quality of the City. Sense of place is a resident’s perception that the City is a unique place, with well defined
    boundaries, a logical order in land uses, and a distinct commercial and social center. This enhances the overall
    aesthetics and quality of life in the City. Moreover, such attributes help visitors to quickly understand the organization
    of streets and land use in a community.
    Efficient, Affordable Public Services and Utilities
    The City will provide public services suited to and affordable to the residents. The location of land uses directly affects
    the cost of public utilities and services. For example, extensive backbone sewer and water pipe systems significantly

    increase both initial capital cost and on-going maintenance. Similarly, scattered, low-density residential use can
    increase the cost and diminish the effectiveness of police, fire, and recreation services. A compact city, with clustered
    housing in the rural areas, can help make public services and utilities more affordable and efficient.
    Quality, Affordable Housing
    The City will include a supply of quality housing affordable to the residents who work in the region. This is necessary
    for the economic development of the City. The Land Use Element will contribute by designating an adequate area for
    new housing and by excluding incompatible detrimental land uses from residential neighborhoods.
    Safety
    Safety from flooding, earthquakes, and wildfires will be achieved in part by not locating intensive land uses in harms
    way and, in part, by land use design that minimizes exposure and maximizes the ability to evacuate people in
    emergencies.
    Alternative Transportation Methods
    The use of private vehicles will remain the primary mode of transport in this region. However, the Land Use Element
    will contribute to minimizing the effects of automobile traffic by creating a compact community. By locating the more
    intense land uses along roads that can accommodate the higher traffic levels, it will be feasible to walk or bicycle for
    some daily trips. Public transit can serve the more intense land uses clustered along transit routes.
1.8 ECONOMIC SETTING
    The City of Portola in 2010 is shaped by the industries that created and sustained it through the late 19th and 20th
    centuries. Portola developed around the railroad and highway. The railroad established the primary form of the City
    when it was platted in 1909; but timber, mining, and ranching have all contributed to the historic development and
    evolution of the town. As these industries expanded, the town prospered and grew. As these same industries declined,
    Portola experienced a long period of economic stagnation. Although timber, mining, ranching, and the railroad
    continue to play a role in the economy of this region, the future will depend on new types of businesses.
    In the historic economy there was little need for commercial or industrial land use other than the commercial
    development along Sierra Street and Commercial Street. Consequently, Portola has little area available to provide
    economic development opportunities for small businesses that may seek space in the City.
    The preparation of this General Plan coincides with new circumstances that promise a bright future for the City of
    Portola. The City is truly at a crossroads created by circumstances beyond its borders. If properly prepared, the City
    can ensure sustained economic growth, and maintain the existing quality of life for current and future residents. This
    General Plan defines a future based on these new circumstances.
    The new circumstances that will drive economic development in Portola reflect broad changes in technology and
    demographic trends far beyond this community. Technology will change the way in which people will work, shop,
    communicate with others socially and in business, and engage in leisure activities. These changes will make it more
    likely that individuals will choose a place to live based on quality of life issues, rather than traditional economic
    considerations.
    With telecommunications technologies and inexpensive, prompt delivery services, it is now possible to locate many
    types of businesses virtually anywhere. Office work, mail order sales, small manufacturing, and a wide range of other
    activities that historically had to locate in a major population center can now be located where the business decision
    makers choose. Portola is in a position to nurture this type of business as a cornerstone of economic growth. In order
    to attract new businesses the City will need to offer a variety of office, light industrial, and commercial space.
    The amount of land area allocated to business development cannot be precisely established in the General Plan.
    However, it is essential that the City designate areas for commercial and business parks to accommodate economic
    development opportunities.
    Demographic forces will also affect the growth and development of many communities. An aging, relatively affluent
    population will also make retirement and recreation choices based on quality of life issues. As the “baby-boomer”
    generation reaches retirement age in the next two decades, a large population of relatively affluent households will be
    seeking to locate in communities that offer a high level of quality of life. The most attractive retirement areas will be
    smaller communities within a few hours drive of the metropolitan areas where these people spent much of their lives.
    The demand for retirement housing will be met in existing small towns, such as Portola, as well as large, master
    planned communities.
    Tourism and recreation will also be a cornerstone of economic development in Portola. Tourism will create new
    service jobs and will also introduce the area to visitors and will thereby invite further population growth. Finally, job
    growth in the Reno area and in east Plumas County will create a demand for affordable housing and secondary jobs in
    Portola. Tourism will also be a growing factor in the future economy. The Railroad Museum, the River Park
    (described in the Land Use Element, Section 2.7.2), the Feather River itself, and Old Town Commercial area are
    existing or potential attractions for tourists. The City will provide a number of venues or activity centers to host large-
    scale events. The impact of the tourist visits and the growth of recreation activities in the east Plumas County region
    will be felt in retail, lodging, and service business growth.
    Quality of life is fundamental to capturing a “fair share” of the growth that will result from these new circumstances.
    The key is to balance the need for new growth, including jobs, services, retail, and housing with protecting the natural
    resources and amenities in community. Indeed, without those natural resources and amenities, the fundamental
    attraction of the community will be lost and the economic growth needed to survive and prosper will be diminished.
1.9 PHYSICAL SETTING AND RESOURCES
    The challenge to blend new growth with environmental protection is great, but Portola attributes offer significant
    advantages, including some that are virtually unique. The conditions in the existing community and the surrounding
    region, both man made development and the natural environment, are fundamental to determining the potential for
    future land use.
    Regional Location
                                                                       Portola is located just 45 minutes from Reno on an all
                                                                       weather highway, as shown in Figure 1-1. Highway 70
                                                                       is a significant trans-Sierra route that brings commerce
                                                                       to the City. For businesses in Portola, Reno offers a
                                                                       larger market for services and supplies, a potential
                                                                       labor pool, and transportation connections. With the
                                                                       Reno/Tahoe International Airport so near, Portola can
                                                                       ship and receive materials as readily as any major
                                                                       metropolitan area. The Reno/Tahoe International

                                                                       and the east Plumas County region.
       Figure 1-1
                                                                       This proximity to a major employment market enables
                                                                       residents to hold relatively high paying jobs and
                                                                       support a household in Portola. Out-commuting to
    jobs is not a desirable long term strategy for Portola, but the Reno area employment is a stable source of income that
    can help Portola grow its own economy and employment base.
    Portola is the major urban center for several historic and emerging recreation/residential communities. These existing

and developing communities: Graeagle, Blairsden, Whitehawk Ranch, the Cedars, and Gold Mountain, among others,
will attract both seasonal and permanent population that will require services and shopping. As these communities
mature, the population will become more permanent and will require year-round services.
Mountain Setting
The City sits at the east end of the narrow Humbug Valley flanked on the south by Beckwourth Peak (7252 feet) and on
the north by peaks reaching to 6200 feet. The mountains offer distant vistas when viewed from the town.
The City extends away from the river and into the forest on both sides of the valley. Distinct drainages to the river
provide open space corridors and divide the City in small neighborhoods. On the south side of the river the drainage
way has been preserved in a City park corridor. On the north side of the river, a drainage way interrupts the
neighborhood street pattern.
The City and surrounding area is gently sloping. The maximum slope is typically less than ten percent. Steeper slopes,
up to twenty percent, are found along the major tributary drainages and the mountain sides to the north and south.
Generally, the steeper slopes are not a major factor in land use decisions because the steep slope areas are located away
from the planned urban areas. Locally, steep areas limit the development potential and interrupt the neighborhood
street pattern.
Feather River
The Middle Fork of the Feather River is a Federal Wild and Scenic River and is the dominant visual element in the
City. The river channel is only about 100 feet wide, but the river plain varies between 500 feet and 800 feet wide. The
river plain is an attractive area that includes both riparian habitat and mature ponderosa pines.
Distinct Boundaries
 A low pass establishes a distinct entry to the City as one travels west on Highway 70 from Sierra Valley. The City
entry is equally well defined at the west portal. The south side of the City and the rail museum buildings come into
view as one driving east from Delleker rounds a curve in the highway adjacent to the river.
Compact Form
Portola is a compact City with boundaries and physical character defined by natural features. The City of Portola
currently covers an area of 1268 acres, about two square miles. The Middle Fork Feather River, the Union Pacific
Railroad and Highway 70 run parallel through the valley and divide the City in distinctly separate north and south
sectors. Existing land uses are located in a clear, functional pattern. The primary institutional uses are clustered in a
core along Gulling Street. These include the hospital, City Hall, the library, a City park, a County Sheriff substation,
the Post Office, and the schools.
Distinct Commercial Core Areas
The primary regional services and highway commercial uses are located along Highway 70. Businesses serve both the
local population and the regional traffic drawn by recreation opportunities. The commercial strip includes regional
services such as banking, restaurants and automobile services. South of the river, the Old Town commercial area along
Commercial Street provides small scale, local services and retail, and has the potential to become a tourism and
recreation center for the region.
Railroad Museum
The railroad museum is a unique facility that attracts rail enthusiasts, as well as casual visitors. It provides a focal point
for tourism and an anchor for economic development in the Old Town area. The City of Portola recognizes the
importance of the museum to the character of the City and as an attraction to visitors in the community. The City
Council endorses enhancements to the museum.
     Recreation Resources
     Portola residents enjoy a high level of recreation amenities in the surrounding forest, and in the City’s parks and
     community facilities. Recreation-oriented tourism, such as fishing at Lake Davis, has been a fundamental component
     of the local economy. There are substantial opportunities for expanding recreation including mountain biking, bicycle
     touring, fishing, golf, camping and a wide range of other activities.
     Historic and Cultural Resources
     The local area is rich in historic resources that can attract visitors to Portola. In addition, the natural setting provides
     opportunities to host cultural events and permanent facilities, such as museums that offer additional visitor attractions.
     Historic features within Portola include the Railroad Museum and the Williams Cabin. Nearby features include the
     Beckwourth Cabin and Johnsville historic mining museum within the Plumas-Eureka State Park.
     Public Services
     The City is unique in the east Plumas County region in the ability to provide public services required by urban
     development. The City can use basic infrastructure, including sewer and water systems, to direct and moderate urban
     growth.
     Hospital and Medical Services
     The Eastern Plumas Hospital located in Portola serves the residents of eastern Plumas County. Access to a quality
     hospital, ancillary health and emergency medical services are an important consideration for households, notably senior
     citizens, seeking a new home. The hospital is an important asset in Portola’s economic growth potential.
     Education and Training Resources
     Portola is the location of the elementary, middle and high school serving the local region. In addition, the educational
     opportunities include satellite courses offered by Feather River Community College in Portola, as well as the main
     campus in Quincy. The nearby University of Nevada, Reno offers a broad spectrum of courses.
1.10 GEOGRAPHIC AREA OF GENERAL PLAN STUDY
     This General Plan examines three geographic areas: the current City boundary, the current Sphere of Influence
     boundary and a General Plan Study Area boundary. The General Plan Study Area is approximately 17 square miles.
     The City of Portola currently occupies about two square miles. The purpose in establishing the Study Area boundary
     significantly larger than the existing City is to identify and evaluate the areas surrounding the City that may affect the
     future economic viability, traffic, services, and aesthetic quality of the City. In addition, since many issues such as air
     quality, traffic and economic development, extend beyond political boundaries, the law provides for planning outside of
     the jurisdiction’s territory.
     The General Plan must cover all territory within its boundaries as well as “any land outside its boundaries which in the
     planning agency’s judgment bears relation to its planning,” (Government Code Section 65300). A local government
     can formally communicate its concerns for the future of lands under its neighbors’ jurisdictions by this means.
     “Cooperative ‘extraterritorial’ planning can be used to guide the orderly and efficient extension of services and utilities,
     ensure the preservation of open space, agricultural, and resource conservation lands, and establish consistent standards
     for development in the plans of adjoining jurisdictions” (State of California General Plan Guidelines). It is for these
     purposes that the City of Portola General Plan Study Area boundary extends beyond the existing Sphere of Influence.
     However, the City of Portola will not necessarily seek to initiate annexation of land that is either in the Sphere of
     Influence or the General Plan Study Area.
     The area included in the General Plan Study Area considers proximity to the City, access to Highway 70, the terrain,
     and the potential for further urbanization as defined by land uses in the Plumas County General Plan.

1.11 AMENDMENTS TO THE GENERAL PLAN
     To ensure that the General Plan is true to the original vision and principles it should be reviewed at regular intervals of
     approximately five years. Periodic adjustments to the General Plan may occur from time to time, as development
     opportunities emerge.
1.12 ELEMENTS ADDRESSED IN THE GENERAL PLAN
     The California Government Code identifies seven mandatory elements of the General Plan. In addition to the mandated
     elements, the Government Code authorizes other General Plan elements which, in the judgment of the local legislative
     body, relate to the physical development of the community. Once adopted, these optional elements become an integral
     part of the General Plan with the same force and effect as the mandatory elements. The Portola General Plan is
     intended to guide the City in expanding economic growth and opportunities, while emphasizing quality of life issues,
     notably environmental conditions. Consequently, the General Plan includes the optional Community Design Element,
     Public Services and Facilities Element, and Economic Development element. These elements are intended to focus the
     plan on community quality, economic development, and environmental protection.
     The Government Code permits a city to combine elements and issues in the General Plan as appropriate to the local
     conditions. The Portola General Plan takes advantage of this provision in combining the mandatory Open Space
     Element with the mandatory Conservation Element.
     The City of Portola General Plan includes the following elements:
                   v    Land Use (mandatory)
                   v    Community Design (optional)
                   v    Circulation (mandatory)
                   v    Economic Development (optional)
                   v    Public Services and Facilities (optional)
                   v    Safety (mandatory)
                   v    Open Space and Conservation (combined mandatory elements)
                   v    Noise (mandatory)
                   v    Air Quality (optional)
                   v    Housing (mandatory)
     Organization of the Elements
     Each element provides goals, policies, and implementation measures. The policies and implementation measures are
     grouped by sub-topic. The policy statements are followed by implementation measures that relate to those policies.
     For certain topics the implementation measures may relate to more than one policy, just as the policies may relate to
     more than one goal. Where the policies and implementation may relate to a topic in another element, the policy is cross
     referenced to the other element(s).
     An example of the format for the goals, policies, and implementation measures follows:
     Goal LU-1.         Enhance the quality of life and physical environment in the City.
              CD-P-20.           Establish a special pedestrian area in Old Town to accommodate tourism and shopping and
                                 services for local residents.
              CD-I-37.           Adopt guidelines for commercial buildings that reflect the history of the region, and
                                 compatible with the climate.
      Each goal, policy, and implementation measure includes an identifying number. The letter code identifies the element
      in this General Plan. The letter following the element identification indicates “P” for policy, or “I” for implementation.
      The policies and implementation measures are grouped under an appropriate heading for quick identification. The
      number following the identifier code is the number of the policy or implementation measure. The numbers are
      sequential and continuous through each element.
2. LAND USE ELEMENT
      This Land Use Element establishes the physical framework for development of Portola. It defines the location, use
      characteristics, and intensity of land uses throughout the City.

    Authority
    The Land Use Element is mandated by the California Government Code. The statute requires:
                    “ a Land Use Element which designates the proposed general distribution, location, and extent
                    of the uses of the land for housing; business; industry; open space, including agriculture, natural
                    resources, recreation and enjoyment of scenic beauty; education; public buildings and grounds;
                    solid and liquid waste-disposal facilities; and other categories of public and private uses of
                    land”
    Relationship to Other Elements
    The Land Use Element is a cornerstone of the General Plan. All other aspects of the General Plan relate to the land use
    and the physical form of the City. The City form is established in the land use policies and the General Plan Diagram.
    The type, intensity and location of land use described in the Plan directly influences, and is influenced by, economic
    development potential, housing, traffic generation and circulation patterns, requirements for public services and
    utilities, safety from hazards, and environmental protection. All of these factors interact for the enhancement of the
    overall community.
    The other General Plan elements are linked through the Land Use Element. In turn, the Land Use Element is
    influenced, and constrained in some instances, by the goals and policies established in other elements. Existing and
    potential land use in the City and surrounding area is affected by environmental factors. These factors establish design
    requirements that will influence the character and density of development and, in some instances, limit the potential for
    new development.
    The Land Use Element and the Open Space and Conservation Element are closely related in that they both deal with the
    use of land. The Open Space and Conservation Element addresses the management of land and resources in the areas
    where urban development is excluded or minimized. Similarly, the Safety Element is linked to land use by defining
    potential hazard areas and limiting the extent and character of development that will be permitted in such areas.
    Land use drives the need for circulation and public infrastructure, and thus the Land Use Element is linked to the
    Circulation Element and the Public Facilities Element. Land use is also linked to the Housing Element by defining the
    land area and conditions for housing opportunities, and by establishing the employment-generating land uses that will
    create additional housing demand. Finally, the Land Use Element defines the land uses that influence the economic
    opportunities and fiscal stability of the community, and thus is linked to the Economic Development Element.
    The Land Use Element is perhaps most closely linked to the Community Design Element. The two elements address
    the fundamental issues dealing with the use of land and development of urban uses. The Land Use Element focuses on
    the definition of land use categories and the location of land uses. The Community Design Element addresses the
    details of community form, and the quality of the built environment. The two elements are organized in parallel fashion
    to facilitate cross-referencing.
2.1 OVERALL LAND USE GOALS
    The land use goals will guide the overall development of the City. Guiding policies and implementation policies based
    on these goals will direct in-fill development, expansion of new land use areas, and improvement of existing land uses.
    Goal LU-1.           Provide for land uses that expand employment, education, recreation, and cultural opportunities for
                         residents. Reinforce Portola as the commercial and service center for eastern Plumas County.
    Goal LU-2.           Protect and preserve natural environmental features and amenities.
    Goal LU-3.           Reinforce strong urban design, quality development, and a compact City form.
    Goal LU-4.           Encourage mixed land uses but provide physical separation or design buffers between incompatible
                         land uses.

    Goal LU-5.         Retain the existing commercial and civic core as the cultural and functional center of the City.
    Goal LU-6.         Reinforce land use and development patterns that encourage walking and the use of local public
                       transit within the community.
    Goal LU-7.         Complete in-fill development of the unimproved portions of the City.
    Goal LU-8.         Maintain access to open space within the urban portions of the City, particularly the Middle Fork
                       Feather River.
    Goal LU-9.         Provide multiple locations for recreation and cultural activities within the existing City core area.
    Goal LU-10.        Ensure that the mix of land uses results in a balance between public revenues and public service
                       demands.
    Goal LU-11.        Establish orderly growth in new development areas to ensure logical public service areas.
2.2 KEY LAND USE ISSUES
    Jobs/Housing Balance
    “Jobs/housing balance” is the relationship between the number of jobs and the number of housing units available within
    the community. In a balanced community workers can find decent housing adequate to their household needs and
    affordable to their household income. Job growth and economic development depends on a supply of quality,
    affordable housing. A jobs/housing imbalance is detrimental to the economic stability of a community.
    It is assumed that most households have between 1 and 1.3 workers. Therefore the ideal condition for a small city is
    that number of local jobs is about equal to or slightly higher than the number of households. Where the number of jobs
    is in balance with the number of housing units there is less need for workers to commute outside the community to find
    work. Such is not the case in most contemporary American cities. Long commutes indicate that jobs and housing are
    not balanced. The future will find Portola residents working in a variety of settings: at home, at small businesses in
    town, at one of the nearby recreation communities, and commuting out to Reno and elsewhere. The General Plan is a
    tool for guiding land use so that jobs and housing grow together.
    Public Service Land Area Requirements
    New population will generate the need for additional space for schools, parks, and institutional uses. The civic and
    commercial core should be augmented by multiple activity centers such as parks, public squares, and public buildings.
    The intent is to provide several locations that can accommodate special events and places of interest to attract tourists.
    Multiple activity centers will also provide spaces that can be coordinated to host large, multi-venue special events, or to
    host multiple small events concurrently.
    Balance Community Growth with Revenues Required for Public Services
    Growth in land use will provide additional revenues, but will also place additional service burdens on the City of
    Portola. The challenge to cities is to balance growth with funds for required new services. All components, residential
    as well as commercial and industrial, are necessary to the overall stability of a city. The intent is to ensure that the City
    can provide needed public services and that the land uses generate sufficient revenues to fund services adequate to meet
    public needs.
    Types of Land Use
    Once the overall form of the City and the general location of land use is established, the type of land uses, or “land use

    categories” applied in the Land Use Element are described in Section 2.5. The Land Use Element establishes land use
    categories tailored to meet the specific needs of the City. Economic development opportunities, housing needs and
    environmental characteristics are among the factors that determine the appropriate land use categories.
    The land use categories established in this General Plan will be implemented through revision of the City Municipal
    Code, Zoning Ordinance.
    Community Form, Scale, and Character
    The developed portion of the City should retain its distinct, compact form with clear, well-defined edges. The existing
    civic and commercial core area should be retained and reinforced as the functional and social center of the City for
    residents. The scale of the City should permit walking and bicycling (during the appropriate seasons) to major activity
    centers such as shopping, recreation facilities, and schools. Commercial, employment, recreational and institutional
    land uses should be conveniently located to the residential neighborhoods. High activity areas should be located to
    facilitate the use of public transit.
    The general form, scale and character of land use in the community, and the connection to open space and the location
    and character of public space are addressed in the Community Design Element, Section 3.4.
    Open Space and Natural Features
    The land uses must ensure that scenic corridors and natural features are protected from incompatible development.
    Urban development should be located and designed so that natural features, such as creeks, the Feather River, the
    surrounding forest, and mountain vistas, are preserved as the defining visual characteristics of the City. The intent is to
    enhance the relationship of the creeks, forests, and river to the adjacent land uses by improving access for recreation,
    and by enhancing the view from the adjacent land uses.
    Land Use Location
    The Land Use Element defines the location of all planned land use in the City, the Sphere of Influence and the General
    Plan study area. The distribution and intensity of land use is influenced by the physical characteristics of the City, the
    compatibility of land uses and proximity to major circulation routes, among many other factors. Preservation of open
    space and natural features integral to the character of the community are primary considerations in determining the
    appropriate location of land uses.
2.3 GENERAL PLAN DIAGRAM (LAND USE MAP)
    The Land Use Element illustrates the location of each land use category in a General Plan Diagram, or land use map
    shown in this Element as Figure 2-1. The location of each land use is affected by environmental constraints,
    compatibility with other land uses, the overall concept for development of the City, and the capacity of the circulation
    systems and public infrastructure systems to accommodate development. The text and policies of the Land Use
    Element and the General Plan Diagram establish a framework for the physical development of the City. As required by
    state law, land use classifications, shown as letter designations, labels or graphic patterns on the Diagram, specify a
    range for population density and building intensity for each type of designated land use.
    The location of land uses in this General Plan considers environmental conditions, the compatibility of land uses, the
    capacity of the circulation system and the basic sewer and water systems to accommodate growth in subareas of the
    City. The General Plan Land Use Diagram also takes into consideration the urban form of the City and the distribution
    of activity centers that support community life and tourism.
    2.3.1     General Plan Sub-Areas
    The General Plan Study Area, including the land within the existing City and the surrounding land outside the City, is

divided into sub-areas that are useful in describing the General Plan land use concepts and intentions. Each sub-area
may contain more than one Land Use designation.
North Neighborhood
This area contains the existing neighborhood north of Highway 70 extending up to Joy Way. The primary role of this
sub-area is to retain the existing stock of housing and to encourage in-fill in the existing lots. Further development is
constrained by the lack of sewer, water and finished streets to serve the existing lots.
Rural North
North of Joy Way is an area of rural large lot development. This area will most likely build out in the existing pattern
of one-acre to five-acre home sites, but may also include clusters of smaller residential lots. They effect a transition
between the small lots within the City and the forest and meadows further to the north and west along Lake Davis Road.
There is additional potential in this area for large lot development and visitor commercial or recreation use, such as a
guest ranch, conference center, or retreat.
South Neighborhood
This area contains the existing neighborhood south of Commercial Street and west of Gulling Street, including
Ridgewood. As with the North Neighborhood, the primary land use purpose here is to retain and improve the existing
stock of housing and to encourage in-fill in the existing lots. This area also includes undeveloped land east of Third
Street that requires additional sewer, water, and road improvement to make existing lots available for use.
Sierra Street Commercial Core
The Sierra Street (Highway 70) Commercial Core will be the regional business center and a tourism and recreation
center. Land uses will include conventional retail and service businesses oriented to the regional needs, restaurants,
tourist-oriented lodging, retail and service shops, space for public events and recreation. The core extends from one end
of the City to the other along Highway 70. The east end is oriented more to offices, small shops, and local-serving
businesses on the north side of the highway. The west end is envisioned as oriented to regional as well as local
businesses. A site suitable for redevelopment as a shopping center with a market and other shops and services is
designated.
River Park (River Walk)
The river front along the north side of the river provides a unique setting for commercial and service land uses.
Businesses, shops and restaurants, lodging and public spaces are envisioned along the south side of Sierra Street to the
river. Existing buildings overlooking the river can be converted to resident services and tourist business use.
Old Town
This includes the area along Commercial Street and extends to Colorado Street and the old railroad hospital site on the
west. The intent is to establish a special commercial and tourist core area with shops, restaurants, public space for
recreation and leisure activities. The Portola Railroad Museum is a key element in this area that will attract visitors to
the City.
Southeast Quadrant
This area includes the mix of residential, light industrial, and institutional uses (park, churches, hospital, and cemetery)
east of South Gulling Street. Although platted as individual lots in the original City subdivision map, this area includes
substantial vacant land and has limited sewer, water, and roads. It can be redeveloped in any pattern suitable for more
modern development. This area is planned to become an expanded residential neighborhood and a new business/light
industrial center. It may also include additional public or private institutional uses such as a conference center, a health
center, recreation facilities, and other special purpose facilities.
Woodbridge
This area south of the high school has long been designated as a residential neighborhood. Uses as approved in the
Tentative Map include commercial, business professional/light industrial, various types of housing clustered in the
relatively flatter areas and low density housing in the steeper areas, and an extensive open space and trail system.
Southwest Quadrant
The southwest quadrant is located along the south side of the river, west of the existing City boundary. This area is
suitable for providing additional housing. Development of this area will provide the local circulation routes that could
ultimately be required for connection to a second crossing of the river near Delleker.
Portola Heights
Portola Heights is an existing underdeveloped neighborhood immediately west of the City and north of Highway 70.
The area is designed and designated for small-lot residential development. The developed portions have public sewer
and water provided by the City. It is anticipated that this area will develop in the existing pattern with minor changes
for more efficient development.
West Neighborhood
To the west of Lake Davis Road and north of Portola Heights is an area suitable for a new residential neighborhood.
The area includes a 160-acre parcel owned by the US Forest Service that would have to be acquired or exchanged to
allow new development. The location could easily be served by the City sewer and water system and is relatively flat.
It would accommodate residential uses in clusters and additional park land to serve the City residents. Development of
this area would include a through street that connects the Lake Davis Road to Highway 70 west of Delleker and thereby
provides a northern route paralleling the highway.
Highway 70 Corridor
The Highway 70 Corridor extends from the existing City boundary to Mabie on the west. The corridor includes the
existing Delleker area and the commercial, quasi-industrial and residential uses permitted by the County along the
highway. With relatively flat land and good highway access this area will continue to attract development. The
General Plan anticipates additional commercial, light industrial, institutional, and residential uses in this area. The
Community Design Element establishes design concepts and standards that will enhance this area such that it will
provide an attractive entry to the City.
West Meadows
Between the Highway Corridor and the steep slopes to the north is an area that may develop in cluster residential use.
The residences will be in predominantly low-density designations, but medium density residential development may
occur where the housing is clustered for aesthetic reasons and to avoid environmentally sensitive areas.
Northeast Quadrant
The area east of the existing City boundary and Sphere of Influence is primarily designated for residential and
recreation use. The area extends to east of Grizzly Road in the County and includes the Cedars project area. The
General Plan does not propose changes to the uses in this area.
TABLE 2-1
POPULATION GROWTH PROJECTION
2.4     LAND USE DESIGNATIONS
        The Land Use Element is required to include a statement of the standards of population density and building intensity
        recommended for the various districts and other territory covered by the General Plan. This section describes the types
        of land use the City will need to meet environmental protection, economic development, jobs/housing balance and
        public service goals. The land use categories established in this General Plan define the range of activities that are
        permitted in Portola.
        The categories define specific classes of land use, but they are intended to provide flexibility in implementing the
        General Plan policies. Under state law, the Land Use Element of the General Plan must establish standards of
        population density and building intensity for each land use category.
        The density/intensity standards do not indicate that development projects will be approved at the maximum density or
        intensity specified for each use. Zoning regulations consistent with General Plan policies and/or site conditions may
        reduce development potential within the stated ranges. The City’s Zoning Ordinance contains more detailed provisions
        and standards for regulating the use and intensity of permitted development.
        More than one zoning district may be consistent with a General Plan land use category.
TABLE 2-2
PROJECTION OF RESIDENTIAL UNITS AND ACRES

         2.4.1    Residential Land Use Categories
         Four residential land use categories are established to provide for development of a full range of housing types
         appropriate in the City. Housing densities are stated as the number of housing units per gross acre of developable land,
         excluding areas subject to physical, environmental, or geologic constraints and areas dedicated for green ways or
         natural resource protection. At least one housing unit may be built on each existing legal lot designated for residential
         use. Dwelling units may be clustered within a General Plan land use category according to standards established in the
         City’s Zoning Ordinance and in the Community Design Element of this General Plan.
         Residential units in addition to the number of dwellings permitted in the conventional zoning districts may occur as:
                       •    second dwelling units on single family lots permitted by the City’s Zoning Ordinance;
                       •    state-mandated density bonuses for provision of affordable housing; and
                       •    residential units included in the various commercial land use categories.

                                                                      properties that require streets, water
                                                                      and sewer service in order to be
                                                                      developed
Rural Residential (RR): Up to 0.2 units per gross acre (5-acre minimum parcel size)
The Rural Residential (RR) category is intended to accommodate large estate residential properties at the periphery of
Portola. This designation will allow private equestrian facilities and tourist or recreation commercial uses such as a
guest ranch, equestrian center, a golf course and golf training center, cross-country ski area, or conference center.
Special use structures such as lodges and recreation activity structures may also occur. Such uses allow non-resident
over-night guests or participants that are not included in the population for this residential category.
Development will typically be single family residences and accessory structures. In order to protect environmental
resources, such as meadows and creeks, the residential lots may be clustered in densities that are higher than the
nominal density permitted in this designation. Where appropriate to the environmental setting and the type of
development, attached dwellings will be considered in the Zoning Ordinance under conditional use permit provisions.
Dwelling units may be clustered on smaller lots provided that:
              •    Plumas County standards for septic systems are met, except that any lot less than 2.5 acres in size
                   shall have public sewer and water.
              •    A minimum of 25 percent of the project is allocated to permanent open space.
              •    The average density in the cluster area does not exceed 0.4 units per gross acre.
              •    The minimum lot size in the cluster development shall be 1/3 acre with a minimum frontage of 100
                   feet.
Examples of an appropriate cluster or attached type of development include a guest ranch or conference center. The
design of such structures and the associated improvements shall be consistent with the environmental setting. This will
typically mean buildings in proportion to the surroundings, use of traditional, durable materials and minimal site
grading.
The local roads in the Rural Residential designated areas may be constructed to a rural standard where the average lot is
one half acre or larger in size.
The Rural Residential uses are located in areas constrained by slopes, meadows and environmentally sensitive areas.

The land use restrictions defined in the Open Space and Conservation Element and the Community Design Element will
affect the potential density and location of residential development in this category. The category will typically be in
proximity to low density residential use and open space, but may be near compatible commercial uses and higher
density special purpose residential uses.
The average density assumed for General Plan buildout calculations is 0.2 units per gross acre.
Low Density Residential (LDR): From 0.2 to 1 unit per gross acre (1 acre to 5 acre parcels)
The Low Density Residential designation is intended to provide single family lots and related uses similar to those
currently found on the periphery of the City. The category will typically provide a transition to medium density
residential use from rural residential land use, but may be near compatible institutional and commercial uses and higher
density special purpose residential uses.
Development within this land use category will typically be single family residences and accessory structures.
Accessory structures are limited to garages, storage structures, planting sheds and green houses, and similar structures
ancillary to the primary residence. This designation will also allow tourist or recreation commercial uses such as a
guest ranch, equestrian center, a golf course and golf training center, cross-country ski area or conference center. Such
uses allow non-resident over-night guests or participants that are not included in the population for this residential
category.
Roads and other public improvements may be developed to rural standards, as described in the Circulation Element and
the Community Design Element of this General Plan, provided that the roads can meet the standards for maintenance,
and on-street parking, where permitted.
Clustering is encouraged to avoid areas of environmental sensitivity and to minimize the length of roads and public
utilities. The maximum density in this designation may be increased to 2 units per gross acre for clustered development
with smaller lots if a minimum of 25 percent of the project is allocated to permanent open space, and the average
density does not exceed 1 unit per gross acre. The minimum lot size in the clustered development shall be 1/4 acre with
a minimum frontage of 80 feet. Any lot less than 2.5 acres in size shall have public sewer and water.
The average density assumed for General Plan buildout calculations is 1 unit per gross acre.
Medium Density Residential (MDR): From 1 to 8 units per gross acre (1 acre to 4,000 square foot parcels)
The Medium Density Residential designation is intended primarily for single family detached dwellings on individual
lots, although this density range will also accommodate duplex and attached dwellings, including apartments and
condominiums. Typical lots would range from 6,000 to 20,000 square feet, however, lots as small as 4,000 square feet
may be permitted in cluster configurations to avoid environmentally sensitive areas.
This category includes the existing urban style residential neighborhoods in the City. Neighborhoods in the medium
density land use category will include the standard residential street with curb and gutter as described in the Circulation
Element and the Community Design Element.
The average density assumed for General Plan buildout calculations is 4 units per gross acre.
High Density Residential (HDR): From 8 to 15 units per gross acre) (4,000 square foot to 2,250 square foot
parcels)
The High Density Residential category provides for attached or multi-family dwelling units. Such units are to be
located in close proximity to public services and commercial uses, but may also be included as a component in
recreation-oriented developments in the peripheral areas of the City. The minimum building area allocated for each
dwelling unit in a multi-unit project shall be 2,250 square feet of net area (i.e. exclusive of streets, open space and other
public rights-of-way). Lot sizes will include a minimum of two residential units and will typically be a minimum of
5,000 square feet.
Dwelling types may include attached or detached single-family housing, duplexes, triplexes, townhouses and
apartments.
The average density assumed for General Plan buildup calculations is 10 units per gross acre.
Home Occupancy
All residential uses will allow home occupancy businesses subject to the standards established in the City’s Zoning
Ordinance. It is anticipated that the percentage of individuals working at home will increase during twenty year span of
this General Plan. At home workers may include telecommuters, professional service sole practitioners, small service
businesses, mail order businesses, and other entrepreneurial endeavors. It is the intent of this General Plan to support
such activities as a means of furthering local economic development. The residential design standards are intended to
provide the flexibility to include most types of small business within the premises.
The design standards for live/work housing are addressed in the City’s Zoning Ordinance.
2.4.2     Commercial Land Use Categories
Although Portola is a relatively small community the commercial land uses, both existing and potential, are varied.
Therefore, the General Plan Diagram identifies two distinct commercial land use categories.
For nonresidential uses the land use intensity is addressed as the maximum percent of a lot that can be covered by a
building. The Zoning Ordinance shall provide specific exceptions to the building coverage limitations for uses with
low employee densities, such as wholesaling and distribution, or low peak-hour traffic generation, such as a hospital.
Core Commercial (CC)
The Core Commercial category is intended to accommodate the businesses, institutions and services for the residents of
Portola and eastern Plumas County. It includes retail and service businesses oriented to tourists and travelers, eating
and drinking establishments, commercial recreation, service stations, financial, business and personal services, motels,
public recreation and social services. Open air cafes and retail sales are permitted in this land use designation provided
that the outdoor sales and restaurant areas are separated from the pedestrian walkway and street by a low, open type
fence. Umbrellas, canopies and other temporary coverings, pedestrian scale lighting and signs will be permitted in
these areas as regulated by the City Zoning Ordinance.
Arts and Crafts Production
The Core Commercial designation will include live/work/sales environments to support the local production of arts
such as sculpture, murals, paintings, furniture, and similar artists products. The product of such activities may be sold
and the artist may maintain living quarters on the premises. The intent is to encourage the development of artist and
craftsman workshops as a component of local economic development and the character of the community.
The Core Commercial designation is generally applied to properties on Commercial Street and the Sierra Street
(Highway 70) corridor.
The maximum allowable building coverage is 50 percent. Limitations on the size and location of parking and the
orientation of the buildings and design standards may restrict the building coverage to less than 50 percent. The
parking requirements in this category are described in the City’s Zoning Ordinance. Each use shall have sufficient
parking to meet the requirements set forth in these standards either in a parking lot on-site, or in a common parking area
within 800 feet of the site.

Commercial Mixed Use (CMU)
The purpose of the Commercial Mixed Use designation is to establish locations that include residential use in addition
to employment centers, retail commercial, professional office, tourist commercial, visitor-oriented commercial
activities, including hotels and motels, private commercial and public recreation facilities, convention and meeting
facilities, recreational vehicle parks, campgrounds, retail shops, restaurants and related services. Properties fronting on
the river are suitable for small retail, lodging, restaurants, services, and office space. The uses are to be oriented to the
river view and the recreation amenities planned along the north side of the river. Other than pre-existing uses,
residential uses cannot be the primary land use and must be a minimum of four dwelling units per acre. The
Commercial Mixed-Use category may also be used as a transition between the commercial uses and adjacent residential
neighborhoods. The maximum building coverage ratio (exclusive of residential uses) is 50 percent.
Service Commercial (SC)
Service Commercial is intended for commercial uses that have heavy truck traffic, are engaged in the sale of bulk
products, such as sand and gravel, or automobile repair and tire sales. Service commercial uses typically require large
retail space, large storage areas, and large parking areas. The Service Commercial areas are located along Sierra Street,
primarily in Delleker. The maximum building coverage ratio is 50 percent.
2.4.3      Business Professional/Light Industrial (BP/LI)
The Business Professional/Light Industrial designation is intended to accommodate light industrial, light assembly
regional services, public and private commercial recreation, small warehouse and distribution, communications and
information services, mail order services, and research and development businesses appropriate to the City’s setting.
The designation is intended to accommodate relatively small buildings in wooded settings. Buildings will be integrated
with the site and the maximum building coverage will be 50 percent. Design standards specified in the Community
Design Element will guide the development and use of this designation such that business uses in this will be
compatible with and may be integrated with other uses in the City.
2.4.4      Public/Quasi-Public (P/QP)
This designation includes civic and institutional uses such as the City Hall, the library, the hospital, the post office,
parks, and schools. Private institutional uses include meeting halls, private schools, and churches.
2.4.5      Utilities (U)
The Utilities designation includes the “infrastructure” in the community, such as the landfill, wastewater treatment plant
and ponds, and the railroad. Development within these areas is generally restricted to the facilities associated with the
primary utility.
2.4.6      Open Space/Conservation (OSC)
The Open Space and Conservation designation covers those areas of the City in which development is constrained by
an historic, cultural, aesthetic, or natural environmental condition. These areas include drainages and the river front
area.
Open space areas may permit rural residential uses, recreation uses, visitor commercial or interim uses, such as special
events under conditions prescribed in the City Zoning Ordinance, the Community Design Element and the Open Space
and Conservation Element.
2.4.7      Overlay Designations
Wild and Scenic River (WSR)
The Middle Fork Feather River is Federally designated as a Wild and Scenic River. The Wild and Scenic River Act

    (Public Law 90-542, October 2, 1968) declares that “. . .certain selected rivers of the Nation which, with their
    immediate environments, possess outstandingly remarkable scenic, recreational, geologic, fish and wildlife, historic,
    cultural, or other similar values shall be preserved in free-flowing condition, and that they and their immediate
    environments shall be protected for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations”. The Act prohibits
    new commercial or industrial uses which do not preserve the free-flowing condition of the river, and which do not
    protect the river’s immediate environment. The Act also requires protection of the bank lands by means of acreage,
    frontage, and setback requirements on development.
    The General Plan Land Use Diagram does not include a separate category for the Feather River corridor other than the
    Federal Wild and Scenic River designation. However, the General Plan includes specific development and open space
    standards and guidelines intended to guide use of this special resource. The Community Design Element includes
    specific design standards for the buildings along the river and community access to the river (Section 3.7). The Public
    Services and Facilities Element includes recommended recreation facilities to be included in the river corridor, and the
    Circulation Element describes the bikeway connections that will use the open space adjacent to the river. The
    Conservation and Open Space Element includes specific policies for the use of the land within the Wild and Scenic
    River designation.
    Floodplain (FP)
    The area immediately adjacent to the Middle Fork Feather River falls within a designated Federal Emergency
    Management Agency (FEMA) floodplain. This floodplain is a special flood hazard area that is inundated by a 100-year
    flood. The use of the land within the 100-year flood plain is regulated by standards that require all occupiable
    development to be above the predicted flood elevation.
2.5 PROJECTED POPULATION GROWTH
    The land area required to accommodate future development is determined by population increases and economic
    development. The land plan seeks to maintain a balance between population and economic growth, and the effects of
    growth.
    The Portola population grew steadily from 1910 to 1950, but declined from 1950 through 1970. From 1970 through the
    early 1990’s population gained slowly, but did not recover to the same level of population found in 1950. Population
    growth was modest through the 1990’s.
    New population growth in Portola is likely to come from three primary sources:
    (1) Population growth in California and northern Nevada will generate a spill over effect as people seek to relocate to
    small communities from increasing development in more urban areas.
    (2) An aging population will generate an increase in retirees seeking small communities for second homes or a
    permanent retirement home.
    (3) Economic development will generate new job growth in service and tourism industries, and growth in small
    businesses whose leaders can choose a location based primarily on quality of life considerations.
    The cumulative effect of these factors is difficult to project because the current population in the City is very small.
    The overall growth rate in California will increase the pressure for population growth throughout the state, but the rate
    of increase will not be matched in all areas. Individual communities will grow faster or slower than the overall state
    projection. Moreover, in a small community like Portola the annual percent of growth is not as significant as the actual
    number of new residents. Because the community is relatively small, population projections based on an annual
    average percentage increase are not meaningful. With a population base just above 2,000 residents, a relatively small
    increase in absolute population could translate to a high growth rate, yet there would be little noticeable effect on the
    community from year to year.
    Nonetheless, the cumulative effect over time will be noticeable, and significant in a small community such as Portola.

    Table 2-1 summarizes a projection of population growth in the City through 2020, a twenty year time horizon. The
    table applies three growth rate assumptions: 2 percent, 3 percent and 5 percent.
    At a compound growth rate of 5 percent annually the population in the City will reach a total of 5,678 persons in twenty
    years, a net increase of 3,538 persons.
    The growth rate anticipated in the original General Plan 2020 has not been revised in the General Plan Update, although
    the City has not experienced any growth since 2000. Preliminary census figures have documented a slight decline in
    population from 2,227 in 2000 to 2,109 in 2010. The General Plan Update still plans to accommodate future growth.
2.6 PROJECTION OF LAND AREA TO ACCOMMODATE FUTURE GROWTH
    Full development of all land use in the General Plan Study Area would accommodate a population substantially larger
    than 5,678. However, the population growth anticipated in this Land Use Element can be accommodated within the
    existing City boundary if adequate land area is allocated in appropriate locations, and the necessary supporting land
    uses and infrastructure is available when needed. If additional land is annexed to the City, the potential population will
    increase in proportion to the development potential of the new land area.
    The estimate of the required land area is determined by the projected population in twenty years, the average number of
    persons in a dwelling, and the average density (dwelling units per acre). Land area for commercial uses, schools and
    parks are added to support the projected population. This estimate provides a general guideline, not an absolute
    benchmark for future land use allocations. Within broad ranges of land use mix the City can assign specific land use
    and adjust to accommodate changes in demand over the period of this General Plan.
    Average Household Size
    The average household size during the General Plan time horizon is assumed to be 2.8 persons per household. This
    assumption is based on household size in the City in 2000. The household size may fluctuate over a period of decades.
    For example, if Portola attracts a significant number of retired persons the average household size may actually decline
    over time.
    Average Dwelling Density
    For the purposes of estimating future land area required, it is assumed that the average density of all dwelling units
    constructed in the next twenty years will be three units per acre. This allows for a mix of higher density in-fill
    development on existing urban lots at approximately seven units per acre, and development of new residential
    neighborhoods including small lots and multi-family residences, manufactured housing, and larger single family and
    estate lots. The dwelling density is the average number of dwelling units on a developed acre in the City. Dwelling
    density depends on many other factors, such as the type of employment available, the amount of in-fill development
    that occurs, the percentage of retirees that locate in the City.
    The land area allocated for residential use in the Land Use Element will accommodate the highest level of growth
    anticipated, five percent. This will be considered the “build-out” population for this General Plan. However, the
    General Plan will also be effective if a lower rate of growth occurs. At an average of 2.8 persons per household the
    number of dwelling units required to house the projected population is shown in Table 2-2.
    Land Area Required for Jobs/Housing Balance
    The land area requirements for development of the City also include the non-residential land uses, public facilities and
    open space. Retail and service commercial, business-professional and industrial land use will increase as the population
    of the City and east Plumas County increases. Tourism and other economic development may increase the demand of
    service and retail commercial land above that created solely by population growth.
    The precise amount of commercial land area cannot be projected, but an approximation of the land area required can be
    estimated on the basis of an average jobs/housing ratio. The jobs/housing ratio depends on:

               •    the number of resident workers,
               •    the number of households,
               •    the average commercial or industrial space required per employee, and
               •    the average density of housing supply.
An estimate of the ratio of land required for a balance of jobs and housing in the City is based on the following
assumptions. On average, there will be 1.3 workers per household, that is, each dwelling unit will have 1.3 workers.
However, this average could be less if the population includes a large percentage of retired persons. The percentage of
retired persons cannot be estimated in this General Plan.
Land Area Required to Accommodate Employed Residents
The land area required to accommodate each worker varies greatly from industry to industry. For the purposes of
establishing a balance of land use in the General Plan it is assumed that on average each worker will require
approximately 500 square feet of work space. The average commercial space in Portola covers approximately thirty
percent of the land. Each acre of non-residential land use can accommodate about 25 employees. At a ratio of 1.3
workers per dwelling unit and an average of three dwelling units per acre, there are approximately four resident workers
for each acre of residential land use. On this assumption, one acre of commercial, business/professional or industrial
land is required to balance six acres of residential use.
Land Area Required for Institutional Uses and Public Services
Public facilities, including schools, parks, hospitals, civic centers and fire stations require additional land area on the
ratio of approximately 1 acre for each 10 acres of residential use. Open space and natural resource areas occupy
approximately 30 percent of the total land area in the community.
Land Area Required for Fiscal Balance
The revenues required to support City services come from many sources, but two of the most important continue to be
sales tax and property tax. In the foreseeable local government financing environment cities must consider the balance
between the demand for services and the potential for new development to generate revenue. The overall health of the
community depends on a balance of land uses. Non-residential uses may generate high revenues relative to service
demands, but the residential uses are necessary to support the non-residential uses. The intent in this Land Use Element
is to ensure that the overall balance of land use is sustained over time.
Infill Neighborhoods
The City includes three neighborhoods that were by-passed and not developed in the early years of the City growth.
Despite being located near the center of the City, see Figure 2-2, these neighborhoods were passed over because the
terrain made the area uneconomical to develop. Nonetheless, the lots were subdivided, and exist today as legal lots.
Development of these areas remains impractical for individual land owners due to the high cost of extending roads,
sewer, water and other utilities to single family residential lots. Yet, the neighborhoods are ideally located relative to
existing and planned services and retail areas. These in-fill areas will provide additional land area needed for
population growth and economic development. Due to the high cost of development for individual owners it is likely
that the City of Portola, or other public or private entity in cooperation with the City, will take the lead in organizing the
property owners to plan and develop these areas. Organizing and developing these lots may require reconfiguring them
to provide larger lots and/or new lot shapes and street alignments to conform to the terrain.
In 2002, 2007, and 2009 the Planning Commission and City Council sent letters, made direct contact with property
owners, and conducted a survey with information regarding the formation of an assessment district (for road
improvements) and Specific Plan areas (for the potential of reconfiguring neighborhoods). Generally, property owners
were not interested in forming an assessment district or Specific Plan. Further analysis should continue as directed by
the Planning Commission and City Council.

        Growth Monitoring: Balancing Land Use and Public Needs
        The mix of land use in the City should be monitored periodically to inform future decisions on land use, public service
        levels, and capital investments. The process for monitoring growth should occur in the annual budgeting process. The
        annual budget statement should include a summation of the overall mix of land use.
        The mix of land uses in the City will vary from time-to-time. The changes in land use will be particularly noticeable
        because Portola is a small community. Any single new industrial use or a single new residential subdivision will affect
        the balance of land uses. There is a range of land uses that will provide a balance of jobs and housing, adequate space
        for public uses, fiscal stability, and quality of life.
        This range provides a general guideline for the mix of all land use in the City. It is not intended to be a specific
        measure of community health and stability, and should be expected to shift and change over five to ten years. The mix
        of land uses in the City is a mosaic that will change and evolve as the community continues to diversify and mature.
        The range established in this Land Use Element is intended to gauge the course of future development. The range in
        Table 2-3 should be considered a picture of the unfolding future. Individual development proposals should be
        evaluated as to how well they contribute to completion of the picture. If the picture is incomplete, such as a shortage of
        adequate space for new jobs, or parks or new housing, the City should seek to maintain the balance and complete the
        picture. This can be done by amending the General Plan to change the available supply of land, and implementing
        strategies to accelerate economic development.
TABLE 2-3
TARGET RANGE OF LAND USE MIX
                       Land Use Type                                Percent of Total Land Area
                       Residential Low/Medium Density                        55% to 65%
                       Residential High Density                              3% to 6%
                       Commercial and Other Non-Residential                  9% to 12%
                       Public Land Use (including roads)                     15% to 20%
                       Urban Open Space                                      20% to 30%
        Urban open space in Table 2-3 primarily includes the undeveloped land along stream corridors and other open space set
        aside for safety, habitat protection, or aesthetic purposes. The Feather River is a substantial area that significantly
        increases the percentage of open space within Portola, compared to what may typically be found in other communities.
        Open space is an important characteristic of the City of Portola. A discussion of open space policies is found in the
        Conservation and Open Space Element (Section 8.5) in this General Plan.

         available concurrent with development.
LU-P-10. The City will assert its authority in reviewing proposals for residential, commercial, or
         industrial development in unincorporated areas within the General Plan Study Area. Urban
         development should occur within the City boundary.
LU-P-11. The City may initiate studies to investigate the potential of annexing areas within its Sphere
         of Influence or expanding the Sphere of Influence boundary. The studies should be focused
         on those areas that would be logically served and planned by the City in a manner consistent
         with the City General Plan goals and policies and the City's Annexation Policy.
LU-P-12. The City will consider applications for annexations that are consistent with the City's
         Annexation Policy and:
         a.        Are contiguous with City boundaries and provide for a logical expansion of the

Implementation: Land Use
       LU-I-1.  The City will continue to pursue a regional approach to planning and growth in the east
                Plumas County area. The City will seek public comment and early consultation with
                applicable agencies for major projects proposed either within or outside Portola. The intent
                of this consultation will be to provide public input to the process and to coordinate planning
                efforts between jurisdictions and minimize the impacts of growth to Portola and the
                surrounding region.
       LU-I-2.  The City Manager will coordinate preparation of a five-year public services report to the
                City Council in concert with that year'sbudget report. This report should document growth
                trends the capacity and level of service for public services and facility planning efforts.
       LU-I-3.  The City Manager will coordinate preparation of a five-year land use summary report to the
                City Council in concert with the that year's budget report. This report will document the
                growth in residential and commercial development and estimate the increase in employment
                in the City over the previous five year period.
       LU-I-4.  The land use summary shall include a reference to the range of land use mix in Table 2-3 in
                this Land Use Element and determine the then current and five year projection of land use in
                the City.
       LU-I-5.  In a public hearing process, the City shall establish guidelines and procedures for periodic
                monitoring and evaluation of the growth in the City budget, the number of dwelling units,
                growth in sales tax revenue and other factors that affect the fiscal stability and health of the
                City. The intent is to maintain balance over time, rather than on a project-by-project basis.
       LU-I-6.  With input from the public and the affected property owners, the City shall initiate a study to
                determine an appropriate and feasible land plan for the in-fill areas. The City shall
                coordinate the preparation of a master plan that may result in reconfiguration of existing lots
                to achieve a more efficient and feasible land use and street plan.
       LU-I-7.  With input from the public and the affected property owners, the City shall initiate a plan for
                providing infrastructure to the in-fill areas. The plan will include a finance plan to enable the
                development of infrastructure funded by the properties that benefit from the improvements.
3. COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT
       Surrounded by mountains and forests, and located around creeks and meadows, the Feather River and Humbug Valley,
       Portola is inherently an attractive community. One challenge to living in this setting is to develop a built environment
       that is compatible with the natural amenity. Poor quality design and construction, and poor maintenance of existing
       buildings, has the ability to seriously detract from the surrounding beauty and diminish the very features and character
       that attract people to live here. This is not to imply that human occupation of the forest and mountains is inherently
       incompatible with the natural surroundings. Indeed, attractive buildings designed to be compatible with the natural
       surroundings have the ability to inspire, and to be an attractive complement to the natural setting. The community can
       be designed to sustain and be in harmony with the environment.
       The first priority is to not destroy the natural amenities that make the area so attractive. The guidelines are simple. Do
       not remove more trees than necessary to construct a building and do not unneccessarily modify the natural land form or
       the natural flow of water through grading. Compliance with these fundamentals will inherently protect the natural
       character of the community. The companion priority is to develop the community in a manner that is compatible with
       and protective of the surroundings. The Community Design Element defines specific details for development of the
       City. These details address building characteristics and common area features such as landscaping, signs, neighborhood
       design, and community form.
       Authority
       The Community Design Element is an optional element of the General Plan under Section 65303 of the Government
       Code.
       “The general plan may include any other elements or address any other subjects which, in the judgment of the
       legislative body, relate to the physical development of the county or city.”
       Relationship to Other Elements
       The Community Design Element establishes intent and guidance for community development and is closely related to
       the Land Use Element. The Land Use Element defines the location and use of land. The Community Design Element
       defines the characteristics of the land use and provides guidelines and standards for development. This is the basis for
       new development standards that will be applied in the subsequent amendments to the Zoning Ordinance, the
       Improvement Standards, and Subdivision Ordinance in the Municipal Code.
       The Community Design Element includes guidelines for developed area relationship to open space and forested areas,
       and guidelines for development in sloping or highly erodible areas. These fundamentals are also addressed in Open
       Space and Conservation Element and the Safety Element. The Community Design Element is also related to the
       Circulation Element in the recommendations for street, parking, public transit, and pedestrian and bike system features.
   3.1 COMMUNITY DESIGN GOALS
       The fundamental goal for the Community Design Element is to encourage development that:
                                     •   is economically and environmentally sustainable; relates well to the natural setting;
                                     •   is sustainable because it is well constructed of durable, quality materials appropriate to
                                         the setting; and
                                     •   offers memorable buildings and spaces.
       The underlying principle in this Community Design Element, indeed throughout the General Plan, is that natural
       amenities and the man-made environment are not mutually exclusive. Portola residents and visitors will be able to
       enjoy the built environment integrated into the natural beauty of the region.

    Goal CD-1.     Guide development of the community in a manner that will sustain the natural resources and
                   amenities and will be economically sustainable over time.
    Goal CD-2.     Foster creativity and design excellence consistent with community objectives, the environmental
                   characteristics of the area and the economic conditions inherent in a small, rural community.
    Goal CD-3.     Ensure that development will be compatible with the natural features that define the existing City and
                   surrounding area.
    Goal CD-4.     Establish high standards so that the future development will be attractive, distinctive, and functional.
    Goal CD-5.     Protect natural environmental features and integrate the built environment with the natural
                   environment.
    Goal CD-6.     Establish quality development appropriate to the local history, culture, and natural environment.
    Goal CD-7.     Build for long term durability and economic life cycles.
    Goal CD-8.     Establish well designed, distinctive gateways, lighting, and signage that will distinguish Portola as an
                   attractive community.
    Goal CD-9.     Retain and enhance the existing, well-defined form of the City.
    Goal CD-10.    Provide public spaces to accommodate visitors with minimal impact on City residents.
    Goal CD-11.    Establish attractive, well-designed, and distinctive districts such as Commercial Street and a business
                   park to enhance employment and economic development opportunities.
    Goal CD-12.    Enhance and preserve the existing neighborhoods, and restore or replace existing housing stock in the
                   older neighborhoods.
3.2 PROTECTION AND ENHANCEMENT OF NATURAL AMENITIES
    Policies:      Protection of Open Space and Natural Resources
            CD-P- 1.         Where contiguous to open space, development will be designed to provide views to
                             meadows, creeks, rock outcroppings and other natural features.
            CD-P- 2.         Meadows and riparian corridors along drainage ways and the river are to be maintained in
                             the natural condition. No structures will be permitted in meadows or riparian corridors other
                             than small structures incidental to recreation, agriculture, forest management, environmental
                             management, or education activities. Such structures may include open pavilions, seating
                             areas, small informal amphitheaters, kiosks, open shelters for recreation, small structures for
                             storage required for maintenance, and similar basic structures. Major structures such as
                             lodges, residences, restaurants, resorts and other similar buildings will not be permitted in a
                             meadow or riparian corridor.
            CD-P- 3.         The edge of the City adjacent to forests and meadows will provide a transition from urban to
                             open space by reducing the intensity of land development.
            CD-P- 4.         The urban portion of the City will be clearly distinct from the unincorporated area along the
                             major roads entering the City.
FIGURE 3-1
CHARLES CREEK MEADOW
        Implementation: Protection of Open Space and Natural Resources
               CD-I-1.  All applications for tentative maps, conditional use permits, and planned unit developments
                        pursuant to the Municipal Code will be required to show:
                        •    the location and character of any natural features, such as a spring, meadow, rock
                             outcropping, or defined drainage way;
                        •    the location of trees to be removed in the development;
                        •    a grading plan that indicates cut and fill banks.
               CD-I-2.  At the discretion of the City Council applications for tentative maps, conditional use permits,
                        and planned unit developments pursuant to the Municipal Code shall include a reforestation
                        plan that provides for replacement of trees removed in construction. The replacement plan
                        shall indicate the location and method of replacing one tree for each tree cut. The
                        reforestation may occur in the project site, or in another location acceptable to the City.
               CD-I-3.  The review of all such applications will consider the effect of the proposed development on
                        major natural amenities, such as a large rock outcrop or view to a major peak.
               CD-I-4.  Adopt design guidelines for development adjacent to creeks that include consideration of the
                        following:
                        •    streets abutting the bank;
                        •    discourage rear lot lines along creeks;
                        •    provide public access and visual easements to creeks;
                        •    linkages to other open spaces and open space systems;
                        •    trails for pedestrians and bicyclists;
                        •    planting for erosion control and riparian enhancement with native shrubs, groundcover,
                             and riparian trees.
               CD-I-5.  Work with Plumas County to support implementation of the Scenic Highways policies in the

                               County General Plan.
                CD-I-6.        Work with the United States Forest Service (USFS) to implement the Wild and Scenic
                               Rivers standards in the Plumas Forest Master Plan.
                CD-I-7.        Maintain view corridors to the river along the existing streets leading from Highway 70.
                               New development or redevelopment of existing properties abutting or within these corridors
                               must be designed to maintain the view to the river.
FIGURE 3-2
FEATHER RIVER WITHIN THE CITY
                CD-I-8.        Amend the Zoning Ordinance to require a transition to lower density development for all
                               land use within 500 feet of any permanent open space area or the future City edges,
                               identified as the Sphere of Influence Boundary. The intent is to provide a reduction in the
                               intensity of land use near the City edge so that there is a gradual transition from urban use to
                               forest.
                               •    Residential zones shall be amended such that one-half the normal intensity is permitted
                                    within 500 feet of the Sphere of Influence Boundary. The reduction in intensity can be
                                    achieved by increasing the size of each residential parcel or by clustering units and
                                    leaving a portion of the residential subdivision in open space.
                               •    Non-residential zones shall be amended such that the required open space area within
                                    the developed parcel is increased by 50 percent within 500 feet of any permanent open
                                    space boundary. Open space area within the parcel may be increased by reducing the
                                    allowed building coverage, reducing the parking area, or permitting multi-story
                                    buildings.
3.3     BUILDING QUALITY AND DURABILITY
        Policies:       Building Quality
                CD-P-6.        New construction, and redevelopment of existing buildings, should use durable materials
                               that will age well and will require minimal maintenance.
                CD-P-7.        Use of native materials and design features associated with the history of the area is
                               encouraged.
                CD-P-8.        Life cycle costs of all buildings and public improvements shall be considered in all new
                               construction.

    Implementation:            Building Quality
            CD-I-12.           The City will prepare guidelines for commercial, business-professional and residential
                               building types that illustrate appropriate building materials and forms, such as overhangs and
                               the placement of windows and doors.
            CD-I-13.           The Building Inspector will provide information to building permit applicants on suitable
                               building materials and forms for the Portola area.
            CD-I-14.           The City will take the opportunity with City buildings and public improvement projects to
                               demonstrate cost effective use of suitable materials.
            CD-I-15.           The City Planning Commission will consider the durability of materials and the appropriate
                               use of materials in conjunction with other considerations in review of development
                               applications.
3.4 CITY LANDMARKS AND GATEWAYS
            The existing City boundaries are well-defined by natural land forms. Traveling west on Highway 70, one
            enters the east end of the City over a low pass that establishes a distinct entry to the City (refer to location “A”
            in Figure 3-3). Driving east from Delleker, one enters the City around a curve in the highway adjacent to the
            river, and the south side of the City where the rail museum buildings come into view (refer to location “B” in
            Figure 3-3). This approach provides a natural gateway and an attractive view up the river toward the Gulling
            Street Bridge.
    Policies:        City Landmarks and Gateways
            CD-P-9.            Enhance the visual impact of the natural features that mark the major entries to the City.
            CD-P-10.           Establish visual landmarks throughout the city that will guide visitors to major activity areas.
            CD-P-11.           Establish a hierarchy of street designs, including the street landscape, lighting, and signs, to
                               help orient and guide people in the city.
            CD-P-12.           Retain views and public access to the river from Highway 70.

FIGURE 3-3
MAJOR GATEWAY ENTRIES
        Implementation: City Landmarks and Gateways
               CD-I-16. Work with Plumas County to establish design standards and land use controls on the
                        unincorporated area in a corridor extending along Highway 70 and along the Lake Davis
                        Road and County Road A-15 within 2 miles of corporate limits of the City.
               CD-I-17. Acquire land at the east and west entries to the City along Highway 70 and install a gateway
                        feature that includes major signs, a small visitors parking area, an information kiosk with
                        information and directional signs, interpretive signs and a small picnic area.
               CD-I-18. Establish a design standard for the gateway features that reflects the historic character of the
                        town. This may include elements of railroad, mining, ranching, timber, or recreation, but is
                        not intended that any gateway feature incorporate all of these elements.
               CD-I-19. Establish a landmark and sign feature to direct people to the Old Town commercial area, the
                        railroad museum and the Civic Center in highly visible locations throughout the City,
                        including, but not limited to, the southwest corner of the intersection of Gulling Street and
                              Highway 70.
            CD-I-20.          Adopt design standards for the landmark features throughout the City. The design theme
                              should reflect the historic heritage and the natural amenity of the area. The landmark
                              features should include three dimensional components, lighting and signs.
            CD-I-21.          Establish requirements for providing landmark features in new development. Landmark
                              features may include gateway elements and landscaping, special lighting and paving, and
                              sculptural elements.
            CD-I-22.          Continue implementation of the City Improvement Matrix as amended as a design standard
                              for major streets that differentiates them from small collector and residential streets through
                              landscaping, signs, and lighting. Refer to the landscape guidelines for the City streets in this
                              element and the street standards in the Circulation Element.
    Policies:        City-Wide Directional Signs
            CD-P-13.          Establish a City-wide sign program to establish a common design element and provide
                              directional features to guide people in the city.
    Implementation:           City-Wide Directional Signs
            CD-I-23.          Adopt a public directional sign program that includes three dimensional elements as well as
                              signs. The intent is to establish a common design theme throughout the City. At a
                              minimum, the public directional sign program will include directions to City Hall, the library
                              and parks, the sheriff’s substation, the Railroad Museum, Old Town and the hospital. The
                              sign program will include a standard lettering style and color, and background color and base
                              materials so as to provide a uniform image that is easily recognizable as part of the City
                              program.
3.5 NEIGHBORHOOD CONSERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT
    The City contains many old neighborhoods that predate the common use of automobiles. The character of these
    neighborhoods is small, individualized homes that reflect the distinctive tastes of many occupants over several decades.
    The General Plan goal (CD-12) is to enhance the existing neighborhoods and restore or replace the existing housing
    stock. The underlying purpose of this goal is to create more attractive neighborhoods that will retain property values
    and encourage private investment in individual properties.

FIGURE 3-4
TYPICAL RESIDENTIAL STREET
        Policies:       Residential Neighborhoods
                CD-P-14.       Encourage neighborhood revitalization and improvement including replacement, renovation,
                               or conversion to alternative use of buildings in serious disrepair.
                CD-P-15.       Encourage designs for new construction and renovation that are compatible with the adjacent
                               buildings and the existing residential scale and character of the neighborhood.
                CD-P-16.       Improve the overall streetscape in residential neighborhoods by providing improvements
                               such as a public sidewalk, street lighting, and directional signs, in accordance with the City
                               Improvement Matrix as amended.
                CD-P-18.       Actively enforce the Municipal Ordinance sections regarding trash collection and disposal in
                               residential yards, and the replacement or renovation of dilapidated or unsafe buildings.
        Implementation:        Residential Neighborhoods
                CD-I-25.       Assist in the organization of neighborhood associations for the purpose of identifying and
                               implementing local improvement projects. Assistance may include the provision of
                               mailings, meeting facilities, and research.
                CD-I-26.       Maintain a category in the annual municipal budget for local improvements such as street
                               tree planting, annual clean-up days, sidewalk installation and repair, and similar local
                               activities to enhance the visual quality of the City.
                CD-I-28.       Establish an inventory of dilapidated properties as candidates for restoration or removal.
                CD-I-29.       Identify sources of funding and community support for restoration of residential properties
                               for low income households.
3.6 CIVIC CORE AND PUBLIC SPACES
    It is anticipated that Portola will grow as the economic center and an attraction to visitors to Eastern Plumas County.
    The City needs an attractive core area that can accommodate large numbers of visitors without detracting from the
    quality of the natural environment and the quality of life for residents. This will be done by maintaining the compact
    form of the major institutional and commercial uses, by designating the core area as an extended “visitor’s center”, and
    by establishing high quality building design and amenities throughout the core area. The general boundaries of the core
    area are shown in Figure 3-5.
    Policies:           Civic Core and Public Spaces
              CD-P-19.          The existing civic core area, including City Hall, the post office, library, sheriff substation,
                                Courthouse, and City Park shall remain the institutional center of the City. The City will
                                seek to expand the City offices as necessary to keep pace with the service demands of
                                increased population.
              CD-P-20.          Design standards for public buildings and streetscape will reinforce the significance of the
                                civic core area as the public center of the City.
              CD-P-21.          The commercial core area of the City, including Highway 70, Commercial Street, the
                                Railroad Museum area, and the civic center core will provide multiple locations to
                                accommodate visitor activities. The intent is to enable the City to host large single events in
                                multiple centers of activity, such as a craft or music festival, or to host different small but
                                concurrent events.
              CD-P-22.          The multiple venue locations will be linked by a vehicle and pedestrian system and
                                accessible by public transit and parking.
    Implementation:             Civic Core and Public Spaces
              CD-I-31.          Invest in expansion of public services and other civic uses into the core area.
              CD-I-32.          Provide support uses, such as parking, pedestrian spaces and sidewalks, and public transit
                                access to ensure that the civic core area remains viable.
              CD-I-33.          Adopt a Public Events Master Plan to identify multiple event centers and define their
                                potential function. The Public Events Master Plan will include an operations component for
                                coordinating multiple venue events and a facilities component that describes the venues and
                                their supporting services and infrastructures.
              CD-I-34.          The Public Events Master Plan will be coordinated with the General Plan Circulation
                                Element to ensure that the pedestrian circulation plan provides:
                                •    Public spaces that include pedestrian scale lighting, signage, and sidewalks. Benches
                                     and seating areas will be included along pedestrian ways that connect major activity
                                     areas, such as the Old Town area and the River Park.
                                •    Drinking fountains and public restrooms or temporary comfort stations will be provided
                                     in appropriate public areas.
                                •    Space for street vendors and for viewing areas overlooking the rail yard.
              CD-I-35.          Identify the network of parking areas, pedestrian connections, public transit stops, and public
                                activity spaces in the Public Events Master Plan.

                CD-I-36. Establish a center for public events and recreation along the river. The event center is
                         intended to provide a central place for coordination of multiple venue events, as well as a
                         central activity center for single events, and a year round recreation and cultural center for
                         City residents.
FIGURE 3-5
CIVIC CORE AREA
3.7 DESIGN STANDARDS: COMMERCIAL AREAS
    Design standards for the commercial areas are closely linked with the standards for the civic core and public spaces. In
    part, the intent is to provide public spaces within the commercial core area that encourage public activity and patronage
    of the retail and service businesses.
    There are two distinct commercial areas, Old Town and Sierra Street. Old Town is envisioned as a small scale retail
    and service area with restaurants, small shops, and service for tourists as well as local residents. The proximity of the
    Railroad Museum offers special opportunities for visitor oriented services and retail. A high level of pedestrian
    amenities (including broad sidewalks, shade, seating, fountains, low level lighting) will establish a unique character for
    this commercial area.
    Sierra Street and the adjacent side streets will provide the more conventional business center for the City and the region.
    Auto oriented businesses catering to local residents, as well as travelers along Highway 70, will be the primary uses in
    this area. Although it is a primary traffic route of regional significance, the Sierra Street corridor should incorporate
    pedestrian amenities as well. Continuous sidewalks setback from the street edge, shade structures, seating areas, and
    pedestrian scale lighting and signs will provide a more pedestrian friendly corridor.
    Policies:            General Commercial
              CD-P-23.           Establish design and standards to retain and enhance the Old Town core area and Sierra
                                 Street corridor as the primary commercial and tourism centers in the east Plumas region.
              CD-P-24.           Establish quality design of buildings on Commercial Street and the Sierra Street corridor to
                                 identify them as the center of primary commercial activity.
              CD-P-25.           Signs and lighting for commercial and office uses will contribute to a common theme
                                 element that becomes a visual symbol for the City.
              CD-P-26.           Encourage preservation and enhancement of commercial buildings with architectural
                                 character or historic significance.
    Implementation:              General Commercial
              CD-I-39.           All applications for commercial use pursuant to the Municipal Code will be required to show
                                 the location and features of any exterior space intended for public use.
              CD-I-40.           All applications for commercial use pursuant to the Municipal Code will be required to show
                                 access to parking and the pedestrian route to the parking area.
              CD-I-41.           Adopt guidelines for commercial buildings that reflect the history of the region, and
                                 compatible with the climate.
    Policies:            Old Town Commercial Area
              CD-P-27.           Establish a special pedestrian area in Old Town to accommodate tourism and shopping and
                                 services for local residents.
              CD-P-28.           Provide a direct, clear, and convenient pedestrian connection between Commercial Street
                                 and the Railroad Museum.
              CD-P-30.           Provide additional parking on the perimeter of the Old Town areas along First Avenue, and
                                 in other convenient locations.
          CD-P-31.    Provide convenient pedestrian connections between parking areas and the Commercial Street
                      businesses.
          CD-P-32.    Accommodate artists’ studios and sales within the Old Town area.
    Implementation:   Old Town Commercial Area
          CD-I-42.    Adopt a Street Lighting and Sign Program for placement of a unique sign and lighting
                      standard in all commercial areas along Sierra Street. The program will adopt a lighting and
                      sign structure standard that will be a form and constructed of materials that evoke the history
                      of the City and surrounding area. The form will include one or two standard locations for
                      placement for individual business signage, and a lighting fixture that casts light downward
                      on the sidewalk and the adjacent street. Business signs will be front lighted and must be
                      within size parameters and proportions established by the City program.
          CD-I-43.    Adopt standards and an improvement plan for Commercial Street that includes at a
                      minimum:
                      •         pedestrian level street lighting;
                      •         special sidewalk pavement or a boardwalk along the store fronts;
                      •         crosswalk signs, striping and special paving;
                      •         street furniture including benches, trash collection containers, directional and
                                interpretive signs;
                      •         designated areas for street vendors, performing arts, and train watching;
                      •         guidelines for building facades, window and door treatments;
                      •         canopies over the storefront sidewalks;
                      •         street trees;
                      •         on-street parking.
          CD-I-44.    The City will work with the merchants and landowners in the Old Town area to install a
                      street lighting program consistent with the pedestrian use of the street and the “Old Town”
                      theme.
          CD-I-45.    The City will work with the Railroad Museum Association to improve the visibility and
                      attractiveness of the main museum buildings when viewed from Highway 70.
          CD-I-46.    Encourage the Railroad Museum Association to include a landmark architectural element,
                      such as a clock tower, in the museum facilities.
          CD-I-47.    Develop a reuse plan for the former railroad hospital site for commercial or public access
                      uses that will include attractive new structures and landmark elements.
          CD-I-48.    As additional commercial uses develop, adopt standards and an improvement plan for a
                      landscaped corridor along First Street, Second Street, Pacific Street, California Street and
                      Main Street to provide a pedestrian corridor from the west end of Commercial Street to the
                      museum.
3.8 DESIGN STANDARDS: SIERRA STREET AND RIVERFRONT COMMERCIAL

    The commercial uses along the south side of Sierra Street are a special condition because of the interface with the river.
    The Sierra Street corridor has the unique advantage of being contiguous to the Feather River along a substantial portion
    of the reach through the City. This provides very attractive views and opportunities for access to the river corridor.
    The River Park extends for one half mile from Beckwith Street to the US Forest Service Park. The Feather River is a
    special resource because it retains the character of a relatively unimproved water course. As a federally designated
    Wild and Scenic River, the Feather River has a natural, scenic quality. Unlike many communities that developed with
    buildings facing away from a natural amenity, such as the river, Portola retains undeveloped edges along the north bank
    of the river. This provides opportunities that are unique to Portola for recreation, public open space, and a strong
    identity. The purpose of these design standards is to ensure that the future development of commercial use along the
    south side of Sierra Street will take advantage of this unique opportunity by providing access and an attractive interface
    with the open space corridor. The intent is to provide a distinctive character for Sierra Street that relates to the river,
    and to the role as “main street” for the east Plumas Region.
    Policies:          Sierra Street and Riverfront Commercial
             CD-P-33.           Pedestrian and bikeway connections will be provided by businesses between Sierra Street
                                and the River Park corridor from the west gateway to the USFS park.
             CD-P-34.           Businesses will provide a view toward the river from the main sales or dining area where
                                feasible. Decks and terraces oriented to the river are encouraged.
             CD-P-35.           Refuse, storage and service areas will be screened and/or located to have minimum visual
                                impact from the river.
             CD-P-36.           Small scale signs oriented to the river that identify the business will be allowed pursuant to
                                special use permits.
             CD-P-37.           Businesses that provide services and products, such as food service or equipment rental,
                                related to the recreation opportunities along the river are encouraged.
             CD-P-38.           View corridors to the river will be maintained by controlling the spacing of buildings along
                                the south side of Sierra Street so as to provide periodic openings between buildings.
             CD-P-39.           The City shall continue to seek to acquire land for recreation and public purposes.
    Implementation:             Sierra Street and Riverfront Commercial
             CD-I-49.           The City will implement a program to support installation of a sign and lighting structure
                                along Sierra Street. The location of the structure will be coordinated with adjacent
                                landowners, but will be placed to facilitate spacing the structure at approximately regular
                                intervals along the street.
             CD-I-50.           City review of any building permit for new construction or renovation, conditional use
                                permit, rezone or other entitlements for commercial use along the south side of Sierra Street
                                shall consider:
                                •    siting with respect to the views toward the river;
                                •    orientation of sales areas, dining areas, terraces and decks overlooking the river;
                                •    pedestrian access corridors between Sierra Street and the river corridor within blocks;
                                •    pedestrian walks between the businesses and the River Walk pathway;
                                •    provision of small signs oriented to the river to identify the businesses;
                                •    provision of amphitheater seating or other seating areas overlooking the river.
3.9 DESIGN STANDARDS: BUSINESS PROFESSIONAL AND INDUSTRIAL AREAS

Historically, industrial uses within the City were few, and primarily related to railroad operations. Office uses are
typically located in small buildings in the commercial areas. The General Plan is based on the premise that the quality
of life in the City will attract new businesses not previously associated with the community. Such businesses will
include office uses, light manufacturing, and assembly. The City currently offers very little land area, and few
improved buildings suitable for such businesses. They will require relatively small, affordable space to become
established and grow. Perhaps more important, the space will need to be of high quality and amenity to attract and
retain quality businesses.
The Land Use Element identifies new land use categories for businesses, including Commercial Mixed Use (CMU) and
Business Professional-Light Industrial (BP/LI). The Land Use Diagram (Figure 2-2) designates specific locations
within the City to accommodate these uses.
These design standards are intended to ensure that the business professional offices and light industrial uses are
compatible with the natural setting, functional in the emerging telecommunication technologies, and distinguished by a
high level of amenities.
Policies:          Business Professional and Industrial
          CD-P-40.          Encourage the development of high quality business professional and industrial parks that
                            accommodate a range of small business activities.
          CD-P-41.          Business and industrial parks will provide an attractive landscape and sign program
                            including directional signs and major entry features.
          CD-P-42.          Truck access and storage areas will be screened from view from the primary street frontage
                            and any adjacent residential use.
          CD-P-43.          Business and industrial parks will provide pedestrian and bicycle access and bicycle parking.
          CD-P-44.          Business and industrial parks will be designed to be integrated with the natural setting to
                            provide an attractive work place and minimize the impact on the environment.
Implementation:             Business Professional and Industrial
          CD-I-51.          City review of any building permit for new construction or renovation, conditional use
                            permit, rezone or other entitlements for business professional and industrial use shall
                            consider:
                            •    siting with respect to natural features such as creeks, meadows, rock outcroppings and
                                 significant trees in the adjacent forest;
                            •    the scale of the proposed buildings relative to adjacent land uses;
                            •    location of truck access and storage areas;
                            •    pedestrian access, and bicycle access and parking areas;
                            •    location of and character of major signs and landscape features, and directional signs.
          CD-I-52.          The City will designate the location of major sign and gateway features for business and
                            industrial park locations.

4. CIRCULATION ELEMENT
       The Circulation Element deals with the physical infrastructure of transportation, including the streets, bikeway and
       pedestrian networks. It also deals with the programming and operation of the circulation system, such as rideshare
       programs and the operation of transportation systems.
       Authority
       The Circulation Element is authorized in Government Code Section 65302(b) that states that the General Plan is
       required to include:
                 “A Circulation Element consisting of the general location and extent of existing and proposed major
                 thoroughfares, transportation routes, terminals, and other local public utilities and facilities, all
                 correlated with the Land Use Element of the plan.”
       The statute specifically identifies public utilities and facilities as components of the Circulation Element, but permits
       jurisdictions to organize elements in a manner appropriate to the community. The Portola General Plan addresses the
       public infrastructure, including sewer, water, energy, and utilities, in the Public Facilities and Infrastructure Element.
       Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
       Circulation and land use are closely linked elements that provide the framework for much of the General Plan. The
       location and intensity of land uses determines the need for circulation system components and, in turn, the capacity of
       the circulation system often determines the location and feasibility of land use. In combination with land use, the
       circulation system may affect air quality, plant and animal habitats, environmental noise, energy use, community
       appearance and other environmental considerations.
       Coordination between the Land Use Element and the Circulation Element:
                     encourages walking and bicycle trips by promoting a compact urban form with neighborhood destinations
                      close to residents;
                     makes public transit feasible through coordination of the intensity and location of land uses; and
                     reduces the length and number of vehicle trips outside of the community by promoting mixed-use
                      development and by providing employment centers, shopping and services within the City.
       Relationship to Regional Transportation Programs
       The circulation system in the City is linked to the circulation network in Plumas County and beyond. Planning for
       future circulation improvements must address the existing and planned roads, bikeways, and transportation services that
       extend beyond the City. This Circulation Element is intended to be compatible with the Regional Transportation Plan
       for Plumas County, 2000.
   4.1 KEY CIRCULATION ISSUES
       Individual Independence
       Flexibility and personal independence are characteristics of the existing circulation system. People are accustomed to
       using personal automobiles to travel at will. The circulation system must retain this level of independence, but also
       seek to include alternatives that will reduce reliance on automobiles as the primary mode of transportation.
       Economic Development

The circulation system will play a significant role in fulfilling the tourism and economic development goals established
in this General Plan. The system must provide clear and convenient access for tourists, visitors, and travelers along
Highway 70. Elements of the circulation system, such as the improved bike paths, the mountain bike trails, a local
shuttle system and the rail road, not only serve a transportation need, but may also be an attraction to visitors.
Tourism and regional service businesses will be a growing component of the local economy. The circulation system
must provide convenient access for business patrons in the form of parking and direct access routes. For the tourists,
the circulation system must not only provide access, but should also become an attraction by providing special travel
modes and experiences. In order to successfully serve tourists, the circulation system must be easy to navigate to points
of interest, and must provide short-term parking and local transportation.
The circulation system can enhance the potential for economic development in the City by providing transport for
goods and services and by providing convenient travel for workers to jobs. Within the City and the neighboring areas
the emphasis is on making the trip to work convenient and safe, and facilitating alternatives to the single occupant
automobile.
Local economic growth can also occur through local residents working outside the community. Commuter bus
services, ride sharing and other measures that enhance the opportunity to work outside the community can indirectly
enhance the local economy in the short term by raising the income of residents. However, in the long term, a large
percentage of out commuting workers will diminish the potential growth of the local economy. The ultimate objective
is to establish a strong local economy that relies on a resident work force employed in the City and neighboring area.
Refer to Section 2.6 in the Land Use Element for additional discussion of the jobs and housing balance in the City.
Time Horizon
Perhaps more than other elements in the General Plan, the Circulation Element must take a very long term view.
Physical infrastructure, such as the road system, establishes a framework that is very difficult to alter. Land uses may
change and buildings be torn down and reconstructed, but the route of the public streets and utility corridors are
typically fixed in place over time. Therefore, the circulation system components must be carefully considered for their
long-term impacts on land use and community form. Moreover, many major infrastructure components, such as a
bridge crossing or major new road, are relatively expensive and must be planned long in advance in order to accrue
sufficient funding. For these reasons, the Circulation Element, particularly that portion addressing major infrastructure
improvements, must look beyond the twenty-year horizon typical of other elements in the General Plan.
Safety
Safety is a fundamental goal for all components of the circulation system. Conventional design standards typically
address the safety requirements for streets, bicycle paths, and pedestrian networks. However, Portola has specific needs
that require special attention to safety concerns. These include the need to design safe routes for evacuation in
emergencies, and the special design considerations for streets and bike and pedestrian paths in mountainous, winter
conditions. The special conditions in Portola also relate to the intent to accommodate a mix of bicycles, pedestrians,
and vehicles of various types. Special conditions also will occur when the City is the site of special events that
accommodate large numbers of visitors.
Multi-modal System
The circulation system will be more efficient and will provide better flexibility and conveniences if all modes of
transportation are coordinated. This means that different modes connect at central locations where people can easily
transfer from one mode to another. An example would be to establish a transit center where a regional bus, a park-and-
ride lot, a local shuttle, a jitney or cab service, a primary pedestrian path, and a primary bicycle path can all connect.
The different modes must also be coordinated in time so that the connections are convenient.
Cost Effective
Travel and movement of goods and utilities requires expenditures of money, energy, and time. An efficient circulation
    system serves to minimize these expenditures by reducing the need for travel, and by reducing the time and distance of
    necessary travel. Reduction of travel can be accomplished by clustering travel destinations (retail, services, schools,
    and so on) close to the residents’ home so that walking or public transportation is feasible. The Land Use Element
    where the land uses that attract traffic are clustered in a compact urban form that will facilitate the use of public
    transportation and walking.
    An efficient circulation system will also help to reduce the expenditure of public funds for new construction through
    design that reduces the length and width of roads to the minimum actual requirement. The General Plan Land Use
    Element will help minimize the need for new infrastructure expenditures by maximizing the use of, and by directing
    new development to the existing roads.
    Energy Efficiency
    Fuel required for transportation is a significant energy demand in any community. Relatively low fuel costs have
    enabled expansion of substantial development throughout California. However, small, relatively remote communities
    such as Portola are particularly vulnerable to increases in fuel costs. Fuel costs typically tend to be higher in such
    communities, and if fuel prices increase, as is likely over the next two decades, the effect can seriously hinder economic
    stability and development. Higher energy (fuel) costs will demand more of individual household incomes for typical
    daily travel, and may make it uneconomic to travel to jobs outside the area, therefore, residents may be forced to
    relocate. The use of ride sharing and other trip reduction methods will reduce dependence on increasingly expensive
    fuels. The policies in this Circulation Element encourage trip reduction methods as a means to reduce dependence on
    expensive fuels before they become prohibitively expensive and diminish the economic potential and quality of daily
    life in Portola.
    Higher fuel costs may also diminish the level of services as businesses and suppliers find it uneconomical to deliver
    goods and services to the area. Finally, and perhaps most serious, is the potential loss in tourism as people reduce their
    travel due to the high cost of fuel. Fuel prices will be determined far beyond the influence of this City, but the General
    Plan must seek to minimize the vulnerability to energy costs by developing alternative modes of travel within the City
    and facilitating alternative means for tourists to travel to the area.
    Impact on Natural Features
    The circulation system must include design standards that minimize the physical effect of circulation improvements on
    the natural environment, and the need to design systems that are safe and functional in the winter.
    Air Quality
    Unlike many urban places, vehicle traffic has not been the primary source of air pollution in Portola. However, the
    climate conditions that create the winter air pollution problem indicate the potential for increased pollution within and
    near the City. Measures designed to minimize reliance on vehicles are necessary to reduce the potential for air pollution
    increases in the community.
4.2 CIRCULATION GOALS
    The goals for the circulation system reflect the broader the goals of this General Plan. These include improvement of
    the existing community, economic development, expanded tourism, aesthetic quality in the built environment, public
    and personal safety, and environmental protection.
    Goal C-1.           Upgrade all existing streets to current improvement standards.
    Goal C-2.           Extend the circulation network, including streets, bike and pedestrian paths, and transit routes to in-
                        fill areas and new growth areas in a manner that is energy and cost efficient, safe, and minimizes
                        impact on the natural environment.
    Goal C-3.           Improve the circulation network, including streets and parking, rail, transit, and pedestrian paths to

                        enhance economic development and tourism.
    Goal C-4.           Expand transportation alternatives within the City, including public transit, walking and bicycling.
    Goal C-5.           Expand the circulation system to accommodate and attract new businesses and visitors (tourists).
4.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE STANDARDS
    The effectiveness of the streets to carry traffic is measured by a standard evaluation criterion, the Level of Service
    (LOS). Traffic engineers use LOS as a quantitative measure to describe traffic conditions, and as a means of evaluating
    future traffic conditions. Level of Service is a measure of the existing or projected traffic compared to the theoretical
    capacity of the street or intersection to safely accommodate traffic. Factors taken into consideration include volume of
    traffic, street and intersection design, signal timing, and other variables. Each LOS is assigned a letter, ranging from
    “A” (less than a 5 second wait at intersections and no restrictions on speed along arterials) to “F” (delays of more than
    one green cycle at intersections and “stop and go” movement along the street). LOS is normally used to describe the
    morning or afternoon peak-hour conditions when traffic is the heaviest. Table 4-1 describes the Level of Service
    categories.
    The LOS criteria are useful aids in identifying potential problems with street capacity, and the land uses that generate
    traffic. However, LOS is a generalized evaluation tool and must be tempered by interpretation of local conditions. For
    instance, minor adjustments in the timing of a traffic signal, adding turning lanes, limiting the points of access from
    adjacent properties and other modifications can improve the actual operation of a given street or intersection.
    The current traffic conditions in Portola do not normally approach the levels experienced in more urban areas. Most
    existing streets and intersections in Portola operate well within the range of LOS C or better, although the Plumas
    County Regional Transportation Plan (2000) identifies SR 70 (Sierra Street) within the City operating at LOS D during
    peak traffic conditions. The Caltrans "Guide for the Preparation of Traffic Impact Studies" (Guide) states that Caltrans
    endeavors to maintain a target LOS C on State Highway facilities. The Guide is consulted when State Highways are
    affects.
4.4 STREET NETWORK AND CLASSIFICATION
    The street system in Portola consists of three general classes of street:
                    •   local, small scale streets that serve the residential neighborhoods;
                    •   local, rural roads that serve the low density residential areas; and
                    •   larger collector and arterial streets.
    Much of the existing street system was built before private automobiles came into common use. The streets follow a
    grid pattern established when the City was originally platted in 1909. The grid does not relate to the topography and
    many streets stop at a ravine or steep slope. This results in discontinuous streets in portions of the older City. These
    areas were subdivided into individual lots, but have no streets or other public improvements to serve those lots. The
    street pattern developed outside the original grid pattern is typically circuitous and follows the natural terrain. At the
    perimeter of the City the grid pattern transitions to an informal pattern of rural streets flanked by larger lots.
    The street system was not designed to accommodate modern traffic, or to park cars on residential lots. The narrow,
    residential lots found on older streets typically do not have sufficient width for a driveway, and on-street parking and
    snow removal are not convenient. The streets are laid out in short blocks only 350 feet long by 300 feet wide. This
    enables people to walk in relatively direct routes within the City, but it requires a substantial amount of land to be
    paved, and is not practical in steep terrain.
    The majority of the 14 miles in the Portola road system existed at the time the City incorporated in 1946. This includes
    .55 miles of paved major collector street, 4.43 miles of paved minor collector street and 15.92 miles of paved local

        streets, as shown in Figure 4-1. Minor arterial streets are important routes for intra-county regional circulation. In
        Plumas County, the minor arterial circulation system consists of all State Routes including: SR 70, 89, 36, 147, 49, and
        284. Only SR 70 (Sierra Street) directly affects Portola.
        SR 70 (Sierra Street) is the primary street through the City. The highway has a 100 foot right of way through the center
        of the City, but flares to 120 foot wide right-of-way at the east of the City and 160 foot wide right of way to the west.
        The highway was widened to four lanes in 1997 with full curb, gutter and side walk along portions of the street. Curb,
        gutter, and sidewalk improvements were not installed where the highway abuts a driveway or parking apron. The back
        of the sidewalk abuts the property boundary and fronts individual buildings in some locations. On-street parking occurs
        where there is a curb, and in those locations there is no room for additional parking in front of buildings.
        Major collector streets provide greater access to more localized destinations for regional circulation. These streets
        typically are designed to provide access for regional traffic between the State Routes. In Portola, only West Street
        (Lake Davis Road) is designated by the County Regional Transportation Plan as a major collector.
        Minor collector streets provide additional access to local attractions for regional traffic and serve as local collectors for
        the residential street system. The County Regional Transportation Plan identifies Beckwourth Street, Gulling Street,
        Commercial Street, First Avenue, Fourth Avenue, Sixth Avenue, Pacific Street, Main Street, and County Road A-15 as
        the primary collector streets in the existing street system. Traffic within and outside the City cause these streets to
        function as collectors although they have the standard 60-foot wide right-of-way found on all City streets.
TABLE 4-1
TRAFFIC LEVEL OF SERVICE CONDITIONS
        Street Conditions
A study of existing street conditions (Bastian Engineering, November 19, 1998) indicates that several older streets are
in need of repair due to deteriorating sub base, deteriorating pavement, and other serious conditions. These streets will
require upgrading in order to maintain a minimum standard of maintenance. In addition, many street sections were
never constructed and remain unimproved. Many other streets exceed 6% grade and are difficult to travel during snow
and ice conditions. The streets in need of repair are shown in Figure 4-2.
Repair or reconstruction of these streets is essential to maintain the current level of service and to avoid significant on-
going maintenance costs. A fundamental objective of the Circulation Element is to upgrade the existing streets to
current standards and to extend the unimproved streets in the in-fill areas described in the Land Use Element, notably
Section 2-6.
4.4.1     Street Standards
Extension of local streets to serve new development in the areas at the perimeter of the City requires design standards
and street patterns that are more responsive to the terrain and environmental conditions. These street standards may be
different from the existing streets in the older parts of the City. The new streets will typically extend into forested areas
that are somewhat steeper than the developed portion of the City. Therefore, the street system needs to be more
flexible, both in alignment and street width than the historic street standards.
Each classification of City street is designed to standards appropriate to the conditions and intended use. In general, the
standards use the minimum level of street cross-section needed for traffic safety and emergency access and evacuation.
The intent is to minimize grading and the amount of land paved for streets. In addition to requiring less grading and
paving, narrower streets will tend to slow traffic, and may indirectly discourage vehicle use. Where combined with a
convenient and safe pedestrian route, narrow streets will encourage residents to walk rather than drive. Beyond
fundamental traffic safety concerns, street design should emphasize ease of maintenance, ease of snow removal,
simplicity of construction, visual character, and pedestrian access. Ease of maintenance suggests a relatively narrow
paved section and simple rolled curb and gutter, or no gutter in rural settings, rather than the more formal standing curb.
Street standards for various conditions existing or expected to occur in Portola are summarized in Table 4-2.
FIGURE 4-1
EXISTING MAJOR STREETS
FIGURE 4-2
EXISTING STREETS IN NEED OF REPAIR OF NEW CONSTRUCTION
        Minor Arterial and Collector Streets
        The level of new residential and employment growth anticipated in the General Plan Land Use Element will not lead to
        urban type development experienced in many other communities. Consequently, the volume of traffic associated with
        major arterial streets in urban areas is not anticipated. There will be a need for streets capable of carrying traffic at
        volumes and speeds greater than acceptable in typical residential areas. Therefore, arterial and collector street standards
        are planned to accommodate these higher demand levels should they occur as the community grows. Cross-section
        diagrams of the minor arterial street and the collector street classification are shown in Figures 4-3 and 4-4 respectively.
        Urban Residential Streets
        The typical street in residential neighborhoods must be sufficiently wide to carry local traffic at relatively slow speeds
        (25 m.p.h. or less). The street should allow for on street parking and a public sidewalk. The streets should be designed
        to facilitate snow removal and storage. A cross-section diagram of the urban residential street is shown in Figure 4-5.
        Low Density Residential Streets
        Extensions of local streets to serve new development areas require design standards and street patterns that respond to
        the terrain and environmental conditions. The new streets will typically extend into forested areas that are somewhat
        steeper than the developed portions of Portola. Therefore, the street system needs to more flexible than the existing
        street standards, both in alignment and street width. A cross-section diagram of the low density residential street is
        shown in Figure 4-6.

        Traffic Calming
        Traffic speed is a concern where local and collector streets are relatively straight and there are few intersections.
        Within the developed portions of the City, in residential and school areas, and where there pedestrian crossings or
        sidewalks along the street, it is desirable to slow traffic to safe speeds. This is accomplished through “traffic calming”
        measures. These may include signalized or signed intersections, round-abouts and traffic circles, and other physical
        improvements that cause drivers to slow and be more aware of other vehicles and pedestrian or bicycle traffic.

4.4.2     Major Streets Master Plan
The Major Street Master Plan defines the framework of major streets. It is intended that the City retain the existing
compact form. In-fill development is encouraged in the Land Use Element as a significant means of accommodating
new growth. Consequently, selected existing streets will continue to function as the major streets. Nonetheless, there
are potential growth areas within and adjacent to the existing City boundary that will require major new roads where
development is permitted.
New Arterial Streets and Collector Streets
Development in the areas north and south of the existing urban area, as well as in-fill development, will generate the
need for additional routes parallel and connecting to Highway 70. The conceptual routes are described here and are
shown on Figure 4-7. The intent is to provide collector streets through the potential major new development areas
identified in the General Plan Diagram.
County Road A-15/Colorado Street/First Avenue Realignment will route traffic from County Road A-15 to Gulling
Street. A-15 will be realigned north along a newly constructed Colorado Street and will curve onto a new alignment of
First Avenue through the vacant parcel. The alignment will provide a new route to the Railroad Museum and access to
parking along the north side of First Avenue to serve the commercial uses on Commercial Street. Commercial Street
will continue to be a public street for traffic, but will be designed to accommodate wider pedestrian sidewalks and
slower, lower volume vehicle traffic. This is consistent with the intent to make Commercial Street a pedestrian oriented
service and shopping street, as described in the Land Use Element Section 2.6.1 and the Community Design Element
Section 3.1.
First Avenue/Gulling Street/Hospital Drive Intersection will be reconstructed to raise the intersection and lower the
grade along First Avenue. The existing right-of-way for Portola Avenue between south Pine Street and Gulling Street
will be declared surplus and made available to the adjacent property owners. This reconstruction will facilitate the use
of First Avenue as the primary route to Road A-15.
FIGURE 4-7
NEW ROADS IN THE CORE AREA
        County Road A-15/Third Avenue Realignment will also route traffic from County Road A-15 to Gulling Street. A
        traffic circle will be constructed in the existing triangular parcel bounded by Rio Grande Avenue, Third Avenue, and
        California Street. The traffic circle will enable traffic to move freely through the Third Avenue/California Street
        intersection which is currently off-set.
        South Gulling Street will extend south into Area B and provide a connection to the proposed business park and
        residential area, and the new collector street connecting South Fifth Street to County Road A-15.
        South Fifth Street will be extended south and west around the hospital to connect Taylor Street to the proposed
        Gulling Street extension. Ultimately, South Fifth Street may be extended across the river on a new bridge connecting to
        Sierra Street. This will provide a new entry to the south side of the City.
        Area B Collector will be a new street that extends west from the Gulling Street extension around the south side of the
        high school and connects to County Road A-15. This will provide a connection from County Road A-15 to the Gulling
        Street extension and ultimately to the South Fifth Street extension.
        4.4.3     Major Streets in Future Growth Areas
        Annexation of new growth areas will require new routes to provide local circulation both parallel and connecting to
Highway 70. The primary movements will be north and west of Highway 70.
West Street/ Delleker Collector will connect from West Street in the vicinity of Carmichael School west to an
extension of Delleker Drive north from Highway 70.
Delleker Drive will extend north to connect to the West Street/Delleker Drive Collector.
West Meadow Loop will extend west from Delleker Drive and connect to Highway 70 in the vicinity of Mabie.
Future development of the area to the north of the existing City boundary, notably the Teanna Ranch and Grizzly Creek
Road area will require additional roads. Generally these roads will serve relatively low density development.
4.4.4     Traffic Signals
With the relatively low traffic volumes on most local streets throughout Portola traffic signals have not been needed.
However, the volume of traffic on Highway 70 (Sierra Street) does require signalization at the Gulling Street
intersection. Additional signalization may be required in the future as traffic volumes increase.
4.4.5     Truck Routes
Highway 70 will remain the primary route for commercial traffic through the City and is intended to accommodate
adequate movement of goods by trucking. Truck traffic on all other collector streets will be limited to local deliveries.
Policies:          Street System
          C-P-1:           Maintain traffic Level of Service LOS C on residential streets, arterial and collector streets

          C-I-1:           Conduct a traffic analysis on all development proposals for residential development in
                           excess of 50 residential units and commercial development in excess of 10,000 square feet to
                           evaluate the effect on LOS standards. This requirement may be waived by the City where a
                                recent traffic analysis considered the impact of the proposed project. Caltrans "Guide for the
                                Preparation of Traffic Impact Studies" will be consulted when SR 70 is affected.

                                review of any development proposal adjacent to the proposed route.
4.5 PARKING
    Parking is unusually challenging in Portola because the City streets were designed before automobiles were common.
    Typically the streets are wide enough to allow on-street parking, but there is little dedicated off-street parking in the
    commercial areas, and no parking on the residential lots in the older parts of the City.
    The demand for parking generated by the existing businesses is periodically increased significantly by the patrons of
    special events. New business development and increases in tourism, including special events, is a fundamental purpose
    in this General Plan. The success of the economic development element will rely, in part, on the ability to
    accommodate the traffic and parking associated with new businesses and special events. Other modes of transportation,
    including local shuttles, bus service, and pedestrian and bike systems can be expected to reduce the traffic and parking
    load associated with special events, but the majority of visitors will arrive in automobiles.
    Policies:         Parking
             C-P-13:            Ensure that there is adequate parking for normal commercial activities.
             C-P-14:            Ensure that there is adequate parking for special events.
             C-P-15:            Coordinate the parking area locations with the roadway, transit, and pedestrian and bikeway
                                systems.
             C-P-16:            Expand public parking in the Sierra Street and Commercial Street area to alleviate existing
                                parking shortages.
             C-P-18:            The City will implement a parking plan in the Old Town area to provide parking lots
                                improved and maintained by a parking district to the benefit of the participating businesses.
    Implementing Policies: Parking
              C-I-13:            Work with the local merchants to improve on-street parking conditions.
              C-I-14:            Work with local merchants and property owners to establish off-street parking.
              C-I-15:            Support formation of parking districts to support local merchants.
              C-I-16:            Encourage development of shared parking among local businesses. Allow common access
                                 driveways to shared off-street parking.
              C-I-17:            Locate parking within acceptable walking distance of the facilities they are expected to
                                 serve. Walking distances should not exceed 200 feet for short-term parking and 600 feet for
                                 long-term parking.
              C-I-18:            Locate parking facilities for special events along routes that facilitate walking to the event,
                                 and in locations that can be logically served by a shuttle system.
              C-I-19:            Locate parking facilities for special events near transportation nodes.
              C-I-20:            Locate long term parking facilities where they can be observed by passers-by.
              C-I-21:            Locate parking for recreation activities such as hiking and mountain biking riding near the
                                 trailhead.
4.6 BIKEWAY AND PEDESTRIAN SYSTEM
    Portola is a compact community with most public destinations within reasonable walking distance of the majority of
    residents. The town is approximately one mile in length along Sierra Street and neighborhoods extend approximately
    one mile north and south from Sierra Street. City Hall, the library, post office, major parks, and sheriff substation are
    clustered together just a few blocks from the old town commercial area. The high school and middle school are located
    at the edge of the south neighborhood, and the elementary school and a neighborhood park are located at the edge of the
    north neighborhood.
    The existing City is very walkable in terms of the location of primary land uses. The existing street pattern throughout
    the older parts of the City typically consists of very short blocks 350 feet long. This facilitates walking, but creates
    multiple intersections and an excessive amount of paving. The major limitation to ease of walking is the lack of
    sidewalks. Sidewalks occur sporadically in the residential neighborhoods outside the commercial areas.
    The relatively direct routes afforded by the existing street pattern facilitate bicycle travel in Portola. However, cycling
    is constrained by the lack of designated bike routes and the condition of local streets. Steep streets and, in some cases,
    unpaved lanes and/or shoulders make it difficult to bicycle throughout the City. Cycling is particularly difficult in
    winter when ice on the steeper streets and snow piled along the shoulders adds to the hazard.
    Sierra Street is a barrier to both pedestrians and cyclists due to the width of the street, the relatively high speed and
    volume of traffic, and the lack of designated and signalized crossings. The installation of a traffic signal at the
    intersection of Sierra Street and Gulling Street in 2002 will improve this condition, but additional designated crossings
    are needed.
    Improving the facilities for bicycling is important for the convenience and enjoyment of Portola residents, and for
    expanding economic development through tourism. The area around Portola offers significant opportunities for touring
    and mountain bike riding. Portola is the crossroads of regional bike routes designated in the Regional Transportation
    Plan. Primary routes extend from the City up Rocky Point Road and Grizzly Creek Road to Lake Davis and return by
    Lake Davis Road. A second route extends out County Road A-15 to Highway 89, then returns via Graeagle and
    Blairsden along Highway 70. Several additional routes extend from these primary routes to provide touring cyclists
    with a range of trips that can be based in Portola.
Portola can become a hub for such activity if it provides the base facilities to serve these potential patrons of local
businesses and events. The primary facilities required are staging areas and good routes to the trails and touring routes
outside the City.
The existing bikeway and pedestrian network should be enhanced to further encourage bicycling and walking in the
City. This is accomplished in part by encouraging the continuity of the existing compact land use pattern in the Land
Use Element, and by creation of new bike routes and sidewalks where ever new streets are installed or existing streets
are upgraded.
In addition to the existing pedestrian network the General Plan establishes a new pedestrian system designed to link
major activity and recreation centers. These centers are part of the land use and recreation facilities intended to enhance
the quality of life for community residents, and to attract tourism as part of the economic development strategy
described in the Economic Development Element.
The backbone of this pedestrian system is the walkway and bikeway that links the Federal Park land with Railroad
Museum. The trail will be part of the planned “Riverwalk Park” located along the north side of the river connecting the
Federal Park to the Gulling Street Bridge. From Gulling Street, the walk continues up Commercial Street then to the
Railroad Museum. The path will be marked with 1/10-mile markers and signs identifying it as the Riverwalk trail.
One of the primary constraints to bicycle travel is the narrow pavement section on the Gulling Street Bridge. The
pavement is only 28 feet wide and would permit a four-foot wide bike lane on both sides only if the travel lanes are
reduced to 10 feet. A dedicated bike route will require additional width on the bridge.
Similarly, the width of Commercial Street limits the potential for a bike lane and on street parking on both sides of the
street.
Policies:         Bikeway and Pedestrian System
         C-P-20:            Develop a system of sidewalks and bikeways that promote safe walking and bicycle riding

4.7 TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM MANAGEMENT
    Transportation System Management (TSM) refers to measures designed to reduce the number and length of automobile
    trips, particularly during peak commute hours. TSM measures typically include ride sharing, van pools, and a variety
    of management techniques applied by larger employers in metropolitan areas. Typical TSM measures are most
    effective where they can be implemented by large employers.
    In rural communities where there is a significant number of workers commuting out to a larger metropolitan area the
    TSM measures focus on ride sharing and van pooling to reduce the number of single occupant vehicle trips. Reduced
    vehicle travel can help reduce peak hour traffic congestion, reduce future air pollution concentrations, and reduce
    consumption of energy for transportation uses. Moreover, it can help reduce individual transportation costs for Portola
    residents, yielding potentially significant savings as the cost of fuel rises.
    TSM measures can also be effective in reducing the number of vehicle trips resulting from special events. TSM
    measures can include special bus service or shuttles to bring visitors in from distant locations.
    Policies:           Transportation System Management
              C-P-28:           Establish a program to provide ride sharing and van pool opportunities for Portola residents.
              C-P-29:           Use alternative modes of transportation to bring visitors to special events.
    Implementing Policies: Transportation System Management
              C-I-37:           The City shall seek to establish a ride share information base and coordinate the matching of
                                rideshare commuters with a local service agency.
              C-I-38:           The City shall work with the County and Caltrans to locate a park and ride lot at the east
                                edge of the City to facilitate ride sharing.
              C-I-39:           The City shall seek to establish a van pool program for commuters with Caltrans or a local
                                service agency.
              C-I-40:           The City shall make information available at City Hall and the library regarding public
                                transit, ridesharing, van pools, and other transportation alternatives to single occupant
                                vehicles.
4.8 PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION
    General public transportation within Plumas County is provided by Plumas County Transit. They operate three buses
    on fixed routes, with dial-a-ride service available. Plumas County Transit is funded primarily by Local Transportation
    Funds and State Transit Assistance Funds, allocated on an annual basis through the Plumas County Transportation
    Commission. One bus begins in Portola and provides three round trips throughout Portola and to Graeagle, Blairsden,
    Cromberg, and Quincy. Plumas County Nutrition Center also provides transportation to Senior Citizens for a variety of

purposes including, but not limited to: meal delivery, medical appointments, and shopping.
In addition to the County transit service, Greyhound bus service is provided along Highway 70 on a daily basis.
The ridership on public transit in rural areas is typically quite low due to the relatively small population base and low
density of residential development. However, there are factors that indicate the potential need for expanded transit
service in Portola. The planned population growth and the residential densities shown in the Land Use Element in the
core of the City will contribute to the demand for public transit service. The City includes uses that are typically
attractions for bus ridership, such as the hospital, library, post office, shopping, and services along Sierra Street and
Commercial Street. The schools are also a potential service area.
A small, locally operated shuttle or jitney would provide the services within town and connect to the Plumas County
Transit system. A local shuttle or jitney service would provide an alternative transportation mode within the City for
visitors to special events such as Railroad Days, craft fairs, cultural and sporting events.
Policies:           Public Transit
          C-P-30:            Cooperate with Plumas County Transit to enhance the public transit ridership in Portola.
          C-P-31:            Seek opportunities to provide an alternative public transit system in Portola.
          C-P-32:            Establish a goal for public transit in Portola that will be associated with the recreation and
                             tourism opportunities in the community.
          C-P-33:            Seek to establish a regional public transportation link.
          C-P-34:            Encourage local entrepreneurial efforts to provide public transportation services.
          C-P-35:            Ensure that public transit services are linked to public parking areas, bikeways, and major
                             pedestrian routes.

4.9  RAIL
     The Union Pacific Railroad is a dominant element in the physical form of the City, but plays only a minimal role in
     local transportation. The rail line is totally dedicated to freight and the local service is limited to shipping and
     receiving. Nonetheless, the rail through the Feather River Canyon is a major trans-Sierra route and recognized as one
     of the more scenic. Although passenger service was discontinued in the 1970’s the route is still used occasionally for
     special passenger trains. Passenger rail service is growing after a long period of decline and new passenger service is
     slowly being re-established. The California State Rail Plan identifies Portola as a major railyard and connection to
     Nevada and states to the east for rail freight movement.
     The decision to institute passenger service occurs far beyond the City’s influence. Yet, the City can encourage the
     restoration of passenger service, even on a limited, periodic basis. The rail museum is an obvious draw that will bring
     rail enthusiasts to the City. The City can help support the interest in rail travel by sponsoring events that draw people
     who enjoy riding on the railroad, and by ensuring that rail travel is a convenient and comfortable experience when
     stopping in Portola.
     Guiding Policies:            Rail
               C-P-36:            Encourage Union Pacific Railroad to provide passenger service on the Feather River route at
                                  every opportunity with the ultimate goal of re-establishing regularly scheduled service.
               C-P-37:            Encourage Union Pacific Railroad to sustain the rail shipping service.
     Implementing Policies: Rail
               C-I-52:            Cooperate with the Portola Railroad Museum in their efforts to provide visitor facilities in

               C-I-53:            Zone land use near the visitor facilities to accommodate lodging, restaurants, retail shops,
                                  and other services in support of visitors to the rail museum.
               C-I-54:            Route the local shuttle system or other transportation networks under the City’s control to

               C-I-55:            Include directional signs to the rail museum in appropriate locations on any master
                                  directional signage program established by the City.
               C-I-56:            Establish a working relationship between the City administration and the local management
                                  of the Union Pacific Railroad by requesting regular meetings to discuss items of common
                                  interest regarding expansion of rail service and economic development of the region.
4.10 AIRPORT

Portola along Highway 70. The airport provides services for general aviation on a 4,600 foot long runway capable of
accommodating large general aviation aircraft.

5. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
      Portola, as many other small, rural communities, has experienced economic stagnation because of the long-term decline
      of basic industries such as mining and forestry. Historically, the local economic base relied on extracting and
      consuming natural resources. Basic industries that brought new revenue to the community formerly meant exporting
      the natural resource. Relatively low wages, high unemployment, low property values, and little prospect for return of
      the historic job base are common economic factors.
      However, new circumstances promise new economic growth if communities are poised to take advantage of them.
      These circumstances include:
                        an increase in healthy active people seeking retirement in attractive communities with recreation
                         opportunities,
                        new telecommunications technologies that enable businesses to locate virtually any where, and
                        an increase in tourism and retirement life styles brought about in part by the overall health and wealth
                         of people throughout the nation.
      Traditional location criteria such as availability of shipping or the aggregation of certain services or business
      connections have become less important for many types of businesses. With the advent of various telecommunications
      technologies, and growth in industries based on information services and manufacture of small, highly transportable
      goods, business decision-makers can be much more flexible in selecting a new business location.
      The new criterion for business growth is broader than the traditional concerns. In addition to the need for access to
      markets and transportation, the new criterion includes the availability of business services, telecommunications
      technology, and the quality of the local environment. For some employers the quality of life opportunities are now as
      important as proximity to markets and transportation.
      Economic development opportunities in Portola will occur, in part, because of the high level of natural amenity and
      recreation resources. Protection of the visual and natural amenity in this area is essential to the success of economic
      development. Good housing, good schools and parks, a vibrant social and cultural life, recreation opportunities, good
      transportation systems, and above all, an attractive natural setting are essential to the future potential growth in jobs and
      economic opportunities.
      The strategy underlying this Element is to enhance and broaden tourism as a basic economic engine, and to establish a
      new non-tourism employment base in the City. This is accomplished by establishing land use, community design,
      circulation, public facilities, and natural resource conservation goals, policies and standards in the General Plan and
      Portola Municipal Code that will accommodate new growth while protecting the natural environment.
      Authority
      The Economic Development Element is an optional element of the General Plan under Section 65303 of the
      Government Code.
                     “The general plan may include any other elements or address any other subjects which, in the
                     judgment of the legislative body, relate to the physical development of the county or city.”
      Relationship to Other Elements of the General Plan
      Although this is an optional element, it is given considerable weight in this General Plan. The success of economic
      development is interwoven with virtually all aspects of the community. Thus, the Economic Development Element
      incorporates policies and concepts that are linked with the Land Use Element, Housing Element, Public Facilities
      Element, Open Space and Conservation Element, and the Circulation Element.

    Regional Cooperation
    Portola is the service center of the east Plumas region, and the economic future of the City significantly depends on
    maintaining and expanding that role. Consequently, the economic success of Portola is closely linked with the success
    of the enterprises in the region. Provided that economic growth in the surrounding area is of good quality and does not
    diminish the environmental qualities that attract visitors and new residents, Portola will benefit from the success of its
    economic neighbors and will cooperate in efforts to ensure their success.

6. PUBLIC SERVICES AND FACILITIES ELEMENT
       Public facilities and services is the framework that supports and sustains the community. They are essential to
       maintaining the current quality of life and accommodating economic growth and development in the community. The
       availability and capacity of public infrastructure determines the ability to use land.
       The Public Services and Facilities Element is focused on ensuring that the community infrastructure is in place to
       accommodate the growth and development identified in other elements of this General Plan. This element addresses
       both hard infrastructure (such as sewer and water) and the public services (such as police and fire). The City of Portola
       provides the basic infrastructure and some of the public services required by the community. A variety of public
       agencies and private franchises provide other services. All facilities and services are included to ensure that the
       resources required to support the community is available when needed.
       The infrastructure facilities and services addressed in this element are:
            ❖Water
            ❖Sewer
            ❖Major Drainage
            ❖Communications
            ❖Electricity
            ❖Solid Waste
            ❖Schools
            ❖Libraries
            ❖Recreation and Parks
            ❖Police
            ❖Fire Protection
            ❖Community Services and General Government
       Authority
       The Public Facilities and Service Element is an optional element of the General Plan under Section 65303 of the
       Government Code.
                 The general plan may include any other elements or address any other subjects which, in the
                 judgment of the legislative body, relate to the physical development of the county or city.
       Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
       The location and capacity of basic infrastructure is closely related to the Land Use Element, Housing Element,
       Circulation Element, and Economic Development Element. The goals and policies of these other elements cannot be
       fully achieved where the basic public infrastructure is lacking.
       Relationship to the Region
       Most of the facilities and services described in this element are primarily for the benefit of the citizens of Portola.
       However, certain services clearly are of regional significance and benefit. The City shares these services outside the
       city boundary. Fire protection, for example, is extended beyond the city through mutual aid agreements.

6.1 PUBLIC SERVICES AND FACILITIES GOALS
    The Public Facilities and Services Element addresses a broad range of activities by the City and the other service
    agencies in the community. Each of these services and activities may have specific goals that relate only to the
    character of that service. Underlying all of these specific goals are guiding principles that relate to all of the services.
    These principles establish the fundamental direction for expanding and refining the public services in the community.
    Goal PF-1.         The City will be innovative in new techniques and technologies to provide the best available “state-
                       of-the-art” level of public services in a cost effective manner.
    Goal PF-2.         Public infrastructure and services will be affordable to the residents and business interests in the City.
    Goal PF-3.         Facilities improvements and services required to serve development will not place an economic
                       burden on existing residents of the City. Development will pay a fair share of all costs of required
                       public infrastructure and services.
    Goal PF-4.         Public improvements and facilities will be designed to enhance, rather than degrade, the natural
                       environment in the City and surrounding area.
    Goal PF-5.         The City’s public services and facilities will support economic development and residential growth in
                       the city.
    Goal PF-6.         Public facilities and services agencies will cooperate on a regional basis.
    Goal PF-7.         Conduits to provide connection between public facilities on both sides of the river shall be included
                       on any new bridge structure.
6.2 PROJECTED GROWTH RELATIVE TO PUBLIC SERVICES AND FACILITIES
    Population growth and economic development affects all public services and facilities. The land use projections and
    the associated population growth described in the Land Use Element is summarized here to define the range of effects
    of development.
    The population in Portola grew from 1910 to 1950, but declined from 1950 through 1970. The population grew slowly
    from 1970 through the early 1990’s, but did not recover to the 1950 level. Population growth through the 1990’s has
    been modest. Despite the relatively slow growth in the last few decades, Portola must prepare for potentially much
    higher growth in the next two decades. New population growth is likely to come from the fringe effect of overall
    growth in California, an increase in retirees, and job growth in service and tourism.
    Individual communities will grow faster or slower than the overall state projection. Moreover, in a small community
    like Portola the annual percent of growth is not as significant as the actual number of new residents. Because the
    community is relatively small, population projections based on an annual average percentage increase are not
    meaningful. With a population base just above 2,000 residents, a relatively small increase in absolute population could
    translate to a high growth rate, yet there would be little noticeable effect on the community from year to year.
    Nonetheless, the cumulative effect over time will be noticeable, and potentially significant. At a compound annual
    growth rate of 5 percent, the population in the city will reach a total of 5,678 persons in twenty years, a net increase of
    3,538 persons.
    In-fill Areas
    Older areas of the city (outlined in Figure 6-1) were never fully developed and lack basic sewer, water, drainage, and
    streets. Full development of the city will require extending the basic infrastructure to these “in-fill” areas. The in-fill
    areas provide efficient growth areas within the city boundary. New development would require relatively short
    extensions of the existing infrastructure system and would provide improved circulation, for pedestrians and vehicles,

        within the existing core area.
        Policies:          Core Area In-fill Development
                  PF-P-1.           Facilitate development of the in-fill areas by extending infrastructure.
                  PF-P-2.           Encourage comprehensive development rather than incremental, single project development.
                  PF-P-3.           Encourage compact, mixed use design in the in-fill areas that respond to the topographic and
                                    other natural constraints.
                  PF-P-4.           Make use of the public right-of-way as a tool for facilitating good quality design and
                                    development.
        Implementation:                       Core Area In-fill Development
                  PF-I-1.           The City will organize the landowners in the in-fill areas to master plan the extension of
                                    public infrastructure.
                  PF-I-2.           The City will work with the landowners to prepare comprehensive development plans
                                    equitable to all landowners and the City.
                  PF-I-3.           The City will investigate means of serving these areas with minimal capital expenditure and
                                    will identify and implement the most feasible funding mechanism.
FIGURE 6-1
INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT INFILL AREAS
6.3 DOMESTIC WATER
    Supply
    Portola provides water for domestic consumption and fire flow. The current sources of city water supply include
    Willow Creek Springs and municipal wells. Additional water capacity can be developed from new wells in the city, the
    unused springs located on Beckwourth Peak, and resumption of the Lake Davis supply.
    The total average water supply available to the City is approximately 1,400,000 gallons per day. If all wells operated
    continuously over a 24 hour period the peak production is approximately 1,740,000 gallons per day. The current
    sources include:
              Willow Creek Springs 312 gpm
              Maintenance Yard Well 300 gpm
              Commercial Street Well 600 gpm
    The City owns a subterranean water collection system on 160 acres at Willow Creek Springs, located approximately 4
    miles northwest of the City. Willow Creek was originally developed by the City in 1957. The source was further
    improved with the construction of underground galleries in 1974. With these improvements the Willow Creek facility
    consistently produces approximately 312 gallons per minute (503 acre feet per year). Potential for connecting
    additional spring “pods” to the system is believed to be limited to less than 100 gallons per minute (gpm) (Pyramid
    Engineers, page 11). The water is delivered to the City’s terminal facility through an 8 inch pipe. A 1958 report by the
    state Department of Public Health reported the pipe capacity at 667 gpm, more than double the output of the springs.
    Though this has decreased markedly with age, the delivery system probably has some unused available capacity.
    The City operates two wells located on the south side of town. The Maintenance Yard Well, located in the Portola
    Corporation Yard at First and Main Streets was drilled in 1993 and fully improved as a municipal water supply in 1995.
    The well has consistently yielded 300 to 320 gpm.
    The Commercial Street Park Well, located at the intersection of Commercial Street and Gulling Street, was put in
    service in 1998. This well has an estimated sustained yield of 600 gpm.
    The City has rights to four separate spring sources on Beckwourth Peak, south of the City- Turner, Malloy, Golden and
    Darby. Total estimated capacity of these springs is 170 gpm (270 acre-feet per year). The City stopped using the
    springs as a water source in 1971, after the Lake Davis water became available. At that time the Lake Davis water was
    considered more reliable and subject to fewer potential health hazards. Approximately 30,000 feet of antiquated and
    substandard water lines connect the spring sources with the City’s distribution system.
    Development of these springs for future use would require improvements to collect the water below ground (below root
    level) and a new delivery pipeline system. The cost of such improvements is unknown, but likely to be substantial
    relative to the amount of water that can be delivered.
    Lake Davis Water Treatment Plant
    The Lake Davis Water Treatment Plant, was constructed as part of the State Water Project, and commenced deliveries
    to the City in 1970. In 1997 the California Department of Fish and Game (DFG) poisoned the lake in an attempt to
    remove the invasive Northern Pike fish. Domestic use of the lake water was terminated as a result of that action. In
    May 1999, DFG reported that the species Northern Pike had been rediscovered in Lake Davis. This announcement led
    to concerns about the future use of Lake Davis as a potable water supply and a 2007 chemical treatment. No pick have
    been found in Lake Davis since 2007.
    In the following years, after numerous public hearings and the settlement of a lawsuit that resulted in an agreement to
    bring Lake Davis Water Treatment Plan up to new Safe Drinking Water Act standards, the City and County entered into
    an agreement to work together to bring the Plant back online. Currently, the LDWTP is substantially complete;

however it has not been accepted into use.
Future Water Supply and Demand
The existing water supply and delivery system is adequate only for the existing community. Land use development
anticipated in the Land Use Element will require an increase in the water supply and the expansion and upgrading of the
water storage and distribution system. The City completed a Water System Master Plan in 2006 that addresses the
water supply and distribution needs for the growth of the community.
Water demand for future development is estimated on the basis of 375 gallons per day per single family dwelling. This
estimate considers that all new and renovated residential development will be required to use water conserving fixtures,
and that the used of water for outdoor irrigation in the mountain environment is relatively less than required in large lot
residential use in other climates. The growing season is relatively short and the style of landscaping typically relies on
native materials that require little irrigation. Turf landscaping is not restricted in private yards, but the use of lawn areas
is typically small compared to conventional suburban areas. Therefore, there is no difference in estimated water
demand between large estate lot and small urban lots.
The future demand for water is based on the average water demand for a single family home. The average water
requirement for a single family home is referred to as a “dwelling unit equivalent” (or DUE), and all water demand for
all uses are measured in “dwelling unit equivalents”. This measure includes non-residential units.
Commercial and light industrial water use will vary with the type of activity. Large water use industrial activities
cannot be accommodated in the community unless a supplemental water supply is developed. For estimating the
average commercial use, the water demand is based on an assumed .5 DUE per acre.
Distribution
The water distribution service area includes the city as well as small, unincorporated areas to the north of Joy Road and
portions of the Portola Heights neighborhood. All of the City’s supply and storage facilities are in good operating order
and comply with current water supply standards. Water storage for the City is in three covered, above-ground steel
tanks. The Northside tank is a 1.0 million-gallon facility installed in 1976. A 250,000 gallon tank and a 500,000 gallon
tank located south of the high school serves the City south of the river.
Policies:          Water Supply and Distribution
          PF-P-5.           Secure sufficient sources of water to meet the needs of the existing community and planned
                            growth.
          PF-P-6.           Domestic water will be allocated first to serve residential and commercial uses that exist
                            prior to adoption of this General Plan.
          PF-P-7.           The City will allocate water for future development to maintain a balance of jobs and
                            housing. Exceptionally high water users that do not generate a reasonable number of jobs
                            will not be permitted in the absence of other significant benefits to the community.
          PF-P-8.           City water service will not be extended to unincorporated areas unless an adequate supply is
                            available for all areas within the city.
          PF-P-9.           The City will develop a program for the use of recycled water for exterior landscaping within
                            the parameters of State and County Health Codes and standards.
          PF-P-10.          Develop and implement water conservation measures as necessary elements of the water
                            system.
          PF-P-11.          Ensure that all development provides for and funds a fair share of the costs for adequate
                            water distribution, including line extensions, easements, and plant expansions.

               PF-P-12.         Monitor water quality regularly and take necessary measures to prevent contamination.
               PF-P-13.         Provide an emergency backup system which that meets 150% of average demand.
    Implementation: Water Supply and Distribution
               PF-I-4.          The City will prepare and adopt a Water System Master Plan that identifies the sources of
                                water and the treatment, storage anddistribution system required to serve the future growth
                                of Portola. The Master Plan will establish a baseline water capacity sufficient to serve the
                                community as of 2000. All subsequent water uses will be required to demonstrate the
                                availability of water supply, storage, and distribution before approval of any land use
                                entitlements. The City will maintain a City-wide map of all water distribution and storage
                                system components and monitor the condition of the system on a regular basis.
               PF-I-5.          The City will continue to identify and secure water supplies from ground water sources, and
                                consider utilization of Lake Davis water.
               PF-I-6.          The City shall require, as a condition of project approval, dedication of land and easements,
                                or payment of appropriate fees and exactions, to help offset municipal costs of expansion of
                                water treatment facilities and delivery systems.
               PF-I-7.          The City will encourage the use of recycled water for landscape irrigation where feasible
                                within the parameters of State and County Health Codes and standards.
               PF-I-8.          The City will continue to monitor water quality.
6.4 SEWER
    Sewer collection and treatment systems in Portola have been constructed piece meal over a period of decades. Serious
    infiltration problems and inadequate treatment resulted in upgrading the collection system and improvements to the
    treatment plant during the 1990’s. The current system is adequate for the existing community, but expansion of the
    collection system will be needed to accommodate the development anticipated in the Land Use Element. In addition,
    improvements are required to make full use of the treatment plant.
    Collection System
    The existing collection system is comprised of 15 miles of six, eight, or ten-inch lines of varying materials. The sewage
    collection system includes a Northside Pumping Station and a Southside Pumping Station. Both of these were
    constructed in the late 1940’s.
    Prior to improvements completed in 1997 and in 1999, leaky sewer mains and laterals contributed an estimated average
    of .68 million gallons per day (mgd) of inflow and infiltration during the wet weather season to the treatment plant in
    1997. The estimated total peak wet weather flow to the treatment plant was 1.56 mgd.
    Improvements to the pumping stations and the treatment plant were completed in Summer, 1997 as part of the State
    Revolving Loan Fund Project No. C-06-4364, Phase I of improvements to the entire city sewer system. Phase I
    addressed fundamental causes of past sewage surcharges by substantial reconstruction of the Northside and Southside
    pumping stations including: complete replacement of motors, pumps and piping, installation of new, optimized
    controls, correction of or addition to wet wells, addition of auxiliary power and building modifications.
    Sewage Treatment
    Sewage treatment consists of aeration and settling ponds. The ponds provide primary treatment in a total of 17.3 acres.
    The last step of sewage treatment is the chlorination/ dechlorination of pond discharge prior to flow into the 5.8 acre
    storage pond.

Treated and disinfected effluent is discharged from the storage pond to 1.8 acres of constructed wetland adjacent to the
River. Subject to Waste Discharge Order 92-147, the treated and disinfected effluent may be discharged to the River
                                           st            th
only during the period from November 1 to August 15 . Expanded pond area and effluent chlorination facilities were
constructed in 1992.
Phase I also included improved sewage treatment by providing inter-pond piping between the stabilization ponds as
well as the aeration pond and emergency aeration pond. This piping provides complete flexibility and routing through
and/or around any of the seven noted ponds. The 1992 improvements to the pond and treatment system have served to
assure discharge of effluent in conformance with prevailing water quality standards and regulations. Discharge from
the City treatment facility continues to be to the Feather River during the Winter and to constructed wetlands in the
Summer, in accord with the Waste Discharge Requirements.
Subsequent to the improvements completed in 1997 the treatment plant has capacity to process an average dry weather
flow of 0.50 million gallons per day (mgd). The peak wet weather flow capacity is 0.74 mgd and the design capacity is
0.75 mgd.
Average Household Demand for Sewer Service
The average daily flow generated by a single family home dwelling unit equivalent is 218 gallons. However, inflow
and infiltration increase the average wet weather flow to 317 gallons per day per dwelling unit. Reductions in average
dry weather flow due to improved pipeline construction found in new development will further reduce the average daily
flow to 275 gallons per dwelling unit equivalent (DUE) per day in new construction areas.
At the average rate of 275 gallons per day per dwelling unit equivalent, the wastewater treatment plant has the capacity
to serve a total of 1,818 dwelling unit equivalents, approximately double the current demand for wastewater treatment
in the City.
Policies: Wastewater Collection and Treatment
          PF-P-14.          Ensure wastewater collection and treatment for all development in the City and the safe
                            disposal of wastes.
          PF-P-15.          The City will require that collection systems be designed on a gravity-flow basis except
                            where a site-specific engineering analysis clearly demonstrates the long-term cost
                            effectiveness of pump facilities.
          PF-P-16.          The City will maintain capacity to process combined residential, commercial, and industrial
                            flow.
          PF-P-17.          The City will maintain the ability to handle peak discharge flow while meeting State
                            Regional Water Quality Control Board Standards as established in the current NPDES
                            Permit.
Implementation: Wastewater Collection and Treatment
          PF-I-9.           The City will require all sewage generators within its service area to connect to the city’s
                            system, except those areas where on-site treatment and disposal facilities are deemed
                            appropriate.
          PF-I-10.          The City will encourage and permit an industrial pretreatment program for the Portola
                            Business Park and other industrial uses in accordance with state and federal requirements.
          PF-I-11.          The City will consider the use of sub-area or project specific wastewater treatment facilities
                            that use innovative technologies that produce tertiary effluent with minimal energy costs.
                            The intent is to encourage water recycling and reduce future demands on the existing city

                                plant.
              PF-I-12.          The City will investigate methods of improving the quality of the effluent from the City
                                plant and will investigate options for reuse of treated wastewater. The recycled wastewater
                                will be used for irrigation of public recreation lands, restoration of wetland areas, and
                                irrigation of landscaped areas.
              PF-I-13.          The city will promote reduced wastewater system demand through efficient water use by:
                                a.   requiring water conserving design and equipment in new construction;
                                b.   encouraging retrofitting with water conserving devices;
                                c.   designing wastewater systems to minimize inflow and infiltration to the extent
                                     economically feasible; and
                                d.   maintaining a city-wide map of all sewer collection system components and monitor the
                                     condition of the system on a regular basis.
              PF-I-14.          The City will monitor the increase in wastewater flow on an annual basis and will
                                periodically expand the capacity of the wastewater treatment plant to ensure that there is
                                capacity to serve a minimum of five years of additional projected growth at any time.
6.5 MAJOR DRAINAGE
    Storm drainage is periodically a critical issue because a narrow corridor along the river is subject to flooding. Much of
    the flooding is caused by conditions outside the City rather than local development. Nonetheless, as the City continues
    to develop, there will be an ongoing need to minimize flood waters in the existing flood plain and along the major
    drainage channels. Storm water drainage is managed in a system of open channels, such as the Wild Cat Creek channel
    in City Park, and underground storm drains. The City of Portola Master Drainage Plan (1987) identified a series of
    specific improvements required to accommodate drainage of the existing urban area of the City. In addition, the plan
    identified other measures that apply to future development:
         •    Easements should be obtained where they do not already exist, along all major stormwater systems that lie
              outside public road rights-of-way. The granting of these easements should be made a standard practice with
              the approval of development projects.
         •    Orderly development of the City storm drainage system can be further enhanced by the construction of curb
              and gutter and the grading of lots to flow to the street or drainage easement as a part of individual lot
              development.
    Policies: Storm Water
              PF-P-18.          The City will seek to minimize additional storm water runoff from new development areas.
              PF-P-19.          The City will establish equitable methods of paying for future storm drainage improvements.
              PF-P-20.          Storm water will be managed in natural channels rather than underground pipes where
                                feasible.
              PF-P-21.          No net increase in storm water compared to the undeveloped condition will be permitted in
                                new development areas.
              PF-P-22.          Stormwater system improvements will be extended to the in-fill areas shown in Figure 6-1
                                when feasible.

    Implementation: Storm Water
              PF-I-15.          The City will explore alternatives to storm water management methods including on-site
                                retention and detention basins, and maintain a City-wide map of all drainage system
                                components and monitor the condition of the system on a regular basis.
              PF-I-16.          Developers will be encouraged to consider use of porous materials for outdoor spaces,
                                paving, and sidewalks where feasible to promote groundwater infiltration.
              PF-I-17.          The City will explore the feasibility of a City-wide rate structure to fund storm water
                                improvements and on-going maintenance. Require all new development to pay this fee as a
                                condition of the project approval.
6.6 COMMUNICATIONS
    Communication is essential to economic development for Portola. New businesses will be attracted to Portola for the
    quality of life, but many will need state-of-the-art communications to sustain their businesses. Currently, cable service
    is offered by New Day Broadband under a City Franchise Agreement. In the future, access to the Internet through cable
    or other technology will enable residents and businesses to have the same level of communications technology, and all
    the information and services that are available in any metropolitan region. The intent is to ensure that the highest level
    of communications technology is available to businesses and residents. The City will seek to be positioned to take
    advantage of new technologies.
    Policies:           Communications
              PF-P-22.          Expand the level of communications service throughout the City through cable and other
                                technologies as they become available.
    Implementation: Communications
              PF-I-18.          Explore the development of additional telecommunications technology within the City
                                including, but not limited to, fiber optic cable, DSL, and other cable services.
              PF-I-19.          Indicate to potential service providers the interest to expand communication services in the
                                City, and the intent to ensure that residents and businesses have access to the highest level of
                                communications technology feasible in the Portola area.
              PF-I-20.          Cooperate with service providers to enable construction of improvements for
                                communications.
              PF-I-21.          Where necessary to ensure that telecommunications will be provided in the most cost
                                effective manner with minimal disruption to city streets and services, the city will require
                                that all new development install sleeves, conduit, and other underground facilities required
                                for future telecommunication services.
6.7 ELECTRICITY
    Availability of relatively cost effective power is essential for many types of businesses and for the residents of Portola.
    In order to expand economic development opportunities the City must seek and support expansion of the available
    power supply.
    Liberty Energy provides electric power to Portola. The Liberty Energy substation is located at the intersection of
    Gulling Street and Fourth Avenue. Power is delivered to the substation in the transmission line along Pole Line Road
    that connects east to Loyalton. The substation contains two transformers with a capacity of 3 megawatts and 5
    megawatts, respectively. Portola currently uses approximately 5 of the total 8 megawatts available from this substation.
    Liberty Energy currently maintains three diesel generators at the substation as backup power in case of power outages
    in Portola or Loyalton. These generators have a capacity of two (2) megawatts each, and are currently near their backup
    capacity in cases of widespread power outages due to such events as large winter storms.
    Power is distributed throughout Portola in a system of overhead power lines typically along the public streets. Power
    lines are underground in the more recent subdivisions, such as Ridgewood.
    Policies: Electric Service
              PF-P-23.          Ensure that reliable, adequate electric service is available to all uses in the City at reasonable
                                cost.
              PF-P-24.          Cooperate with and encourage efforts to expand the opportunities for electric power service
                                in the City.
    Implementation: Electric Service
              PF-I-22.          The City will investigate opportunities to develop alternative sources of electric energy as
                                they become available.
              PF-I-23.          The City will consider participation with utility companies in generating and/or distributing
                                electric service within the City.
              PF-I-24.          The City will encourage energy conservation measures and innovative uses of solar energy,
                                heat recovery, and cogeneration in all structures and industrial processes.
              PF-I-25.          The City will communicate its major development plans with utility companies and
                                coordinate planning expansion of these utilities.
              PF-I-26.          The City will require undergrounding of utility lines in new development and as areas are
                                redeveloped, except where infeasible for operational reasons.
6.8 SOLID WASTE
    Solid waste generated by homes and businesses in Portola is collected by Intermountain Disposal (pursuant to a
    Franchise Agreement), collected at the Delleker Transfer Station, and then transported to the Lockwood Regional
    Landfill in Sparks, Nevada. Waste consists predominantly of mixed municipal solid wastes. Self-haul customers also
    deliver their waste to the Delleker Transfer Station. Ultimately, the waste is transported to the Lockwood Regional
    Landfill in Sparks, Nevada.
    The City owns the Portola Landfill, which collected the City’s waste through October 2002. State and Federal
    regulations placed on the City’s landfill prompted its early closure for acceptance of solid waste material. Effective
    November 1, 2002, the Portola Landfill no longer accepts solid waste material. The area east of the landfill is currently
    operated by Intermountain Disposal as an Environmental Reclamation Center and is open seasonally to the public.
    Intermountain Disposal provides curbside pickup and recycling, yard waste pickup, bulky waste pickup, rear-load
    containers, roll-off containers, storage units
    City of Portola Source Reduction and Recycling Element
    The City of Portola has established the following goals for the integrated management of solid waste generated within
    its borders:
         •    To provide for the safe, efficient, and cost effective removal of waste from residences, businesses, and
              industry.

         •    To provide adequate disposal capacity at local or regional landfills for waste generated in the City.
         •    To reduce the amount of waste disposed of in landfills by:
                ∼      reducing the amount of waste generated (i.e. source reduction);
                ∼      maximizing the recycling of generated waste;
                ∼      utilizing the nutrient value of generated waste through composting;
                ∼      to dispose of the remaining waste in a safe and environmentally sound manner.
         •    To assure the development of recycling, composting, waste transfer, and disposal facilities which satisfy the
              highest established environmental standards and regulations.
         •    To provide for the safe and efficient handling of special wastes.
    The Source Reduction and Recycling Element adopted by the City of Portola in 1996 identified the total waste
    generated by category through 2005, and projected the total refuse disposal through 2014.
    Policies:          Solid Waste Management
    PF-P-25.           The City will implement and enforce the provisions of it Source Reduction and Recycling Element.
6.9 EDUCATION
    Educational opportunities are important for the quality of life of residents and the overall sense of community that a
    good school system provides. The education programs and facilities are an integral part of the community. Good local
    education opportunity is also is an important factor in economic development. The local public school system is
    essential because future employees will prefer to locate where their children have access to quality education.
    Advanced education and training is important for residents to expand their interests and increase their job skills.
    Technological advances in many fields require that workers have access to on-going training. Therefore, adult
    education and lifelong learning opportunities will become increasingly important.
    Existing Primary and Secondary Education Resources
    The Plumas Unified School District (PUSD) is a County-wide district. Charter schools not operated by PUSD are also
    located in Portola. PUSD operates three (3) schools in Portola:
         •    C. Roy Carmichael Elementary School
         •    Portola Jr. /Sr. High School
         •    Jim Beckwourth High School East (Continuation)
    Student enrollment throughout the District, including the Portola Attendance Area, has been in steady decline.
    However, the Portola Attendance Area is projected to experience a modest resurgence in enrollment. The population
    growth projected in the Land Use Element suggests that the demand for school space will increase significantly over the
    twenty year horizon of the General Plan. If development occurs at an average growth rate of five percent annually, the
    Portola Attendance Area will increase by approximately 1200 dwellings. At an average 0.4 elementary and middle
    school children per household, the total enrollment in those grades will increase by approximately 466 children. This
    indicates the need for an additional elementary school with a capacity for 400 to 450 students. However, current (2010)
    trends do not indicate population growth in the schools; C. Roy Carmichael Elementary School has a student population
    of 320 and Portola Junior/Senior High School has a student population of 300.
    At an average of approximately 0.2 high school students per household, the total high school enrollment will increase
    by approximately 233 students over the next twenty years.
    This is substantially higher than the current district projections that indicates a growth in enrollment of only 34 students
    for grades K-6 over five years (2002/03), or an average annual growth rate of 1.21%. The five-year projection for
    grades 7-8 also shows a growth in enrollment of 24 students, a 2.81% average annual growth rate. The projection for

grades 9-12 indicates a cumulative growth of 48 students in five years, a 3.57% growth rate. The five year overall K-12
enrollment of 1,124 shows annual growth rate averaging 2.02% or approximately 21 students per year, a cumulative
growth rate of 103 students from the 1997/98 enrollment.
The 1997-98 enrollment figures show that only Feather River Middle School is operating above capacity, with 65
students more than the State capacity of 203 students. The growth projections used in the General Plan indicate that the
population in the Portola area could more than double in the next two decades. Such growth would surely increase the
demand for classroom space beyond the capacity of the existing campuses.
Additional school sites, if needed, will require substantial time for advance planning, and ultimately design and
construction. The district and the City need to cooperatively plan for the location of future schools.
Existing Post Secondary Education Resources
Post secondary education is provided by the Feather River College. Located in Quincy, the college also provides
classes in Portola. The community college is an important resource that should have an expanded presence in Portola
as the community grows as the economic hub of east Plumas County. The city will encourage the expansion of the
community college programs and, ultimately, facilities within the community. The growth of telecommunications as a
teaching tool can help the community college expand their program offerings locally. Similarly, many larger
institutions offer extended learning programs through telecommunications. In keeping with the goals and policies for
expanding telecommunications opportunities in Portola, the City will encourage the expansion of education
opportunities.
The University of Nevada, Reno is the nearest four year institution. The opportunities for extending education through
on campus programs are expanding for Portola residents with the growth in commuting to the Reno area for
employment.
Policies: Education
          PF-P-26.          Adequate facilities must be shown to be available in a timely manner before approval will be
                            granted to new residential development.
          PF-P-27.          Financing of new school facilities will be identified and assured before new development is
                            approved.
          PF-P-28.          The City and the School District will work together to develop criteria for the designation of
                            school sites and consider the opportunities for reducing the cost of land for school facilities.
                            The City will encourage the school district to comply with City standards in the design and
                            landscaping of school facilities.
          PF-P-29.          The City and the School District will consider opportunities for joint-use of facilities. If
                            feasible, a joint-use agreement will be pursued to maximize public use of facilities, minimize
                            duplication of services provided, and facilitate shared financial and operational
                            responsibilities.
          PF-P-30.          Designate public/quasi-public land uses in clusters, such as the civic core area, so that the
                            use of schools, parks, open space, libraries, child care and community activity and service
                            centers create a community or activity focus.
          PF-P-31.          Where feasible, schools will be located away from hazards or sensitive resource conservation
                            areas, except where the proximity of resources may be of educational value and the
                            protection of resources is reasonably assured.
Implementation: Education
          PF-I-27.          The City will inventory all public lands to identify opportunities for joint-use facilities.
                     PF-I-28.          As needed, the City will request a meeting with the Administrator and the Board of Trustees
                                       of the school district to review development issues and opportunities for cooperation
                                       between the school district and the city.
                     PF-I-29.          The City will encourage the school district to provide curriculum that enhances the economic
                                       development potential of the area.
                     PF-I-30.          The City will encourage the Feather River College to expand the education program
                                       offerings in Portola.
     6.10  LIBRARIES
           Libraries are an important part of community quality of life. Even with the expanding use of the Internet as a means of
           communication and disseminating information, the public library will continue to function as a source of printed
           information, and a landmark institution that helps define the community.
           The Portola Branch Library was built in 1994, and planning for the building included anticipation of the city’s future
           growth. The library is 3,950 square feet in size, and was built to serve a population up to 6,000 people. The library can
           hold up to 14,000 volumes. Currently, the library has 10,250 volumes. On the basis of 14,000 volumes to serve 6,000
           people, the current service capacity of the library is a population of 4,393 people. This is approximately double the
           current population of the City, but this library serves the population of eastern Plumas County.
           The library is staffed by one .9 FTE (full time employee) branch library assistant, and is open 37 hour per week. The
           library is a branch of the Plumas County Library and is funded entirely by the County. The City of Portola agrees to
           plow the library parking lot in the winter.
           Staffing is based primarily on circulation (number of books checked out). An increase in population would cause a
           proportional increase in the demand for services. The growth projections used in this General Plan indicate that the
           population in the Portola area could more than double in the next two decades. Such growth would surely increase the
           demand for library services. However, the increased use of the Internet and other information resources may diminish
           the normal level of increase.
           Policies: Libraries
                     PF-P-32.          The City and County will work together to develop criteria for expansion of library service
                                       in the City.
                     PF-P-33.          As the need for additional capacity emerges, the City and County will consider opportunities
                                       for joint-use of facilities. If feasible, a joint-use agreement will be pursued to maximize
                                       public use of facilities, minimize duplication of services provided, and facilitate shared
                                       financial and operational responsibilities.
                     PF-P-34.          Designate public/quasi-public land uses in clusters, such as the civic core area, so that the
                                       use of schools, parks, open space, libraries, child care, and community activity and service
                                       centers create a community or activity focus.
6.11 RECREATION AND PARKS
           Parks are an important part of the overall vision for the City of Portola. The overall intent of the park improvements in
           the City is to provide recreation amenities for the residents. A secondary objective is to provide space for public
           gatherings that may attract visitors to the community. In addition to the typical purpose of providing open space and
           recreation for City residents, the parks are envisioned as space for music and craft fairs, exhibitions, and other public
           events. Consequently, the parks need to be designed to serve a variety of roles.
           In order to meet the primary objective of resident recreation, the park facilities need to be designed with the local

     neighborhoods in mind. With the current distribution of parks (one to the north and one to the south of the river) there
     is a park within reasonable walking distance of all residents. The intent is to provide a series of parks within convenient
     walking distance of one another and linked by a pedestrian system consisting of sidewalks and trails through open space
     areas.
     The City currently owns three developed park sites including the 35-acre Riverwalk Park, the 13.8-acre City Park, and
     the 5-acre Baldwin Park. The city owns a total of 53.8 acres, or 24.5 acres per one thousand residents. A total of 18.8
     acres of park are fully improved.
     Under the California Subdivision Map Act (the “Quimby Act”) a City or County can require the dedication of up to five
     (5) acres of park per one thousand residents. In lieu of dedication of land, a developer may pay a fee for dedication of
     land to the city.
     The Riverwalk Park planned along the north bank of the Feather River is a major visual and social center for the
     community. It is envisioned as a place for active recreation, quiet open space, and river access, as well as a highly
     visible open space that helps establish the character of the city.
     Policies:          Recreation and Parks
               PF-P-41.          The Riverwalk Park and the City Park are to provide the primary areas for public activities
                                 that will draw visitors to the community. These parks will include picnic areas, restrooms,
                                 and a turf area that can be used for craft fairs, music presentations, sporting events and
                                 similar activities. Parking will be provided near or on the park site.
               PF-P-42.          Neighborhood parks shall conform to the following typical standards:
                                 a.   Minimum size shall be 3 usable acres.
                                 b.   The typical service area for a neighborhood park shall be approximately 1/4 mile.
                                 c.   Neighborhood parks shall include a turf area of approximately one acre, a tot lot, a small
                                      picnic area, and a drinking fountain. Public restrooms are not included in a
                                      neighborhood park.
                                 d.   A public street shall front the park on at least two sides. The intent is to provide a clear
                                      view into the park from a street front and to encourage the use of the park.
     Implementation: Recreation and Parks
               PF-I-31.          The City will establish specific development criteria for the use of Riverwalk Park in a
                                 Master Plan for this area.
               PF-I-32.          The City will seek joint-use of tennis courts and other public use facilities with the school
                                 district.
               PF-I-33.          The City will establish a park development and maintenance fee program applied to all new
                                 residential development.
               PF-I-34.          All new residential development will be required to make a land dedication or pay an in-lieu
                                 fee for park land dedication based on providing 5 acres per 1,000 residents.
6.12 POLICE
     Growth in the City of Portola, along with increased tourism and businesses, will incrementally increase the demand for
     police protection over time. Increases in the level of police services will need to grow in response to population
     increases. It is intended that the police service in Portola be based on principles of Community Oriented
     Policing/Problem Solving Policing (COP/PSP). This involves a community-based, problem solving, police service
     organization that would continuously focus on meeting community needs. Fundamental to these principles is formation

     of a partnership involving the delivery of police services between the community, the police and elected officials
     focused on making the City a quality place to live, work and play.
     A primary characteristic of community oriented policing is involvement in the community. This can take the form of
     direct contact with the residents, such as foot or bicycle patrols in the neighborhoods, recreation, and commercial areas,
     participation in local youth activities, and working relationships with the local business community. The police service
     may include a mix of commissioned officers and non-commissioned officers designed to use noncommissioned officers
     for calls which require less safety training and responsibility. The non-commissioned officers, known as Community
     Service Officers, will be trained in recognition and identification of personal and public safety symptoms, criminal and
     traffic accident report writing and crime scene reconstruction. They would assist the commissioned officers by
     monitoring the neighborhoods, coordinating with block watch activities and assortment of crime prevention/human
     service activities. Such an approach would be particularly useful if the city pursues tourism and visitor based economic
     development. Such economic activity will involve management of large groups of visitors during special events. The
     guiding concept is to develop a police service tailored to the particular needs of Portola.
     Law enforcement in Portola is provided by the Plumas County Sheriff’s Office. There are currently five (5) patrolmen
     and one (1) supervisor serving the eastern portion of the County.
     The patrol service for the eastern portion of the County is headquartered at the Sheriff’s substation located on Gulling
     Street in Portola adjacent to the Portola Library and City Hall. The City of Portola contracts with the PCSO to provide
     patrol service within the city limits. The contract is renegotiated periodically to reflect increased levels of service and
     costs of service.
     In order for the city to pursue implementation of the Community Oriented Policing concept it is necessary to establish
     specific guidelines and objectives for police services. This can be accomplished through close coordination with the
     County Sheriff, but as the community grows, the concept of a City-based police service should be considered.
     Policies: Police
               PF-P-42.          The City will establish a standard for the level of police service and will establish the criteria
                                 for determining the circumstances under which police service will be improved.
     Implementation: Police
               PF-I-35.          The City will review the level of service provided by the County Sheriff and determine
                                 whether increased levels of service are required to serve additional population.
               PF-I-36.          The City will establish the means of funding additional police service through benefit
                                 assessment districts, sales tax, fees for development, or other methods.
               PF-I-37.          The City will establish a plan to incorporate Community Oriented Policing principles in the
                                 current police service and will expand and tailor the service over time to meet the specific
                                 needs of the community.
               PF-I-38.          The Planning Commission and City Engineer will review proposed residential street patterns
                                 to evaluate the accessibility for police patrols and emergency response.
6.13 FIRE PROTECTION
     Fire protection and emergency response is essential for the well-being of the city residents and is fundamental to attract
     many types of business to the community. The cumulative effect of growth in the city will incrementally increase the
     number of calls for service from the Portola Fire Department (PFD). The current Insurance Services Organization
     (ISO) level of service, and other indicators of service capability, will be affected over time. The effects will be in terms
     of personnel requirements for training and emergency responses, and in increased need to upgrade equipment and
     engines.

The City of Portola Fire Department (PFD) provides fire protection throughout the city and in adjacent areas through
mutual aid agreements. The PFD is primarily a volunteer organization, but maintains an ISO rating of 5. This reflects a
relatively high standard of training, personnel, equipment, response times, and fire suppression water availability for a
small, rural community. The PFD maintains two stations, one north of the Middle Fork Feather River at the
intersection of Gulling Street and Plumas Street, and the other south of the river at the intersection of First Avenue and
Pacific Street.
The City Engineer has identified a potential fire flow deficiency within portions of the city resulting from the elevation
relative to, and the distance from, the south storage tank. This will be resolved by constructing a new water storage
tank at a higher elevation on the south side of the city, and construction of new water distribution lines to serve Area B.
Policies:          Fire Protection
          PF-P-43.          The City will establish fundamental standards for level of service that include response times
                            and level of response criteria and will establish the criteria for determining the circumstances
                            under which fire service will be improved.
Implementation:             Fire Protection
          PF-I-39.          New development will participate in the funding of a prorata share of new fire protection
                            equipment, including personnel safety equipment, engines, and stations through benefit
                            assessment districts, sales tax, fees for development or other methods as may be established
                            for this purpose.
          PF-I-40.          New construction will conform to all standards for fire safety as established by the City
                            through zoning, other municipal codes, and building construction codes.
          PF-I-41.          The City Engineer will ensure that new development meets City standards for fire safety
                            access and emergency egress.
7. SAFETY ELEMENT
       Safety hazards can occur as a result of the actions of nature or works of man. The intent of the Safety Element is to
       identify the potential hazards in the community that must be considered when planning the location, type, and intensity
       of development. The primary objective of the Safety Element is to reduce the potential for loss of life, injuries, and
       property damage which could result from a natural or man caused disaster.
       Authority
       The Safety Element is mandated by the California Government Code (65302 (g)). The statute requires:
                      “.. A Safety Element for the protection of the community from any unreasonable risks associated
                      with the effects of seismically induced ground shaking, ground failure, tsunami, seiche, and dam
                      failure; slope instability leading to mudslides and landslides; subsidence and other geologic
                      hazards known to the legislative body; flooding; and wildland and urban fires. It shall also
                      address evacuation routes, peak-load, water-supply requirements, and minimum road widths and
                      clearances around structures as those items relate to identified fire and geologic hazards.”
       Specific topics addressed in this Element include:
                          Seismic and Geologic Hazards
                          Flood Hazards
                          Dam Failure Inundation
                          Wildland Fire Protection
                          Hazardous Materials
       Relationship to Other Elements
       The mandated Safety Element relates to the subjects addressed in the Land Use Element, Conservation and Open Space
       Element, Public Services and Facilities Element, and Air Quality Element.
   7.1 SEISMIC AND GEOLOGIC HAZARDS
       Geology of the Portola Region
       Portola is located in the Humbug Valley Ground Water Basin. The Humbug Valley, the Sierra Valley to the east and
       the Mohawk Valley to the west, are believed to have been formed during the Pliocene-Pleistocene Eras (3 million to 11
       million years ago). Evidently, these were undrained basins trapped among the volcanoes and granite knobs of the
       region. They filled with water during a time when rainfall was heavier than it is now, and became lakes until their
       outlet streams managed to erode valleys deep enough to restore drainage into the Feather River.
       Much of the floor of Humbug Valley is comprised of lake deposits from the ancient lake. Intermediate alluvium,
       unconsolidated sand and silt not over 60 feet in thickness, overlay the lake deposits in areas adjacent to the Feather
       River, most of the City of Portola south of Highway 70, and the Charles Valley area north of Highway 70. Alluvial
       soils are among those least resistant to seismic shaking.
       It is interesting that the Feather River drains this region westward toward and through the high Sierra Nevada
       Mountains. The river would be expected to flow “down hill” away from the high Sierra toward the east. This
       unexpected direction of flow indicates that the river is older than the outlines of the present landscape, and managed to
       maintain its westward course through all the regional faulting and volcanism of the last several million years. The river
       was able to erode its channel downward more rapidly than the uplift of the Sierra Nevada block.

The geology of the area is characterized as Ql (Quaternary lake beds) on the Geologic Map of the Chico Quadrangle,
California (California Division of Mines and Geology, 1977). Quaternary lake beds are described as pebble
conglomerates, sands, and clays.
Landslide Hazard Identification Program
Under the Seismic Hazards Mapping Act of 1990 (AB 3897), regional data must be gathered and zones mapped to
identify areas where earthquake geologic hazards may occur. This information is to be used in city and county hazard
mitigation plans and incorporated into general plan safety elements. The existing conditions are described in Appendix
A.
Alquist Priolo Act
The Alquist-Priolo Special Studies Zone Act of 1972 is directed at areas identified by the State Geologist as likely to
experience earthquakes. The Act focuses on surface fault rupture and not shaking. It addresses earthquake safety in
building permits and subdivision procedures by requiring project applicants to submit a registered geologist’s report
describing potential for on-site surface rupture.
There are no active faults in Portola that have been zoned by the State Geologist under the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake
Fault Zoning Act. The nearest seismically active faults are the Mohawk Valley Fault located approximately 8.5 miles
(13.7 kilometers) to the west of Portola, and the Honey Lake Fault located approximately 21 miles (33.8 kilometers) to
the east. The nearest potentially active fault zone is the Sulphur Creek Fault Zone located approximately 8 miles (12.9
kilometers) to the southwest, which has an estimated maximum credible earthquake magnitude of 6.5.

                               by earthquakes and wind.
7.2 FLOOD HAZARDS
    The primary flood hazard in Portola is the Middle Fork Feather River, a Federally designated Wild and Scenic River,
    which courses through the City. The creeks and tributaries which drain into the river also pose flood hazards when
    snow melt or storm runoff exceeds drainage capacity.
    Floodplain Area
    The boundaries of the 100-year floodplain for the Feather River are delineated by the Federal Emergency Management
    Agency (FEMA) on the basis of hydrology, topography, and modeling of flow during predicted rainstorms. Areas
    designated as flood zones are shown on published Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM). FEMA requirements for
    residential development in a designated ‘A’ Zone include raising the first floor to at or above the base flood elevation
    (100-year). The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) requires owners of property within designated flood zones
    to purchase flood insurance.
    7.2.1    Flood Safety Goals
    Goal F-1.         Minimize the potential for loss of life and property due to flooding.

                                minimize the potential for flooding.
             F-I-9.             Require a Drainage Plan as condition of the approval for urban residential subdivisions over
                                ten acres in area. Require the Plan to provide mitigation to insure that the cumulative rate of
                                peak runoff is maintained at pre-development levels.
7.3 DAM FAILURE INUNDATION
    The Grizzly Creek Dam at Lake Davis is located on Grizzly Creek which drains into the Middle Fork Feather River in
    Portola. According to the Grizzly Creek Dam Inundation Map, portions of the 100-year floodplain in Portola would be
    subject to inundation in the event of dam failure. (See FEMA Flood Zone Map)
    Through enforcement of the policies and implementation measures for restricting development within the 100-year
    floodplain (Subsection 7.2.1 above), the threat to Portola is minimal in the event of failure of the Grizzly Creek Dam.
    7.3.1    Dam Failure Safety Goals
    Goal DF-1.         Minimize injury and property damage due to dam failure inundation.
    Policies:          Dam Failure Safety
             DF-P-1.            Ensure that all development is above the inundation zone of any potential dam failure at
                                Lake Davis.
    Implementation:             Dam Failure Safety
             DF-I-1.            Enforce the policies and implementation measures for restricting development within the
                                100-year floodplain.
7.4 WILDLAND FIRE PROTECTION
    The scars of a major wildland fire just to the south of Portola High School is ample evidence that the possibility of
    wildland fire in the area is substantial. The potential for future fires is inherent in Portola’s natural setting. Expansion
    of the City into the forest areas will increase this potential hazard. Consequently, all planning for new development
    must incorporate fundamental fire safety design criteria that addresses access for emergency vehicles, evacuation of
    residents, the location and type of construction, and the clearing of vegetation to provide fire safe zones around all

development.
Development in the forest areas around the City are regulated by interlinked statutes and local standards and guidelines.
Uniform Fire Code
The Uniform Fire Code addresses suppression and control of hazardous fire areas. Safeguards are presented which are
intended to prevent the occurrence of fires, and to provide adequate fire protection facilities to control the spread of fire
which might be caused by recreational, residential, commercial, industrial, or other activities conducted in hazardous
fire areas.
California Board of Forestry: SRA Fire Safe Regulations
Subchapter 2 (State Responsibility Areas -SRA- Fire Safe Regulations), Title 14 of the Public Resources Code Section
4290, constitutes the basic wildland fire protection standards of the California Board of Forestry. On May 30, 1991, the
Office of Administrative Law (OAL) approved and filed with the Secretary of State the language for the SRA Fire Safe
Regulations (and subsequently updated). These standards apply to development projects in state responsibility areas or
in local jurisdictions which have adopted SRA Fire Safe Regulations.
California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection
The SRA Fire Safe Regulations are administered by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CDFFP)
Ranger Unit Headquarters in each county. The CDFFP Ranger Unit Headquarters for Plumas County is located in
Quincy. Local requirements implementing SRA Fire Safe Regulations are reviewed and approved by the CDFFP.
Plumas County Fire Safe Council
The Plumas County Fire Safe Council is an association of fire fighting and protection agencies in Plumas County. The
Council is currently developing a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the member agencies. Primary
goals of the Council include education of Plumas County residents regarding fire behavior and protection.
County of Plumas
Plumas County has adopted SRA Fire Safe Regulations. The County has included these regulations in its “New
Building Permit Requirements” and "New Subdivision Requirements” publications. These regulations are applicable to
development projects within the County’s jurisdiction.
7.4.1     Wildland Fire Safety Goals
Goal WF-1.          Protect against injury, loss of life, and damage to property and the environment due to wildland fire.
Policies:           Wildland Fire Safety

                             County Fire Departments to establish a cooperative fire fighting agreement in areas prone to
                             wildland fires, and to enhance the benefit to the City of tools such as air tankers and
                             helicopters.
          WF-P-2.            Work with the Plumas National Forest, the California Department of Forestry, and Plumas
                             County Fire Departments to establish cooperative participation in establishing fuel breaks
                             and prescribed burns.
          WF-P-3.            Require a Fire Safe Plan for new development.
Implementation:              Wildland Fire Safety (Plumas Fire Safe Council recommendations are
                             incorporated by reference to the General Plan as may be amended from time-to-

                                time )
             WF-I-1.            Adopt the SRA Fire Safe Council Regulations for existing and new development in the areas
                                adjacent to open forest.
             WF-I-2.            As a condition of approval for all residential development over ten acres with ten or more
                                dwelling units, a Fire Safe Plan prepared by a Registered Professional Forester shall be
                                submitted to the City. The Fire Safe Plan shall be consistent with the City adopted SRA Fire
                                Safe Council Regulations. The current regulations and future revisions will be adopted by
                                the City of Portola and are incorporated to the General Plan.
7.5 HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
    The City of Portola is not included on a list of hazardous materials sites compiled pursuant to Government Code
    Section 65962.5. However, the handling of hazardous materials is a daily activity in truck traffic and trains that pass
    through the City. The Federal Government, under Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations, lists thousands of
    hazardous materials, ranging from radioactive waste and explosives to gasoline, insecticides, and household cleaning
    products.
    Storage
    Safe and proper storage of hazardous materials incorporates a variety of techniques, depending upon the type of
    material being stored. Underground storage tanks are commonly used for the storage of hazardous materials, especially
    petroleum products. These storage devices are found most often at gas stations and businesses operating vehicle fleets.
    There are two (2) gas stations within the City of Portola. The Union Pacific Railroad operation facilities are another
    potential location of hazardous materials storage. Leaking underground storage tanks contaminates the surrounding soil
    and possibly the water table.
    Transportation
    Hazardous materials are routinely transported by truck over state and federal highways as well as local roads (e.g.,
    gasoline tankers). The California Vehicle Code Section 31303 requires that hazardous materials be transported via
    routes with the least overall travel time, and prohibits the transportation of hazardous materials through residential
    neighborhoods.
    The Union Pacific Railroad through the City must be considered a possible source of hazardous materials spills. In the
    event of a derailing or other railroad accident, the residents could be exposed to any hazardous materials being
    transported by the railroad.
    Disposal
    Hazardous materials, used in many household products (e.g., drain cleaners, waste oil, cleaning fluids, insecticides and
    car batteries), are often improperly disposed of as a part of normal household trash. Furthermore, there is risk to the
    community from exposure or explosion caused by adding hazardous waste to landfills that are not equipped to handle
    them.
    Emergency Response
    Response to a hazardous waste spill varies according to the circumstances under which it is released. Union Pacific
    Railroad has primary responsibility for hazardous materials spills on its premises. Hazardous materials spills on state
    and federal highways are the responsibility of Caltrans and the California Highway Patrol (CHP), which provide on-
    scene management of the spill site and coordinate with the Environmental Health Department, Office of Emergency
    Services, and the local fire department. Primary responsibility for handling of these events within the City is assigned
    to the Portola Fire Department.
7.5.1   Hazardous Materials Safety Goals
Goal HM-1.      Protect health, safety, natural resources, and property through regulation of use, storage, transport,
                and disposal of hazardous materials.
Policies:       Hazardous Materials Safety
        HM-P-1.          Maintain an awareness of hazardous materials in the Portola area.
        HM-P-2.          Develop an Interagency Hazardous Materials Emergency Plan.
Implementation:          Hazardous Materials Safety

                         and commercial businesses within the City of Portola. The list shall be maintained by the
                         Portola Fire Department (PFD), and updated through periodic review.
        HM-I-2.          Work with Plumas County and other public agencies to inform consumers about household
                         use and disposal of hazardous materials.
        HM-I-3.          Cooperate fully with Union Pacific Railroad and other agencies, such as the CHP, in the
                         event of a hazardous material emergency.
        HM-I-4.          Continue operation of a City hazardous waste pick-up program for household hazardous
                         materials.
8. CONSERVATION AND OPEN SPACE ELEMENT
       Clean air and water, healthy forests, meadows, streams and the Feather River make Portola an attractive place to live
       and work. These assets must be conserved and protected as the community grows and the population increases.
       This General Plan seeks to accommodate population growth while conserving, and protecting the area’s natural
       resources and quality of life. Economic development and quality of life are not inconsistent and contradictory goals.
       Indeed, economic development for the City of Portola and the east Plumas County region depends on protecting the
       abundant, high quality natural resources that are essential to the quality of life in Portola.
       Authority
       The Conservation Element and the Open Space Element are both mandated by the Government Code (Sections
       65302(d) and 65302(e)). The Conservation Element is required to:
                     “. . .provide direction regarding the conservation, development, and utilization of natural
                     resources.”
       The Open Space Element is required to:
                     “. . .guide the comprehensive and long-range preservation and conservation of ‘open-space
                     land’ (Section 65563). Open-space land is defined in the code as any parcel or area of land or
                     water that is essentially unimproved and devoted to open-space use (Section 65560(b)).”
       The discussion of these topics are organized under the following headings:
                             Water Conservation
                             Energy Conservation
                             Soils and Erosion Control
                             Water Quality
                             Open Space
                             Feather River
                             Biological Resources
                             Archaeological, Historic, and Cultural Resources
                             Mineral Resources
       Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
       The required topics for Conservation and Open Space indicate substantial overlap. Water supply, energy sources, and
       outdoor recreation are addressed in the Pubic Services and Facilities Element. Open space is addressed in the Land Use
       Element. Energy efficiency is discussed in the Community Design Element and the Circulation Element.
   8.1 WATER CONSERVATION
       Potable water is essential for human habitation. Conservation of water resources is essential for meeting the demands
       of current and future residents, and new economic development. The primary goals are not only to conserve and protect
       current water resources, and minimize the demand for new sources of water.
       Water supply and conservation is also addressed in Section 6, the Public Services and Facilities Element.
       8.1.1    Water Conservation Goals

    Goal WC-1.        Minimize the consumption of water to reasonable levels consistent with a high level of amenities and

             WC-I-5.           Actively pursue the use of treated wastewater in irrigation and industrial applications,
                               including development of appropriate infrastructure.
8.2 ENERGY CONSERVATION
    The potential for growth in Portola will depend on conserving and planning for the future allocation of energy
    resources. The primary goals are not only to conserve and protect current energy resources, but also to seek new
    sources of energy for current and future land use.
    8.2.1    Energy Conservation Goals
    Goal EC-1.        Develop a pattern of land uses and circulation that will help conserve scarce or nonrenewable energy
                      resources.

                               through an efficient roadway and intersection system. The circulation pattern is designed to
                               minimize trips required for shopping and daily errands.
             EC-I-9.           Develop alternative transportation systems, such as public transportation and bikeways,
                               which reduce the need for automobile use and petroleum products.
8.3 SOIL
    The primary concerns regarding soil erosion are soil loss and water quality loss due to erosion and sedimentation. The
    effect on water quality is discussed in Section 8.4 below. Soil loss is due primarily to development and land
    management practices that leave disturbed soil exposed to weather.
    The majority of the soils in the study area were formed in alluvium, and are found on alluvial fans and terraces or
    stream terraces. Runoff is slow on these deep alluvium soils, and the hazard of erosion is “slight.” The soils in the
    General Plan study area are described in Appendix B.
    8.3.1    Soil Erosion Control and Safety Goals
    Goal SC-1.       Preserve and maintain Portola’s soils to avoid pollution of the Feather River and its tributaries and
                     loss of soil.
    Policies:        Soil Erosion Control and Safety
             SC-P-1.           Minimize soil erosion and loss of topsoil from land development activities, wind, and water
                               flow.
             SC-P-2.           Minimize risk from expansive soils.
    Implementation:            Soil Erosion Control and Safety
             SC-I-1.           Require site-specific research and ground surveys for proposed development projects. This

                                 research should include a detailed inventory of soil conditions, and appropriate mitigation
                                 measures for avoiding or reducing erosion and risk from expansive soils. This requirement
                                 may be waived if determined by the City that the proposed project area is already sufficiently
                                 surveyed.
              SC-I-2.            Comply with Uniform Building Code (UBC) requirements for specific site development and
                                 construction standards for specific soil types.
              SC-I-3.            Comply with the California Uniform Building Code (CUBC) Chapter 29, regulating
                                 excavation, foundations, and retaining walls; and Chapter 70 regulating grading activities,
                                 including drainage and erosion control.
              SC-I-4.            Require projects in areas that have highly expansive soils to undertake necessary studies and
                                 structural precautions as part of the project approval process. (Where prior soil studies on
                                 similarly-situated property have been conducted, the City may waive the requirement for
                                 field work in order to avoid imposing unnecessary application costs.)
              SC-I-5.            If expansive soil is present, it may be necessary to remove a portion of the clay, deepen
                                 footings, and/or moisture condition slab-on-grade and flatwork subgrade.
8.4 WATER QUALITY
    Water quality refers to protection of both surface and groundwater resources from contamination. Protecting surface
    water quality involves minimizing sedimentation from soil erosion, and minimizing pollution of waterways and other
    water bodies from urban runoff. Protecting groundwater quality requires maintaining high water quality within the
    creek systems. Much of the policies in this element address the management of land development and use of potential
    contaminants.
    Urbanization has both short-term and long-term impacts on water quality. Development results in increased impervious
    surfaces (streets, storm drains, rooftops, etc.) which decrease infiltration opportunities and may increase the volume and
    rate of runoff. Increased runoff velocity can result in increased channel erosion, which in turn can result in increased
    sediments into surface waters. Construction activity can also result in degradation of surface water quality.
    Long-term impact to water quality may occur as a result of runoff from urbanization that enters the water courses.
    Urban runoff from streets, parking lots, driveways, and landscaped areas may include oil, grease, heavy metals,
    pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers, and sediments.
    Urbanization can also impact groundwater recharge and quality. Groundwater is recharged by rainwater that reaches
    the subsurface saturated zone of the soil through percolation. Impervious surfaces reduce the percolation of water and
    the associated filtration processes beneficial to water quality. Pollutants found in urban runoff can leach into aquifers,
    impacting groundwater quality.
    The major surface water within the study area is the Middle Fork Feather River. The river is fed by numerous creeks
    and drainages, most of which are unnamed. The most significant of these are Humbug Creek and Grizzly Creek.
    Humbug Creek empties into the river just west of Delleker. Charles Valley Creek feeds Humbug Creek as its course
    leaves Charles Valley. Grizzly Creek courses from Lake Davis and empties into the river east of Portola. Willow
    Creek, located outside the study area to the west, is a third major creek in the area feeding the river.
    Best Management Practices (BMP’s) are methods to control and abate discharges of material into water courses.
    BMP’s are very important tools in protecting and maintaining water quality in the creeks, as well as the Middle Fork
    Feather River into which the creeks empty. Maintaining high water quality within the creek system will also help to
    keep contaminants out of the groundwater aquifer.
    The California State Water Resources Control Board has jurisdiction over nine Regional Water Quality Control Boards,
    whose charge it is to identify and implement water quality objectives. Portola falls under the authority of the Central

    Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board.
    8.4.1     Water Quality Goals
    Goal WQ-1.         Maintain water quality in Portola surface and ground waters.
    Policies:          Water Quality
              WQ-P-1.          Minimize sedimentation and loss of topsoil from soil erosion.

                               State Water Resources Control Board will be used.
              WQ-I-4.          Comply with the Regional Water Quality Control Board’s regulations and standards to
                               maintain and improve groundwater quality in Portola.
              WQ-I-5.          Where feasible, maintain the natural condition of waterways and floodplains, and protect
                               watersheds to ensure adequate groundwater recharge and water quality.
              WQ-I-6.          Coordinate water quality and groundwater resource efforts with other appropriate agencies.
8.5 OPEN SPACE
    Portola is currently a compact, rural community surrounded by open space and divided by the Feather River, a major
    open space feature. One of the most notable visual characteristics of the community is the sense of open space within
    and around the City. Protection of these features is fundamental to maintain the quality of life enjoyed by current
    residents. New development will inherently change some aspects of the open space resource, but through planning for
    the location and character of new development, the existing open space can be protected.
    Access to open space is also very important. Recreation along the river and in the surrounding forest is a major
    attraction for residents and visitors. The General Plan serves to enhance the potential for access to the open space
    resources in and around the City.
    In Portola, open space includes lands that serve the following purposes:
    •Open space for the preservation of natural resources. Such areas are required for the preservation of plant and animal
    life, including habitat for fish and wildlife species (particularly rare, endangered or threatened plant and animal
    species), areas required for ecological and other scientific study purposes, rivers, streams, bank of rivers and streams,
    wetlands, and watershed lands. In Portola, the primary open space resource area is the Feather River and its major
    tributaries.

•Outdoor recreation. This includes areas of outstanding scenic, historic, and cultural value, areas particularly suited for
park and recreation purposes including access to the river and streams, and areas that serve as links between major
recreation and open space reserves, including utility easements, stream- and riverbanks, trails, and scenic highway
corridors.
•Public health and safety. This refers to areas requiring special management or regulation due to hazardous or special
conditions, such as earthquake fault zones, unstable soil areas, floodplains, watersheds, areas presenting high fire risks,
and areas required for the protection and enhancement of air quality. In Portola, such areas include the flood plains and
steep slope areas.
• Preservation of scenic areas and vistas. Settled in a narrow valley, Portola is surrounded by mountain peaks that
visually define the community. Much of the surrounding mountain area is in public lands and is not likely to be
developed in a manner that will affect the views from Portola. However, there are scenic areas within the General Plan
study area and vicinity that have the potential to be developed in the future.
8.5.1    Open Space Goals
Goal OS-1.         Maintain open space as a key feature of Portola.
Policies:          Open Space
         OS-P-1.            Establish a comprehensive system of public and private open space, including interconnected
                            open space corridors.
         OS-P-2.            Maximize the potential for open space, recreation, and visual experiences.
         OS-P-3.            Provide access to public open space areas.
Implementation:             Open Space
         OS-I-1.            Where feasible, integrate creekside greenways with the City’s open space system and
                            encourage public access to creek corridors.
         OS-I-2.            Utilize the open space system to connect neighborhoods and define the edges of
                            neighborhoods.
         OS-I-3.            Provide an interconnecting system of open space corridors that incorporate bicycle and
                            pedestrian paths.
         OS-I-4.            Use the system of open space corridors to provide pedestrian and bike connections between
                            schools, parks and other recreation, commercial uses, employment centers, the river and the
                            federal lands surrounding the City.
         OS-I-5.            Require all new development to provide linkages to existing and planned open space that
                            would logically be connected through the project.
         OS-I-6.            Provide opportunities for public education through the City’s open space system, natural
                            resource areas, and parks and recreation facilities.
         OS-I-7.            Cooperate with private open space preservation groups, private land owners and developers,
                            and other public agencies, such as Plumas County and the U.S. Forest Service, to
                            permanently set aside and protect open space areas that are significant to the environmental
                            quality and identity of the City. Such open space areas include the Wild and Scenic Middle
                            Fork Feather River and its major tributaries in the City, the Charles Creek Meadow, the
                            meadow along Highway 70 at Grizzly Creek Road, and the meadow areas along Highway 70
                            downstream of the Portola pump station.

              OS-I-8.            Monitor groundwater resources. Areas where recharge potential is determined to be high
                                 should be considered for designation as open space.
8.6 MIDDLE FORK FEATHER RIVER
    The Feather River is a special open space resource that significantly helps define the character of Portola. Not only is it
    a strong visual presence, the river provides unique opportunities for recreation in the center of the City. Few
    communities have the advantage of a beautiful river running through the center of town with very few structures
    abutting and screening out the river. The south side of the river abuts the Union Pacific Railroad and the land is held by
    the railroad. Therefore, the land is not accessible, but is relatively undisturbed by development.
    The relative lack of development along portions of the north side of the river provide unparalleled opportunities to
    maintain the visual dominance of the river while also providing exceptional opportunities for public use and access.
    The Community Design Element provides guidelines for development of lands abutting the river in a manner that will
    take advantage of the views and provide access, but will not eliminate the view from the adjacent streets.
    Protection and enhancement of this resource is a primary goal not only of this Element, but it underlies the fundamental
    concepts of this General Plan. That is, an attractive, compact community integrated with the natural environment.
    The river was dredged and straightened through Portola about the middle of the 1900s. The effect is a somewhat deeper
    and straighten channel than would otherwise exist. Restoration of the river to a more natural configuration with
    naturally occurring bars, shallows, rock outcrops, and pools would enhance the visual quality and the fisheries quality
    of the river. The adjacent floodplain along the north side of the river is flanked by stands of pines and a riparian strand
    that extends along the foot of the steep bluff that provides a view from Sierra Street to the river.
    The river and its immediate environment were designated a Wild and Scenic River by Congress in 1968. Thus the river
    is under the jurisdiction of the Plumas National Forest. Public Law 90-542 (October 2, 1968) declares that “...certain
    selected rivers of the Nation which, with their immediate environments, possess outstandingly remarkable scenic,
    recreation, geologic, fish and wildlife, historic, cultural, or other similar values shall be preserved in free-flowing
    condition, and that they and their immediate environments shall be protected for the benefit and enjoyment of present
    and future generations.” The Act continues, “...the appropriate Secretary shall issue guidelines, specifying standards for
    local zoning ordinances, which are consistent with the purposes of this Act. The standards specified in such guidelines
    shall have the object of (A) prohibiting new commercial or industrial uses other than commercial or industrial uses
    which are consistent with the purposes of the Act, and (B) the protection of the bank lands by means of acreage,
    frontage, and setback requirements on development."
    In its current state the river is not easily accessible for recreation, either on the river or along its banks. Although it is
    one of the dominant visual features in the area, it is only occasionally actively used by residents or visitors. The vision
    in this General Plan is to make the river not only a significant visual resource, but a resource for community events,
    active recreation and wildlife conservation, as well.
    8.6.1     Feather River Goals
    Goal FR-1.          Enhance and make use of the river for public access and recreation compatible with the qualities of
                        the Wild and Scenic River designation.
    Policies:           Feather River Open Space
              FR-P-1.            The Feather River corridor through the City of Portola will accessible to the public where
                                 feasible and practical.
              FR-P-2.            The Feather River corridor through the City of Portola will provide recreation amenities for
                                 residents consistent with the natural resource.
              FR-P-3.            The Feather River corridor through the City of Portola will provide space for public events

                                such as craft fairs and music presentations consistent with the natural resource.
             FR-P-4.            The Feather River corridor through the City of Portola will include a bike trail along the
                                river.
    Implementation:             Open Space
             FR-I-1.            The City will develop a master plan for the river corridor. The master plan will include a
                                bike trail, handicap access to the river, low impact recreation facilities which may include a
                                turf play field, and habitat conservation areas.
             FR-I-2.            Development along the river will be encouraged to provide public access and orientation to
                                the river as described in the Community Design Element, Section 3.7.
             FR-I-3.            The bike trail along the river will be linked to an interconnecting system of open space
                                corridors that incorporate bicycle and pedestrian paths where feasible.
             FR-I-4.            The City will actively seek funding for bike trails, public access and other improvements to
                                the river corridor that are consistent with the Wild and Scenic River designation.
             FR-I-5.            Require all new development along the river to provide linkages to existing and planned
                                open space that would logically be connected through the project.
             FR-I-6.            Coordinate with the school district to provide opportunities for public environmental
                                education along the river corridor and provide environmental interpretive signs for the
                                general public.
             FR-I-7.            Cooperate with private open space preservation groups, Plumas Corporation, and other
                                public agencies, such as Plumas County and the U.S. Forest Service, to develop and
                                implement a program for restoring and enhancing the quality of the river as a habitat for fish.
8.7 BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES
    Biological resources within the study area are significant and important to the prosperity of Portola. These resources
    include:
                  •Wetlands
                  •General Vegetation Types and Habitats
                  •Special Status Wildlife
                  •Plumas National Forest Lands
    Wetlands
    There are a number of areas within the Portola General Plan study area which may contain jurisdictional wetlands.
    Waters of the United States include, but are not limited to, perennial and intermittent streams, lakes, ponds, and
    wetlands such as marshes, wet meadows, and seeps.
    The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) has jurisdiction within the GP Update study area under the authority of
    Section 404 of the Clean Water Act for the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States. Most
    work involving a discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States requires prior Department of the
    Army authorization under the Clean Water Act.
    A Preconstruction Notice and Nationwide Permit 26 (NWP 26) application to the Corps is required if proposing to fill
    any type of U.S. waters greater in size than 1/3 acre but less than 3.0 acres. Proposed fill of waters greater than 3.0
    acres in size is not eligible for a NWP 26; this level of fill requires that an Individual Permit be obtained from the

        Corps. NWP 26 applies only in isolated waters or above headwaters.
        General Vegetation Types and Habitats
        The California Vegetation System (CALVEG) identifies three basic vegetation types in the General Plan study area.
                       •   Mixed Conifer-Fir (MF)
                       •   Urban-Agriculture (UA)
                       •   Barren (BA)
        The general, broad-brush vegetation types are shown in Appendix B, General Vegetation Map. Ground surveys by
        qualified biologists must be conducted for site-specific land use decisions.
        Special Status Species
        Special status biological resources include California State or federal listed, candidate, or proposed rare, threatened, and
        endangered, and sensitive animals, plants, and natural communities that have been afforded special status by public
        agencies or major conservation organizations. Table 8-1 lists the special status species identified within the Portola
        General Plan Study Area.
TABLE 8-1
SPECIAL STATUS SPECIES
        Special Status Wildlife
        There are two (2) animal species afforded special status which are known to occur, or to potentially occur, within or
        adjacent to the study area, as shown in Table 8-1 above. These species are also shown in Appendix B.
        The Data Base search (CNDDB) reports one state endangered wildlife species, the Willow Flycatcher (Empidonax
        traillii). This special status bird nests in dense willow thickets, which are present near the Middle Fork Feather River
        and on the edges of wet meadows, ponds, and backwaters.
        8.7.1      Biological Resources Goals
        Goal BR-1.         Protect and maintain all biological resources in the Portola area.
        Policies:          Biological Resources
                   BR-P-1.           Emphasize existing natural areas bordering the Wild and Scenic Middle Fork Feather River.

              BR-P-2.            Encourage exchange of urban land uses for U.S. Forest Service lands within the City’s
                                 Sphere of Influence.
              BR-P-3.            Protect special-status species and other species that are sensitive to human activities.
              BR-P-4.            Maintain healthy and well-managed habitat areas in conjunction with one another.
              BR-P-5.            Enhance the fish habitat potential of the Feather River in the City.
    Implementation:              Biological Resources
              BR-I-1.            Require site-specific research and ground surveys for proposed development projects. This
                                 research must include a detailed inventory of all biological resources onsite, and appropriate
                                 mitigation measures for avoiding or reducing impact to these biological resources. This
                                 requirement may be waived if determined by the City that the proposed project area is
                                 already sufficiently surveyed.
              BR-I-2.            Integrate, where feasible, passive recreational and educational opportunities with the
                                 protection of wildlife and vegetation habitat areas.
              BR-I-3.            Incorporate existing trees into development projects where preservation is feasible.
              BR-I-4.            Preserve and rehabilitate, if required, continuous riparian corridors and adjacent habitat
                                 along the creeks and Middle Fork Feather River.
              BR-I-5.            Require dedication of the 100-year floodplain or comparable mechanism to protect habitat
                                 and wildlife values in perpetuity.
              BR-I-6.            Require preservation of contiguous areas in excess of the 100-year floodplain as merited by
                                 special resources or circumstances. Special circumstances may include sensitive wildlife or
                                 vegetation, wetland habitat, slope or topographical considerations, recreational opportunities,
                                 and maintenance access requirements.
              BR-I-7.            Require cumulative mitigation plans for wetlands, where feasible.
              BR-I-8.            Limit the access of pedestrians and cyclists to wetland areas so that access is compatible with
                                 long-term protection of these natural resources.
              BR-I-9.            Manage public lands with special status species to encourage propagation of the species, and
                                 discourage nonindigenous, invasive species.
              BR-I-10.           Work with adjacent jurisdictions, regulatory agencies, and community organizations to
                                 explore opportunities for regional mitigation measures, including mitigation banking.
              BR-I-11.           Work with the California Department of Fish and Game and other agencies to improve the
                                 fish habitat potential in the river by providing boulders, gravel banks, and other natural
                                 features that enhance the aeration of water and provide habitat for trout.
8.8 ARCHAEOLOGICAL, HISTORIC, AND CULTURAL RESOURCES
    The Humbug Valley and surrounding area was home to the Miwok Indians and early settlers. Consequently, the area is
    rich in potential cultural sites. The specific locations of such sites are not addressed in the General Plan and do not
    directly affect the location or character of land use.
    8.8.1     Archaeological, Historic, and Cultural Resources Goals

    Goal AHCR-1. Protect archaeological, historic, and paleontological resources for their aesthetic, educational, and
                    cultural values.
    Policies:       Archaeological, Historic, and Cultural Resources
            AHCR-P-1.         Create and preserve a record of the community.
    Implementation:           Archaeological, Historic, and Cultural Resources
            AHCR-I-1.         Require a records search for any proposed development project, to determine whether the
                              site contains known archaeological, historic, or cultural resources and/or to determine the
                              potential for discovery of additional cultural resources. This requirement may be waived if
                              determined by the City that the proposed project area is already sufficiently surveyed.
            AHCR-I-2.         Require that sponsors of proposed development projects on sites where probable cause for
                              discovery of archaeological resources (as indicated by records search and where resources
                              have been discovered in the vicinity of the project) retain a consulting archaeologist to
                              survey the project site. If unique resources, as defined by California State law, are found, a
                              qualified archaeologist or historian shall be called to evaluate the find and to recommend
                              proper action. Require a monitoring plan for the project to ensure that mitigation measures
                              are implemented.
            AHCR-I-3.         When feasible, incorporate significant archaeological sites into open space areas.
            AHCR-I-4.         The City should compile an inventory of all historic sites throughout the City. The inventory
                              will contain a narrative of the significant facts regarding the historic events or persons
                              associated with the site, and pictures of the site.
            AHCR-I-5.         The City should maintain an archive of historic information, including photographs,
                              publications, oral histories, and other materials.
            AHCR-I-6.         The historic archives will be compiled according to location in the City and will be
                              maintained in a safe environment to protect it over time.
            AHCR-I-7.         The City should develop policies and the means to make the information available to the
                              public for viewing and research, as long as the City does not make public information that
                              will allow the public to raid the site.
            AHCR-I-8.         Encourage the placement of monuments or plaques that recognize and celebrate historic
                              sites, structures, and events.
            AHCR-I-9.         Amend the Zoning Ordinance to include a landmark Overlay District to be applied to
                              designated landmarks and historic sites, and require preparation of conservation plans for
                              designated landmarks and historic sites.
            AHCR-I-10.        All City permits for reconstruction, modification of existing buildings will require submittal
                              of a photograph of the existing structure or site. The intent is to create a record of the
                              buildings in the City over time. A photograph will also be required for vacant sites that will
                              be modified with new construction of new buildings or other above ground improvements.
            AHCR-I-11.        Support the use of the Williams House, a site of historic interest, as a location for a local
                              historic museum, visitor center, and community gathering place.
8.9 MINERAL RESOURCES
    There are no known mineral resources within the study area. There is no Mineral Resource Zone Map available for the
study area. There are no active sites on or near the study area listed in the available information on gravel and other
mineral resources in California.
8.9.1    Mineral Resources Goals
Goal MR-1.        Protect and develop mineral resources in Portola, should they be discovered.
Goal MR-2.        Balance the development of mineral resources, should they be discovered, with protection of the
                  natural environment.
9. NOISE ELEMENT
       Noise is generally defined as unwanted sound. A sound that may be disturbing to one person, may go unnoticed by
       another. Residents of a small, rural mountain community such as Portola, can reasonably expect that the overall level
       of sound will be low compared to more urban settings. Traffic levels will be less, sirens and other sounds of urban life
       will be nonexistent, or at least, more rare. The sounds of people, groups of children at play and of large gatherings will
       be relatively more localized and less frequent.
       The relative lack of sound associated with human activity is valued in the community. The relative quiet of the
       neighborhoods in the forest and the opportunity to sit on the bank and listen to the river are among the attractions for
       many residents. Because many rural residential areas experience very low noise levels, residents may express concern
       about the loss of “peace and quiet” due to the introduction of even low noises. In very quiet environments, the
       introduction of virtually any change in local activities will cause increases in noise levels.
       The purpose of the Noise Element is to define goals and policies for managing the effect of sound in the community. It
       is the overall goal of the Noise Element to protect the health and welfare of the community by promoting community
       development and activities that are compatible with noise level criteria.
       Authority
       The Noise Element is mandated by the California Government Code (65302 (f)). The statute requires:
                      “ a Noise Element which identifies and appraises noise problems in the community. The Noise
                      Element shall recognize the guidelines established by the Office of Noise Control in the State
                      Department of Health Services ...”
       The statute also requires that the Noise Element analyze and quantify projected noise levels for highways, primary
       streets, railroads, and stationary noise sources.
       Relationship to Other Elements
       •    Land Use Element. Noise generated by the railroad and traffic along major roads is considered in establishing the
            pattern of planned land uses depicted on the General Plan Land Use Diagram. The intent is to minimize the
            exposure of community residents to excessive noise.
       •    Circulation Element. Traffic volumes are used to estimate the future noise levels along major streets.
       •    Community Design Element. The design of building elements that can generate or control noise, such as trash
            enclosures or sound walls are guided through standards in the Community Design Element.
       •    Conservation and Open Space Element. Noise exposure is considered to avoid excessive noise that would
            adversely affect enjoyment of recreational pursuits in designated open space. Open space also can be used to
            buffer sensitive land uses from noise sources.
       Sensitive Land Uses
       Noise sensitive land uses include residences of all types, nursing homes, day care centers, the Eastern Plumas Hospital,
       schools, parks, and open space near the City. In general, most portions of the Planning Area which contain noise-
       sensitive uses are relatively quiet.
       The Uniform Building Code states that: “Interior community noise levels (CNEL) with windows closed, attributable to
       exterior sources, shall not exceed an annual CNEL or Ldn of 45 dB in any habitable room.” This standard is to apply to
       all new hotels, motels, apartment houses, and dwellings other than single-family detached dwellings. State law also
       requires noise insulation of new multi-family dwellings constructed within the 60 dB CNEL noise exposure contours.

9.1 NOISE GOALS
    The existing City is a relatively quiet mountain community with the notable exception of the railroad operations and the
    Highway 70 traffic noise. These sources are endemic to the community and cannot be easily avoided. The fundamental
    objective is to avoid creating new noise generating conditions that would degrade the existing community environment,
    or to place a sensitive land use where it would be adversely affected by an existing noise source.
    Goal N-1.          Protect City residents from the harmful and annoying effects of exposure to excessive noise.
    Goal N-2.          Protect the quality of life in the community and the tourism economy from noise generated by
                       incompatible land uses.
    Goal N-3.          Accommodate additional tourism and visitors without creating new noise sources.
    Goal N-4.          Ensure that places of quiet remain near the urban areas of the City.
    Goal N-5.          Protect public health and welfare by eliminating existing noise problems where feasible, by
                       establishing standards for acceptable indoor and outdoor noise, and by preventing significant
                       increases in noise levels.
    Goal N-6.           Incorporate noise considerations into land use planning decisions, and guide the location and design
                       of transportation facilities to minimize the effects of noise on adjacent land uses.
9.2 MOBILE NOISE SOURCES
    The primary noise sources in the Plan Area are traffic along Highway 70 and railroad operations. The noise contours
    are linear bands that depict noise levels at 60 dB Ldn. The 60 dB Ldn contour represents the level for which any new
    residential development that is not shielded generally will require mitigation to comply with noise standards. These
    contours are generalized depictions of the conditions found in the community and should be used only as an indication
    of the need for additional study as described in the policies in the Noise Element.
    Contours along roadways represent the predicted noise level and do not reflect the mitigating effects of noise barriers,
    structures, topography, or vegetation. Because intervening structures and topography may significantly affect noise
    exposure at a particular location, the noise contours should not be considered site specific, but rather are guides to
    determine when detailed acoustic analysis should be undertaken.
    Noise from the railroad operations is generally buffered by distance from much of the community. The rail lines are
    separated from homes on the north side of the river by a distance of approximately 550 feet and from homes to the
    south by approximately 250 feet.
    Other mobile noise sources include the train whistles and the occasional emergency helicopter flights to the Eastern
    Plumas Hospital. Each of these noise sources cannot be easily mitigated and cannot be eliminated.
    Policies:          Mobile Noise Sources
              N-P-1              Allow the development of new noise-sensitive land uses only in areas where the existing or
                                 projected transportation generated noise level does not exceed the levels specified in Table
                                 9-1. Noise sensitive uses include, but are not limited to residential, schools and hospitals.
                                 Noise mitigation measures may be required to reduce noise in outdoor activity areas and
                                 interior spaces to the levels specified in Table 9-1.
              N-P-2.             Require new roadway improvement projects to be mitigated so as to not exceed the noise
                                 levels specified in Table 9-1 at outdoor activity areas or interior spaces of existing noise-
                                 sensitive land uses.
                  N-P-3.                An acoustical analysis shall be required as part of the environmental review process so that
                                        noise mitigation may be considered in the project design.
                  N-P-4.                An acoustical analysis prepared pursuant to the Noise Element shall:
                                        a.     Be the responsibility of the applicant.
                                        b.     Be prepared by a qualified person experienced in the fields of environmental noise
                                               assessment and architectural acoustics.
                                        c.     Include representative noise level measurements with sufficient sampling periods and
                                               locations to adequately describe local conditions and the predominant noise sources.
                                        d.     Estimate existing and projected (20 years) noise levels in terms of Ldn or CNEL and/or
                                               the standards of Table 9-1 and/or 9-2, and compare those levels to the adopted policies
                                               of the Noise Element.
                                        e.     Recommend appropriate mitigation to achieve compliance with the adopted policies and
                                               standards of the Noise Element.
                                        f.     Estimate noise exposure after the prescribed mitigation measures have been
                                               implemented.
                                        g.     Describe a post-project assessment program which could be used to monitor the
                                               effectiveness of the proposed mitigation measures.
TABLE 9-1
MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE NOISE EXPOSURE
TRANSPORTATION NOISE SOURCES
          Table Footnotes (Table 9-1):
          •    Outdoor activity areas for residential development are considered to be backyard patios or decks of single family dwellings, and the patios or
               common areas where people generally congregate for multi-family developments.
          •    Outdoor activity areas for non-residential developments are considered to be those common areas where people generally congregate,
               including pedestrian plazas, seating areas, and outside lunch facilities.
          •    Where the location of outdoor activity areas is unknown, the exterior noise level standard shall be applied to the property line of the receiving
               land use.
          •    Determined for a typical worst-case hour during periods of use.
          •    Where a proposed use is not specifically listed on this table, the use shall comply with the noise exposure standards for the nearest similar use
               as determined by the City.
        Implementation:                 Mobile Noise Sources

             N-I-1.             Use the “normally acceptable” noise levels for new land uses as established in Table 9-1
                                (Noise and Land Use Compatibility) as review criteria.
             N-I-2.             New development in residential areas with an actual or projected exterior noise level of
                                greater than 60 dB CNEL will be conditioned to use mitigation measures to reduce exterior
                                noise levels to less than or equal to 60 dB CNEL. Site-specific measures could include the
                                incorporation of building materials, building location, building orientation, setbacks, and/or
                                walls or barriers.
             N-I-3.             Assist in enforcing compliance with noise emissions standards for all types of vehicles,
                                established by the California Vehicle Code and by federal regulations, through coordination
                                with the Plumas County Sheriff’s Department, and the California Highway Patrol.
             N-I-4.             In making a determination of impact under the California Environmental Quality Act
                                (CEQA), consider an increase of four or more dB to be “significant” if the resulting noise
                                level would exceed that described as normally acceptable in Table 9-1.
             N-I-5.             Conduct site-specific railroad noise studies for noise sensitive projects anticipated to be
                                affected by railroad noise.
             N-I-6.             Control noise at the source through use of insulation, berms, building design and orientation,
                                buffer space, staggered operating hours and other techniques. Use noise barriers to attenuate
                                noise to acceptable levels.
             N-I-7.             Evaluate new transportation projects, such a rail or public transit routes, using the standards
                                contained in Table 9-1. However, noise from these projects may be allowed to exceed the
                                standards contained in Table 9-1, if the City Council finds that there are special overriding
                                circumstances.
             N-I-8.             Require an acoustical analysis where:
                                •    Noise sensitive land uses are proposed in areas exposed to existing or projected noise
                                     levels exceeding the levels specified in Table 9-1.
                                •    Proposed transportation projects are likely to produce noise levels exceeding the levels
                                     specified in Table 9-1 at existing or planned noise-sensitive uses.
             N-I-9.             Require that all acoustical analyses utilize a consistent format and be prepared in accordance
                                with Policy N-P-4.
             N-I-10.            Work in cooperation with Caltrans and the Union Pacific Railroad to maintain noise level
                                standards for both new and existing projects in compliance with Table 9-1.
             N-I-11.            Work with the Railroad Museum Association to establish guidelines for use of whistles and
                                horns in the daily activities of the museum.
9.3 STATIONARY NOISE SOURCES
    The rural, mountain character of the City does not include many industrial, commercial or other activities that generate
    substantial noise. The primary current sources of noise include the City land fill, the Daw's Recycling facility on Taylor
    Street and the electric generators at the Sierra Pacific substation on Fourth Avenue. None of these is a major, consistent
    noise source.
    Implementation of the General Plan will create new noise sources that may be significant. Among these are the new
    business park planned on the extension of Gulling Street, and additional commercial and business-professional land use
    along First Avenue and Taylor Street. In addition, the planned use of the River Park area, the existing community park,
    and Commercial Street for public events, such as craft fairs and music fairs has the potential to increase traffic and

        crowd noise during short periods.
        Policies:             Stationary Noise Sources
                  N-P-5.                  Allow the development of new noise-sensitive uses only where the noise level due to fixed
                                          (non-transportation) noise sources satisfies the noise level standards of Table 9-2. Noise
                                          mitigation may be required to meet Table 9-2 performance standards.
                  N-P-6.                  Require proposed fixed noise sources adjacent to noise sensitive uses to be mitigated so as to
                                          not exceed the noise level performance standards in Table 9-2.
                  N-P-7.                  Where noise mitigation measures are required to achieve the standards of Tables 9-1 and 9-2,
                                          the emphasis of such measures should be placed upon site planning and project design.
                                          These measures may include, but are not limited to, building orientation, setbacks,
                                          landscaping and building construction practices. The use of noise barriers, such as sound
                                          walls, should be considered as a means of achieving the noise standards only after all other
                                          practical design-related noise mitigation measures have been integrated into the project.
                  N-P-8.                  Regulate construction related noise to reduce impacts on adjacent uses.
                  N-P-9.                  Public events, such as carnivals, music festivals and other gatherings will be designed and
                                          managed to avoid creating a noise nuisance.
        Implementation:                   Stationary Noise Sources
                  N-I-12.                 An acoustical analysis shall be required as part of the environmental review process so that
                                          noise mitigation may be considered during project design.
                  N-I-13.                 The City shall use the noise Level Performance Standards contained in Table 9-2 for
                                          reviewing new development of noise-sensitive uses exposed to fixed noise sources.
                  N-I-14.                 The Municipal Code will be amended to add noise management standards for all public
                                          events.
TABLE 9-2
PERFORMANCE STANDARDS FOR NON-TRANSPORTATION NOISE SOURCES OR PROJECTS AFFECTED BY NON-TRANSPORTATION NOISE
SOURCES
          Table Footnotes (Table 9-2):
          •    Each of the noise levels specified above should be lowered by five dB for simple noise tones, noises consisting primarily of speech or music,
               or recurring impulsive noises. Such noises are generally considered by residents to be particularly annoying and area primary source of noise
               complaints.
          •    No standards have been included for interior noise levels. Standard construction practices should, with the exterior noise levels identified,
               result in acceptable interior noise levels.

10. AIR QUALITY
           Good, clean air is a critical environmental resource and is essential to the quality of life in Portola. Not only does the
           quality of air affect the residents on a daily basis, the naturally high level of air quality, along with other amenities,
           attracts visitors and new business that sustain the economic viability of the community. As a small, mountain
           community, Portola inherently avoids many air quality problems that plague more populous, warmer environs. Yet, the
           rural mountain setting brings other air quality problems. There is a propensity for atmospheric inversion layer
           formation in mountain valleys leading to trapped air pollution, as well as the propensity for smoke to settle into low
           areas. These strong inversions and stagnant conditions are especially prevalent during the winter. The fundamental
           goal of the Air Quality Element is to protect the health and welfare of the community by promoting air quality
           standards in all aspects of development, transportation, and activity affected by this General Plan.
           Authority
           The Air Quality Element is an optional element of the General Plan under Section 65303 of the Government Code.
                           The general plan may include any other elements or address any other subjects which, in the
                          judgment of the legislative body, relate to the physical development of the county or city.
           Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
           This Element incorporates policies and concepts that are linked with the Land Use Element, Community Design
           Element, Circulation Element, Public Services and Facilities Element, and Safety Element.
   10.1    PRIMARY SOURCES AND AMBIENT AIR QUALITY STANDARDS
           The California and Federal Clean Air Acts establish air quality standards for several pollutants, primarily ozone, and
           particulate matter. These state and federal acts require jurisdictions in areas that violate these standards to prepare and
           implement plans to achieve the standards. Relevant California and federal Ambient Air Quality Standards are shown in
           Table 10-1.
           Ozone
           Ozone is a public health concern because it is a respiratory irritant that increases human susceptibility to respiratory
           infections. Ozone also causes substantial damage to natural vegetation, including the forest, and damages many
           materials by acting as a chemical oxidizing agent.
           Ground-level ozone is the principal component of smog. Ozone is not directly emitted into the atmosphere, but is
           formed by the photochemical reaction of ozone precursors, reactive organic gases (ROG) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), in
           the presence of sunlight. Ozone levels are highest during late spring and early summer when precursor emissions are
           high and meteorological conditions are favorable for the complex photochemical reactions to occur. Generally, the
           majority of reactive organic gas and nitrogen oxide emissions come from motor vehicles.
           Plumas County is currently considered to be unclassified for ozone. The current standards are not exceeded.

           California standards for ozone are not to be exceeded. The ozone standard is attained if,
           during the most recent three-year period, the average number of days per year with maximum
           hourly concentrations above the standard is equal to or less than one.
        Particulate Matter (PM 10 and PM 2.5)
        There are two size ranges of particulate matter (PM) for which state and federal health-based standards have been
        developed: PM 10 and PM 2.5. The numbers 10 and 2.5 refer to particle diameter in microns. PM 10 includes PM 2.5
        but also includes particles larger than 2.5 microns, up to 10 microns.
        Portola's PM 2.5 is mostly smoke particles from open burning, wildfires, wood stoves and fireplaces. Exhaust from
        motor vehicles, off-road equipment, trains and generators, as well as aerosol particles of natural and man-made origin,
        are also components. PM 10 includes dust, which in Portola’s case is mostly windblown natural dust and dust from
        sanding roads in the winter. Some pollen and mold spores are also smaller than 10 microns.

        Fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) is the main pollutant of concern in Portola. PM 2.5 has been shown to contribute to
        asthma development, lung capacity reduction among children, breathing difficulty, eye irritation, exacerbation of
        cardiovascular problems, and even premature death. It is especially damaging for sensitive individuals such as children,
        elderly citizens, individuals with pre-existing health conditions, and people who are exercising outdoors. PM 2.5 is
        considered to be more dangerous than PM 10 because smaller particles travel deeper into the lungs and include some
        compounds with toxic properties.
        Table 10-2 lists both the state and federal ambient air quality standards for PM10 and PM 2.5.
        Greenhouse Gases (GHGs)
        Global climate change has been clearly documented and is predicted to have substantial effects on the world we live in,
        not only in parts of the world that are far away, but here in California. Emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) must be
        curtailed if we hope to minimize the extent and impact of climate change. The majority of GHG emissions come from
        combustion of fossil fuels for energy and transportation. While renewable energy sources, cleaner fuels, and green
        technology will help to reduce GHG emissions, we also need significant changes in how we design and construct our
        “built environment” to meet our climate protection goals.

     The State of California is leading the country in efforts to reduce greenhouse gases and the impacts on the global
     climate. The California legislature has passed and the Governor has signed the landmark greenhouse gas and climate
     change legislation, Assembly Bill 32 (AB 32), commonly known as the “California Global Warming Solutions Act of
     2006,” that will have substantial impacts on the City of Portola. In addition, the California Attorney General has
     initiated legal action against local governments for not addressing greenhouse gas and climate change issues in
     California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) documents prepared for General Plan updates and development projects.
     The Air Quality Element provides a focal point for the City of Portola’s General Plan efforts to reduce greenhouse
     gases and climate change impacts.
     Under the current AB 32 “business as usual” scenario developed by the California Air Resources Board (ARB),
     statewide greenhouse gas emissions are increasing at a rate of approximately 1 percent per year as noted below. The
     following estimates represent the average statewide reductions needed from all emission sources (including all existing
     sources) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions back to 1990 levels.
           •   1990: 427 Million Metric Tons of Carbon Dioxide Equivalent (MMTCO2e)
           •   2008: 495 MMTCO2e (an average 14 percent statewide reduction needed to achieve 1990 base)
           •   2020: 596 MMTCO2e “Business As Usual”(an overall 29 percent reduction needed to achieve 1990 base)
     Senate Bill 375 was signed in September 2008 and establishes a process to develop regional targets for reducing
     projected year 2020 greenhouse gas emissions from passenger vehicles and light-duty trucks back to 1990 levels.
     Greenhouse Gases and Their Sources
     Carbon dioxide is the most dominant greenhouse gas; however a number of other gases also contribute significantly to
     climate change, including methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), hydrochlorofluorocarbons
     (HFCs) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs). Each gas has a different heat trapping capacity compared to CO2. For instance,
     methane is 21 times more effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere compared to the same mass of CO2, while some
     of the fluorocarbons have thousands of times more heat trapping capacity as CO2. To account for these differences
     whencomparing emissions for the different compounds, the emissions are generally expressed in terms of CO2
     equivalents (CO2e). Thus, generic references to GHG emissions generally mean CO2 equivalent emissions.
     From a land use standpoint, carbon dioxide, and methane are the most importantGHGs the City of Portola has the
     potential to significantly influence and will be the primary focus of general plan goals, policies, and reduction
     implementation strategies (CAPCOA) Model Policies for GHGs.
10.2 EXISTING CONDITIONS IN PORTOLA
     The Northern Sierra Air Quality Management District includes Plumas County. The District’s Board of Directors has
     approved staff’s involvement in the development of city and county general plans to meet the strategic goal of keeping
     all jurisdictional areas out of federal nonattainment for all pollutants.
     As of 2010, there are four air pollution monitors in Portola: One for near real-time PM 2.5 hourly data, one with filters
     for PM 2.5 24-hour data (used by EPA for attainment designations) and two for information on the types of particulate
     matter present in the ambient air.
     The Portola Valley portion of Plumas County was designated non-attainment for the California PM 2.5 standard (12
     micrograms per cubic meter of air, annual average) in 2003, based on monitors in Portola.
     In September, 2006, EPA issued a revised ambient air quality standard for PM 2.5 (35 micrograms per cubic meter of
     air, 24-hour average). The value used to compare with the standard is the 98th percentile of samples for each year,
     averaged over the past 3 years. Thus, if between 100 and 150 valid samples are collected in 3 consecutive years, the
     third highest for each year are averaged. This is called the “design value.”

Raw data for 2006-2008 place Portola above the federal standard. However, the NSAQMD was able to document, to
EPA’s satisfaction, that some of the high values during 2007 and 2008 were due to wildfires, so those were tossed out
of the averaging as “exceptional events.” After discarding the exceptional event values, Portola remained in attainment
through 2008. Preliminary 2009 data indicate that the area is still in attainment, just barely.
          Year     Design Value
          2005     33 μg/m3
          2006     30 μg/m3
          2007     31 μg/m3
          2008     34 μg/m3
          2009     34 μg/m3 (preliminary data)
If the design value exceeds 35 μg/m3, a federal non-attainment designation will occur.
Portola is within federal standards for all other air pollutants. There used to be an ozone monitor in Quincy, which was
removed in 2009. Data prior to 2009 placed Plumas County in the attainment range.
EPA has indicated that a violation of the federal PM 2.5 standard at the Portola site would probably result in the entire
County, and possibly an even larger portion of northern California, being designated as a federal PM 2.5 non-attainment
area.
The consequences of violating the federal PM 2.5 standard are serious. A federal non-attainment designation for
Plumas County would necessitate the preparation of, and adherence to, a PM 2.5 control plan to reduce emissions.
Specifically, all Reasonably Available Control Technologies and other strategies that could reduce emissions would
have to be implemented. This would mean the imposition of new rules to govern industry, motor vehicles, residential
heating appliances, new development projects, open burning, and other sources of PM 2.5, all at great expense and
inconvenience to the public and to businesses. Additional requirements include emission offsets, conformity analyses
for every transportation project and other federally funded project (in order to demonstrate that the actions would not
make the problem worse), and possibly Transportation Control Measures and other measures.
After an area is designated as non-attainment, if all of the required rules and demonstrations are inadequate or not
implemented quickly enough, federal sanctions kick in. For instance, federal highway money is withheld, emission
offsets for new or modified pollution sources are raised, and ultimately EPA can step in and take over parts of the air
pollution control program.
Finally, if an area is designated non-attainment and progress toward attainment does not proceed rapidly enough, the
area has to “bump up” to a worse non-attainment classification, with even more stringent requirements, and when a
non-attainment area finally reaches attainment, the rules cannot be relaxed.
Therefore, it is crucial that PM 2.5 emissions in the Portola area be reduced immediately, not only for the benefit of
public health but also in order to avoid a federal non-attainment designation.
Consistency with other Elements
The General Plan is the gateway to transforming our communities into more efficient, low-carbon, sustainable, vital
places for us, our families, and our neighbors to live, work, and play. The City of Portola General Plan contains 10
distinct standalone elements (Land Use, Housing, Community Design, Safety, Noise, Economic Development,
Conservation, Circulation, Public Facilities, and Air Quality). However, it is important to remember that each of these
elements weave together to create the comprehensive long-range plan for the City. Many policies already exist within
these other elements which support the City’s future goals of improving air quality within the City, region, and State.

     Land Use Goals
     LU-3     Reinforce strong urban design, quality development, and a compact City form.
     LU-6     Reinforce land use and development patterns that encourage walking and the use of local public transit within
              the community.
     LU-7     Complete in-fill development of the unimproved portions of the City.
     Community Design
     CD-1     Guide development of the community in a manner that will sustain the natural resources and amenities and
              will be economically sustainable over time.
     Safety
     WF-1     Protect against injury, loss of life, and damage to property and the environment due to wildland fire.
     Conservation
     EC-1     Develop a pattern of land uses and circulation that will help conserve scarce or nonrenewable energy
              resources.
     EC-2     Utilize non-traditional energy sources such as co-generation, wind and solar to reduce dependence on
              traditional energy sources.
     EC-3     Promote energy efficiency in new development and in building design.
     Circulation
     C-2      Extend the circulation network, including streets, bike and pedestrian paths, and transit routes to in-fill areas
              and new growth areas in a manner that is energy and cost efficient, safe, and minimizes impact on the natural
              environment.
     C-4      Expand transportation alternatives within the City, including public transit, walking and bicycling.
     Public Facilities
     PF-4     Public improvements and facilities will be designed to enhance, rather than degrade, the natural environment
              in the city and surrounding area.
10.3 AIR QUALITY GOALS
     New visitors, businesses and residents in the community will contribute to conditions that could ultimately result in
     nonattainment of federal or state air quality goals. Once air quality monitors record violations of the state or federal
     standard, an area is designated by either California or U.S. EPA as nonattainment for that pollutant.
     Federal nonattainment designation requires air pollution control strategies to be implemented, targeting the air pollution
     sources that cause the greatest degradation of air quality to clean the air and stop exceedances of the standard. Being in
     nonattainment of an ambient air quality standard means higher rates of respiratory ailments and related health care
     costs, higher rates of premature deaths, and may require the implementation of control strategies to reduce the
     emissions of the pollutant. Being designated as a federal nonattainment area is generally more economically
     burdensome to an area than being designated nonattainment due to violations of a California State Air Quality Standard
     (CAAQS).
     Because air pollution is typically a regional problem, the city must undertake feasible policy and implementation plans
     to minimize the existing air pollution events and avoid increased air pollution that would accompany economic and
population increases. These policies and implementation cover a wide range of common daily activities, such as
burning slash outdoors and wood stoves, as well as transportation and land use planning that have a strong, but indirect,
effect on air pollution.
Goal AQ-1.         Improve Portola’s air quality by:
                     a.  Achieving and maintaining ambient air quality standards established by the U.S. Environmental
                         Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board;
                     b.  Minimizing public exposure to toxic or hazardous air pollutants; and
                     c.  Minimizing public exposure to pollutants that create a public nuisance, such as unpleasant
                         odors.
Goal AQ-2.         Integrate air quality planning with land use and transportation planning processes.
Goal AQ-3.         Although the automobile is the primary form of transportation, the City of Portola should make a
                   commitment to other modes of transportation.
Goal AQ-4.         Reduce air emissions through energy conservation.
