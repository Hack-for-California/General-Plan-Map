a.   The TransecT: concepTual organizing sysTem
This General plan is a physically-based plan. The primary
importance of this distinction is that this plan’s vision and pol-
icies are based upon tangible physical outcomes at the scale of
the town and individual buildings.
To apply this physically-based approach to Tehachapi, the
Transect system is utilized [1]. The Transect is a system of
rural-to-urban	transects	or	‘human	habitats’.		Each	transect	in	
this	General	Plan	is	equivalent	to	a	General	Plan	designation	
but with more information. This system provides a simple but
powerful framework to allow a community to describe with
precision, a broad but continuous range of environments for
human habitation and activity.

Corridors
Corridors are linear areas that traverse several neighborhoods or
districts and connect the various places within town. Instead of
being relegated to the areas known as the ‘backs’ of houses along
busy roads, corridors, as they are intended, play an important role
in buffering neighborhoods from traffic. This is most commonly
done by fronting the street with buildings and uses that benefit the
neighborhood but are not necessarily compatible with being inside
the neighborhood. In this way, corridors provide a positive transi-
tion from the more quiet and slower-paced neighborhood and the
busier street that connects several places within town. Recognizing
the role of corridors also minimizes the need to expand the town to
find the land to accommodate such uses and activities.

and corridors. Each neighborhood or its fragment is identified by a
pedestrian shed within which a mixture of uses and amenities could
be well connected to one another for the enjoyment of residents and
visitors. Similarly, Tehachapi’s districts and corridors are identified.

1.1 the strategy
a. estaBlishing the visiOn
1.   process and Background
To establish the vision expressed in this General Plan, in 2006 and
2007 the community completed a public involvement and visioning
process aimed at two primary purposes. To identify a vision of how
Tehachapi could grow while maintaining its uniqueness and appeal-
ing small mountain town character, and to understand and identify
the preferred physical and social outcomes associated with that
vision. This plan then physically organizes the vision’s constituent
elements to comprehensively and cohesively generate Tehachapi
one building or one action at a time over the near and long term.
Intrinsic to this work is the need to correspond the intended physical
character with the appropriate physical capacity. For this reason, this
plan identifies buildout in an integral way that reflects the range of
intended physical outcomes.
While the vision is for the long-term, this town plan recognizes the
need to address a tangible planning horizon. The horizon of 2035
is established as it provides for a clear 30 year time frame to begin
implementation of this long-term vision. With a long-term vision
established for Tehachapi, incremental progress toward subsequent
planning horizons is fully informed. How much of the long-term
vision is realized by 2035 and in later years will depend on the rate
of economic and physical growth - which cannot be projected or con-
trolled with precision.
Leading up to the last update in 1999, the community had been
experiencing very modest rates of growth, such that change was
small and gradual and went largely unnoticed. That trend dramati-
cally changed in the following decade with 17% growth adding                         This page and bottom page:

cess.
While the results of this building boom were well received in terms
of new investment, they were increasingly seen as a concern to the
small town way of life that attracted many to town in the first place.
Community concern was expressed primarily in terms of new proj-
ects being incompatible with Tehachapi’s small town physical char-
acter, with some related concerns about traffic, water usage, and the
environment as well.
In response to this growing concern, in October of 2006, the
Tehachapi Council adopted urgency ordinance 06-030-682, suspend-
ing further processing of residential subdivisions. This pause was
intended to allow time for review of the 1999 General Plan, zoning
ordinance and related regulations and identify the root causes of the
undesired results and potential solutions.

2.    interim Community design program (iCdp)
In November of 2006, Tehachapi extended the urgency ordinance for
one year and hired HDR Town Planning to:
a)    evaluate the existing regulations to determine which provisions
      were contributing to the types of development that Tehachapi
      was consistently receiving;
b) work with the community to identify a physical vision for its
      future urban design; and
c)    prepare a summary document to guide decision-making until
      Tehachapi could make the necessary regulatory and/or adminis-
      trative adjustments.
 • evaluation of existing regulations: The work of HDR Town Plan-
   ning resulted in finding that a number of policies contributing
   to some of the community’s concerns were present in the 1999
   General Plan. While the General Plan satisfied State Law and
   contained numerous policies aimed at protecting and promot-
   ing Tehachapi’s small town character, such policies were in some
   cases not supported by the necessary regulations to implement
   the general intentions.
 • Community design Charrette: With the above preliminary evalua-
   tion and the community’s consistent feedback about not wanting
   to become just another suburb of Palmdale/Lancaster or Bakers-
   field, the Tehachapi City Council sponsored a 5-day, Community
   Design Charrette during the week of February 13-17, 2007. This
   week-long interactive design exercise provided an opportunity
   for the community to work directly with the City’s consultants to
   distill and synthesize the ideas and feedback from the community
   into a set of diagrams, illustrations and strategies that expressed
   the community’s vision for itself.
 • interim Community design program: Summary Document (ICDP):
   Following the charrette, a concise document that summarized the
   community’s direction for itself was prepared. This document was
   titled the “Interim Community Design Program” or ICDP. The          • Our Community vision: Our community vision is comprehensive

         2 stories with certain areas up to 2.5 stories [1]. Buildings are at or near
         the sidewalk to appropriately define the commercial streetscape. The
         street network is fully interconnected balancing the needs of pedestrians
         with vehicular movement and on-street shared parking. On-street public
         parking provides short-term convenient customer parking and augments
         private parking in the rear of properties. Streetscapes are continuous
         and emphasize hardscape with accents of potted plants and canopy
         trees in tree wells.

         size regionally-oriented retail/services allowing office and/or residen-
         tial above. Along side streets, house-form buildings are appropriate.
         Buildings are near or close to the sidewalk to appropriately define the
         commercial streetscape while accommodating on-site surface parking.
         Parking may be between the sidewalk and buildings, alongside or behind
         buildings. On-street public parking is provided during non-peak times
         along Tucker Road. Streetscapes are continuous and emphasize hard-
         scape with accents of potted plants and canopy trees in tree wells.
         walkability: Wide sidewalks provide comfortable areas for strolling indi-
         vidually or among large groups. Crossing distances for pedestrians are
         improved for the 5-lane size of Tucker Road, with curb radii sized from
         15 to 25 feet and sometimes combined with curb-extensions (bulb-outs).
         sustainability: The large floorplate nature of most buildings combined
         with the largest of surface parking lots in town make permeability and
         runoff a priority to be addressed through landscape and hardscape.          Above: Over time, large format retail may utilize a combination of reconfigured lanes on Tucker Road to pro-

         which includes the Mill Street neighborhood and existing residential
         along Dennison Road.

         physical Character: A variety of walkable blocks comprise an intercon-
         nected network of streets supporting single and 2.5-story block-form build-
         ings near or close to the sidewalk [1]. Along side streets, house-form build-
         ings are appropriate. On-street public parking augments on-site parking
         along the side or in rear of lots. Streetscapes are continuous and emphasize
         hardscape with accents of potted plants and canopy trees in tree wells.
         walkability: Overall, the street network in this area is to become more inter-
         connected, providing much needed alternate routes to Tehachapi Boulevard.
         The interconnected network provides multiple routes along wide sidewalks
         used by employees or nearby residents. Crossing distances for pedestrians
         are short with curb radii appropriately sized from 15 to 25 feet and some-
         times combined with curb-extensions (bulb-outs).
         sustainability: Tehachapi’s Municipal Airport serves to expand this area’s
         market share to include businesses that see Tehachapi as a convenient des-
         tination or mid-point to other destinations. The moderate to large floorplate
         nature of most buildings combined with surface parking lots make permea-
         bility and runoff a priority to be addressed through landscape and hardscape.
         The presence and scale of this employment-generating core offers job-growth
         within town and the region translating into economic, traffic and emission-
         reduction benefits.
         range of activity: Areas identified as special district - light industry, office,
         regional retail, limited residential above ground floor use. For the areas iden-
         tified as T-4, T-4.5, T-5 - residential, retail, residential above ground floor use.
         patterns: Blocks vary but are generally large and of sufficient size to accom-
         modate moderate to large-footprint buildings for employment-generating
         land uses and light industry.

         role in tehachapi: Tehachapi’s regionally unique neighborhoods proxi-
         mate to limited highway-oriented services such as conveniences, lodging,
         regional retail, retail, medical and office uses with a panoramic view of
         town and the Tehachapi Valley.

         physical Character: Block-form buildings in a highway service district off of
         Dennison Road that leads to rural neighborhoods in an interconnected net-
         work of regular and irregularly shaped, walkable blocks that respond to the
         area’s topography and the long views of the Valley. Rural estates transition
         from nature to the north to rural neighborhoods punctuated by natural open
         space and greens. Streetscapes are continuous emphasizing landscape with
         canopy trees in wide tree lanes.
         walkability: Continuous sidewalks provide comfortable area for strolling
         and viewing the valley and adjacent nature. Crossing distances are short
         with curb radii appropriately sized from 15 to 20 feet, sometimes combined
         with curb-extensions (bulb-outs).
         sustainability: The low intensity of these neighborhoods combined with
         their proximity to limited services reduces the overall demand to travel
         across SR 58 for every need. The greens, natural corridors and large tree
         lanes address stormwater runoff and groundwater recharge.
         range of activity: Near and along SR 58, limited highway services with resi-
         dential and animal ownership/boarding, equestrian to the north.
         patterns: Blocks are moderately sized in the highway-related district for
         mixed-use commercial buildings and a medical campus. Non-district blocks
         conform to the natural terrain to generate new neighborhoods of unique,
         rural character.

In order for Tehachapi to effectively direct new investment and growth
to the 2035 planning horizon, it is first necessary to physically identify                                                                                                           Planning Area (Ref. Figure Intro.2)

to be preserved from development (O-1: permanent open space) to the                                                                                                                          Pedestrian Shed (1/4 mi raidus, approx. 120 acres)
areas where infill and reinvestment are most needed and desired (G-4:
infill growth). In between these two ends are four other sectors available                                                                                                           G1 Restricted Growth Sector

sheds are then applied within the growth-sectors (G-1 through G-4) to
indicate where development or new investment is to occur as compared
to conservation areas which do not show pedestrian sheds. The Pedes-
trian shed is used as a general way to express that an area is developable
and that walkable neighborhoods are the intention. Districts and corri-
dors occur between and around neighborhoods.
Along with identifying where Tehachapi expects to grow and reinvest, it
is necessary to identify the appropriate development footprint or pattern
per the vision. This is accomplished by assigning parameters to each
sector. Table 2-1 identifies these parameters.
With the sectors assigned and the type of growth or conservation identi-
fied, the appropriate transect designations are identified and applied
to the various areas throughout Tehachapi’s Sphere of Influence. For
example, the appropriate transect designations in an ‘open’ sector do
not include any that allow development that would fit better in town.

   Table 2-3B identifies the range of appropri-
   ate frontage types and their general char-
   acteristics for Tehachapi as a whole. These
   frontage types carry out the community
   vision by responding to the variety of physi-
   cal contexts throughout town.
   The diagram at right illustrates the range
   of frontage types on a continuum from less
   to more intense. Intensity is not focused
   on land use but on physical character.
   Each frontage type, independent of archi-
   tectural style, interacts with and shapes the
   public realm on the basis of an individual
   building.

Statutory Requirements
State of California Law (Government Code Section 65300-65307) requires that a
city’s General Plan include a circulation element that shall:
         “...consist of the general location and extent of existing and proposed
         major thoroughfares, transportation routes, terminals, and other public
         utilities and facilities, all correlated with the land use element of the
         plan.”
The Mobility Element satisfies the above requirement by implementing the
community vision through coordination with all elements, particularly the
Urban Form Element.

                                                                                     5.  Objectives and Policies                           2:59
       “to assure that cities and counties recognize that open space land is a
       limited and valuable resource which must be conserved whenever pos-
       sible.” (CGC Section 65561(a)).
The State identifies numerous types of open space that must be addressed in
the General Plan. The types of open space land are: 1) open space for the pres-
ervation of natural resources such as habitat, 2) open space for the managed
production of resources, 3) open space for outdoor recreation, 4) open space
for public health and safety, 5) open space in support of the mission of military
installations, and 6) open space for the protection of certain places or features
(CGC Section 65560).
This General Plan satisfies the above requirements and elaborates on the rela-
tionship between the various types of open spaces relative to their intended

munity-scale parks in the natural environment offer passive
space as well as opportunities for formal civic gatherings while
being large enough to allow a diverse menu of places and rec-
reation opportunities. The expansive size of this type of open
space makes it an important community-wide resource and
should be accessible to all of Tehachapi. In addition, agricul-
ture can be incorporated into natural open space and is often a
defining aspect of nature.
Greenways
These landscape elements forge linear connections between dis-
tinct neighborhoods and community places connecting nature
to the town and its urban open spaces. The advantages of
greenways are multiple: they offer generous frontages for public
and private buildings; they enable the enjoyment of extended
pedestrian, equestrian and bike paths and circuits; and, they
embrace natural elements such as creeks, rivers and other
naturally occurring linear features. As an example, the Antelope
Run open space corridor will include bikeways, walkways, open
space preservation areas, and small mini-park areas within its
86 acres generating a unique address for the real estate along
its edges. It is the intent of this public realm network to expand
the system of greenways such as Antelope Run to ultimately cre-
ate a looped system of greenways that are easily accessible by
all neighborhoods.
Town: Greens, Plazas, Squares, Playgrounds
These well-distributed and unique spaces are characterized by
greater formality than neighborhood parks and often serve as
primary gathering places. Their block-size-or-smaller configura-
tion is typically intended to accommodate a range of people
from a few to several dozen. As civic places, their designs are
often highly engaged with adjacent buildings. The refined aes-
thetics of these spaces reflect civic intentions and are modest
enough in size to be widely distributed within the plan area.

Nature, Agriculture
The open space in this planning area is primarily
non-urban, consisting of agriculture and nature,
contributing to the town-defining qualities of
Tehachapi’s natural and agricultural surroundings. A
regional park near SR 58 connects with greenways to
the north and along Dennison Road.

Additionally, community preferences, directions, and corresponding objectives
and policies ensure fiscal sustainability of Tehachapi’s Sphere of Influence, such
that its maturity as a place and region is tied to an economic maturity, which
will ensure sufficient resources for a full range of public services and improve-
ments over the near and long-term.
Statutory Requirements
The Economic Vitality Element is not required by State of California Law.
Because of the strong relationship between the economic dimensions of a
small town and its physical form, Tehachapi has included the optional element.
                                                                                                                                        January 2012   Tehachapi, california           2:62

• Tertiary - Further down the scale are the third order central places which
primarily provide daily needs and products that are at a lower cost and
margin. Typical of these uses are gas stations, convenience stores, and
the like. In evaluating Kern County, it is possible to identify this hierar-
chy of central places with Bakersfield being the primary central place and
the secondary central places including communities such as Wasco in
the west of the county, or Ridgecrest in the north.
Tehachapi serves as the secondary place for the southeastern part of
Kern County, and in each case, there are tertiary communities which
are contained within the secondary cities’ markets. For example, But-

along I-395 in Inyo County are served by Ridgecrest. For Tehachapi, the

Tehachapi’s history has been marked by its close connection to its surrounding
environmental features, natural resources and wildlife. Thus, Tehachapi’s con-
tinued legacy hinges upon its enduring conservation of the natural resources it
enjoys, to ensure that these rich amenities are a part of its past, present, and
future.
Statutory Requirement
State of California Law (CGC Section 65302) requires a conservation element to
         “...provide direction regarding the conservation, development, and utili-
         zation of natural resources”.
This General Plan satisfies the above requirement and elaborates on the interre-
lationship between the needs of the built environment and those of Tehachapi’s
natural resources which strongly define the town.

Based on the community vision, the following issues have been identi-
fied as relevant and key to address in the Natural Resources Element:           The following sections contain the objectives and policies to guide
                                                                                Tehachapi in achieving the community vision.
•    Air Quality - Air pollution is a concern as the local atmosphere is
     affected by the weather and substantial growth in the neighboring Cen-
     tral Valley and High Desert regions. While many solutions to air pollu-
     tion require regional approaches, local land use decisions which mini-
     mize dependence on vehicular traffic and pollutant sources are needed
     to maintain clean air;
•    Scenic Quality - Viewsheds of Tehachapi within its natural setting are
     important and intrinsic to Tehachapi’s strong physical character and
     appeal. These viewsheds need to be protected and enhanced. Addi-
     tionally, the subject of viewsheds needs to be expanded from only views
     of the valley to include views within town, and along streetscapes, as
     this is equally important and how most Tehachapians experience their
     community.
•    Viability of Agriculture - The majority of agricultural lands within
     Tehachapi’s Sphere of Influence are currently outside of the incorpo-
     rated boundary and not under complete regulatory control by Tehachapi.
     Strong cooperation with Kern County is needed to maintain these lands
     as economically viable, continuing to provide agricultural products/
     activities, and avoid premature conversion to non-agricultural uses;
•    Wildlife - The presence of various wildlife species within and surround-
     ing Tehachapi’s Sphere of Influence is a desirable qualitative aspect of
     living in or near Tehachapi. Accordingly, this presents the need to pro-
     mote Tehachapi’s sensitivity to wildlife corridors and/or habitat.
•    Mineral Resources - The Tehachapi Valley’s abundant mineral resources
     will continue to be appealing for extraction to supply customers with
     mineral products. While the economic activity is important for the
     Valley and Tehachapi, it is equally important that the extraction and pro-
     cessing of mineral resources occur in the most sensitive and equitable
     manner possible.

A. AIR QUALITY, VIEWS AND DARK SKIES
Air quality is important to Tehachapi’s appeal and sustainability from the
perspectives of health and community appeal. The subject of air quality
is connected to Tehachapi’s high quality views and wonderful night skies.
As the area’s air quality goes, so go the area’s visual qualities. It is the
community’s intent to maintain and improve Tehachapi’s air quality pri-
marily by attracting clean industry and through an interconnected com-
munity that allows people to get around by means other than vehicles.
Tehachapi’s natural landscapes and surrounding mountains generate
dramatic views across the Tehachapi Valley as well as from within town.
These views are a combination of the relatively clear skies and the strong
contrast and silhouette of the mountains that define the Tehachapi Valley.

is a constant reminder of the appeal that is created by these physical
conditions. Tehachapi’s dramatic setting is equally impressive in the
evening. This is large due to the relatively low light pollution from the
town and surrounding unincorporated communities in comparison to
the vast open and natural lands in the Tehachapi Valley. The night silhou-
ette seen in nearby areas is still not seen in Tehachapi which affirms the
area’s dark sky quality environment.

to the areas indicated for growth and those for conservation. These pedes-
trian sheds do not require development to occur but identify where growth
may and may not occur. If growth may occur in an area, those areas have
been prioritized in terms of whether an area is completing the town (infill) or
adding to the town (expansion). The approval of development within those
areas is subject to the applicable design, review and public process require-
ments of the City.                                                                  Old Town

ment pattern has surrounded or become a neighbor to prime farmland
parcels (see Figure 2-8). As mentioned earlier, of the 1,790 total agricultural
(prime, unique) acreage within Tehachapi’s Sphere of Influence, 472 acres
were in production as of 2006 (see Figure 2-8). From the perspective of
maintaining a defined and small town form, several of the prime farmland
parcels fall within the areas prioritized for infill development and some into
expansion areas. Therefore, this General Plan directs growth into areas that
happen to have prime farmland with the understanding that the overarching
objective is to define a clear town edge by removing the speculative issues
from surrounding agriculture.                                                         Mackenzie

C. FLORA AND FAUNA
Although a substantial portion of the planning area has been developed
or is under active agricultural production, portions are vacant or open
space, and still support habitat and communities suitable for native
plant and animal species. These communities are primarily annual
grassland and drainage features, but also include stands of native oak
and grassland communities along the foothills in the northern portion of
the planning area.
Wildlife within the planning area is expected to be tolerant of distur-
bance and human presence, except in the northern foothill portion,
where a moderately diverse fauna may utilize the remaining oak domi-
nated communities that are contiguous with vast expanses of wilderness
in the Sierra Nevada to the north. While largely disturbed, the planning
area retains an open character and some opportunity for movement
between the Tehachapi and Sierra Nevada ranges is likely to remain for
medium and large-bodied mammal species tolerant of human develop-
ment. Agricultural areas, and a pond associated with a water treatment
plant provide foraging opportunities for a suite of migratory and colonial
bird species.
Native amphibian populations are likely to be relatively diminished

C. Role of the Arts in Building Community Identity and Pride
The arts have long been instrumental in supporting tourism, fostering a
sense of belonging, and preserving collective memory in a community.
To this end, the arts can build community identity and pride in the fol-
lowing ways:
1.   The arts provide opportunities for people to engage socially and
     strengthen social bonds. Diverse communities are brought together
     through the arts, providing opportunities for residents to reflect on their
     shared and individual experiences.
2.   Communities without a lengthy history do not appear as strongly
     based as those communities that do have a history upon which to
     draw. Images and buildings live beyond the lifespan of the individu-
     als who created them, thereby leaving a legacy for the next generation.
     Tehachapi has an active historical society that is a highly valuable insti-
     tution that should be supported to the extent practical.

D. Historic Preservation: Knowing the past as a means of better know-
     ing our current community
Retaining the “small mountain town” character of Tehachapi is as much
about sustaining and nurturing the history, traditions, institutions, recre-
ational opportunities, arts and industries of the community as it is about                                                                            Right:

4.   Preservation as a “green” building practice.

      T1 - The Natural Zone
      The Natural Zone is intended to preserve Tehachapi’s natural
      beauty, and by doing so maintain and enhance the small
      mountain town character cherished by most residents. The
      T1 zone permanently protects natural open space areas from
      development, with the exception of roads and recreational trails.
      Areas currently within the City limits that should be protected
      include the Antelope Run creek corridor and the hillsides north
      of SR-58. It is suggested that adjacent areas within the county
      would experience similar protection.
                                                                         T1: A trail provides pedestrian access to the otherwise

 1.  Update Tehachapi’s zoning map to reflect and be consistent with Figure 2-3 of this General Plan;
 2.  Prepare a Railroad Corridor Master Plan to identify the details about how transportation, transit, buildings, landscaping and land use activity interact and positively shape the corridor
 3.  Bicycle Master Plan. Complete and implement the Bicycle Route Master Plan, including open space and multi-purpose trails connecting all areas of the community. Coordinate with the Califor-
                                                                                                                                                                                                          CE
     nia Department of Transportation and utilize the Transportation Planning Grant Program to fund implementation.
 4.  Housing GIS Database/Code Enforcement. Conduct a 100 percent housing condition survey utilizing a geographic information system database. Prioritize code enforcement activity based on
     these results and address at least ten substandard units per year.
 5.  Secondary Residential Units. Amend Chapter 18.90 (Secondary Residential Units) of the Tehachapi Zoning Ordinance to comply with AB 1866, requiring ministerial consideration of second-unit
     applications in residential zones.
 6.  Density Bonus. Amend Chapter 18.92 (Density Bonuses) of the Tehachapi Zoning Ordinance to comply with changes in the State Density Bonus law (Government Code Section 65915).
 7.  Emergency Shelters. Amend the Tehachapi Zoning Ordinance to comply with SB 2 and permit emergency shelters without a conditional use permit (CUP) or other discretionary permits and
     define transitional and supportive housing as residential uses subject to the same restrictions that apply to other housing.
 8.  Density Consistency. Revise Tehachapi’s zoning code to implement and be consistent with the General Plan Transect Designations.
 9.  User Fee Assistance. Develop a funding mechanism, including fee-deferrals, to reduce fees for approximately 10 very low income and low income housing units per year.
 10. Residential Land Inventory. Prepare land inventory of available, vacant residentially zoned property and publish for easy use.
 11. Housing Constraints for Disabled Persons. Update the Tehachapi Zoning Ordinance to permit group homes of up to 6 persons in all residential zones ‘by right’. Occupancy of group homes
     should include protected categories such as persons with disabilities. Development standards should specify siting requirements for group homes of 7 or more. Clearly stated requirements for
     approval of group homes will improve certainty to the applicant, removing impediments to fair housing choices for elderly, disabled, or other persons with special needs.
 12. Energy-Efficient Incentive Programs. Develop an incentive program to encourage new development to incorporate the following design elements:
     •    Locate and design buildings to maximize natural day lighting and promote use of photovoltaic systems;
     •    Energy-producing technology;
     •    Light-colored “cool roofs”; and
     •    Water-efficient landscapes, efficient irrigation, and potential permeable paving materials.
 13. Energy Rebate Programs. Through coordination with the California Energy Council (CEC or other such groups), create an incentive program for the annual installation of approximately 25 solar
     energy systems on new and existing development.
 14. Within 1 year of adopting the General Plan, create and adopt a climate action plan per the requirements of SB 375, AB 32 and Executive Order S-3-05
 15. Growth Management. Develop procedures for tracking maximum development allowed by this General Plan, as identified in Table 2-2.1.

Each local government in California is required to adopt a comprehensive, long-term General Plan for the physical
development of the city or county. The housing element is one of the seven mandated elements of the General Plan.
Housing element law, first enacted in 1969, mandates that local governments adequately plan to meet the existing
and projected housing needs of all economic segments of the community. The State Legislature has found that “the
availability of housing is of vital statewide importance, and the early attainment of decent housing and a suitable living
environment for every California family is a priority of the highest order.” (Government Code § 65580(a)). California
law recognizes the vital role local governments play in the supply and affordability of housing. The housing element
must establish goals, policies and programs to facilitate and encourage the provision of safe, adequate housing for
its current and future residents of all income levels.                                                                      The State Legislature has found

C hapter 1: I ntroduction
         The Housing Element consists of the following major components, as required by State law:
         R e v i e w th e P rev i ous H ous ing E l eme n t: This Section reviews the results of the goals, policies, and programs
         adopted in the previous Housing Element and analyzes the differences between what was projected and what was
         achieved.
         H o u s i n g N e eds A s s es s ment : This Section includes a community profile of population characteristics, household
         information, housing stock, tenure, and housing affordability. This Section also considers special housing needs of the
         community, such as, seniors, farmworkers, homeless, large households, and female-headed households.
         Pr o j e c te d H ous i ng N eeds : California law requires the Department of Housing and Community Development
         to project statewide housing needs and allocate the need to each region in the State. After consulting with the Kern
         Council of Governments (Kern COG), HCD provided the regional need to the Kern COG. It is Kern COG’s responsibility
         to allocate the projected needs to the unincorporated County of Kern and to each of the 11 incorporated cities within
         the Kern COG region. This section documents the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA).
         L a n d In v e nt ory : This Section compiles relevant information on the zoning, acreage, density ranges, availability of
         services and infrastructure, and dwelling unit capacity of sites that are suitable for residential development.
         Go v e r n m e nt al and N ongov ernm enta l Co n stra in ts: This Section identifies and analyzes impediments to
         the development of housing for all income levels.
         Pr o g r a m o f A c t ions : This Section outlines housing programs that meet local housing goals, quantify objectives,
         and fulfill HCD requirements. Quantified objectives for new construction, rehabilitation, and conserved units by income
         category (i.e. very low, low, moderate, and above moderate) are included to make sure that both the existing and the
         projected housing needs are met, consistent with the City’s share of the RHNA.

Opportunities for residents to provide input on housing issues and objectives are critical to the development of appropriate
and effective housing programs. To ensure participation from all segments of the community, the City sought input through a
variety of methods.
A workshop was held on May 11, 2015, during a normal session of the Planning Commission, to discuss the housing element
process, address changes to State housing element law, and create an opportunity for community dialogue. The agenda for
the workshop was posted on the City’s website and on the community board outside of City Hall.
The workshop began with a presentation by the City’s Consultant, Lisa Wise Consulting, Inc. The presentation included
highlights from the implementation of the previous Housing Element programs, Senate Bill 375 (SB375) and why the City
must update the Housing Element again so soon, an overview of the City’s Regional Housing Needs Allocation and vacant
land inventory, and outline of next steps. No community members were present at the meeting. The Planning Commissioners
asked questions and made comments throughout the presentation. Topics of discussion included:
       •	 Overview of what a Housing Element is, and is required to cover
       •	 Additional information about SB375 and how it impacts Housing Element timing
       •	 How the vacant land inventory relates to the RHNA
       •	 That the vacant land inventory is based on City’s exiting zoning and density, and does not propose any re-zone/
           upzone
       •	 The City is not required to construct or fund construction of RHNA
       •	 Additional information about HOME and CDBG funds
On August 1, 2015 the Public Review Draft Housing Element was submitted to the State Department of Housing and
Community Development (HCD) and made available for public review and comment. The City made available a copy in print
at the Community Development Department. Additionally, seeking additional input and feedback, the City posted the Public
Review Draft Housing Element on the City’s website and the public library, and e-mailed stakeholders, regional agencies, and
local non-profit groups notifying them of the availability of the Housing Element and additional opportunities to participate.
Groups contacted included, but are not limited to, Kern Housing Authority, Kern Regional Center, Kern County Homeless
Collaborative, Tehachapi Chamber of Commerce, Tehachapi Economic Development Council, Salvation Army, Tehachapi
Senior Center, and the Community Action Partnership of Kern (CAPK). Comments received during the public review period
included [to be completed].

On November 9 2015, the City presented the Public Review Draft Housing Element at a Planning Commission hearing for public review and comment. The Planning
Commission recommended City Council adopt the Draft Housing Element. Comments and questions from the Planning Commission and public included:
       •	 What is the relationship between the Vacant Land Inventory Map and the Zoning Map?
       •	 How does the Housing Element affect commercial property or public infrastructure improvements?
       •	 The RHNA does not set any maximum limits on housing development by income category.
On December 7 2015, the City Council adopted the Public Review Draft Housing Element. Comments and questions from the City Council and public included:
       •	 How many people participated in the May 2015 public workshop? City should consider new outreach methods, including social media.
The agendas for the Planning Commission and City Council hearings were posted 20 days in advance of the hearing online and in front of City Hall. No written public
comments were received.
General Plan Consistency
The Housing Element is one of seven mandatory elements of the General Plan, which was updated by the City of Tehachapi in 2012. For the General Plan to provide
effective guidance on land use issues, the goals, policies and programs of each element must be internally consistent. This Housing Element builds upon the existing
General Plan and is consistent with its policies. Consistency between the Housing Element and the General Plan will continue to be evaluated as the update process
unfolds. Whenever an element of the General Plan is amended, the City will consider the impacts of the amendment on the other elements to ensure consistency is
maintained.

ELEMENT
Implementation of the 2006 Housing Element was successful with the accomplishment of 12 of the 25 programs.
The City constructed or approved 384 units, greatly exceeding the housing allocation for moderate income housing.
However, the City did not meet the housing allocation for very-low, low, and above moderate income housing. (See

Known for its rural atmosphere, the City of Tehachapi is located at the southern terminus of the Sierra Nevada
mountain range in the Tehachapi Range, west of the Mojave Desert and east of the Central Valley. The City is in close
proximity to Bakersfield, the Palmdale/Lancaster area, and in commuting distance to Los Angeles (100 miles).
Tehachapi has a continental climate. Unlike coastal southern California, the Tehachapi area exhibits a noticeable
change in seasonal conditions due to its location within the Tehachapi Range. Average annual rainfall is ten inches,
with the highest rainfall between November and April.
Tehachapi grew with the rail line owned by the Western Development Company, a subsidiary of the Southern
Pacific Railway (currently Union Pacific). Incorporated in 1909, the community expanded through the subdivision of
surrounding ranches. The City’s population grew to about 11,000 by the end of the century, then population increased
by approximately 31 percent between 2000 and 2010. Population figures from the United States Census state that
Tehachapi had a population of 14,414 in 2010. It should be noted that this figure includes both City population and
Prison/inmate population. Currently the City resident’s is 8,906 individuals excluding CCI. The largest communities
surrounding Tehachapi are Bear Valley Springs, Stallion Springs, and Golden Hills.

         Median Gross Rent
         Table 3-12 identifies the median owner-value and median gross rent (not adjusted for inflation) for Tehachapi,
         Bakersfield, and Kern County. Median owner value is the amount property owners’ estimated their property would sell
         for at the time of the census. While the numbers have fluctuated, rents in the City tend to be lower than the County
         and Bakersfield. As of 2010, median owner values in the City are considerably lower than the County or Bakersfield,
         with owner values $29,000 less than the County and $57,000 less than Bakersfield.

According to HCD, there is one assisted affordable housing development in the City of Tehachapi, The Tehachapi Senior
Manor. The Tehachapi Senior Manor was originally constructed and financed through a combination of Low Income Housing
Tax Credits (LIHTC), USDA Rural Development Section 515 Rural Rental Housing Program, and USDA Rural Development
Rental Assistance program. The original tax credits, issued in 1989 ,were set to expire in 2014 and the property was conisdered
at risk. In 2003, the property was granted additional LIHTC tax credits and was renovated. The LIHTC program provides tax
credits to developers who reserve a minimum percent of new units for low income tenants. The property received a nine
percent tax credit allocation in 2003 for $278,989 with a 10 year value of $2,789,890. The property was placed in service in
2004. 69 of 71 units at Tehachapi Senior I And Shafter Senior Manor are low income and subject to the tax credit program.
The property is required to remain affordable for 30 years from time placed in service and is not at risk of converting to market
rate during this planning period.

According to Section 4512 of the Welfare and Institutions Code a “developmental disability” is defined as a disability
that originates before an individual attains age 18 years, continues, or can be expected to continue, indefinitely, and
constitutes a substantial disability for that individual and includes mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and
autism. This term also includes disabling conditions found to be closely related to mental retardation or to require
treatment similar to that required for individuals with mental retardation, but does not include other handicapping
conditions that are solely physical in nature. The U.S. Census does not collect data on developmentally disabled
persons.
Many developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently within a conventional housing environment;
however, more severely disabled individuals require a group living environment where supervision is provided, and
the most severely affected individuals may require an institutional environment where medical attention and physical
therapy are provided.
The State Department of Developmental Services (DDS) currently provides services and support to approximately
267,843 California children and adults, approximately 30,538 of which are infants at risk for developmental delay or
disability. Service is provided through a system of State operated development centers and community facilities as
well as private contracts with over 21 non-profit regional centers throughout the State. Kern Regional Center (KRC) is
the Kern County development services center. Their most recent Performance Report Summary indicates that 7,800
people were served by this center in 2014. Table 3-17 shows that a total of 191 of those residents resided in Tehachapi
postal codes. The majority of Tehachapi residents served by the KRC were between the ages of 0 and 14 years.

         There are a number of housing types appropriate for people living with a development disability: rent subsidized
         homes, licensed and unlicensed single-family homes, inclusionary housing, Section 8 vouchers, special programs
         for home purchase, HUD housing, and SB 962 homes. SB 962 homes, Adult Residential Facilities for Persons with
         Special Health Care Needs, are licensed and regulated by DDS and the Department of Social Services (DSS)
         and can accommodate four to five individuals with significant developmental disabilities in a community setting.
         The design of housing-accessibility modifications, the proximity to services and transit, and the availability of group
         living opportunities represent some of the types of considerations that are important in serving this need group.
         Incorporating ‘barrier-free’ design in all new multifamily housing (as required by State and federal Fair Housing laws)
         is especially important to provide the widest range of choices for disabled residents. Special consideration should also
         be given to the affordability of housing, as people with disabilities may be living on a fixed income.
         In order to address the housing needs for persons with Developmental Disabilities, the City will monitor availability
         of land for residential use including special needs housing, analyze governmental constraints to the provision of
         affordable housing for disabled and developmentally disabled residents, assist in the funding of special needs housing
         rehabilitation, and work to mitigate any constraints on the adequate supply of housing for developmentally disabled
         residents.

        This Section describes opportunities for conserving energy in existing homes, as well as in new residential construction. It
        discusses the factors affecting energy use, conservation programs available in Tehachapi, and examples of effective programs
        available in the region.
        Planning to maximize energy efficiency and the incorporation of energy conservation and green building features, can
        contribute to reduced housing costs for homeowners and renters. Energy efficient design produces more resilient communities
        and reduces dependence on automobiles. Additionally, maximizing energy efficiency renders a reduction in greenhouse gas
        emissions contributing to global climate change. In response to recent legislation on global climate change, local governments
        are now required to implement measures that cut greenhouse gas emissions attributable to land use decisions (see discussion
        on Global Climate Change below). The Housing Element programs can support energy efficiency that benefits both the
        market and the changing climate by:
        • Establishing a more compact urban core, bringing residents close to work and services, therefore reducing automobile trip
        numbers and trip lengths and reducing emissions that add to global climate change.
        • Encouraging passive solar construction techniques that require solar orientation, thermal massing, and other energy efficient
        design techniques.
        • Encouraging the use of solar water and space heating.
        Executive Order S-E-05 set into action the first steps in establishing greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in California.
        This was followed by the California Global Warming Solutions Act (AB 32), which required the California Air Resource Board
        (CARB) to establish reduction measures. Implementation of the global warming legislation became part of the responsibilities
        of individual jurisdictions with the San Bernardino County Settlement Agreement, which effects discretionary land use
        decisions and government operations. The City supports energy conservation in new and existing housing through several
        policies, programs, and standards. The City applies State residential building standards that establish energy performance
        criteria for new residential buildings (Title 24 of the California Administrative Code). The City also encourages land use policies
        and development standards that reduce energy consumption, such as promoting more compact, walkable neighborhoods,
        with housing close to transit, jobs, community facilities and shopping; infill development; planning and zoning for multi-use and
        higher density development; mixed use; cluster development; and promoting passive and active solar design elements and
        systems in new and rehabilitated housing. Several energy conservation programs are listed below.

         Southern California Edison (SCE) provides a variety of energy conservation services for residents and participates in several
         other energy assistance programs for lower income households, which help qualified homeowners and renters conserve
         energy and control electricity costs. These programs include:
         C a l i fo r n i a A lt ernat e R at es f or E ne rg y (CARE) Pro g ra m
         This program provides a monthly discount of 20 percent or more on electric bills to income-qualified households and certain
         non-profit group living facilities; including group living facilities, homeless shelters, hospices, and women’s shelters.
         F a m i l y E l ec t ric R at e A s s is t anc e (F ERA) Pro g ra m
         For families of three or more who do not meet the income requirements for the CARE Program, SCE offers discounted
         rates on electricity bills for qualified families who exceed baseline electricity usage by more than 30 percent. The income
         requirements for the FERA Program are less strict than CARE.
         En e r g y As s i s t anc e Fund (E A F)
         EAF helps customers who meet income guidelines, many of whom are seniors, disabled, or are facing financial hardships.
         The fund is an important part of our customer outreach efforts — especially in today’s challenging economic environment —
         providing critical support to our customers who are having difficulty paying their electric bills. A maximum of $100 is available
         to qualified customers once in a 12-month period.
         Se l f- Ge n e rat ion I nc ent i v e P rogram (SGIP) -
         For residents who want to generate their own power, the SGIP could be a good option. SGIP offers rebates to residential,
         commercial, industrial, government, and non-profit customers who install qualifying types of distributed generation to meet all
         or a portion of their own energy needs.
         En e r g y S a v i ngs A s s i s t anc e P rogram
         This program helps income-qualified households conserve energy and reduce their electricity costs. SCE pays all the costs of
         purchasing and installing energy-efficient appliances and equipment, which are free to eligible customers
         En e r g y U pgrade C al i f ornia
         Through Energy Upgrade California, incentives of up to $4,500 based on percent energy consumption reduction are available
         to SCE and SoCalGas residential customers with detached single-family homes (including all-electric) who complete qualifying
         energy-saving home upgrade projects. The program provides free consultation for interested homeowners.

         Energy Consumption
         Residential water heating and space heating/cooling are major sources of energy consumption. With the application of energy efficient design and the
         use of solar power systems, these sources can be operated on a much more efficient and sustainable level.
         By encouraging solar energy technology for residential heating/cooling in both retrofits and new construction the City can play a major role in energy
         conservation. The best method to encourage use of these solar systems for heating and cooling is to not restrict their use in the zoning and building
         ordinances and to require subdivision layouts that facilitate passive solar access.
         Residential water heating can be made more energy efficient through the application of solar water heating technologies. Solar water heating uses the
         sun to heat water, which is then stored for later use, connecting the water heater to gas or electricity is needed only as a back up. By cutting the amount
         of energy needed to heat water by 50-75 percent per building, solar water heating systems can lower energy bills and reduce global warming pollution.
         The City has the opportunity to implement solar technologies with the help of State legislation. The Solar Water Heating and Efficiency Act of 2007 (AB
         1470) creates a $250 million ten-year program to provide consumer rebates for solar water heating systems.
         G l o b a l C l i m at e C h a n g e
         The accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere regulates the earth’s temperature and is known as the “greenhouse effect”. Without
         these natural gases, the Earth’s surface would be approximately 60 degrees Fahrenheit cooler. Emissions from human activities such as electricity
         production and automobiles have elevated the concentration of these gases in the atmosphere. This is referred to global warming or global climate
         change. Examples of greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and hydrofluorocarbons. The increased consumption of fossil
         fuels (wood, coal, gasoline, etc.) has substantially increased atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases. New housing development may contribute to
         greenhouse gas emissions, but careful site planning and design, and the selection of environmentally friendly building materials and equipment can
         significantly reduce these emission levels.
         There are significant areas where the City can do more to encourage energy conservation in new and existing residential development to reduce the
         demand on energy production. A variety of energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emission reduction strategies are available that can be integrated into
         land use decisions. Table 3-22 lists strategies developed by the California Environmental Protection Agency’s Climate Action Team to address energy
         conservation and global climate change.
         Through these and other conservation measures the City can help minimize the percentage of household income that must be dedicated to energy
         costs as well as minimize the production of greenhouse gases that contribute to global climate change. Several programs have been included to
         incorporate newly adopted state energy efficiency standards and to encourage alternative energy efficient technologies.

State Housing Element law (Government Code § 65580 et. seq.) requires regional councils of government to identify
for each city and county its "fair share allocation" of the Regional Housing Needs Determination (RHND) provided
by the California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD). The Kern Council of Governments
(Kern COG), the COG for the Tehachapi area, adopted the Regional Housing Needs Allocation Plan for this planning
period in September 2014. Kern COG took into account several factors in preparing the RHNP, including projected
households, job growth, and regional income distribution. In turn, each city and county must address their local share
of regional housing needs in their housing elements.

          The Regional Housing Needs Allocation for Tehachapi is shown in Table 4-2 The City has a total allocation of 495
          units for the January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2023, planning period. This number can be reduced by planning
          permits pulled since January 2013. Taking these permits into account, Tehachapi has 483 of the allocated units
          remaining - most of which are in the above moderate and very-low income categories.

         Tehachapi is not responsible for the actual construction of these units. Tehachapi is, however, responsible for creating a
         regulatory environment in which the private market could build unit types included in their State housing allocation. This includes
         the creation, adoption, and implementation of General Plan policies, zoning standards, and/or economic incentives to encourage
         the construction of various types of units.

Vacant Land Inventory
State law governing the preparation of housing elements emphasizes the importance of an adequate land supply by requiring
that each housing element “. . . identify adequate sites . . . to facilitate and encourage the development of a variety of types
of housing for all income levels . . .” (Government Code Section 65583(c)(1)). If an adequate supply of new housing is to be
provided, enough vacant land must be zoned to allow for the construction of a variety of housing at densities that will satisfy
the objectives of the Housing Element. The land must also have access to appropriate public services, such as water, sewage
treatment, storm drainage, and roads.
As Table 5-1 indicates, there are 452 vacant parcels zoned for residential development that have the capacity to accommodate
a realistic development level of 4,092 units if built at 70 percent of allowable densities. The anticipated 70 percent buildout is
based on historical trends and the assumption that a certain portion of the land is not be suitable or desirable for development.
There may be political barriers to full development, as well. The development potential far exceeds the units required to meet
the regional housing need of 483 remaining housing allocation for the current planning period (see Table 4-2).
In order to assess the land available for very low, low, and moderate-income housing, parcels greater than one acre in the high
density residential zones which allow densities of 20 units per acre or higher were separately analyzed. These zones include
Transect zones (T-4 and T-4.5), which allow densities up to 35 units per acre or 50 units per acre, respectively, depending on
building type. Transect zones and density will be described in more detail in Chapter 6. Sites greater than one acre in these
zones are presumed to be more likely to accommodate very low and low income housing development. Table 5-2 shows
the realistic capacity of these parcels. These sites can reasonably accommodate the development of 3,164 units total at a
conservative 20 dwelling units per acre. This number greatly surpasses the 191 remaining very low and low-income housing
units required by the current State housing allocation as listed in Table 4-2 and Table 2-1 respectively.

         The City recognizes that the State requires land zoned at a minimum of 20 units per acre to meet the very low and low income housing
         allocation. The City has adequate vacant land and housing opportunities within the T-4 District, which has a maximum allowable density of 35
         units per acre, to accommodate the remaining 191 units in these categories. As shown in Table 5-1 and Table 5-2, a realistic capacity for T-4
         zone is 3,164 units assuming the parcels are only built to 70 percent capacity and at a conservative density of 20 units per acre.

         Table 5-2 shows the residential capacity of high density sites with a minimum lot size of one acre. This indicates that while there are 10 parcels zoned T-4.5,
         there are no parcels greater than one acre and here is one parcel zoned R-3 but it does not meet the minimum density requirements, and therefore the T-4.5
         and R-3 parcels are not assumed to accommodate very-low and low-income housing.

         and addresses density and residential zones. With the new Zoning Ordnance,sites located within transect zones allow densities of 20 units per acre or more,
         depending on building type and zone. For more information see Chapter 6, Constraints.

In addition, the Tehachapi Zoning Ordinance permits second units on parcels greater than 8,000 square feet in the R-1 zoning districts
with ministerial approval. There are a total 365 vacant parcels in the R-1 zoning district that meet the minimum lot requirement and
would be able to accommodate second units. However, no applications has been filed and approved since 2006. In the City of
Tehachapi the development of second units may not have a significant contribution to the housing stock.

The City of Tehachapi Public Works Department provides potable water and waste water treatment and collection services for
residential, commercial, and industrial customers. The proximity, availability, and capacity of infrastructure help to determine the
suitability of residential land for development. This section evaluates the water and sewer capacity available to accommodate
the housing needs during the planning period.
On April 16, 2012 the City Council of the City of Tehachapi approved a comprehensive update of the General Plan (Tehachapi
General Plan Update 2035). In conjunction with the General Plan update adoption, the City Council also certified a programmatic
Environmental Impact Report (EIR). The EIR evaluated a wide range of issues associated with the build out of the General Plan
including water and sewer capacity.
Water
With respect to water capacity and availability, the City of Tehachapi (City) draws its water from the underlying Tehachapi basin
which was adjudicated in 1970 and the adjudicated in 1973 establishing a physical solution to address the over drafting of the
basin. In conjunction with the adjudication process the safe yield of the basin was determined to be 5,500 acre feet per year.
The Tehachapi Cummings County Water District (TCCWD) was established as the Water Master over the adjudicated basin.
In addition to ground water pumped from City wells within the City’s pumping allocation, the City can also purchase water from
TCCWD to supplement the City’s domestic water demand. The TCCWD water is non potable State Water Project (SWP) water.
As such, the water purchased from TCCWD is not placed directly into the City’s water distribution system. Rather the water
purchased from TCCWD is recharged into the Tehachapi Basin and the City is in turn permitted to pump additional water from
the basin in an amount commensurate with the amount of SWP water recharged into the basin by TCCWD. The year 2035
supply/demand comparison (acre feet) prepared in conjunction with the General Plan Update EIR concluded that there would
be a total supply potential of 4,032 acre feet per year in comparison to the 2035 demand of 2,567 acre feet per year. Based
upon the General Plan 2035 build out analysis, there is adequate water supply to support the anticipated growth in the City.
Sewer Capacity
The General Plan EIR incorporated a 2035 General Plan buildout analysis which concluded that the at build out the associated
effluent would be 2.5 million of gallons per day (MGD). Currently the sewer treatment plan is operating at 60 percent capacity with
a total capacity of 1.25 mgd and a potential capacity of 2.5 mgd. Therefore there should be adequate capacity to accommodate
the anticipated growth within the Housing Element Planning period. Long term the sewer treatment plant was designed to
double its capacity and the connection/mitigation fee protocol associated with the development process will provide a revenue
source to enable the sewer treatment plant capacity to keep pace with growth they anticipated.

This chapter covers local governmental, non-governmental, and environmental constraints.
L o c a l G o v e r n m e n ta l C o n s t r a i n t s
Local policies and regulations can affect the quantity and type of residential development. Since governmental actions can
constrain the development and the affordability of housing, State law requires the housing element to "address and, where
appropriate and legally possible, remove governmental constraints to the maintenance, improvement, and development of
housing" (Government Code § 65583(c)(3)).
The City’s primary policies and regulations that affect residential development and housing affordability include: the Zoning
Ordinance, the General Plan, development processing procedures and fees, on and off-site improvement requirements,
and the California Building and Housing Codes. In addition to a review of these policies and regulations, an analysis of
governmental constraints on housing production for persons with disabilities is included in this Section.
Land Use Controls
The City’s land use controls generally do not constrain the development of multi-family rental housing, manufactured housing,
mobile homes, housing for agricultural employees, transitional or supportive housing, single-family units, or emergency
shelters.
The following sections provide information on local land use regulations.

Development standards can constrain new residential development when the standards make it economically unfeasible
to develop a particular lot, or there are no suitable parcels which meet the development criteria for building form, massing,
height, and density in a particular zone. Table 6-4 provides development standards for the non-transect residential districts
and Table 6-5 provides the development standards by transect zone.
The 2014 Zoning Ordinance update included the addition of seven transect zones, ranging from the rural edge (least intense)
to Downtown (most intense) as well as one special zone district for the Tehachapi Blvd West area. The standards in these
zones are intended to ensure that proposed development is compatible with existing and future development on neighboring
properties, and produces an environment of desirable character, consistent with the General Plan and any applicable specific
plan.
The Transect Zones include:
•	 T-2 Rural Edge
•	 T-2.5 Rural General
•	 T-3 Neighborhood Edge
•	 T-4 Neighborhood General
•	 T-4.5 Neighborhood Center
•	 T-5 Downtown
•	 SD 2.1 Tehachapi Blvd West
The current development standards do not impede the City’s ability to achieve maximum allowable densities. In fact, with
the 2014 adoption of the new Zoning Ordinance, the City has added increased flexibility in achieving greater densities and
allowing a greater variety of residential building types in more zones. (See Table 6-1 and Table 6-2)

        Building and Frontage Standards
        Applicable only to the transect zones, the Zoning Ordinance establishes building and frontage standards to implement
        the General Plan vision for each area. Building and frontage standards provide a variety of options for applicants and
        help increase the certainty of the entitlement process for developers and of the development outcome for residents
        and stakeholders. By reducing uncertainty and providing clear standards and diagrams, the building and frontage
        standards may streamline development and act as an incentive for new investment. Building and frontage standards
        do not impede residential development or increase the cost of development.
        Building standards are intended to generate new buildings or the revitalization and/or modification of existing buildings
        to successfully implement the Tehachapi General Plan. Building standards provide a list of 12 approved building types,
        and identifies the allowed height (by zone) and which building types are allowed in each transect zone depending
        on the intent of the zone; whether residential, mixed-use, or commercial. Any use is allowed in any of the approved
        building types, so long as the building and use are allowed in the transect zone. The applicant may chose from any
        of the approved building types for the particular zone. In transect zones there are no required setbacks. Instead, the
        building placement in relationship to the street is determined by the type of building selected. This approach allows
        flexibility in design while ensuring all projects in a given location have similar buildings and setbacks.
        Frontage standards are intended to provide standards for how buildings individually shape the streetscape, including
        the framing of views of the surrounding hillsides and mountains. Frontage standards provide a list of approved frontages
        which correspond to 1) a particular transect zone and 2) a particular building type to create a built environment
        consistent with the community vision for the area. In transect zones there are no required front setbacks. Instead, the
        building placement in relationship to the street is determined by the type of frontage selected.
        Table 6-6 shows the allowed building and frontage types, by transect zone.
        Landscaping Standards
        To ensure all new or redeveloped properties are aesthetically pleasing and compatible with surrounding development,
        all projects must adhere to the landscaping standards outlined in Chapter 4.40 (Landscape Standards). This chapter
        addresses Landscape and Irrigation Plans, General Standards, Parking Area Landscaping, Irrigation requirements,
        Maintenance, Fences and Screening, Lighting, and Lien. All new projects must comply with the standards of Chapter
        4.40. Minor additions to existing development and/or changes in use within an existing development may include
        conditions of approval requiring compliance with standards of Chapter 4.40.

        Under the City’s zoning regulations mobile home parks and subdivisions are permitted by right in the mobile home
        park zones (MHP). Mobile homes, mobile home parks, trailer parks, travel trailer parks and recreation vehicle parks,
        where allowed, shall conform to the to Title 25 of the California Administrative Code, the residential development
        standards in Chapter 3.30 (Non-Transect Zones), and the additional provisions of Section 4.60.030 (Applicable to
        Non-Transect Zones - Mobile Home Parks and Subdivisions).
        The City is in compliance with State law and no constraints to the development of mobile homes and manufactured
        housing have been identified.
        E m e r g e n c y S he lt e r s     and   Transitional Housing
        In compliance with Chapter 633 of Statutes 2007 (SB 2), jurisdictions are required to consider and treat transitional
        and supportive housing as residential use subject only to those restrictions that apply to other residential dwellings
        of the same type in the same zone. SB 2 also requires every locality to identify a zone, zones, or a specific site or
        sites where emergency shelters are allowed as a permitted use by right without a conditional use permit or other
Page 66                                                                                                          City of Tehachapi 2015 -2023 Housing Element

discretionary review. The City completed Program 5-4 of the previous housing element to comply with SB-2. The 2014 Zoning
Ordinance includes a definition for transitional and supportive housing and emergency shelters. Emergency shelters are allowed
by right in the E, R-1, R-2, R-3, and MHP zones subject to the standards in Section 6.30.030 (Applicable to Non-Transect Zones -
Emergency Shelters). Standards for Emergency Shelters are consistent with SB2, and include:
       •	 Off-street parking based upon demonstrated need
       •	 The provision of on-site management and security
       •	 The proximity to other emergency shelters, not more than 300 feet apart.
       •	 The length of stay.
       •	 Lighting.
Transitional and Supportive housing is allowed by right in all residential zones, and with a minor use permit in the T-4, T4.5, T-5,
and SD2.1 zones. The City understands in order to comply with SB-2, transitional and supportive housing must be allowed as a
residential use subject to the same permit requirements of other residential units of the same type in the same zone. As such, the
City proposes program 5.3 to make minor Zoning Ordinance clean-ups to allow transitional and supportive housing in the A, R-P,
T2, T2.5, and T-3 zones and clarify permitting procedures for the T-4, T-4.5, T-5, and SD2.1 zones.
Density Bonus Program
To achieve density increases the City implements the State’s density bonus program (Government Code 65915) through Zoning
Ordinance Chapter 4.30, updated in 2014. The requirements of Chapter 4.30 allow for a density increase of up to 35 percent over
the maximum allowable residential density under the Zoning Code and General Plan.
Two recent legislative actions, SB 1818 and AB 2280 amended the State density bonus program. SB 1818 became effective in
January 2005. Under SB 1818, applicants are eligible for a range of density bonuses up to 35 percent, based on the percentage of
affordable units in a development. Applicants are also eligible for an innovative new land donation density bonus, which allows for
land donations within ¼ mile of a project if the applicant demonstrates to the City that building the requisite number of affordable
units on-site is infeasible and there is an identified source of funding for the very low income units. Jurisdictions are required to offer
at least one to three incentives (reductions in parking, for example), based on the percentage of affordable units in a development.
SB 1818 also limits parking requirements that may be imposed by the Zoning Code’s parking standards.
AB 2280 became effective in September 2008. The bill instituted various changes to the density bonus law, most notably amending
the timing for density bonus requests, clarifying density bonus requirements for senior housing, and instituting a 10 percent across
the board increase in the percentage of affordable units that must be included in a project to qualify for incentives.
With the implementation of Program 5.3 from the previous housing element, the City’s zoning requirements are consistent with SB
1818 and AB 2280.

         Development Permit Processing, Procedures,                                    and   F ee s
         Government policies and ordinances regulating development affect the availability and cost of new housing. Although land
         use controls have the greatest direct impact, development approval procedures and fees can affect housing costs as well.
         Permit processing requirements have increased at all levels of government in recent years. The City of Tehachapi has a
         number of procedures developers are required to follow. Although the permit approval process must conform to the Permit
         Streamlining Act (Government Code § 65920 et. Seq.), housing proposed in Tehachapi is subject to one or more of the
         following discretionary review processes: environmental review, zoning, precise development plan review, subdivision review,
         architectural design review, and building permit approval.
         As required by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), the City's permit processing procedures include an
         assessment of the potential environmental impacts of proposed projects. If a project requires an environmental impact report,
         additional processing and time is required. Many of the environmental regulations have protected the public from significant
         environmental degradation and the location of certain developments on inappropriate sites and have given the public an
         opportunity to comment on project impacts. This process does, however, increases the time and cost of project approval and
         may decrease the buildout of a parcel.
         Planning Permit Procedures
         Procedures for processing permits vary based on the permits involved. Generally, the following procedures are common to
         the permitting process:
         a)	      Pre-application meeting with staff
         b)	      Filing of application and fees

       2. The proposed use is consistent with the purpose of the applicable zone or zones.
       3. The proposed use is listed as a use subject to a CUP or MUP in the applicable Zone or Zones or a use determined to
       be similar to a listed use in accordance with the procedures set out in Section 1.10.030 (Rules of Interpretation).
       4. The proposed use meets the minimum requirements of this Zoning Code applicable to the use and complies with all
       other applicable laws, ordinances, and regulations of the city and the state of California.

        Notes
        1. A residential project of any type that includes a zone change and/or general plan amendment may take an additional month to process due to the added complexity. However, the subdivision zone
        change and general plan amendment would be processed concurrently and as such the processing time frame is not significantly greater than a stand alone proposal needing no zone change and/or
        general plan amendment. The majority of residential type projects such as subdivisions, PRD’s apartment complexes, etc., that comply with the general plan will only require a Negative Declaration
        not an EIR.
        2. A typical Negative Declaration takes 1 to 3 months to process including agency circulation. However, depending upon the need for additional or special studies such as an archeological survey, traffic
        study soil analysis, etc., the process could take an additional month in order for the applicant to produce the study.
        3. Architectural Design and Site Plan Review could go to the City Council upon project appeal. With regard to Tentative Tract’s, unless a Tract is a PUD the applicants are not obliged to provide floor
        plans and elevations at the application stage. Floor plans and elevations are required at the building permit stage.

Tehachapi requires the installation of certain on-site and off-site improvements to ensure the safety and livability of its residential
neighborhoods. On-site improvements are regulated by the Subdivision Ordinance and through conditions and standards
established during the Site Plan Review Process. On-site improvements typically include required off-street parking, curbs,
and utilities, as well as amenities such as landscaping, fencing, streetlights, and park facilities. Off-site improvements typically
include the following (some of which are regulated by other agencies):
A) STREET IMPROVEMENTS:
Including construction of sections of roadway, medians, bridges, sidewalks, bicycle lanes, and lighting.
B) DRAINAGE IMPROVEMENTS:
Including improvement to sections of channel, culverts, swales, and pond areas.
C) WASTEWATER COLLECTION AND TREATMENT
D) WATER SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS:
Including lines, storage tanks, and treatment plants
E) PUBLIC FACILITIES FOR FIRE (KERN COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT), SCHOOL (TEHACHAPI UNIFIED SCHOOL
DISTRICT), AND RECREATION (TEHACHAPI VALLEY RECREATION AND PARKS DISTRICT).
Generally, the developer passes on-site and off-site improvement costs to the homebuyer as part of the final cost of the home.
To reduce housing costs, the City attempts to require only those improvements that are deemed necessary to maintain public
health, safety, and welfare.

         Parking
         Table 6-12 lists applicable parking space requirements for residential developments. Unless otherwise stated, guest parking
         is not required.
         Parking requirements may be reduced under the City’s joint use option. If more than one use occupies the same building,
         the Planning Commission can reduce the number of spaces required by up to 20 percent if it can be determined that the
         combination of uses will not necessitate the number of parking spaces that would be required if the uses were developed
         independently. Parking requirements are being evaluated as part of the Zoning Ordinance update.

         Building        and    Housing Codes
         Some building and housing regulations are mandated by State law to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the community or
         to protect existing residents from financial or environmental impacts. Tehachapi enforces the 2013 Uniform Building Code (all
         future amendments are automatically incorporated without further action), as established by State law, which sets standards
         for residential and other structures. No local amendments have been made to the codes that would significantly increase
         housing costs. Building code violations are enforced on a per complaint basis.

         Non        g o v e r n m e n ta l     Constraints
         The availability and cost of housing is strongly influenced by market factors over which local governments have little or no
         control. Nonetheless, State law requires that the Housing Element contain a general assessment of these constraints.
         This assessment can serve as the basis for actions to offset the effects of such constraints. The primary non-governmental
         constraints to the development of new housing in Tehachapi are land costs, construction costs, and environmental constraints.
         Land Costs
         Costs associated with the acquisition of land include both the market price of raw land and the cost of holding the property
         throughout the development process. These costs can account for over half of the final sales prices of new homes in very
         small developments and in areas where land is scarce. Among the variables affecting the cost of land are its location,
         amenities, the availability and proximity of public services, and financing arrangements. According to information provided by
         the City, in 2015 an acre of vacant, unimproved land suitable for single-family development in Tehachapi range from $20,000
         and $40,000 per acre. This estimate depends on a variety of factors including location, lot shape and size, topography, utilities,
         and accessibility. However, there are very few vacant lots available for sale within the City limits. The majority of lots available
         are in the unincorporated areas of the County near Tehachapi. The limited supply of developable land near the City’s center
         is likely to increase the cost of land, which is then passed on to the homebuyer.
         Construction Costs
         Construction costs vary widely depending on the type, size, and amenities of the development. The City estimates that
         construction costs average at about $70 to $100/square foot. This cost has decreased significantly since 2008, when the City
         estimated roughly $127 to 140/square foot. This estimate does not include land costs, financing, permits/fees, developer profit
         or marketing costs, and assumes typical lot arrangement with few site limitations such as steep slopes. Multi-family housing
         construction costs can widely vary depending on the density and intensity of the development, arrangement of the housing
         units on the property and the size of the units. Larger, multiple story town-home may have greater costs than smaller units in
         a multiple story high rise apartment complex.

E n v i r o n m e n ta l C o n s t r a i n t s
The following potential physical and environmental constraints may affect development regulated by the City of Tehachapi by limiting the development
potential and/or adding mitigation costs to a project:
E n v i r o n m e n ta l C o n s t r a i n t s  1
A) Two sensitive plant communities are known to occur in Tehachapi: Valley Oak Woodland and Riparian and Stream habitat. In addition, activities
such as oak tree removal are regulated by the City and could add additional barriers to development.
B) Special status species with the potential to occur based on habitat and behavioral patterns are the Swainson’s hawk, black-shouldered kite, ring-
tailed cat, golden eagle, southern rubber boa, southern spotted owl, Tehachapi pocket mouse, Tehachapi slender salamander, badger, California black
legless lizard, Cooper’s hawk and six other bird species. Barriers to wildlife movement and migration and the removal of raptor nesting sites are to be
avoided in future development. The occurrence of any of these species on a site could pose constraints to a housing project.
Physical Constraints
A) Parcels with steep slopes may have constraints associated with landslide hazards and some sites may have soil types with high erosion potential.
B) Sites in Tehachapi are subject to impacts from uncontrolled runoff from seasonal storms that result in erosion, sedimentation and water damage.
C) Stationary noise sources near potential sites for development may pose constraints. For example, the railroad tracks that run through the City
exceed acceptable noise levels.
D) Housing may be limited within 500 feet of State Route 58 under CEQA, due to the health hazards of siting sensitive uses near urban roads with over
100,000 vehicles per day.
E) A major portion of the City lies in areas subject to 100-year flood depths less than one foot, areas between the 100- and 500- year flood zones, and
areas of 100-year shallow flooding (See Figure 6-1). Historically, the City has had several flood incidents and associated economic loss. Although
these flood zones represent a potential constraint to development, the adoption of the Tehachapi Watershed Plan has implemented several structural
measures to alleviate flooding (two dams with diversion inlets, channel enlargements; and wildlife habitat development). Figure 6-1 identifies the FEMA
flood plain - constituting 100 and 500 year flood zones.

         State law requires that the Housing Element contain a “statement of the community's goals, quantified objectives, and policies
         relative to the maintenance, improvement, and development of housing.” This section describes the proposed goals, policies,
         implementation programs, and objectives of the Housing Element for the City of Tehachapi.
         The Goal is a general purpose statement, and indicates the direction the City will take with respect to the housing problems
         identified. Policies are statements of the City’s position regarding the various housing issues identified, and provide a link
         between the goal and the programs. Programs are steps to be taken to implement the policies. Some of the programs contain
         quantified objectives, which refer to the number of units that are expected to be constructed, conserved or rehabilitated
         through a specific program during the time frame of the Housing Element. The quantified objectives represent measurable
         outcomes, which can be used to evaluate the success of the Housing Element in the future.
         This Housing Element includes several policies, programs, and institutional changes intended to significantly increase
         the amount of affordable housing and rehabilitation for housing in Tehachapi. These efforts will be initiated throughout the
         planning period beginning December 31, 2015 and ending December 31, 2023. This Housing Element Update will also
         address programmatic needs that could not be addressed during the previous planning period. The City will annually evaluate
         the progress and effectiveness of these efforts in accordance with State law. Together, these initiatives reflect a commitment
