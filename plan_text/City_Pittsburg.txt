2 LAND USE
This element outlines the framework embodied by the City’s land use approach,
describes the General Plan land use classification system, projects buildout of
various land uses through 2020, and provides both city-wide and sub-area specific
policies to guide land use decisions.
Pittsburg’s land use pattern is reflective of its history as an industrial center of
Contra Costa County. The City’s Downtown and industrial center are near water
and rail transportation corridors – the Sacramento River and the Burlington
Northern & Santa Fe and Southern Pacific railroads. As the City grew southward,
auto-oriented residential subdivisions became dominant, and regional streets and
highways such as State Route 4 became major transportation routes.
With limited availability of vacant land within City limits, major land use
challenges include Downtown revitalization, infill development, fostering land
use/transportation linkages, and appropriate hillside development.

               2.1        BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
               LAND USE PATTERN
               Much of Pittsburg’s land use pattern can be traced to its industrial heritage. Both
               the historic Downtown and adjacent industrial waterfront evolved along the shores
               of the Sacramento River, which was a shipping route for goods. The Southern
               Pacific Railroad is the dividing line between the gridiron street network of older
               portions of the City and the larger-scale industrial parks, commercial centers, and
               newer residential developments. The relatively small-scale Downtown gives way
               to larger, predominately single-use areas as one moves south through the City.
               Figure 2-1 illustrates the City’s existing land use distribution, as of 1999.
               Residential and commercial developments throughout the City are characteristic
               of the period in which they initially developed. Smaller-scale neighborhoods in
               older sections of Downtown contrast with new residential subdivisions that have
               spread into the hills. Locally-owned stores coexist with larger retailers throughout
               the length of Railroad Avenue, the City’s main north-south artery. The advantages
               of visibility and vehicular accessibility are now encouraging large-scale
               commercial development in eastern Pittsburg along State Route 4.
               Magnitude of Uses
               The Pittsburg Planning Area comprises a total of 26,960 gross acres (42 square
               miles). Of this area, approximately 7,700 acres (12 square miles) lie within City
               limits (28 percent of the Planning Area). The community of Bay Point, the area
               West of Bay Point, and other vacant and unincorporated areas of the northwest
               planning area lie within the Sphere of Influence and encompass approximately
               10,900 gross acres (17 square miles). Wetlands and Suisun Bay/ Sacramento River
               environs account for 6,760 additional acres. Table 2-1 shows the land area
               distribution within the Planning Area.

                                                    Residential and industrial uses are dominant in the developed portions of the
                                                    Planning Area. As Chart 2-1 shows, residential uses comprised 32 percent of the
                                                    City’s land area in 1998. Approximately 12 percent of the City was occupied by
                                                    industrial uses, primarily in the northeastern parts of Pittsburg. Commercial uses,
                                                    encompassing five percent of the City’s land area, were located principally along
                                                    major transportation corridors such as Railroad Avenue and State Route 4. A total
                                                    of 60 percent of the Planning Area (16,300 acres) consists of open spaces areas,
                                                    including City parks, Suisun Bay wetlands, and vacant land within the

                                                    With over a century of development, residential neighborhoods in Pittsburg
                                                    represent a wide range of development patterns, ranging from traditional
                                                    neighborhoods with a gridiron block pattern, such as Central Addition, to the

emerging commuter neighborhoods at the City’s fringe. The more recently
developed neighborhoods, especially at the City’s southern fringe, are typified by
suburban-style residential development – large expanses of residential
subdivisions with little or no other uses, with a layout dominated by cul-de-sacs
and few through-streets, and often built within peripheral walls. Because grocery
stores and other commercial uses are limited to Railroad Avenue and East Leland
Road, Pittsburg’s emerging residential neighborhoods are located at increasing
distances from basic shopping facilities.
A wide range of housing types—single-family homes, multifamily units, and
mobile homes—are present in the City. With 17,770 housing units on 2,450 net
acres, the average residential density in Pittsburg in 2000 stands at 7.2 housing
units per net acre. Low Density Residential uses, occupying 2,080 acres, comprise
about 85 percent of the land area devoted to residential uses in the City. Higher
density residential sites are scattered throughout the City; those south of State    Most city neighborhoods are suburban-style like those

in size.
Commercial Development
In addition to Downtown, commercial uses are concentrated along the City’s
major transportation corridors: Railroad Avenue, Leland Road, Loveridge Road,
and State Route 4.
• Downtown Commercial. Once the center of commerce in Pittsburg and Contra
     Costa County, commercial activity in Downtown has decreased in the last
     several decades. Although retail sales along Railroad Avenue and State Route
     4 have captured a larger market with retail chain and value-oriented centers,
     such as WalMart and Home Depot, the Downtown continues to feature
     specialty retail and service uses.
• Community Commercial. Many of Pittsburg’s community shopping centers are
     located along Railroad Avenue, south of State Route 4. Few neighborhoods in
     the City are within a five- to ten-minute walk (1/4 mile-1/2 mile) of a major
     grocery store.
• Regional Commercial. Larger-scale warehouse and big-box retail centers are
                                                                                                                                              2-5

                                                                intermixed with other commercial businesses or serve as buffers between busy

                                                            Industrial Development
                                                            Pittsburg is known for its steel, petroleum, and chemical industries. Originally
                                                            located along New York Slough to facilitate shipping, industrial uses continue to
                                                            dominate the waterfront. Major manufacturing operations such as USS-Posco and
                                                            the Dow Chemical plant are located along the eastern waterfront, while the Mirant
 Ultramar Inc., a petroleum refining company located at     (formerly PG&E) power plant, a visual landmark, dominates the western
 Harbor Street and East Third Street, is one of Pittsburg’s waterfront. Physical and visual buffering between industrial facilities and
 many industries.                                           residential neighborhoods continues to be a major issue.
                                                            TRANSIT-ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT (TOD)
                                                            The concept of transit-oriented development (TOD) is based on the assumption
                                                            that small, dense urban districts near transit platforms will result in greater transit
                                                            ridership. The City’s Downtown maintains the potential for TODs, as bus routes
                                                            are expanded and concentrated within Downtown neighborhoods. The City’s
                                                            BART station also presents tremendous opportunity for TODs, because of the
                                                            BART system’s connectivity to employment and housing centers throughout the
                                                            region.

Pittsburg/Bay Point BART Station Specific Plan
The Pittsburg/Bay Point BART Station opened in fall of 1996, becoming the
eastern terminus of BART’s Concord line. Shortly thereafter, the Pittsburg/Bay
Point BART Station Area Specific Plan was written to facilitate continued orderly
growth of the station area, stimulate revitalization activities in the unincorporated
Bay Point community, and capitalize on special opportunities presented by the
presence of a BART Station. The Specific Plan Area consisted of approximately
295 acres of land that are adjacent to the Station or along major access routes to
the Station. Major components emphasized in the Specific Plan included Land
Use, Circulation, Urban Design, and Implementation. Development proposals will
be reviewed based on the merits of their plans to meet the broad goals of
providing housing, office, and commercial activities.
The policies throughout the Specific Plan facilitate creation of a high intensity
mixed use area in the immediate vicinity of the BART Station, with the intention
of serving residents as well as BART commuters. Land Use policies focus on new
development ideas as well as redevelopment and revitalization of existing land
uses in order to take advantage of the Station Area’s unique transportation
opportunities and advantages, and to ensure a high quality environment for
residents. Circulation policies balance local and regional circulation needs, while
prioritizing local needs in terms of traffic circulation, access to transit, and
pedestrian and bicycle circulation. In particular, such policies encourage greater
accessibility to transit and non-automotive travel. The Urban Design Element of
the Specific Plan focuses on establishing a cluster of mixed-use neighborhoods
around the BART Station, and linking these and nearby neighborhoods in order to
establish a sense of cohesion and identity. This section of the Specific Plan
consists of a series of concepts (such as a Transit Plaza, a Linear Park, and a
Neighborhood Commercial District) that will achieve various urban design and
other Specific Plan objectives.
The City and BART have also proposed an extension of the current rail line to
Railroad Avenue. Should this proposal move forward, the City will have the
opportunity to develop a specific plan for the Railroad Avenue BART station area,
with a dense mix of compatible land uses and transit-oriented design regulations.
                                                                                               2-7

               GROWTH AND ANNEXATION
               Since the 1988 General Plan was adopted, Pittsburg has witnessed six major
               expansions of its City boundaries, totaling approximately 2,780 acres:
               • Northeast River subarea. In 1990, 1,170 acres were annexed for industrial
                   development;
               • West Central subarea. In 1991, 190 acres were annexed for construction of a
                   mobile home park;
               • Buchanan subarea. In 1997, 160 acres of Highlands Ranch were annexed for
                   residential development;
               • Southwest Hills subarea. In 1990, 1,030 acres were annexed for the San
                   Marco project. In 1992, 130 acres were annexed along the western municipal
                   boundary. Then in 1996, 100 acres were annexed south of Oak Hills.
               As part of the 1996 Contra Costa County General Plan, the County delineated an
               Urban Limit Line (ULL) to identify areas appropriate for urban expansion and
               preserve open space in the southern hills. However, the County ULL does not
               reflect topographic or environmental constraints. Recently (year 2000) the County
               amended its ULL, removing several hundred acres of the southern hills from
               planned urban growth areas. This General Plan seeks to define appropriate limits
               for urban growth based on land use considerations and environmental and
               topographic constraints.

Major Development Projects, 2000
The City has a substantial inventory of residential projects with development
approvals, as well as several planned commercial and industrial complexes. The
two largest residential projects—San Marco and Alves Ranch (Vista del Mar)—
are both located in the Southwest Hills subarea. A total of 4,000 housing units are
in the pipeline. Business and Community Commercial districts are also planned
for the southwestern portion of the City along State Route 4, within the proposed
San Marco and Alves Ranch projects. Two major industrial projects are located
along the industrial waterfront area – Los Medanos Energy Center and Delta
Energy Center.
PLANS AND PROGRAMS OF ADJACENT JURISDICTIONS
Pittsburg lies adjacent to the Planning Area boundaries of three nearby cities in
Contra Costa County: Concord, Antioch, and Clayton. Several long-range
planning policies in Concord and Antioch may have an effect on Pittsburg. In
Concord, plans for conversion of the Naval Weapons Station to civilian uses may
directly impact Pittsburg because of the facility’s size and proximity to Pittsburg.
However, the Weapons Station Restricted Federal Easement, an area surrounding
weapons bunkers with the potential for critical damage, overlaps a small portion
of the Pittsburg Planning Area. This easement in the southern hills prohibits
construction of all development, including infrastructure and roadways. In
addition, potential business park and regional commercial development in eastern
Concord may affect Pittsburg, by saturating the commercial development market
and increasing the amount of traffic on State Route 4.
Bay Point, a community in Pittsburg’s SOI, has expressed a desire to incorporate.
In light of this, land uses in this General Plan either reflect existing uses for the
area or are consistent with the adopted County General Plan. The incorporation of
Bay Point would likely have little effect on Pittsburg, as there are no major
shopping or employment centers within the small, unincorporated community.

               2.2        GENERAL PLAN DIAGRAM AND USEASSIFICATIONS
               GENERAL PLAN LAND USE FRAMEWORK
               General Plan Diagram
               The land use framework of the General Plan is embodied in the General Plan
               Diagram (Figure 2-2), which is a graphic representation of the themes and policies
               in the Plan. A calculated distribution of land use acreages, according to the
               General Plan Diagram, is shown in Table 2-2. The General Plan Diagram
               designates the proposed general location, distribution, and extent of land uses
               through buildout, which is expected by about 2020. As required by State law, land
               use classifications, shown as color/graphic patterns, letter designations, or labels
               on the Diagram, specify a range for housing density and building intensity for
               each type of designated land use. These density/intensity standards allow
               circulation and public facility needs to be determined; they also reflect the
               environmental carrying-capacity limitations established by other elements of the
               General Plan.
               The Diagram is to be used and interpreted only in conjunction with the text and
               other figures contained in the General Plan. The legend of the General Plan
               Diagram abbreviates the land use classifications described below, which represent
               an adopted part of the General Plan. The General Plan Diagram is not necessarily
               parcel-specific, and uses on sites less than one acre in size are generally not
               depicted on the Diagram. The interpretation of consistency with the General Plan
               on sites less than one acre in size will be done through the Zoning Ordinance and
               the Zoning Map.
               Magnitude of Uses
               The Pittsburg Planning Area comprises a total of 26,960 gross acres (42 square
               miles). Approximately 20,028 acres (33 square miles) of this will be located
               within the City or southern hills. More than half of this will remain in Open Space
               and Parks. Table 2-3 shows the General Plan land area distribution for the entire
               Planning Area (including Bay Point and other land). For land distribution by sub
               area, see Table 2-7.

Land Use Framework Guiding Principles
The General Plan Diagram embodies several ideas and principles. These include:
• Compact urban form. All growth, with the exception of the Bay Point
   unincorporated community and a small amount of clustered low-density
   residential hillside development, is contiguous to existing City limits.
• Promotion of Downtown as a focus of activity. Plan policies seek to increase
   Downtown population, as well as non-residential activity, to enhance vitality
   and provide a market for commercial uses. Policies that promote development
   standards that build on Downtown’s traditional urban pattern are identified.
• Modulated development intensities that reflect accessibility. Development
   intensities are modulated to reflect accessibility to transit and services. The
   General Plan designates highest intensities in Downtown and around the
   Pittsburg/Bay Point BART Station, and lowest intensities in the constrained
   hillside areas.
• Promotion of infill development. In order to minimize encroachment into the
   hillsides, reverse and prevent blight, promote economic development, and
   efficiently provide services, the Plan encourages use and revitalization of
   vacant and underutilized sites. These include areas in and around Downtown
   (West Tenth Street and Harbor Street), around Railroad Avenue and East
   Leland Road, the Pittsburg/Bay Point BART station, and complementary and
   viable uses on vacant sites in existing neighborhoods.
• Increased connectivity between and within neighborhoods. Major arterial
   streets are designated to result in increased connectivity between
   neighborhoods in different subareas. In addition, policies for locating local
   streets are included to ensure neighborhood-level connections while providing
   flexibility to project developers.
• Designation of mixed-use and pedestrian-oriented activity centers. New
   neighborhood centers are envisioned in the form of mixed-use pedestrian-
   oriented centers. Designated centers include the area surrounding the West
   Leland Road/San Marco Boulevard intersection. In addition, mixed-use or
   multi-use development is encouraged surrounding the proposed location of
   Railroad Avenue BART Station, between East Leland Road and State Route 4.
                                                                                          2-13

PITTSBURG 2020
               • Increased diversity in housing types. The General Plan seeks to expand the
                   range of housing types currently available in Pittsburg through designation of
                   sites for low-density hillside development, as well as higher-density residential
                   development in selected locations. This allows for a diverse range of housing
                   opportunities for residents of different social/economic sectors. Plan policies
                   also provide for increased flexibility in single-family development by
                   encouraging small-lot (Downtown and arterial corridors) or executive-style
                   and custom/estate (Southern Hills) housing design.
               • Protection of ridgelines and creeks, and expansion of the trail and park
                   network. The General Plan identifies major and minor ridgelines, and
                   establishes development guidelines to protect them. Additionally, the Plan
                   identifies a network of open space along creeks in new growth areas that will
                   be realized over time. These open space areas will also facilitate development
                   of a network of bikeways and pedestrian trails.
               • Flexibility and mixed-use areas. To provide flexibility and encourage mixed-
                   use development, the use and intensity regulations provide variable
                   development standards and incentives for mixed-use development in locations
                   such as Downtown and neighborhood centers.
               DENSITY/INTENSITY STANDARDS
               The General Plan establishes density/intensity standards for each use
               classification. Residential density is expressed as housing units per gross acre.
               Gross acreage includes all identified areas within the specific land use designation,
               including public and/or private streets and other rights-of-way or easements. Gross
               acreage is measured to the centerline of any abutting peripheral street (not
               including State Route 4).
               Maximum permitted ratio of gross floor area to site area, called Floor Area Ratio
               (FAR), is specified for non-residential uses. FAR is a broad measure of building
               bulk that controls both visual prominence and traffic generation. It can be clearly
               translated to a limit on building bulk in the Zoning Ordinance and is independent
               of the type of use occupying the building.

                                                                                     2: LAND USE
Density (housing units per gross acre) and intensity (FAR) standards are for gross
developable land (that is, including streets and other rights-of-way), but excluding
areas subject to physical or environmental constraints, which include ridgelines
and steep hillside slopes, creek corridors and floodways, and areas dedicated for
greenways or habitat protection.
Maximum Density/Intensity Not Automatic
The density/intensity standards do not imply that development projects will be
approved only at the maximum density or intensity specified for each use. Zoning
regulations consistent with General Plan policies and/or site conditions may
reduce development potential within the stated ranges. Examples of conditions
that may limit attainment of the maximum densities/intensities include, but are not
limited to:
• Development standards established in the Zoning Ordinance (such as for
    heights and setbacks, or minimum habitable space) may limit building size;
• The Zoning Ordinance and Zoning Map may break down a single General
    Plan land use classification into two or more districts with intermediate
    maximums; and
• The       Zoning Ordinance may establish intermediate maximum
    densities/intensities, with attainment of the General Plan maximum subject to
    specific performance, design, or other criteria.
• Site constraints due to environmental hazards, infrastructure limitations,
    and/or compatibility with neighborhood land uses may place limitations on the
    size and/or density of projects.
                                                                                            2-15

PITTSBURG 2020
               Additionally, density bonuses provided to development projects for provision of
               public facilities, infrastructure, or services beyond that which is required may al-
               low development in excess of stated General Plan densities and FARs. Gross den-
               sity standards and assumed averages for residential categories are listed in Table
               2-4. Design standards specified in the Urban Design Element and/or the Zoning
               Ordinance should also be consulted in addition to the density/intensity standards
               in this element.
               LAND USE CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM
               The classifications in this section are meant to be broad enough to give the City
               flexibility in implementing policy, but clear enough to provide sufficient direction
               to carry out the General Plan. The City’s Zoning Ordinance contains more detailed
               provisions and standards to implement these classifications. More than one zoning
               district may be consistent with a single General Plan land use classification.
               For residential uses, densities are stated as the number of housing units per gross
               acre of developable land. Development would be required within the density range
               (both maximum and minimum) stipulated in the classification. For non-residential
               and mixed uses, floor area ratios (FARs) area specified.
               Residential
               Seven residential land use classifications—including three for Downtown— are
               established to provide for development of a full range of housing types (mixed-use
               classifications that permit residential uses are included later in this section).
               Second units (accessory dwellings) permitted by local regulation and a 25 percent
               density bonuses for provision of affordable housing are in addition to densities
               otherwise permitted. An additional 25 percent bonus is available for projects
               located within one-quarter mile of a BART station.
               Assumed average densities listed are used to calculate probable housing unit and
               population holding capacity. Neither the averages nor the totals constitute General
               Plan policy. Population densities corresponding to the housing unit densities can
               be obtained by multiplying each housing unit by 3.1, the average projected

Pittsburg household size in 2020, according to the Association of Bay Area
Governments’ (ABAG) Projections ‘02.
Hillside Low Density. Single-family (attached or detached) residential
development in the southern hills built at a density of less than 5 units per gross
acre. Maximum densities should be allowed only in flatter, natural slope areas or
non-environmentally sensitive level areas. An open, natural character is
encouraged by clustering homes and minimizing cut-and-fill of natural hillsides.
The average density assumed for General Plan buildout calculations in this
classification is 3 units per gross acre.
Low Density. Single-family residential units built at a density of 1 to 7 units per
gross acre. Typical lots would be 6,000 square feet; the Zoning Ordinance may
permit lots smaller than 6,000 square feet, if the proposed development meets
specified community design standards in specific neighborhoods, such as
Downtown, to promote compact development. This classification is mainly
intended for detached single-family dwellings, but attached single-family units in
selected or all areas may be permitted, provided that each unit has ground-floor
living area, and private or common outdoor open space. The average density
assumed for General Plan buildout calculations is 6 units per gross acre.           Pittsburg has a diverse housing stock. A view of Suisun Bay is
                                                                                    shown here from the Oak Hills Park development.
Medium Density. Housing at densities from 7 to 14 units per gross acre. Dwelling
types may include one or two story garden apartments, townhouses, and attached
or detached single-family residences. The Zoning Ordinance may permit zero lot-
line or small-lot detached residential units in some or all areas. The average
density assumed for General Plan buildout calculations is 12 units per gross acre.
High Density. Residential development at densities ranging from 14 to 25 units
per gross acre. Subject to design review by the Planning Commission, additional
discretionary density increases, up to a maximum project density of 40 units per
gross acre, may be granted to projects that fulfill community objectives. A wide
range of housing types, from single-family attached units to multi-family
complexes are permitted. The average density assumed for General Plan buildout
calculations is 20 units per gross acre.
Downtown Low Density. Housing densities from 4 to 12 units per gross acre.
                                                                                                                                             2-17

PITTSBURG 2020
               Dwelling types may include attached or detached single-family housing and
               townhouses. The average density assumed for General Plan calculations is 8 units
               per gross acre.
               Downtown Medium Density. Residential development at densities ranging from
               12 to 18 units per gross acre. Dwelling types may include attached or detached
               single family townhouses, garden apartments, and other forms of multi-family
               housing. The average density assumed for General Plan buildout calculations is 16
               units per gross acre.
               Downtown High Density. Residential development at densities ranging from 18 to
               30 units per gross acre. New high-density projects within Downtown should have
               transit-oriented amenities (such as covered bus stops at project entrance, where
               appropriate) and reduced parking requirements to encourage use of alternative
               modes of transportation. The average density assumed for General Plan buildout
               calculations is 24 units per gross acre. Subject to design review by the Planning
               Commission, additional discretionary density increases, up to a maximum project
               density of 40 units per gross acre, may be granted to projects that fulfill
               community objectives.
               Mixed Use
               This mixed use land use designation is established to allow for greater flexibility
               of land uses around and accessible by transit.
               Pittsburg/Bay Point BART Station Area. Encompasses approximately 54 acres
               located west of the Oak Hills Shopping Center, including the Pittsburg/Bay Point
               BART Station parking lot. Residential densities up to 65 units per gross acre, or
               as approved by the Pittsburg/Bay Point BART Station Specific Plan, are allowed
               on these properties. Maximum FAR for non-residential development is 1.0, or as
               approved by the Specific Plan.
               Railroad Avenue Specific Plan. Encompasses approximately 97 acres located
               within a roughly one-half mile radius surrounding the Railroad Avenue/State
               Route 4 intersection. Residential densities between 15 and 65 dwelling units per
               acre are permitted and nonresidential FAR between 0.25 and 1.0 is permitted.

Downtown. Encompasses approximately 20 acres located in and near the
Downtown. Residential densities between 12 and 30 units per acre are allowed on
these properties. For properties located along West Tenth Street, maximum FAR
for non-residential development is 0.6. For properties located along Railroad
Avenue, maximum nonresidential FAR of 1.0, with maximum total FAR not to
exceed 2.0.
Commercial
Six commercial land use designations are established; each of these serves a
specific purpose, accommodating a broad range of uses.
Each commercial land use designation allows residential uses above ground floor
office and retail uses (mixed use development). Subject to design review approval
by the Planning Commission, the maximum allowable FAR in each land use
designation could be increased, up to a maximum of 0.25 additional FAR, in order    Commercial opportunities in the City include the WalMart
to accommodate a residential component. Higher FARs may be allowed as               shopping center on Loveridge and East Leland Roads.
identified by specific subarea policies (see Section 2.5: Planning Subareas).
Regional Commercial. Provides commercial acreage for large-scale retailers and
big-box retail centers, such as Home Depot, Best Buy, and auto dealerships,
designed to attract shoppers from a wide market area. The Zoning Ordinance will
provide adequate sites for regional commercial uses to ensure visibility and access
from major transportation corridors, such as State Route 4, which are necessary
for establishing a regional clientele.
Community Commercial. Intended to provide sites for retail shopping areas
(primarily in shopping centers) containing a wide variety of businesses, including
retail stores, eating and drinking establishments, commercial recreation, service
stations, automobile sales and repair services, financial, business and personal
services, motels, educational and social services. The Zoning Ordinance may limit
certain commercial areas to neighborhood stores or non-automotive
establishments.
Downtown Commercial. Accommodates specialty retail, personal services,
restaurants, offices, financial organizations, institutions, and other businesses
                                                                                                                                           2-19

               serving the daily needs of Downtown residents. Upper-story residential and mixed
               commercial/residential ground-floor uses are permitted, subject to appropriate
               design standards. The maximum allowable FAR is 2.0, with a maximum 1.0 for
               non-residential uses. Limitations on the size and location of parking, coupled with
               building orientation and design standards, will ensure that a pedestrian-oriented
               environment is created. A detailed discussion of Downtown land uses is located in
               Chapter 5: Downtown.
               Business Commercial. Intended to provide sites for administrative, financial,
               business, professional, medical, research and development, and public offices, as
               well as custom manufacturing, limited assembly, light manufacturing,
               warehousing and distribution, and support commercial uses. The maximum
               allowable FAR is 1.0. The Zoning Ordinance will identify areas appropriate for
               office/business uses vs. industrial parks. Limits on retail activities will be
               specified in the Zoning Ordinance, in addition to potential specific locations for
               hospitals, extended care and other similar facilities. Development standards and
               buffering requirements will prevent significant adverse affects on adjacent
               residential uses.
               Marine Commercial. Business and professional services, offices, convenience
               sales, restaurants, public marketplaces, repair services, specialty retail (such as
               boat sales and repair), hotel/motel with a coastal orientation, recreational facilities,
               research and development, custom manufacturing, and marinas are all
               accommodated. Maximum allowable FAR is—0.5 for retail, recreation facilities,
               marinas, and eating and drinking establishments, 1.0 for offices, and 1.5 for
               hotels—for all (commercial and residential) uses; no separate residential density is
               specified.
               Service Commercial. Intended to provide sites for commercial business not
               appropriate in other commercial areas because of high volumes of vehicle traffic
               and potential adverse impacts on other uses. Also, residential uses may be
               permitted above ground floor commercial uses (such as office and retail). The
               maximum allowable FAR is 0.5 for all (commercial and residential) uses; no
               separate residential density is specified. Allowable uses include automobile sales
               and services, building materials, nurseries, equipment rentals, contractors,
               wholesaling, warehousing, storage, and similar uses. Offices, retail uses,

restaurants, and convenience stores should be allowed as ancillary uses.
Industrial
Manufacturing, wholesale, warehousing and distribution, commercial and business
services, research and development, and storage uses are permitted, in addition to
agricultural, food and drug, and industrial processing. Only small restaurant and
ancillary commercial uses would be appropriate, subject to appropriate design
standards. The maximum FAR is 0.5, and increases in the maximum FAR may be
permitted up to 0.8, for uses with low employment intensities. Performance
standards in the Zoning Ordinance will minimize potential environmental impacts.
Public/Institutional
Intended to provide for schools, government offices, transit sites, public utilities,
and other facilities that have a unique public character. Religious facilities are not
called out separately on the General Plan Diagram; these facilities may or may not
be specifically delineated on the Zoning Map.
Parks/Recreation
Provides for parks, recreation complexes, community fields, public golf courses,
stadiums, and greenways. Local and regional trail network is also accommodated.
Ancillary facilities such as concession stands, clubhouses, and equipment rental
are also allowed.
                                                                                       Pittsburg attempts to provide a variety of recreational facilities

Much of the City’s Planning Area is rural privately-owned land that falls within
the open space designation. This classification accommodates any greenbelts
and/or urban buffer areas that may be designated in the future. Greenbelts are open
space, parkland, and agricultural areas located outside urban areas, as opposed to
urban parks located within developed areas. Generally, there are two primary
criteria that identify lands as open space:
                                                                                                                                                      2-21

               • Resource Conservation. Includes sites with environmental and/or safety
                   constraints, such as riparian corridors, sensitive habitats, and wetlands.
                   Development is limited to one housing unit per existing legal parcel, and no
                   construction is allowed on land within the parcel that is unsuitable for
                   development.
               • Agriculture and Resource Management. Includes orchards and cropland,
                   grasslands, incidental agricultural or related sales, and very low-density rural
                   residential areas, not to exceed one housing unit per 20 acres. One housing
                   unit may be built on each existing parcel, and agriculture is allowed with
                   fewer restrictions on keeping animals than in the residential classifications.
               Permitted residential development may be clustered in locations with little or no
               environmental constraints. However, land area with the open space designation is
               not to be used in calculating allowable density.
               Utility/ROW
               Intended to designate land area dedicated to utilities, infrastructure or road right-
               of-way.
               2.3        GENERAL PLAN BUILDOUT
               Development consistent with the General Plan resulting from application of
               assumed average densities and intensities is described in Tables 2-5 and 2-6. The
               time at which full development (“buildout”) will occur or areas where
               redevelopment may occur are not specified in or anticipated by the Plan.
               Designation of a site for a certain use does not necessarily mean that the site will
               be built/redeveloped with the designated use over the Plan horizon.
               BUILDOUT POPULATION
               Buildout of the General Plan, at the assumed densities shown in Table 2-5, will
               result in approximately 31,690 housing units located within the City limits. An
               estimated population of 93,340 will reside within the City limits, while
               approximately 15,730 people will live within Bay Point by 2020; resulting in a

               Buildout of all commercial and industrial sites within the Planning Area would
               result in approximately 14.9 million square feet of commercial space and 6.4 mil-
               lion square feet of industrial space. This increase in non-residential building area,
               in conjunction with increased populations and business expansion throughout East
               County, will result in a total of 54,170 commercial jobs and 10,470 industrial jobs
               at buildout (see Table 2-6).

               2.4    CITY-WIDE LAND USE POLICIES
               GOALS: LAND USE
               2-G-1 Maintain a compact urban form within the City’s projected municipal
                     boundary. Ensure that hillside lands not environmentally suitable for
                     development are maintained as open space.
               2-G-2 Promote large-scale office/business development, and reserve sites for
                     Business Commercial uses in designated locations accessible from
                     regional transportation systems.
               2-G-3 Emphasize concentrated commercial development, rather than linear
                     commercial strips.
               2-G-4 Provide a range of development intensities, with the highest intensities in
                     Downtown and in areas accessible to transit and services, and lower
                     intensities in hillsides and at the City’s southern edge.
               2-G-5 Promote a diversity of housing types, including opportunities for hillside
                     estate development, as well as smaller lot, infill, and high-density
                     housing.
               2-G-6 Maintain programs and provide incentives for use of vacant infill land
                     and reuse and revitalization of underutilized sites.
               2-G-7 Promote flexibility and diversity in land use arrangements, including
                     mixed-use development in appropriate areas.
               2-G-8 Ensure that hillside development enhances the built environment,
                     improves safety through slope stabilization, is respectful of topography
                     and other natural constraints, and preserves ridgelines and viewsheds.
               2-G-9 Exercise leadership in securing development and preserving open space
                     consistent with the General Plan in portions of the Planning Area that
                     will ultimately be inside the city boundaries.

POLICIES: LAND USE
The policies in this section address city-wide land use strategies. Section 2.5 applies to
specific sub-areas.
For Downtown policies, see Chapter 5: Downtown. For parks, recreation, and open
space policies, see Chapter 8: Youth and Recreation.
Growth Boundaries and Procedures
2-P-1     Review the City’s Sphere of Influence every 5 years. Pursue necessary annexa-
          tion and Sphere of Influence changes through coordination with the County and
          Local Agency Formation Commission, in accordance with Figure 2-3.
           Changes to the City’s Sphere of Influence (SOI) are shown in Figure 2-3. The
           figure shows several areas where the City’s SOI would be expanded: the area
           between Bailey Road and the Concord Naval Weapons Station, and the area
           east of the PG&E transmission line corridor and Kirker Pass Road. Both of
           these areas are proposed exclusively for low-density development.
2-P-2     Update the City’s Zoning Ordinance and Subdivision Regulations for
          consistency with the General Plan, including the General Plan Diagram.
           This revision would include:
          • Establishing new base districts, consistent with the land use classifications
               in the General Plan;
          • Revamping regulations to ensure well-designed hillside development;
          • Considering use of new overlay districts for environmental protection, new
               review processes, and mixed-use and specific plan areas; and
          •    Drafting new development regulations that reflect policy direction contained
               throughout the General Plan, including planning sub-area standards.
                                                                                                   2-27

2-P-3   Allow market forces, the status of agricultural preserve (Williamson Act)
        contracts, and the availability of urban services to determine the timing
        of annexation or development expansion into the hillsides.
2-P-4   Consider amendments to the current Sphere of Influence for properties
        along the eastern and western edges of the City, to take advantage of
        providing City services for the development of adjacent vacant lands.
         The undeveloped Chevron East site has historically been considered part
         of Pittsburg, and is a logical extension of the Highlands Ranch
         development. Developable sites west of Bay Point can also be served by
         extending existing City services.
Planned Development and Compatibility
2-P-5   Undertake planned development as a means to achieve high community
        design standards, not to circumvent development intensity standards.
         Planned Development (PD) zoning has been used fairly extensively in
         the City. While the use of PD regulations in itself is not a problem, the
         PD mechanism should not be a vehicle to circumvent policies,
         regulations, and standards embodied in the General Plan and the Zoning
         Ordinance.
2-P-6   Ensure provision of community amenities within planned development
        projects, including parks and recreation facilities, streetscaping and
        pedestrian paths, transit facilities, parking areas, and public safety
        facilities. Ensure construction of amenities at a time that is in balance
        with the needs of the development.
2-P-7   During development review, consider project compatibility with existing
        surrounding land uses. Ensure that sensitive uses—such as residences,
        schools, and parks—are not subject to hazardous or unhealthy
        conditions.

          traveling along City roadways, such as Willow Pass Road and Pittsburg-
          Antioch Highway.
Residential Development
2-P-15 Ensure minimum residential densities, in accordance with the ranges
         stipulated in this Plan.
          This would require update of the City’s Zoning Ordinance to ensure
          consistency with the General Plan, including rezoning of sites to
          appropriate designations so that planned development is within the
          designated range.
2-P-16 Develop criteria and standards for small-lot single-family residential
         development that:
          • Promotes design and development flexibility;
          • Includes design and bulk standards to ensure that development is      Housing opportunities in Pittsburg include the Oak Hills

              appropriate and related to underlying lot size; and
          • Ensures that residential development promotes a neighborhood
              orientation, with limitation on frontage that can be occupied by
              garages.
2-P-17 Maintain regulations to permit second units (accessory dwellings) in
         single-family residential developments in accordance with State law.
          Requirements for this are spelled out in California Government Code
          Section 65852.

PITTSBURG 2020
               2-P-18 Limit all new multi-family housing to 20 units or more. Update the
                         Zoning Ordinance to ensure that new multi-family projects are
                         developed as large-scale, professionally maintained, high-density
                         housing.
               2-P-19 Revise the City’s Subdivision Ordinance to encourage solar access and
                         other energy-saving devices.
               2-P-20 Revise the City’s Zoning Ordinance to require undergrounding of utility
                         service/transformer boxes, and any other type of utility boxes, in new
                         residential subdivisions.
                         If switch boxes and transformer boxes cannot be undergrounded due to
                         physical constraints, these boxes should be placed in locations that are
                         not visually obtrusive and screened to avoid visual blight.
               Hillside Development
               2-P-21 Revise the City’s Hillside Preservation Ordinance to reflect General
                         Plan policy direction. Revisions may include, but are not limited to:
                         • Designating protected ridgelines, creeks, and other significant
                              resource areas, along with daylight plane or setback standards;
                         • Defining protected viewsheds;
                         • Designating location and density of low-density hillside residential
                              development based on slope stability and visual impact;
                         • Provision of well-designed hillside projects that provide larger,
                              family-oriented lots; and
                         • Protection of significant ridgelines and incorporation of hill forms
                              into project design.
               2-P-22 Ensure that all General Plan policies apply to hillside land irrespective
                         of zoning – whether Planned Development or any other base district.

2-P-23 Restrict development on minor and major ridgelines (as identified in
        Figure 4-2). Encourage residential construction on flatter natural slopes
        or non-sensitive graded areas that reduce environmental and visual
        impacts. Minimize cut-and-fill of natural hillsides.
2-P-24 Prohibit new development on designated ridgelines. Ensure that
        residential developers cluster housing units to reduce both
        environmental and visual impact of hillside development.
2-P-25 As a condition of approval, ensure that residential developers
        incorporate natural creeks as open space amenities into the design of
        residential neighborhoods.
2-P-26 Ensure that new hillside development utilizes fire-resistant building
        materials, per the Uniform Building Code. Require that all residential
        units adjacent to open slopes maintain a 30-foot setback with fire-
        resistant landscaping.
2-P-27 Minimize single-access residential neighborhoods in the hills; maximize
        access for fire and emergency response personnel.
2-P-28 During development review, ensure that the design of new hillside
        neighborhoods minimizes potential land use incompatibilities with any
        grazing/agricultural activities in the southern hills.
Environmental Review
2-P-29 Ensure that all Environmental Impact Reports for development projects,
        where required and necessary, be prepared by City staff or staff-
        approved and managed consultants. However, require project
        proponents to pay for all consultant services associated with
        environmental review.
         California Public Resource Code Section 21082.1 requires that a Draft
         EIR be prepared directly by or under contract to the lead agency; this
                                                                                         2-33
PITTSBURG 2020
                      includes traffic modeling and geo-technical studies for project EIRs and
                      program EIRs.
               2-P-30 Encourage private developers to conduct geo-technical and biological
                      studies prior to filing project applications to ensure environmentally
                      sensitive project layout and design.

PITTSBURG 2020
               2.5       PLANNING SUBAREAS
               The City’s subareas are defined geographically, following either major
               transportation routes—such as State Route 4 or the BNSF railroad—or
               City/neighborhood boundaries. Figure 2-4 shows the subareas, and Table 2-7
               presents the land use distribution for each subarea by generalized use categories.
               Subareas 1-11 are within existing City limits, while subareas 12-15 include the
               Bay Point Community and unincorporated lands outside of Pittsburg's Sphere of
               Influence. With the exception of Downtown and East Leland, the subareas are
               generally dominated by one land use type. A description of the subareas follows:
               1.   Downtown. Retail and commercial office uses line Railroad Avenue, north of
                    East Tenth Street. Service commercial uses are located along East Tenth
                    Street, the old County highway. Residential neighborhoods surround the
                    commercial corridors, with newer, higher density developments located near
                    the waterfront. Downtown is discussed in greater detail in Chapter 5.
               2.   Northeast River. Northeast River is characterized by large-scale heavy
                    industrial operations and vacant land. USS-Posco, Dow Chemical, and the
                    Delta Diablo Wastewater Treatment Plant are some of the facilities located in
                    this subarea. Wetlands comprise a small portion of the northeastern corner
                    where Kirker Creek meets the Sacramento River. Browns Island, located
                    across New York Slough, is a Regional Shoreline Preserve.
               3.   Loveridge. Large industrial uses and vacant sites constitute a majority of
                    Loveridge, adjacent to the Loveridge Road/State Route 4 interchange. A
                    variety of land uses line East Leland Road, including a community
                    commercial center, business commercial complex, service commercial node,
                    and several multi-family housing developments. Between the BNSF railroad
                    tracks and State Route 4, heavy industry and business commercial parks are
                    planned. Land dedicated to regional commercial (big-box) retailers is
                    concentrated along Century Boulevard.
               4.   East Central. Located east of Railroad Avenue and north of State Route 4,
                    East Central contains some of the City’s older neighborhoods; most notably

   decades past. Residential uses comprise more than half of the net land area.
   Neighborhood commercial establishments can be found on Railroad Avenue
   and adjacent to State Route 4, and commercial offices on Railroad Avenue
   and Harbor Street. Pittsburg High School is also located in this subarea.
5. Railroad Avenue. The City’s major commercial corridor also serves as a
   major north-south arterial connecting Downtown to the southern City limits.
   Services and business commercial uses line the corridor north of State Route
   4, while community commercial activities constitute the southern portion of
   the corridor. Pittsburg's Civic Center is also located in this subarea, along
   with City Park, one of the City’s major recreational areas.
6. East Leland. Similar to Downtown, East Leland is characterized by a diverse
   mix of uses. However, its commercial establishments, offices, and
   business/industrial parks have been developed at a much larger scale,
   reflecting a less dense suburban land use pattern. A proposed mixed-use,
   business commercial node comprises nearly all land north of East Leland
   Road, adjacent to the proposed Railroad Avenue BART Station. Multi-family
   residential uses are clustered along East Leland Road and Delta De Anza
   Trail in the southeastern portion of the subarea. Small World Park and Los
   Medanos Community College are also located within the area.
7. Buchanan. Located along the City’s southeastern boundary, the Buchanan
   subarea consists of many newer single-family residential subdivisions.
   Additionally, this subarea features a multi-unit senior community along
   Kirker Creek. Two parks and three schools are located here, along with a few
   commercial establishments. Hillside and low-density residential acreage is
   available for development of new up-scale neighborhoods along the southeast
   boundary of the Planning Area.
8. Woodlands. Like Buchanan, Woodlands contains many newer single-family
   housing developments. A small park and one elementary school serve the
   subarea. Clustered, low-density neighborhoods are proposed for the small
   valleys adjacent to Kirker Creek.
9. West Central. Residential neighborhoods comprise the primary use in West
   Central. Two small neighborhood commercial uses serve the subarea
   (Fountain Plaza and Parkside Market). Two mobile home parks also lie
                                                                                        2-37

                   within the area, adjacent to the PG&E transmission corridor. Business
                   commercial, services, and industrial parcels adjacent to and north of the
                   BNSF railroad tracks have potential for redevelopment opportunities.
               10. West Leland. West Leland is dominated by single-family residential
                   neighborhoods, and the City’s joint Golf Course/Stoneman Park recreational
                   facility. Additional public facilities include Del Monte Community Center, an
                   elementary school, and a new fire station.
               11. Southwest Hills. Annexed by the City in 1990, this subarea presently consists
                   primarily of undeveloped, rolling hills. However, the area is the site of the
                   approved 640-acre San Marco residential development, which will include
                   both low and high-density residential units. The Oak Hills and Alves Ranch
                   residential subdivisions are also located within this subarea. Additionally, the
                   southern hills subarea includes the San Marco Meadows and Bailey Estates
                   projects, which are not yet annexed to the City but are located within the
                   County ULL. Potential sites for low-density residential neighborhoods are
                   located outside the County ULL and may be available for development after
                   the Restricted Federal Easement is abandoned.
                   Multi-family housing developments will be concentrated along the West
                   Leland Road corridor. A mixed-use, community commercial center at the
                   West Leland Road/San Marco Boulevard intersection will serve nearby
                   neighborhoods, while business commercial parks will be developed along
                   West Leland Road. A small portion of the Pittsburg/Bay Point BART Station
                   Area Specific Plan area also lies within this subarea.
               Unincorporated Areas
               Subareas 12-15 comprise the unincorporated portions of the Pittsburg Planning
               Area. These areas include:
               12. Northwest River. Two major uses are located in the Northwest River: the
                   Mirant (previously PG&E) Power Plant, and a small portion of the Concord
                   Naval Weapons Station. The remainder of Northwest River consists of
                   marshland.

13. Bay Point. Located west of Pittsburg, the unincorporated community of Bay
    Point consists primarily of residential neighborhoods. Multi-family housing is
    concentrated along Bailey Road north of the Pittsburg/Bay Point BART
    Station, and commercial activities line the Willow Pass Road corridor. A
    large swath of industrial land lies along the railroad tracks. The Mount Diablo
    Unified School District operates two elementary schools within the
    community. The majority of the developed portion of Bay Point, while
    unincorporated, is nevertheless within Pittsburg’s SOI and Planning Area.
14. South Hills. South of the City limit, South Hills consists of undeveloped,
    rolling hills. The Keller Canyon Landfill is in the northwestern portion of the
    South Hills subarea, and is surrounded by an open space buffer.
15. Black Diamond. Located in the far southeastern corner of the City’s Planning
    Area, Black Diamond features undeveloped, rolling hills of primarily rural,
    privately-owned grazing land. The Black Diamond Mines Regional Preserve
    offers a variety of recreational opportunities, such as trails and picnic areas,
    and includes current ranching operations.
Several observations can be made about land uses at the subarea level:
• Medium and High Density Residential acreage can be found in the East
   Leland, Southwest Hills, West Central, West Leland, and Buchanan subareas.
   Most residential development outside City boundaries is located in the
   unincorporated Bay Point community.
• Commercial uses are focused primarily in the East Leland, Downtown,
   Loveridge, and Railroad Avenue subareas.
• Industrial facilities in the Planning Area are concentrated in the Loveridge,
   Northeast River, and Northwest River subareas.
• A majority of parks and open space acreage in the Planning Area is
   attributable to Browns Island Regional Shoreline and Black Diamond Mines
   Regional Preserve. Stoneman Park, in West Leland, constitutes the largest
   proportion of parkland within City limits.
                                                                                            2-39

       ing access.
2-P-43 Ensure that all proposed projects in the Northeast River area com-
       plete an assessment of biological resources, including wetlands, be-
       fore site layout and design is completed.
2-P-44 Ensure—through a combination of on- and off-site mitigation—that
       new development results in no net loss of wetlands.
        Dowest Slough is an excellent example of wetlands restoration
        adjacent to industrial properties. See Chapter 9: Resource
        Conservation for further discussion of wetlands habitat
        preservation.

       industrial properties are redeveloped and remediated.
2-P-46 Support the permanent preservation of the wetlands and salt marsh
       habitats along New York and Dowest Sloughs, including Browns
       Island Regional Shoreline.

                                                   2-P-55 Pursue the extension of the Railroad Avenue linear park along the

                                                             This linear park currently extends along the west side of Railroad
                                                             Avenue from the Delta De Anza Trail to the State Route 4
                                                             interchange. Expanding the linear park would provide a walkable

       to the Civic Center, City Park, high school, and other institutional
       uses on the north side of State Route 4.
        The development of a specific plan for the Railroad Avenue BART
        Station area will ensure that adjacent business commercial sites are
        redeveloped in a manner consistent with a transit-oriented
        commercial node. This area has the potential for intensification as a
        regional employment center, accessible by the BART system.
2-P-57 Allow development at an intensity of up to 2.0 FAR along Railroad
       Avenue from State Route 4 to East Leland Road.
        The sites south of the Railroad Avenue/State Route 4 interchange
        are designated for community commercial and business commercial
        uses in the General Plan Diagram.
2-P-58 Allow mixed-use development at an intensity of up to 1.0 FAR for
       non-residential uses, and additional residential development at a
       maximum density of 25 units per acre, on designated community
       commercial sites along Railroad Avenue, south of Bliss Avenue.
        Such mixed-use development will be subject to review and approval
        by the Planning Commission, and will require provision of
        residential units as part of the proposal.
2-P-59 Extend Garcia Avenue to Railroad Avenue if suitable opportunity
       arises during redevelopment of adjacent sites, and explore the
       feasibility of other linkages to improve accessibility.
2-P-60 Ensure that the small business commercial center at the southern
       end of Railroad Avenue (at Buchanan Road) is compatible with the
       scale of surrounding uses.

       between Leland and Buchanan Roads, along the eastern edge of the
       College at the border of the two cities.
        The proposed street would provide a connection between Loveridge
        and Somersville Roads, and would provide much improved access
        to the campus. It would also divert southwest-moving traffic from
        Antioch to State Route 4; however, it may need an additional
        highway interchange to provide increased connections without
        negatively impacting existing roadways.

                                                    2-P-87 Ensure that all proposed residential development is set back from
                                                              the edge of State Route 4 to mitigate visual and noise impacts.

       • Allow a maximum of 1,400 Hillside Low and Low Density units,
           and 1,500 Medium and High Density units, with additional
           residential and commercial development permitted in the mixed
           use San Marco Village;
       • Require a 10-acre mixed-use pedestrian-oriented core,
           extending along West Leland Road. Encourage site design that
           provides buildings fronting along West Leland Road, with
           parking tucked behind buildings;
       • Allow a maximum of 40 acres of Business Commercial and 10
           acres of Community Commercial between West Leland Road
           and State Route 4;
       • Ensure grading is kept to a minimum, all designated ridgelines
           are protected, and impacts to creeks are mitigated; and
       • Require dedication of one school site, and two neighborhood
           park sites or park in-lieu fees.
       Current development entitlements for the site include over 2,900
       housing units. Thus, while this land use program would result in
       somewhat fewer housing units, because of the Business
       Commercial development permitted, the overall amount of
       development and resulting residential densities would be even
       higher. However, development would be required to conform to
       heightened environmental and design criteria.
2-P-89 Allow development on the site east of the proposed West Leland
       Road/San Marco Boulevard intersection (Alves Ranch) as follows:
       • A maximum of 306 Hillside Low and Low Density units, and
           794 Medium and High Density residential units;
       • A maximum of 20 acres of Business Commercial between West
           Leland Road and State Route 4;
       • Grading to be kept to a minimum, all designated ridgelines
           protected, and impacts to creeks mitigated; and
       • Dedication of one school site.
                                                                                2-77

               2-P-90 Ensure that all new development in Southwest Hills provides
                      trailheads and linkages into the multi-use trail system planned to
                      extend from West Leland Road to Oak Hills Park.
               2-P-91 Ensure as part of the development review process that any future
                      subdivision in the southwest hills that is adjacent to the 2005
                      Pittsburg voter approved urban limit line, establishes a greenbelt
                      buffer within the City's urban limit line between the proposed
                      development and the urban limit line. The greenbelt buffer shall
                      include all land between the City of Concord border and the first set
                      of ridges, including the tops of these same ridges which generally
                      run parallel to the common border. The City will consider, in
                      conjunction with subdivision applications on these properties and
                      related environmental analysis, general plan and/or the transfer
                      of lost development rights as a result of the these greenbelts to
                      other portions of these properties, while not increasing the
                      overall number of units permitted on these properties.
               2-P-92 Consider the development of a specific plan for the High Density
                      Residential, Business Commercial, and Community Commercial
                      areas adjacent to State Route 4, West Leland Road and San Marco
                      Boulevard. Integrate all uses in this area into a mixed-use, transit-
                      oriented village, featuring executive offices, research and
                      development, entertainment, and hotel uses.
               2-P-93 Allow Low Density residential development west of Bailey Road, as
                      shown on the General Plan Diagram. Ensure that such development
                      is minimally visible from Bailey Road, and mitigates any impacts to
                      creeks and wetlands in the area.
               2-P-94 Pursue construction of a landscaped multi-use path along West
                      Leland Road, from Pittsburg/Bay Point BART Station to the
                      proposed San Marco Village. Ensure that design of the linear
                      parkway accommodates bicyclists.

2-P-95 Development in the Concord Naval Weapons Station Restricted
       Federal Easement area may be allowed when that Easement is
       abandoned.
2-P-96 Allow an overall maximum density of 3.0 du/ac within the Low
       Density Residential areas south of the San Marco project and
       outside the present Sphere of Influence line with a maximum number
       of 1500 residential units.

3 GROWTH MANAGEMENT
This element establishes the goals, policies and programs intended to manage and mitigate
impacts of future growth and development within the City. It provides policy framework
to ensure that sufficient opportunities for housing are provided in the City and that facilities
for motorists, bicyclists, pedestrians and transit are constructed in proportion to new urban
development.
This element is intended to comply with the requirements of the Contra Costa County
Transportation Sales Tax Expenditure Plan (Measure J). Measure J, adopted by County
voters in 2004 and later amended by the Contra Costa Transportation Authority (CCTA), is
a 25-year extension of the Contra Costa Transportation Improvement and Growth Man-
agement Program (Measure C) approved by voters in 1988. The Measure J Growth Man-
agement Program is intended to ensure that future development pays for the facilities re-
quired to meet the demands resulting from that growth. More particularly, it requires that
each jurisdiction in the County:
    •   Adopt a development mitigation program;
    •   Address housing options;
    •   Participate in an ongoing cooperative, multi-jurisdictional planning process;
    •   Adopt an Urban Limit Line (ULL);
    •   Develop a five-year capital improvement program; and
    •   Adopt a transportation systems management ordinance or resolution.
In addition to the transportation planning goals and policies identified in this Growth
Management Element, Chapter 7: Transportation, establishes goals and policies for traffic
services and roadway improvements, bicycle and pedestrian movement, and Transportation
Demand Management (TDM) programs. Chapter 13: Housing is also referenced in this
Growth Management Element and includes an expanded list of policies and programs that
describe the City’s efforts to foster access to safe, quality housing for people of all income
levels.

                   3.1       GROWTH AND EXPANSION
                   CURRENT DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS
                   The City has a substantial inventory of residential projects with development approvals, as
                   well as several planned commercial and industrial complexes. The two largest residential
                   projects – San Marco and Alves Ranch – are both located in the Southwest Hills subarea
                   and would include over 4,000 housing units at buildout. Business and Community Com-
                   mercial districts are also planned for the southeastern portion of the City along State Route
                   4 and within the Southwest Hills subarea. Two major industrial projects are located along
                   the industrial waterfront area – Los Medanos Energy Center and Delta Energy Center.
                   To track current development projects, the City maintains a list of private development
                   projects that have been recently proposed, approved or built within the City. This list of
                   current projects is updated periodically by Planning staff and is an informational item
                   available to the public.
                   GROWTH AND ANNEXATION
                   The Planning Area boundaries of this General Plan largely coincide with those of the
                   City’s last comprehensive update of the General Plan, which was adopted in 1988. The
                   Planning Area boundaries are described in Chapter 1: Introduction. Since the 1988 Gener-
                   al Plan was adopted, Pittsburg has witnessed eight major expansions of its City boundaries,
                   totaling over 4,400 acres:
                       •   Northeast River subarea. In 1990, 1,170 acres were annexed for industrial devel-
                           opment;
                       •   West Central subarea. In 1991, 190 acres were annexed for construction of a mo-
                           bile home park;
                       •   Buchanan subarea. In 1997, 160 acres of Highlands Ranch were annexed for resi-
                           dential development. In 2008, approximately 160 acres located south of Highlands

    •    Southwest Hills subarea. In 1990, 1,030 acres were annexed for the San Marco
         project. In 1992, 130 acres were annexed along the western municipal boundary.
         Then in 1996, 100 acres were annexed south of Oak Hills; and
    •    Northwest River subarea. In 2008, 1,467 acres were annexed, including the Mirant
         Power Generation Plant and adjacent wetland areas.
Full implementation of the land uses proposed in this General Plan will require additional
annexations in the Woodlands, Buchanan, and Southwest Hills subareas. Policies also
consider potential annexation of developable lands outside of the current Sphere of Influ-
ence (SOI) along the eastern and western edges of the City.
URBAN LIMIT LINE
As part of the 1996 Contra Costa County General Plan, the County delineated an Urban
Limit Line (ULL) to identify areas appropriate for urban expansion and to preserve open
space in the southern hills. The County amended its ULL in 2000, removing several hun-
dred acres of the southern hills from planned urban growth area.
This General Plan seeks to define appropriate limits for urban growth based on land use
considerations and environmental and topographic constraints. In 2005, the voters ap-
proved the City of Pittsburg Voter Approved Urban Limit Line and Prezoning Act. This
Act amended this General Plan to establish a Voter Approved Urban Limit Line that could
not be changed without a vote of the voters. The Act also prezoned certain specified lands
as a necessary first step in the process of annexing those lands to the City and provided that
the prezoning could be changed by a vote of the voters or by a majority vote of the City
Council.
The findings and purpose section of the City of Pittsburg Voter Approved Urban Limit
Line and Prezoning Act specifically stated its intent to comply with the purposes of Meas-
ure J as follows:
Ensure the preservation and protection of identified non-urban land, including agricultural,
open space, parkland, and other areas, by establishing a line beyond which urban develop-
ment is prohibited;
                                                                                                                 3-3

    PITTSBURG 2020
                   Link land use decisions with the transportation investments in Measure J by channeling
                   future growth to locations more suitable for urban development; and
                   Ensure that land use policies within the Voter Approved Urban Limit Line effectively pro-
                   mote appropriate development that accommodates the area’s projected housing and job
                   needs for the future.
                   GOALS: GROWTH AND EXPANSION
                   3-G-1     Manage the City’s growth to balance development of housing options and job
                             opportunities, protection of open space and habitat areas, construction of
                             transportation improvements, and preservation of high quality public facilities.
                   3-G-2     Realize the opportunities afforded by establishment of the Voter Approved Urban
                             Limit Line to allow the City to grow in such a way as to diversify and expand the
                             employment base, develop a range of housing opportunities, increase the depth of
                             municipal fiscal resources, enhance the quality of urban life for all Pittsburg
                             residents and prohibit urban development beyond the Voter Approved Urban
                             Limit Line.
                   3-G-3     Provide a range of development intensities, with the highest intensities in
                             Downtown and in areas approximate to transit and services, and lower intensities
                             in hillsides and at the City’s southern edge.
                   3-G-4     Maintain programs and provide incentives for use of vacant infill land and reuse
                             and revitalization of underutilized sites. (Land Use Goal 2-G-6)
                   3-G-5     Ensure that new residential, commercial and industrial growth within the Voter-
                             Approved Urban Limit Line pays its share of the costs for the construction of
                             facilities needed to serve that growth.
                   POLICIES: GROWTH AND EXPANSION
                   3-P-1     Allow urban and suburban development only in areas where public facilities and
                             infrastructure (police, fire, parks, water, sewer, storm drainage, and community

      facilities) are available or can be provided.
       Prior to development approval, public service agencies and/or districts should be
       contacted and assurance gained that areas of urban expansion will have all
       necessary infrastructure.
3-P-2 Prior to project approval, ensure that the existing and planned transportation
      system will have adequate capacity to accommodate new urban development.
                                                                                                           3-5

                   3.2       REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLANNING
                   Measure J requires each jurisdiction’s participation in an ongoing process with other juris-
                   dictions and agencies, the Regional Transportation Planning Committees and CCTA to
                   create a balanced, safe and efficient transportation system and to manage the impacts of
                   growth. The City must work with TRANSPLAN (east Contra Costa County’s Regional
                   Transportation Planning Committee) to:
                   Identify Routes of Regional Significance, establish Multimodal Transportation Service Ob-
                   jectives (MTSO’s) for those routes, and develop Action Plans to achieve those objectives;
                   Apply CCTA’s travel demand model and technical procedures to the analysis of General
                   Plan amendments and developments exceeding specified thresholds for their impact on the
                   regional transportation system, including effects on Action Plan objectives;
                   Create development mitigation programs for both local and regional transportation facili-
                   ties to ensure that new growth is paying its share of the costs associated with that growth;
                   and
                   Help develop other plans, programs and studies to address other transportation and growth
                   management issues.
                   In consultation with the Regional Transportation Planning Committees, each jurisdiction
                   must use the travel demand model to evaluate changes to local General Plans and the im-
                   pacts of major development projects for their impacts on the local and regional transporta-
                   tion system and the ability to achieve the Multimodal Transportation Service Objectives
                   (MTSO’s) established in the Action Plans.
                   Jurisdictions must also participate in CCTA’s ongoing county-wide comprehensive trans-
                   portation planning process. As part of this process, CCTA will support county-wide and
                   sub-regional planning efforts, including the Action Plans for Routes of Regional Signific-
                   ance, and will maintain a travel demand model. Jurisdictions must help maintain CCTA’s
                   travel demand modeling system by providing information on proposed improvements to
                   the transportation system and planned and approved development within the jurisdiction.

GOALS: REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLANNING
3-G-6  Support efforts to establish a regional approach to transportation and land use
       planning.
3-G-7  Coordinate circulation system plans with other jurisdictions’ and agencies’
       plans, including but not limited to Antioch and Concord, the Contra Costa
       Transportation Authority, and Caltrans (Transportation Goal 7-G-3).
POLICIES: REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLANNING
3-P-3  Work with Contra Costa Transportation Authority and TRANSPLAN (the
       transportation planning committee for East County) to develop and implement
       Action Plans for Routes of Regional Significance, as designated in Figure 3-1.
        The City should also participate in CCTA’s conflict resolution process, as needed
        to resolve disputes related to the development and implementation of Action
        Plans.
3-P-4  Participate in cooperative regional land use and transportation planning efforts
       by sharing information about future development in the City with interested
       agencies and jurisdictions.
        The City shall notify CCTA, TRANSPLAN, other Regional Transportation
        Planning Committees (such as TRANSPAC), neighboring jurisdictions, and
        transportation and transit service providers about development proposals that
        would generate 100 or more net new peak hour vehicle trips. The City shall
        require preparation of a traffic impact analysis report for private or public
        projects that meet or exceed the 100 trip threshold. Copies of those reports shall
        be made available to regional transportation planning agencies and potentially
        affected jurisdictions. This policy shall also apply to capital improvement
        projects that may have an affect on existing or planned facilities.
                                                                                                             3-7

                                                                                               3: GROWTH MANAGEMENT
3.3        DEVELOPMENT REVIEW AND MITIGATION PROGRAMS
Under Measure J, each jurisdiction in the County must consider, evaluate, and develop
programs to mitigate the impacts of new development on automobile, pedestrian, bicycle,
and transit facilities, both locally and regionally. Furthermore, Measure J directs jurisdic-
tions to establish and adopt programs to ensure that new growth pays its share of the costs
associated with that growth.
For projects that are anticipated to generate in excess of 100 net new peak hour vehicle
trips, traffic studies are required to identify the project-specific transportation impacts on
local and regional roadways. The City may set a lower threshold for requirements of these
studies. The traffic studies shall measure the impacts of a project on roads and at intersec-
tions using Level of Service (LOS) standards, where LOS is expressed as a range of ratings
from LOS A (free flow of traffic) to LOS F (long traffic delays). In addition to identifying
project-related impacts, traffic studies provide a means for identifying mitigation meas-
ures—such as construction of roadway improvements or payment of a pro rata share of the
cost to construct those improvements—in instances where the impacts of a project are an-
ticipated to exceed specified LOS thresholds. Under Measure J, jurisdictions are encour-
aged to adopt programs that promote the use of transportation alternatives to the automo-
bile, and a discussion of these transportation alternatives may also be incorporated into the
traffic study.
Regardless of whether a traffic study is prepared for a project, project developers are still
required to pay mitigation fees to help fund planned improvements to the local or regional
roadway system as part of broader mitigation programs. These programs include both a
local program to mitigate impacts on local streets and facilities, and a regional program to
fund regional and subregional transportation projects. Where mitigation programs require
payment of fees for purposes of mitigating the specific impacts of proposed development,
the programs must preclude the possibility for Measure J monies to be used to offset or re-
place any development-related mitigation fees that would otherwise be collected from de-
velopers.

                  GOALS: DEVELOPMENT REVIEW AND MITIGATION PROGRAMS
                  3-G-8 Achieve traffic levels of service for roadway intersections that are based on the
                        roadways’ classification and location shown in Figure 7-2. (Transportation Goal
                        7-G-1)
                  3-G-9 Encourage the provision of new and improved pedestrian, bicycle and transit
                        facilities to serve all users of new development projects.
                  POLICIES: DEVELOPMENT REVIEW AND MITIGATION PROGRAMS
                  3-P-5  As part of development review, require preparation of a traffic impact study for
                         all development projects expected to generate more than 100 net new peak hour
                         vehicle trips. Ensure that traffic impact studies are prepared by professional
                         transportation consultants selected and hired by the City, but require that project
                         proponents pay all fees associated with development of such studies.
                         The traffic impact study managed by City staff should be prepared according to
                         CCTA’s Technical Procedures, and the Institute of Transportation Engineer’s
                         Traffic Access and Impact Studies for Site Development, Proposed
                         Recommended Practice.
                  3-P-6  Apply the Contra Costa Transportation Authority’s travel demand model and
                         technical procedures to the analysis of General Plan amendments and
                         developments exceeding 100 net new peak-hour vehicle trips for their impact on
                         Regional Routes of Significance and Action Plan objectives.
                  3-P-7  Ensure that all Regional Routes of Significance within the City maintain the
                         following traffic levels of service (LOS) standards (applicable to non-freeway
                         routes and routes not subject to a Traffic Management Program):
                         •      LOS mid D (peak hour volume to capacity ratio less than or equal to 0.85)
                                at intersections along major arterials, except for intersections along Bailey

            Road;
      •     LOS high E (peak hour volume to capacity ratio less than or equal to 0.99)
            at intersections along Bailey Road between West Leland Road and State
            Route 4; and
      •     LOS mid E (peak hour volume to capacity ratio less than or equal to 0.95)
            at intersections on Kirker Pass Road.
      (Transportation Policy 7-P-6)
3-P-8 Ensure that all non-Regional Routes within the City (not designated as Routes of
      Regional Significance in Figure 3-1) maintain the following traffic levels of
      service (LOS) standards based on their location in rural, semi-rural, suburban,
      urban or downtown areas, as designated in Figure 3-1:
      •     Rural – LOS low C (peak hour volume to capacity ratio less than or equal
            to 0.74)
      •     Semi-rural – LOS high C (peak hour volume to capacity ratio less than or
            equal to 0.79)
      •     Suburban – LOS low D (peak hour volume to capacity ratio less than or
            equal to 0.84)
      •     Urban – LOS high D (peak hour volume to capacity ratio less than or equal
            to 0.89)
      •     Downtown – LOS high D (peak hour volume to capacity ratio less than or
            equal to 0.89)
      (Transportation Policy 7-P-8)
3-P-9 Ensure that traffic studies prepared for development projects include an analysis
      of the impacts of project-related traffic and roadway improvements on
      pedestrians, bicyclists and transit users.
      When the traffic study identifies significant impacts to pedestrian, bicycle and
      transit users as a result of a project, the study should identify appropriate
                                                                                                         3-11

                          users is restored or enhanced after construction of the project is complete.
                  3-P-10 Approve proposed development projects expected to generate over 100 peak-hour
                         trips ONLY if Findings of Consistency with adopted traffic levels of service
                         standards are found.
                          Findings of Consistency may be made only if a traffic impact analysis shows that
                          the development project is consistent with adopted Action Plans and will not
                          result in violation of adopted LOS standards for Basic Routes, unless:
                              •    Projects included in the City’s five-year Capital Improvement Program
                                   will result in attainment of adopted LOS standards; or
                              •    Findings of Special Circumstances, including appropriate mitigation
                                   measures, have been adopted by the City and CCTA
                  3-P-11 Prepare, adopt and implement a Transportation Systems Management ordinance
                         or resolution, with the purpose of ensuring attainment of adopted traffic levels of
                         service standards.
                          In accordance with court rulings on Bay Area Air Quality Management District’s
                          Rule 13, much of the implementation will be voluntary.
                  Development Impact Mitigation
                  3-P-12 Adopt and update development mitigation programs that collect fees to mitigate
                         transportation impacts to both local and regional transportation facilities.
                  3-P-13 Review and update the City’s transportation impact fee schedule, requiring
                         developers to pay the costs necessary to mitigate impacts of their development
                         projects on the local and regional transportation system.
                          As part of this process, the City should ensure that the cost of regional
                          transportation improvements, identified by TRANSPLAN, along with other

                                                                                            3: GROWTH MANAGEMENT
        improvements, are reflected in the schedule. The fees should be set at amounts
        that will be sufficient to cover the full cost to construct the improvements, and
        revenue generated from collection of the fees shall not be used to replace private
        developer funding of any required improvements that have or would have been
        committed to any project. The schedule should also differentiate fees based on
        location of projects within the LOS Areas (i.e., higher fees in areas where greater
        mitigation and high LOS standards are needed).
3-P-14 Pursue funding from the Contra Costa Transportation Authority for roadway
       projects intended to maintain levels of service standards, implement Action Plans
       for Regional Routes, or provide Special Circumstances mitigation.
        In no case will revenue from the CCTA Local Street Improvement and
        Maintenance Fund replace private developer funding for transportation projects
        needed to meet or maintain LOS standards that may be adversely affected as a
        result of new development in new growth areas.
3-P-15 Prepare, adopt and periodically update a five-year Capital Improvement
       Program (CIP) that describes City-sponsored capital projects necessary to
       maintain and improve operations for traffic, transit, pedestrians and bicyclists
       within the City. Proposed funding sources, agency responsibility, and project
       phasing should be identified in the CIP.
3-P-16 Preserve options for future transit use when designing improvements for
       roadways. Ensure that developers provide bus turnouts and/or shelters, where
       appropriate, as part of projects. (Transportation Policy 7-P-29)
3-P-17 As part of development approval, ensure that safe and contiguous routes for
       pedestrians and bicyclists are provided within new development projects and on
       any roadways that are impacted as a result of new development. (Transportation
       Policy 7-P-34)

Measure J requires that the annual report on the implementation of the Housing
Element of the General Plan be submitted to CCTA every other year. The report
must include the specified housing reporting period and must be submitted to
CCTA in one of the following formats:
•    The number of housing units approved, constructed or occupied in the City
     since the beginning of the reporting period, compared to the average
     number of units needed annually to meet the fair share regional housing
     need;
•    A description of how the City’s adopted land use, housing, and regulatory
     plans and programs have provided sufficient opportunities for and removed
     undue constraints to the achievement of the City’s fair share regional
     housing need; or
•    A description of how the plans and policies of the General Plan and the
     land use regulations of the Zoning Ordinance facilitate the improvement
     and development of the City’s fair share regional housing need.

4 URBAN DESIGN
This element provides hillside and ridgeline preservation policies, identifies
local views and city edges, outlines improvement strategies for key corridors
within the City, and contains policies relating to design and development of
residential neighborhoods.
The design of key corridors and infill areas—such as the Downtown
neighborhoods and BART Station Areas—will be central to fostering a
livable and vital City. Many General Plan policies emphasize reuse and
intensification adjacent to local activity centers. However, as development
extends into the foothills, preserving ridgelines and views of hills will
become increasingly critical in preserving the City’s identity.

               4.1      VIEWS, RIDGES AND EDGES
               VIEWS WITHIN PITTSBURG
               The most identifying feature lending Pittsburg a sense of character is its
               location between the rolling, grassy hills to the south and Suisun
               Bay/Sacramento River Delta to the north. Views of both natural features are
               important to the visual quality of the community. From the flatland areas of
               Pittsburg, views of the southern hills are prominent. Rolling, grassy slopes
               and the larger, vegetated mountains of Black Diamond Mines Regional
               Preserve rise to meet the skyline. Through streets designed in a north-south
               configuration afford views of the hills. Larger open spaces, such as the Civic
               Center and Stoneman Park, also provide unobstructed views.
               Figure 4-1 illustrates a View shed Analysis on ducted within the Planning
               Area. Using the Arc View program, four “viewpoints” throughout the City
               were selected, and digital elevation modeling used to determine what hills
               and ridgelines were visible from each. Areas visible from all four viewpoints
               include multiple small ridgelines in the southern hills, particularly areas
               southwest of existing development surrounding the Pittsburg/Bay Point
               BART station.
               These southern hills lend Pittsburg residents a sense of identity. Drivers
               recognize the transition into Pittsburg as they crest the ridgeline on State
               Route 4 from Concord. Views of the hills to the south, and Suisun Bay to the
               north create an identifiable entryway for the City. Views from the southern
               hills include vistas of cityscape and Suisun Bay beyond.

               MAJOR AND MINOR RIDGELINES
               In order to define major and minor ridgelines within the City’s southern hills, three
               components were used: structure, elevation, and visibility. The structural component of
               ridgelines is the branching pattern of the ridge system. The major stem of the ridge
               system is considered a major ridgeline, while smaller branches are considered minor
               ridgelines. Elevation also distinguishes major—higher ridgelines, from minor—lower—
               peaks; all ridgelines that are delineated as major or minor are generally 500 feet or higher
               in elevation. Finally, the View shed Analysis described above identifies ridgelines visible
               from several places within the City. This visibility analysis was used to ensure continuity
               among ridges throughout the Planning Area. In Figure 4-2, major and minor ridgelines
               are delineated throughout the southern hills. A thick bar is used to identify major
               ridgelines, while a thin bar is used to identify minor ridgelines. However, the thickness of
               these bars is intended for symbolism only; it is not intended to represent the width of
               ridge protection zones.
               Based on the View shed Analysis, the City’s hillside regulations may be modified as
               needed to balance the City’s goals of maintaining the aesthetic appearance of the
               surrounding hills, encouraging development of upscale housing, ensuring slope
               stabilization, providing access for public safety, developing a cohesive infrastructure
               plan, and implementing a workable traffic and transportation plan.
               URBAN EDGES
               The Suisun Bay waterfront and marshlands constitute the City’s northern boundary, while
               rolling, grassy hills define its southern edge. In the General Plan, new residential
               developments proposed for the southern hills are intended to achieve clustered
               neighborhoods in small valleys and areas of gentler slopes. Residential densities
               gradually decrease as one moves further south into the hills.
               North of State Route 4, the unincorporated community of Bay Point lies at Pittsburg’s
               western edge, while south of State Route 4, the City of Antioch shares Pittsburg’s eastern
               boundary. Major transportation corridors—such as State Route 4 and the BART rail—
               provide access to the City from
4-4

           4-5
PITTSBURG 2020
               the east and the west. Lower density residential neighborhoods fade into the
               hills that separate Pittsburg and Bay Point from the City of Concord. The
               transition between Pittsburg and Antioch is less identifiable—single-family
               residential subdivisions, neighborhood commercial centers, industrial and
               business commercial activities, and urban facilities continue from Pittsburg
               into Antioch.
               GOALS: VIEWS, RIDGES, AND EDGES
               4-G-1 Retain views of major and minor ridgelines within the southern hills,
                        as designated in Figure 4-2.
               4-G-2 Preserve minor ridgelines south of State Route 4 as open space to
                        provide screening for hillside development.
               4-G-3 Ensure that new residential development in the southern hills
                        provides adequate transition between urban and open space uses on
                        the City’s edge.
               .
               POLICIES: VIEWS, RIDGES, AND EDGES
               Views
               4-P-1 Require ridge setbacks for all new hillside development. Building
                        pads should be located at least 150 feet away from the crest of a
                        major ridgeline (measured horizontally from the centerline), as
                        designated in Figure 4-3.
                        Limiting development within the view shed of designated ridgelines
                        will ensure that new development retains significant views of these
                        ridgelines.

               4-P-2 As part of the development review process, require design review of proposed
                     hillside development. Ensure that:
                     •    Hillside development is clustered in small valleys and behind minor
                          ridgelines, to preserve more prominent views of the southern hills.
                     •    Hillside streets are designed to allow open views by limiting the building of
                          structures or planting of tall trees along the southern edge or terminus of
                          streets.
                     Many arterial and collector roadways within the City feature views of rolling,
                     grassy hills. Sensitive layout and design of new and redeveloped sites throughout
                     Pittsburg can retain and enhance views of these tremendous natural features.
               4-P-3 As part of the development review process, limit building heights and massing
                     where views of the hills from adjacent properties and public spaces could be
                     preserved.
                     Limiting the height and massing of new structures to retain views of ridgelines
                     over the tops of rooflines will ensure that the City’s hillside identity is preserved.
                     These building standards should then be used to ensure views before development
                     approval.
               4-P-4 Develop and implement use of a “Design Review Checklist” for all new hillside
                     development, to ensure that conservation and site layout policies within the
                     General Plan are considered.
               Urban Edges
               4-P-5 Design and install entry features at the entrances to the City, implemented
                     through the City’s Capital Improvement Program. Use landscaping, signs,

      lighting, and other visual features to announce the gateway along regional
      roadways.
      Potential gateway points include, but are not limited to: State Route 4, Railroad
      Avenue/Kirker Pass Road, Willow Pass Road, proposed West Leland Road
      extension, Pittsburg-Antioch Highway, and Buchanan Road. Street trees,
      welcome signs, decorative lighting (similar to Railroad Avenue), banners,
      archways, and other streetscape design elements can be used in gateway design.
4-P-6 Ensure that developers of new residential projects in the southern hills plant trees
      and other vegetation along collector and arterial roadways, in order to maintain
      the sense of “rural” open space at the City’s southern boundary.
      Although residential developers should restrict planting of trees and landscaping
      that will block views of the hills from other areas of the City, or views of Suisun
      Bay from hillside streets, vegetation along new roadways will contribute to the
      goal of retaining a sense of open space.
4-P-7 Ensure that design treatment of new development at the City’s southern boundary
      retains a rural feel by:
      •   Discouraging the use of solid walls along these edges (fences must be visually
          permeable; however, discourage use of chain link in front and side yards);
      •   Using materials and design to promote a rural feeling (for example, wooden
          or other rustic materials); and
      •   Encouraging development at the outer edge of the City to face outwards
          toward the rural landscape (preventing a solid wall of residential back yard
          fences).
                                                                                                      4-9

               4.2     HILLSIDE DEVELOPMENT
               The unique setting of the southern hills—with ridges and rolling topography,
               rock outcroppings and mature trees, sensitive habitats, and views—provides
               opportunities for creation of distinctive hillside neighborhoods. General Plan
               policies are designed to ensure that new hillside development is integrated
               into the landscape. All hillside development policies in the General Plan
               apply to land above the 500-foot elevation only.
               GOALS: HILLSIDE DEVELOPMENT
               For policies and discussion related to views of major and minor ridgelines,
               see Section 4.1.
               4-G-4 Encourage development that preserves unique natural features, such
                       as topography, rock outcroppings, mature trees, creeks, and
                       ridgelines, in the design of hillside neighborhoods.
               4-G-5 Encourage a sense of rural character in the design and construction
                       of hillside development, including extensive landscaping, rooftop
                       terraces, sloping rooflines, and use of natural materials.
               POLICIES: HILLSIDE DEVELOPMENT
               Preservation and Grading
               4-P-8 Update the Hillside Planned Development District within the City’s
                       Zoning Ordinance to reflect the hillside development standards and
                       policies set forth within this General Plan.
               4-P-9 Encourage new hillside development to preserve unique natural
                       features by mapping all natural features as part of development
                       applications, including landforms, mature tree stands, rock

                                                                                             4: URBAN DESIGN
       outcroppings, creek ways, and ridgelines. During development and design
       review, ensure that site layout is sensitive to such mapped features.
4-P-10 Minimize grading of the hillsides. Amend the City’s Zoning Ordinance to allow
       density bonuses of 10 percent (maximum) for new hillside development that
       preserves 40 percent of natural hill contours.
       Extensive grading of hillsides has the potential to destroy their irregular character
       and increase risk of geologic and landslide hazards. Encourage developers to
       grade only building pads, and to blend the graded area with adjacent hillside
       properties.
4-P-11 Limit grading of hillside areas over 30 percent slope (see Figure 10-1) to
       elevations less than 900 feet, foothills, knolls, and ridges not classified as major
       or minor ridgelines (see Figure 4-2). During review of development plans, ensure
       that necessary grading respects significant natural features and visually blends
       with adjacent properties.
4-P-12 Encourage terracing in new hillside development to be designed in small
       incremental steps. Extensive flat pad areas should be limited.
4-P-13 Revise the City’s development permitting requirements to include erosion control
       and revegetation programs as part of grading plans for new hillside development.
       Where erosion potential exists, hydro-seeding, silt traps, or other engineering
       solutions may be required. Using revegetation as an erosion control measure also
       contributes to the aesthetic, natural character of a hillside.
4-P-14 Preserve natural creeks and drainage courses as close as possible to their
       natural location and appearance.
                                                                                                        4-11

PITTSBURG 2020
                      “Man-made” streams (manufactured drainage courses designed to
                      simulate natural creeks) draining into natural creeks are preferable to
                      concrete channels for ensuring adequate surface drainage in new
                      hillside development.
               Lot Configuration
               4-P-15 Minimize the visual prominence of hillside development by taking
                      advantage of existing site features for screening, such as tree clusters,
                      depressions in topography, setback hillside plateau areas, and other
                      natural features.
               4-P-16 Allow flag lots with common driveways within hillside
                      neighborhoods, in order to encourage terracing of buildings while
                      minimizing roadway cut-and-fill (see Figure 4-4).
               4-P-17 Encourage clustering of Hillside Low-Density units in the southern
                      hills, with resulting pockets of open space adjacent to major
                      ridgelines and hillside slopes. Allow density bonuses of 10 percent
                      (maximum) for preservation of 60 percent or more of a project’s site
                      area as open space.
                      Clustering new residential development will retain open space within
                      the southern hills. During design review, encourage open space
                      pockets within the most visible hillside slopes.
               4-P-18 Allow flexible (for example, staggered) front and side building
                      setbacks (including zero-lot-line and attached conditions) within
                      clustered hillside residential areas if this allowance will protect an
                      existing slope.

                                                                                 4: URBAN DESIGN
       Flexible setback standards allow more creative design of residential
       sites to preserve natural features and steep slopes (see Figure 4-5).
4-P-19 Encourage lot configuration such that perimeter walls and fences
       along arterial corridors within the southern hills are not needed.
4-P-20 Discourage lot orientation that fronts onto the cross-slope of street
       segments on steep grades.
4-P-21 Encourage single-loaded streets parallel to steep slopes, with
       placement of lots on the uphill side of the street, such that homes front
       down-slope and allow open vistas from the public street.
4-P-22 Discourage placement of lots that allow the rear of homes to be
       exposed to lower elevation views.
Building Character
4-P-23 As part of the City’s Hillside Development Standards, encourage
       architectural design that reflects the undulating forms of the hillside
       setting, such as “breaking” buildings and rooflines into several
       smaller components (see Figure 4-6)
       Designing new residences to follow topography within hillside areas
       both creates safer homes (by distributing structural weight across a
       tiered building pad) and retains view sheds from lower properties (by
       following the hills’ shape, rather than blocking views with taller
       rectangular structures).
4-P-24 Building forms should be “stepped” to conform to site topography.
       Encourage use of rooftop terraces and decks atop lower stories.
                                                                                            4-13

PITTSBURG 2020
                      Discourage construction of decks elevated on poles over sloped areas;
                      they make buildings seem more massive from downhill lots.
               4-P-25 During development review, encourage residential rooflines that are
                      oriented in the same direction as the natural hillside slope.
               4-P-26 Reflect the predominant colors and textures within the surrounding
                      landscape in selection of building materials for hillside development.
                      Roof colors should tend toward darker earth tones, so that they are
                      less visible from adjacent or upslope properties.
                      Preferred building materials include wood siding, exposed wooden
                      structural elements, and natural-colored stucco.
                      Clustering new residential development will retain open space within
                      the southern hills. During design review, encourage open space
                      pockets within the most visible hillside slopes.
               4-P-27 Maximize water conservation, fire resistance, and erosion control in
                      landscape design through use of sturdy, native species. Use irregular
                      planting on graded slopes to achieve a natural appearance.
               Street Layout
               4-P-28 Encourage developers to align and construct streets along natural
                      grades. Minimize visibility of streets from other areas within the City
                      (see Figure 4-7).
               4-P-29 Encourage the construction of split roadways on steep hillsides,
                      where appropriate.

        Split roadways allow the integration of natural features, such as
        mature trees and rock outcroppings, into the street design.
        Additionally, landscaping is increased and medians can be used to
        collect drainage flows.
4-P-30 Ensure that all residential developers provide multi-use trails or
        trailheads connecting to local schools and parks, commercial centers,
        and regional open spaces.
        Because housing will be clustered in hillside areas, the provision of
        trails through remaining open space areas will provide connections to
        employment, shopping, and recreation centers within the City’s
        flatlands.
4-P-31 Provide on-street parking along hillside roads in parking bays where
        topography allows.
4.3     KEY CORRIDORS
The design of several major transportation corridors within the City has a
significant impact on the City’s sense of character. These key corridors—
which include Railroad Avenue, Willow Pass Road, Leland Road, and State
Route 4—are described below, and design improvements are suggested for
each. Design focus is placed on streetscaping, redevelopment opportunities,
and views.
RAILROAD AVENUE
Railroad Avenue is the City’s most important arterial corridor. Historically,
Railroad Avenue was the City’s major railway corridor, used for transporting
coal from the Black Diamond Mines to Suisun Bay’s deep-water ports. As the
City matured and Black Diamond Mines was closed, the railway corridor was
                                                                                         4-15

PITTSBURG 2020
               transformed into the City’s major north-south roadway axis. The Railroad
               Avenue
               corridor also evolved into the City’s destination for commercial activities.
               South of the Downtown core, Railroad Avenue consists of two distinct
               sections:
               1. BNSF Railroad Overpass to State Route 4. North of State Route 4, the
                   east side of Railroad Avenue consists primarily of small, single-family
                   units converted to independent office and commercial uses. The Civic
                   Center, featuring a new steel city hall structure, and City Park, containing
                   several large playing fields, constitute the western side of the corridor.
                   Railroad Avenue then rises over the Southern Pacific railroad tracks and
                   dips under the BNSF railroad tracks. This exchange with the railroad
                   tracks is enhanced with landscaping, a center median, historic
                   streetlamps, and a pedestrian path. It creates the entry into Downtown, the
                   City’s historic commercial core. Downtown design and streetscaping is
                   discussed in detail in Chapter 5: Downtown.
               2. State Route 4 to Buchanan Road. Railroad Avenue, south of State Route
                   4, is lined with small offices, commercial centers (strip malls), parking
                   lots, and fast food restaurants. Set in a mix along the corridor, commercial
                   activities include small-scale structures positioned along the street
                   frontage, and larger scale shopping centers set back behind parking areas.
                   At the southern end of the corridor, single and multi-family subdivisions
                   back up to the street with landscaped sound walls. Recent streetscape
                   improvements have provided center medians with street trees, vines and
                   trellises. The City has also installed historic streetlights along Railroad
                   Avenue, lending a sense of history and identity to the important corridor.
                   A linear park extending along the west side of the corridor from State
                   Route 4 to the Delta De Anza trail contains benches, grassy areas, and
                   large Eucalyptus trees. Underground utilities and wide sidewalks create a
                   peaceful, attractive setting along the heavily-trafficked arterial roadway.

               GOALS AND POLICIES: RAILROAD AVENUE
               Goals: Railroad Avenue
               4-G-6 Create an attractive, walkable corridor, featuring a variety of land
                       uses, along the City’s major north-south arterial.
               4-G-7 Support and encourage redevelopment of aging commercial
                       properties along Railroad Avenue.
               Policies: Railroad Avenue, BNSF Railroad Overpass to State Route 4
               Figure 4-8 illustrates the proposed urban design features along Railroad
               Avenue, from the BNSF railroad overpass to State Route 4.
               Streetscape
               4-P-32 Continue installation and maintenance of street trees, sidewalks, and
                       historic streetlights along Railroad Avenue.
               4-P-33 Pursue the extension of the Railroad Avenue linear park north along
                       the west side of the arterial to City Park.
                       The Railroad Avenue linear park extends north until the roadway
                       narrows at the Railroad Avenue/State Route 4 interchange. Extension
                       of the linear park across the highway would provide residents with an
                       accessible connection to the Civic Center and City Park. However, the
                       City must work with Caltrans on reconstruction of the Railroad
                       Avenue interchange to ensure safe and convenient pedestrian
                       crossing.

Redevelopment Opportunities
4-P-34 Provide incentives (available through Enterprise Zone programs and
        local programs) for demolition and/or reuse of blighted commercial
        properties near the Civic Center.
Policies: Railroad Avenue, State Route 4 to Buchanan Road
Figure 4-9 illustrates the proposed urban design features along Railroad
Avenue, from State Route 4 to Buchanan Road.
Streetscape and Parking
4-P-35 Create a sense of identity along Railroad Avenue by installing street
        amenities fabricated from similar materials and styles as existing
        median trellises.
        Existing steel trellises tie into the historical importance of the City’s
        steel industry. Continuing to install pedestrian furniture, such as
        benches, trash and recycling receptacles, using steel fabrication would
        solidify this aspect of the City’s identity.
4-P-36 Ensure that new development and redevelopment projects along
        Railroad Avenue position new retail and office structures along the
        sidewalk, with parking tucked behind. Consider developing
        architectural guidelines for new development or redevelopment along
        Railroad Avenue.
4-P-37 Ensure that developers plant and maintain a minimum of one tree per
        six parking spaces within Community Commercial parking lots along
        Railroad Avenue.
                                                                                             4-19

       Several existing parking areas along Railroad Avenue are barren of
       vegetation. Most residents perceive a higher “quality of life” when
       green trees cover large paved areas and provide shade.
4-P-38 Develop an entry feature at the intersection of Railroad
       Avenue/Kirker Pass Road and Nortonville Road to welcome residents
       and visitors to the City of Pittsburg.
       Installation of an entry feature, which may include signage, sculpture,
       or landscaping, should be timed before or concurrently with
       construction of new Hillside Low-Density Residential units south of
       existing development.
Redevelopment Opportunities
4-P-39 Encourage rehabilitation and façade improvement of existing
       commercial centers along Railroad Avenue to ensure commercial
       vitality and pedestrian oriented design.
4-P-40 Continue participation with community partners in the Business
       Improvement District program to fund streetscape improvements,
       promotion programs, and special events.
       Business Improvement District (BID) programs are revitalization
       strategies using voluntary assessment districts in older commercial
       areas within the city limits. BIDs address the image of the commercial
       areas by identifying the areas’ market niche and creating a visual
       identity unique to the community. Pittsburg’s BID conducts local
       streetscaping improvements, distributes image brochures, keeps an
       open dialogue with the news media, and hosts festivals.
                                                                                          4-21

PITTSBURG 2020
               4-P-41 Provide incentives to redevelop blighted commercial properties
                      along Railroad Avenue. Encourage developers to provide pedestrian
                      amenities and focus on connections between the street and
                      surrounding properties.
               4-P-42 Work with Contra Costa Water District to clean up Contra Costa
                      Canal, including the removal of litter, and reduction and
                      beautification of fencing.
                      The fencing surrounding Contra Costa Canal at Railroad Avenue is
                      currently an eyesore. Minimizing or replacing existing chain-link with
                      ornamental fencing, and planting vegetation, could provide a much
                      more attractive utility corridor adjacent to the City’s major arterial.
               4-P-43 Pursue private investment in the redevelopment of the Railroad
                      Square shopping center. Consider development of a community or
                      recreational facility on this property.
                      The Railroad Square Shopping Center, near the southern end of the
                      corridor, is a tremendous opportunity for the City. The development
                      of entertainment activities (for example, movie theater, video arcade,
                      laser tag center) within walking distance of several existing
                      residential neighborhoods would support the City’s goal of a
                      pedestrian-oriented arterial corridor.
               4-P-44 Work with BART to develop a pedestrian-oriented mixed-use district
                      in the proposed railroad Avenue BART Station Area. See Section 4.4:
                      Mixed-Use Districts, for further discussion of the proposed Railroad
                      Avenue BART Station Area.

WILLOW PASS ROAD
The two distinct sections of Willow Pass Road are identifiable because of a
railroad underpass/interchange located at Range Road:
1. Beacon Street to Range Road. This stretch of Willow Pass Road contains
     the PG&E transmission corridor, residential motels, service commercial
     and industrial uses. Between the PG&E transmission corridor and Range
     Road, Willow Pass Road is a two-lane rural highway, lacking curbs,
     gutters, and sidewalks.
2. Range Road to Bay Point. At Range Road, Willow Pass Road curves
     under the BNSF Railroad tracks. Autos must then navigate a poorly-
     marked, antiquated interchange to reconnect with the second section of
     Willow Pass Road, which delivers them into the unincorporated
     community of Bay Point. Willow Pass Road, extending west of Range
     Road to Bay Point, is a wide expanse of roadway lined with large
     Eucalyptus trees, industrial facilities, and a landscaped sound wall
     forming the boundary of a contemporary single-family subdivision.
GOALS AND POLICIES: WILLOW PASS ROAD
Goals: Willow Pass Road
4-G-8 Provide more attractive streetscaping along the Willow Pass Road
         corridor.
4-G-9 Encourage private investment and redevelopment of Willow Pass
         Road, east of Range Road.
4-G-10 Redesign Willow Pass Road and railroad interchange to provide
         safer, more desirable pedestrian and bicycle routes.
                                                                                       4-23

               Road, from Beacon Street to Range Road. Figure 4-11 illustrates a proposed
               street layout for this arterial roadway.
               4-P-45 Narrow the section of Willow Pass between Beacon Street and Range
                        Road to one travel lane in each direction, and construct a landscaped
                        center median with left-turn pockets.
                        Narrowing the roadway to one lane in each direction and providing a
                        planted median with left-turn pockets would vastly improve the
                        streetscape, while not significantly affecting traffic levels of service.
                        Figure 4-10 is an example of a proposed street layout for Willow Pass
                        Road; actual design should be based on the City’s adopted street
                        standards.
               4-P-46 Widen sidewalks along the eastern section of the Willow Pass Road
                        corridor, for use by local residents moving between Downtown,
                        adjacent neighborhoods, and industrial employers.
               4-P-47 Maintain a rural feeling along Willow Pass Road west of the entrance
                        to the Harbor Lights subdivision, with two travel lanes and no
                        sidewalks.
               4-P-48 Pursue the design and construction of an interchange/overpass at
                        State Route 4 and Range Road. Work with the California Department
                        of Transportation to design an interchange facility that will
                        accommodate future traffic demands.
               4-P-49 Initiate a tree-planting program along Willow Pass Road. Use a
                        variety of native and locally-recognized trees with low maintenance
                        needs.

        Use of native plant species and locally-recognized non-native species will
        enhance the City’s overall identity. Additionally, these species should have
        low watering and maintenance requirements.
4-P-50 Encourage industrial uses along Willow Pass Road to plant landscaped
        screening for large facilities such as tanks or loading areas.
4-P-51 Actively pursue redevelopment of vacant and underutilized parcels along
        Willow Pass Road with business and service commercial uses.
Policies: Willow Pass Road, Range Road to Bay Point
4-P-52 Rebuild the interchange/underpass between Willow Pass Road, Range Road,

4-P-53 Reconstruct the interchange/underpass between Willow Pass Road, Range
        Road, North Parkside Drive, and the BNSF Railroad tracks to improve
        accessibility, by installing City signage and safety features (for example, stop
        or yield signs).
        Signage, safety features, and landscaping could make the Willow Pass Road
        interchange more attractive and less confusing, until the interchange can be
        rebuilt.
4-P-54 Extend tree planting on Range Road to Willow Pass Road, west of the BNSF
        Railroad underpass.
LELAND ROAD
Leland Road is an arterial corridor that primarily serves to move residential traffic
east-west through the City. It also accommodates spillover east-west traffic from
State Route 4 during peak hours. The three sections of Leland Road include:
                                                                                                    4-27

               1. Century Boulevard to Railroad Avenue. East Leland Road contains a well
                   landscaped center median and marked bicycle lanes. Land uses include
                   neighborhood commercial activities, multi-family housing complexes, and
                   Los Medanos Community College.
               2. Railroad Avenue to Pittsburg/Bay Point BART Station. West Leland Road
                   is fronted primarily by single-family residential units. Nearer to Railroad
                   Avenue, older single-family homes face the roadway with small gardens and
                   porches. However, most of the single-family homes along the corridor back
                   onto the roadway, with aging wooden fences and concrete walls forming the
                   boundary of the public space. The Stoneman Park, Golf Course, and PG&E
                   right-of-way open spaces break up the residential corridor with extensive
                   landscaping and views of the rolling hills. The Oak Hills shopping center also
                   lies adjacent to the Pittsburg/Bay Point BART Station at Bailey Road.
               3. Extension West of Pittsburg/Bay Point BART Station. With approval and
                   construction of the proposed San Marco development project, West Leland
                   Road will be extended west to intersect Willow Pass Road/San Marco
                   Boulevard at State Route 4. The General Plan proposes large multi-unit
                   housing projects, business commercial centers, and a mixed-use commercial

Streetscape
4-P-56 Construct a center median along West Leland Road, with trees and
        landscaping, from Railroad Avenue to the Pittsburg/Bay Point BART Station
        Area, as street right-of-way allows. Provide left-turn pockets for access to
        residential neighborhoods.
        The existing street layout along this stretch of Leland Road could easily
        accommodate a center median; existing lane markers delineate a wide center
        strip with left-turn pockets as needed. Figure 4-12 is an example of a
        proposed street layout for West Leland Road; actual design should be based
        on the City’s adopted street standards
4-P-57 Provide marked, on-street bike lanes along Leland Road, west of Crestview
        Drive.
        Bicyclists often use the West Leland Road corridor for transportation between
        local commercial centers, recreational activities, and residential
        neighborhoods. A designated bike lane, with signage, would create a safer
        environment for bicyclists.
4-P-58 For pedestrian safety and comfort, construct and maintain covered bus
        shelters at transit stops along Leland Road.
        Although the provision of street trees will contribute to a better waiting
        environment for transit riders, covered bus shelters could both heighten
        visibility of local transit programs and ensure safe and comfortable waiting
        areas for local residents.
                                                                                                 4-29

               Policies: Leland Road, Extension west of Pittsburg/Bay Point BART Station
               Figure 4-14 illustrates the urban design features proposed for the section of Leland
               Road extending west from the Pittsburg/Bay Point BART Station.
               4-P-59 Pursue the development of a linear parkway along West Leland Road, west of Bailey
                       Road, linking the Pittsburg/Bay Point BART Station Area to new residential
                       neighborhoods within the southern hills.
                       Extensive landscaping and a multi-use (pedestrian and bicycle) path along West
                       Leland Road will encourage greater use of BART by new residents within the
                       southern hills.
               4-P-60 Work with private developers in the San Marco project to create a pedestrian
                       oriented mixed-use village along West Leland Road at San Marco Boulevard.
                       Encourage buildings to be designed and oriented toward public spaces.
               STATE ROUTE 4
               Views of the southern hills from State Route 4 are afforded to east-bound traffic
               approaching from Concord at the western edge of the Planning Area. Cresting the
               ridgeline, drivers take in a view of the cityscape, Suisun Bay, and rolling hills. Once
               travelers have descended the hill into the City’s flatlands, the highway corridor
               features aging wooden fences and littered shrubs. East of the Pittsburg/Bay Point
               BART Station overpass, new sound walls divide the highway from adjacent
               residential neighborhoods.
               GOALS AND POLICIES: STATE ROUTE 4
               Goals: State Route 4
               4-G-12 Pursue the beautification of the State Route 4 corridor by improving highway
                       landscaping and retaining significant views.

               Views
               4-P-61 Retain views of the southern hills from the State Route 4 corridor, through
                       implementation of ridgeline preservation policies (as described in Section
                       4.1).
               4-P-62 Support local utility providers—such as PG&E—in the undergrounding of
                       utility wires.
                       Views of the southern hills are interrupted by numerous utility wires
                       crossings over State Route 4. The undergrounding of local utility wires would
                       help reduce this distraction and create a more attractive, identifiable view of
                       Pittsburg.
               Streetscape
               4-P-63 During development review, ensure that all development adjacent to State
                       Route 4 provides landscaping along new sound walls. Encourage existing
                       residential areas to improve landscaping along existing fenced areas.
               4-P-64 Work with the California Department of Transportation to implement a
                       uniform landscape theme along the State Route 4 corridor throughout the
                       Planning Area.
                       Potential landscaping includes limiting highway planting to select native trees
                       or identifiable non-native species.
               4-P-65 Work with the California Department of Transportation to incorporate
                       landscaping and signage and to improve views and access to the Pittsburg
                       Civic Center and other destination points—such as the Suisun Bay
                       waterfront—from State Route 4.

4-P-66 Revise the City’s sign regulations to allow larger freestanding signs along State
         Route 4 to identify regional commercial uses. Ensure that such signs are coordinated
         in design and limited in number.
4.4      MIXED-USE AREAS
A mixed-use area provides for an integrated mix of land uses within a distinct area, including
retail, office, service, higher density residential, recreation, and/or transit uses. This General
Plan proposes several mixed-use areas throughout the City: the Pittsburg/Bay Point BART
Station Area; the proposed Railroad Avenue BART Station Area; and the proposed San
Marco Village. Although the City’s Downtown will also be redeveloped into a walkable
mixed-use commercial core, it is discussed within Chapter 5: Downtown.
BART STATION AREAS
Pittsburg/Bay Point BART Station Area
The Pittsburg-Bay Point BART Station presents a unique opportunity to develop high density
housing, commercial, and office uses within walking distance of commuter rail. The location
of the BART Station along State Route 4 provides planning opportunities found in few
locations within the Bay Area. This is an ideal location for intensive uses, both in the Specific
Plan Area and surrounding areas. The Pittsburg/Bay Point BART Station Area Specific Plan
encompasses approximately 295 acres immediately adjacent to and along major access routes
to the BART Station. It includes portions of West Leland, Bailey, and Willow Pass Roads.
Existing land uses in the Specific Plan area include multi-family residential neighborhoods, a
mobile home community, industrial activities, retail commercial uses, vacant properties, and
Ambrose Park. Land Use objectives of the Specific Plan include: encouraging mixed-use
transit-oriented developments; increasing residential densities; enhancing security at the
BART Station; enhancing visibility and usability of Ambrose Park; minimizing travel for
work and shopping trips; and encouraging new commercial development.
                                                                                                              4-35

PITTSBURG 2020
               Railroad Avenue BART Station Area
               The General Plan proposes extension of BART to a new station at Railroad Avenue, east
               of the existing terminus at Bailey Road. However, the City is not certain as to whether
               BART will be extended within the General Plan timeframe, and if so, how the station will
               be configured. It is probable that the station configuration would be similar to that of the
               Pittsburg/Bay Point Station (that is, middle of the highway).
               The proposed Railroad Avenue BART Station facilities (such as ticket vending machines
               and parking) are to be located on the southeast corner of the Railroad Avenue/State Route
               4 interchange. Existing land uses include aging warehouse and light industrial structures.
               Proposed redevelopment activities include intensification of business commercial and
               office uses, development of support retail and restaurant activities, and construction of
               pedestrian and transit-oriented amenities. Redevelopment of the proposed BART Station
               Area could utilize Enterprise Zone incentives available through both State and local
               programs (see Chapter 6: Economic Development).
               SAN MARCO VILLAGE
               Designated along the West Leland corridor, this mixed-use core is intended to be a small,
               pedestrian-oriented, neighborhood commercial center. The currently approved San Marco
               tract map allows a limited number of residential units within the area. However, should
               the development plan be amended or reviewed further for inclusion of a business and/or
               community commercial center (as designated in the General Plan Land Use Diagram),
               the City should work with project proponents to ensure construction of a walkable,
               mixed-use commercial village.

        centers.
4-G-14 Provide permitting and incentives (such as density increases) to
        encourage private (re)development of viable mixed-use structures.
4-G-15 Ensure the provision of public transit and pedestrian amenities within
        the City’s mixed-use areas.
4-G-16 Establish the City’s BART Stations as regional focal points,
        surrounded by a mix of urban activities and services.
POLICIES: MIXED-USE AREAS
Pittsburg/Bay Point BART Station Area
4-P-67 Develop land uses in the BART Station Area according to the
        Pittsburg/Bay Point BART Station Area Specific Plan.
4-P-68 Pursue the development of a Transit Plaza, in cooperation with
        Contra Costa County, BART, Tri-Delta, and County Connection,
        adjacent to the BART Station. Such a Transit Plaza would link rapid
        transit, bus service, and park & ride lots within a walkable, mixed-use
        village.
4-P-69 Encourage all new development within the BART Station Area to
        focus building design, massing, and landscaping toward the
        pedestrian.

                      develop a mixed use, transit-oriented center surrounding the
                      proposed station. Focus redevelopment on higher-end business/office
                      uses, with support retail, restaurant, and residential activities.
               4-P-71 Upon finalization of plans to extend BART to Railroad Avenue, work
                      with BART to develop a Railroad Avenue BART Station Area Specific
                      Plan that addresses:
                          •   Mixed-use structures;
                          •   Building design that focuses on street-orientation;
                          •   Extensive landscaping and street trees;
                          •   Pedestrian furniture (for example, benches and trash cans);
                          •   Street lighting; and
                          •   Signage.
               4-P-72 Encourage       reuse     and     redevelopment      of     the    aging
                      industrial/warehouse structures currently located within the proposed
                      Railroad Avenue BART Station Area, between Garcia Avenue and
                      State Route 4. Amend the City’s Zoning Ordinance to allow
                      commercial intensities of up to 2.5 FAR.
                      Reuse and redevelopment projects in the proposed BART Station
                      Area should focus on providing a safe, attractive, and viable mix of
                      commercial and residential activities within an environment geared
                      toward use of alternative transportation modes (i.e., walking,
                      bicycling, transit). Encourage redevelopment using the State and local
                      incentives available through the Enterprise Zone program.
               4-P-73 Ensure that all new business commercial employers provide safe and
                      convenient pedestrian and bicycle connections to adjacent
                      neighborhoods, the proposed BART Station, Delta De Anza Trail,

       Railroad Avenue Linear Park, and employment and activity centers.
       Clear, convenient linkages between the proposed BART Station area
       and the multi-use paths of Delta De Anza Trail and Railroad Avenue
       Linear Park would provide accessible transportation alternatives for
       local residents.
San Marco Village
4-P-74 Develop a mixed-use village at the intersection of West Leland Road
       and the proposed San Marco Boulevard.
       The Community Commercial designation along West Leland Road is
       intended for the development of a pedestrian and transit-oriented
       commercial district, featuring a mix of retail, service, restaurant,
       office, and residential uses. This mixed-use district should be
       designed at a human-scale, with buildings facing the street and
       encouraging pedestrian traffic (for example, display windows and
       sidewalk cafés).
4-P-75 Encourage West Leland Road to be designed as a pedestrian-friendly
       street, with wide sidewalks, small plazas and benches, signaled
       crosswalks, pedestrian scale building massing, and parking tucked
       behind the buildings.
4-P-76 Pursue the development of a linear parkway along West Leland Road,
       connecting the Pittsburg/Bay Point BART Station Area to San Marco
       Village.
       This linear parkway, originally intended to link the BART Station
       Area with residential neighborhoods in San Marco, would also
       provide a walk able connection between the City’s western activity
       centers (BART Station Area and San Marco Village). This linear
       parkway will also enable residents of the multi-family housing along
                                                                                       4-39

                       West Leland Road to access both activity centers without the use of a
                       car.
               4-P-77 Encourage commercial and high-density residential developers to
                       work together to provide convenient pedestrian paths and access
                       points between San Marco Village and the High-Density residential
                       neighborhoods to the west.
               4-P-78 Allow a mix of retail and service commercial uses in ground floor
                       spaces, and office and high-density residential uses on upper floors.
               4-P-79 Provide pedestrian and transit amenities, such as bike racks, benches,
                       signalized crosswalks, and bus shelters, within the Village setting.
               4.5     NEIGHBORHOOD DESIGN
               NEIGHBORHOOD FORM ANALYSIS
               An evaluation of the urban form characteristics of various neighborhoods
               reveals the changes that took place during Pittsburg’s residential development
               history. This analysis gives the City an opportunity to assess its diverse
               neighborhood patterns. The City can then determine the types of urban form it
               may wish to encourage as Pittsburg continues to grow and evolve.
               •   Central Addition. This neighborhood, bordered by Solari Street to the
                   west and East Fourteenth Street to the south, is intimately connected with
                   Downtown. Like the Downtown neighborhoods, residential construction
                   in Central Addition was complete by 1928. Single-family homes are the
                   dominant housing type.
               •   Pittsburg Heights. The Pittsburg Heights neighborhood is located just
                   west of Railroad Avenue. Originally a military housing project, the
                   neighborhood was redeveloped in 1948. Pittsburg Heights is surrounded

    by newer residential developments, and is bounded to the east by
    commercial establishments.
•   Buchanan. This neighborhood forms the southeastern corner of Pittsburg
    in the Buchanan subarea. It is bounded to the south and east by
    undeveloped hills, and to the north and west by other residential
    neighborhoods. The neighborhood was developed during the construction
    boom that occurred between 1955 and 1975.
•   Oak Hills. The Southwest Hills subarea contains Oak Hills, one of the
    most recent residential developments in the City. A post-1988
    development, this single-family neighborhood is only partially complete.
    It has the advantage of being located southwest of the Pittsburg/Bay Point
    BART station and the Oak Hills Shopping Center.
Comparative Evaluation
Each study area was evaluated according to six components that contribute to
the overall form and character of the neighborhood: number of intersections;
number of through streets; number of access points; area of streets; average
block size (in acres); and typical housing density. The results of the analysis,
discussed below, are presented in Figure 4-15.
•   Overall Development Pattern. The four neighborhoods analyzed represent
    residential development spanning most of this century. Central Addition’s
    development pattern is typical of pre-World War II neighborhoods, with a
    gridded street pattern and densities that are high for single-family
    neighborhoods in Pittsburg. Pittsburg Heights represents housing
    construction that occurred immediately after the War, with a warped grid,
    lower density, and fewer through-streets than Central Addition. The
    transformation of the grid to a suburban style is complete in Buchanan,
    which is characterized by curving streets and cul-de-sacs. This trend is
    continued in Oak Hills, one of the City’s most recent developments.
                                                                                            4-41

• Intersections. The number of intersections is a good indication of a
  neighborhood’s internal level of accessibility. A higher number of
  intersections translates to greater availability of options for travel within
  the neighborhood. Both Central Addition and Pittsburg Heights have a
  greater number of intersections than the two more recent neighborhoods.
  Pittsburg Heights has the highest number of intersections at 20.5 (with T-
  intersections counting as 0.5 intersections). Intersection frequency
  steadily decreases from that point, with Oak Hills at a low of 8.
• Through-Streets. Through-streets provide accessibility by traversing the
  length of a neighborhood, connecting it with other parts of the City. The
  number of through-streets within a residential area is an indication of the
  ease with which one can travel to and from the neighborhood. Through-
  streets are not very frequent in any of the neighborhoods, though Central
  Addition with four through-streets has the greatest level of connectivity
  with adjacent areas. The number of through-streets generally decreases in
  recent, more introverted developments. While Oak Hills, the most recent
  of the neighborhoods analyzed, has one more through-street than
  Buchanan, this street does not pass through the length of the
  neighborhood. Rather, it forms a loop, with both ends terminating at West
  Leland Road.
• Access Points. The number of access points—or streets entering a study
  area that connect with at least one other street—also represents a
  neighborhood’s level of connectivity. Pittsburg Heights has the greatest
  number of access points. However, it is possible to have a large number
  of access points in an inward-looking development if it is composed of
  short streets ending in The intersections. This is the case with
  Buchanan—though it is an introverted neighborhood with only one
  through street and many cul-de-sacs, it nonetheless has the second highest
  number of access points (with 16).

               •  Area of Streets. Streets comprise between 25 and 28 percent of total land
                  area in Central Addition, Pittsburg Heights, and Buchanan. Thus, despite
                  the lower accessibility, Buchanan’s layout does not provide more
                  developable land area than traditional neighborhoods. With streets
                  comprising only 17 percent of land area, Oak Hills has the largest amount
                  of usable land, though at the expense of greater accessibility.
               •  Average Block Size. Average block size is an indicator of the scale of
                  development. In Pittsburg, blocks in older neighborhoods such as Central
                  Addition and Pittsburg Heights average 3 acres, while more recent
                  residential areas have larger blocks averaging 7 acres. This is consistent
                  with analyses of other components of neighborhood form, which reveal a
                  greater degree of accessibility in older neighborhoods because of more
                  intersections and through streets.
               •  Density. Residential densities (defined here as housing units per net acre)
                  in the four study areas do not vary significantly, ranging between six and
                  ten units per net acre. However, density variations do exist elsewhere
                  within the City. For example, the Central Addition neighborhood, with
                  mostly detached housing units, has densities that are 65 percent higher
                  than those achieved in recent attached developments such as Bay Harbor
                  Park.
               GOALS: NEIGHBORHOOD DESIGN
               4-G-17 Encourage development of diverse and distinctive neighborhoods that
                      build on the patterns of the natural landscape and provide a sense of
                      connection with surrounding uses.
               4-G-18 Ensure that neighborhood streets provide safe and attractive
                      connections to local schools, parks, commercial centers, and transit
                      facilities for pedestrians and bicycles.

POLICIES: NEIGHBORHOOD DESIGN
4-P-80 Any subdivision involving more than four units, regardless of the
       number of parcels shall be subject to design review. Prepare a design
       standards checklist and/or residential design guidelines for use
       during review of development projects.
Housing Layout
4-P-81 Encourage neighborhood design—including components such as land
       use, development intensity, and street layout—to be responsive to
       natural and institutional elements, including:
       •   Creeks. Ensure protection of riparian corridors through building
           setbacks. Ensure adequate pedestrian access to creeks, and
           provide connections from local trails and sidewalks. Integrate
           parks and open space areas with creeks.
       •   Urban Edges. Ensure feathering from urban to rural intensities at
           City boundaries.
       •   Adjacent Uses. Promote connections with surrounding land uses
           by integrating street networks and visual/architectural treatments.
4-P-82 Develop and implement development standards in the City’s Zoning
       Ordinance and Subdivision Regulations that minimize the visual
       dominance of garages in residential units.
       Potential strategies that can be considered as part of the City’s design
       standards include:
       •   Limiting the front width of a single-family house that can be
           occupied by a garage to less than one-half of the building width;
                                                                                           4-45

PITTSBURG 2020
                       •   Encouraging the location of garages towards the back of
                           properties;
                       •   Encouraging garages to be setback from the front edge of the
                           house, and allowing for reductions in front yard setbacks;
                       •   Orienting garage doors 90 degrees from the street; and
                       •   Incorporating design elements on the second level above garages
                           (such as bay windows or balconies) to break down the scale of the
                           garage.
               Street Design and Connectivity
               4-P-83 Ensure that new developments provide an integrated pattern of streets
                       and pedestrian paths that provide connections between
                       neighborhoods. As part of the City’s Subdivision Regulations,
                       establish street connectivity requirements.
                       New residential streets, particularly those adjacent to existing
                       neighborhoods, should provide street and pedestrian connections to
                       adjacent areas to enable more efficient movement throughout the
                       City. Single-access neighborhoods should be avoided.
               4-P-84 Use traffic calming measures to reduce speeds in residential areas,
                       rather than limiting through-street connections.
                       Traffic calming measures include:
                       •   Narrowing travel lanes and allowing on-street parking;
                       •   Using different materials at pedestrian crosswalks;
                       •   Planting street trees and other vegetation;

       •   Building corner bulb-outs and intersection round-abouts; and
       •    Installing stop and/or yield signage.
4-P-85 Provide safe and comfortable pedestrian routes through local
       neighborhoods by requiring sidewalks on both sides of residential
       streets, except in hillside areas, by planting street trees adjacent to
       the curb, and by minimizing curb cuts.

5 DOWNTOWN
This element describes the development strategy for the City’s Downtown, and
provides policy framework for streetscape design, waterfront access, historical
resources, and off-street parking.
Downtown Pittsburg, as identified in the General Plan, extends from the Burlington
Northern and Santa Fe (BNSF) railroad tracks in the south to the Sacramento River
Delta waterfront in the north. The eastern and western boundaries of Downtown,
generally defined by Harbor and Beacon streets, are less distinctive. Downtown
stretches about ¾-mile in either direction from Railroad Avenue, encompassing an
area of approximately 350 acres. Streets, utilities, railroads, waterways, and other
rights-of-way account for 104 acres, or about 30 percent of the total land area.

                                                           Originally a way-station during the Gold Rush, Pittsburg supported mining and
                                                           manufacturing industries between the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The City’s
                                                           Downtown developed at the juncture of the Suisun Bay waterfront and rail tracks
                                                           (now Railroad Avenue) that were used to transfer coal from Black Diamond Mines to
                                                           the Bay for shipping. Connection to the water continued to be an important aspect of
                                                           Downtown following the decline in mining, when fishing emerged as the City’s
                                                           industry and canneries flourished in the area. Downtown also provided services to
                                                           soldiers during World War II, when the City developed a war-based economy, with
                                                           as many as 45,000 soldiers stationed at Camp Stoneman. Downtown Pittsburg also
                                                           served as the major retail node in Contra Costa County in the 1940’s and early
                                                           1950’s.
                                                           The departure of soldiers following the Korean War marked the beginning of
                                                           Downtown’s decline. Construction of State Route 4 reduced accessibility from the
                                                           eastern parts of the City to Downtown, and new regional and neighborhood shopping

                                                           sites still remain. Downtown’s “transition” started with the replacement of the old
                                                           cannery buildings with small-craft marinas and several new housing projects.
                                                           Housing redevelopment has since included Marina Heights Apartments in the 1970s,
                                                           Bay Harbor Park (townhomes) and Marina Park (single-family and townhomes) in
                                                           the 1980s, and Village at New York Landing (single-family) in the 1990s. Recent
                                                           revitalization efforts include facade improvements to many buildings in New York
                                                           Landing Historical District (see Section 5.3), and street improvements to Herb White

                                                           Downtown’s population and support for a thriving commercial center.

As of 2000, current and proposed activities include the construction of a linear park
along a former portion of the Sacramento Northern Railroad tracks adjacent to Eighth
Street, and renovation of historic buildings in the core commercial area. Habitat for
Humanity, a non-profit housing organization, is working to provide infill housing in
Downtown through the development of several affordable projects. Some live-work
loft conversions have also taken place, and façade improvements to buildings such as
the old California Theater have also been completed.
ASSETS AND CHALLENGES
Pittsburg lays claim to having one of the oldest Downtowns in Contra Costa County,
and one of the few Downtowns with shoreline access. Downtown Pittsburg has many
vital physical assets, including:
• Waterfront location, adjacent to Brown’s Island Regional Shoreline Preserve;
• Mix of commercial, office, and residential uses;                                     The south side of East Fourth Street demonstrates the
• Historical character, many buildings with ornate architectural features;             City’s unique historical character.
• Pedestrian-scale in building design, wide sidewalks, and small plazas; and
• Traditional urban street pattern, with parking tucked behind the buildings.
Thus, from a physical vantage, Downtown already possesses a structure that could
help realize a vital, mixed-use, and walkable center. In addition, Downtown’s
waterfront location can potentially provide a unique ambiance. However, major
challenges remain:
• Several sites in Downtown are vacant, and many buildings are unoccupied and in
     need of exterior modifications;
• A critical mass of activity (diverse retail, service and entertainment uses within a
     small core area) is needed to draw new businesses and residents seeking an urban
     lifestyle;
• There are few physical and visual connections to the water, with residential and
     industrial uses dominating shoreline areas ideal for commercial uses and public
     access; and
                                                                                                                                             5-3

PITTSBURG 2020
               • Housing, population, and employment estimates are low for a district intended to
                   serve as the City’s historic and symbolic core.
               Downtown revitalization is an issue of citywide importance. A vital Downtown can
               provide identity and a sense of place for all of Pittsburg.
               5.2        DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY
               This element envisions Downtown as a mixed-use center, with specialty retail,
               restaurants, service uses, and professional offices integrated with residential uses.
               Downtown Pittsburg should serve as both a visitor destination and a neighborhood
               commercial center. Economic development that attracts heavy pedestrian activity—
               such as gift stores, clothing boutiques, restaurants and cafes, galleries, professional
               offices, personal services, bookstores and coffee shops—is encouraged.
               Downtown’s unique characteristics—historic buildings, marina, and open space
               improvements—can make it a destination point, but it must be sustained by a critical
               mass of vital activity. Its waterfront location and marine recreation opportunities can
               draw visitors from the region, while Downtown’s commercial storefronts can provide
               them with supplies, eating establishments, and activities for a day away from home.
               A mixed-use neighborhood center should provide businesses, institutions, and
               services meeting the daily needs of nearby residents, including convenience-oriented
               retail establishments (for example, grocery and drug stores) and neighborhood service
               uses (for example, video stores, dry cleaners, and professional services).
               DOWNTOWN SUB-AREAS
               The General Plan identifies five planning sub-areas within the Downtown. Each sub-
               area has its own set of land use strategies and development policies.
               • Commercial Core. Bound by Third Street, Cumberland Street, Tenth Street, and
                   Black Diamond Street, this area is the historical activity center of the City. The
                   Commercial Core area is intended to be a walkable, mixed-use district. Therefore,
                   drive-thru restaurants, auto repair shops, and other car-oriented uses would not be
                   appropriate. Additionally, heavy industrial uses would detract from the friendly,
                   pedestrian-focused identity preferred for the Downtown.

• East Tenth Street Corridor. Extending along East Tenth Street from Railroad
    Avenue to Harbor Street, north to Eighth Street, this area serves as the
    Downtown’s service commercial node. Service, repair, and large retail (for
    example, furniture stores or contractors’ supplies) commercial activities are
    anticipated.
• Marine Commercial Center. Comprised of several large parcels at the terminus
    of Harbor Street, this area is designated for a marine/waterfront commercial
    village. The proposed village may feature marine-oriented repair and sales,
    restaurants, professional offices, industrial incubators (such as research and
    development), and specialty retail activities.
• Marina/Waterfront Neighborhoods. A majority of the residential neighborhoods
    north of Eighth Street have been redeveloped within the last several years, and
    provide a vibrant population to support retail activity within Downtown.
• West Tenth Street Neighborhoods. The aging residential neighborhoods south of
    West Eighth Street (between Railroad Avenue and Beacon Street) are proposed
    for redevelopment and rehabilitation to provide a more dense housing stock
    within the walkable Downtown area.
Figure 5-1 illustrates the planning sub-areas and land use distribution envisioned in
this Plan. The uses described in Table 5-1 are representational of the types of uses to
be allowed by the Zoning Ordinance; the use categories are based on North American
Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Listings, published in 1998. Suggested
development standards—which include residential densities, Floor Area Ratios
(FARs), maximum building heights, and setback requirements—for sub-areas within
Downtown Pittsburg are shown in Table 5-2.

DOWNTOWN BUILDOUT
Buildout of General Plan land use designations would result in a total of 2,640
housing units in the Downtown area. The estimated Downtown population at General
Plan buildout is 7,776, an increase of more than 45% over its population in the year
2000. Redevelopment, reuse, and intensification of the southwestern portion of
Downtown will contribute to the increased population base within Downtown
neighborhoods. Mixed-use residential development adjacent to commercial and office
uses in the core will contribute additional housing units and population. The buildout
of commercial uses, particularly the development of a Marine Commercial center,
will result in approximately 8,488 jobs within the Downtown core. Table 5-3 shows
population and employment estimates for the Downtown.

               ENTERPRISE ZONE OPPORTUNITIES
               Identified as both an Economic Opportunity area within this General Plan and an
               Enterprise Zone by the State of California, the Downtown core has tremendous
               opportunity for redevelopment. The State’s Enterprise Zone Program targets
               “economically distressed areas,” providing incentives to encourage business
               investment and promote the creation of new jobs through State tax credits. Local
               incentives include fast-track permitting, fee waivers or reductions, on-the-job
               training, and business start-up loans.
               The 1,400-acre Enterprise Zone in Pittsburg not only includes the Downtown core
               and the new Marine Commercial center, but also includes East Tenth Street and the
               commercial and industrial areas between State Route 4 and East Leland Road. (For
               further discussion and mapping of Pittsburg’s Enterprise Zone, see Chapter 6:
               Economic Development.) The inclusion of the Downtown commercial core and
               Marine Commercial center within this Enterprise Zone will provide further impetus
               for businesses and developers to rehabilitate structures within the City’s historic
               center. However, it must be noted that the redesignation of any commercial or
               industrial properties to residential uses within the Enterprise Zone would fail to take
               advantage of program incentives.
               GOALS: DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY
               5-G-1 Promote Downtown as the City’s symbolic center, with a mix of residential
                       and commercial uses in a walkable, pedestrian-oriented district.
               5-G-2 Promote the development and intensification of the Downtown commercial
                       core as both a visitor destination and a neighborhood retail center.
                       Encourage a critical mass of visitor-oriented retail businesses, such as gift
                       shops and galleries, as well as neighborhood retail and personal services.
               5-G-3 Encourage a variety of land uses and mixed-use developments at appropriate
                       locations within the Downtown.
               5-G-4 Establish a Downtown population goal of at least 7,000 to provide vitality
                       and support a vibrant neighborhood commercial center.

POLICIES: DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY
5-P-1  Emphasize Downtown as Pittsburg’s historic center, providing an identity
       and a sense of place for the entire city by establishing a focused
       revitalization strategy that integrates the initiatives of the Economic
       Development Strategy.
       A revitalization strategy for Downtown should incorporate the relevant
       initiatives proposed by the Economic Development Strategy, including:
        • Monitoring of land use and development trends in Downtown to ensure
            a sufficient supply of land of appropriate designation and development
            intensity;
        • Establishment of a retail and consumer services strategy to attract retail
            and service sector business to key locations in Downtown;
        • Establishment of criteria for land assembly in Downtown for the
            purposes of redevelopment and revitalization;
        • Consideration of the feasibility of a convention or performing arts
            center, amphitheater, or other public cultural amenity in or linked to the
            Downtown;
        • Facilitation of additional attractions and events that bring both residents
            and visitors to the Downtown; and
        • Preservation and enhancement of historic structures contributing to the
            unique character of the Downtown.
5-P-2  Ensure coordination between the Pittsburg Redevelopment Agency,
       Planning and Building, Engineering, and Economic Development
       Departments in order to achieve the goals and policies envisioned for
       Downtown.

        Increased cultural activities, such as City festivals, will contribute to a vibrant
        Downtown that serves as a multi-purpose destination point for residents and
        visitors.
5-P-6   Encourage property-owners in the Commercial Core to utilize ground-level
        storefronts for retail and pedestrian-oriented commercial activities (for
        example, restaurants, boutiques, and personal services).
East Tenth Street Corridor
5-P-7   Limit commercial uses along the southern side of East Tenth Street to
        Service Commercial businesses – including repair and maintenance, retail
        sales, special trade contracting and other uses.
        East Tenth Street has historically been developed with service commercial uses.
        With its location backing onto the BNSF Railway corridor, East Tenth Street         The Johns Manville property located on East Third Street is
        remains an effective place for the continuance of such uses.                        the side of a historically heavy industrial use in the Marine
                                                                                            Commercial Center subarea of the Downtown.
5-P-8   Permit mixed-use projects with service commercial uses on street frontage
        along the northern side of East Tenth, to provide a transition to Downtown
        residential areas.
        Mixed-use development—service commercial, office and residential—provides
        a transition area between the heavy service uses to the south and residential
        neighborhoods to the north.
5-P-9   Pursue the development of a community/public use in the large vacant lot
        facing East Tenth, adjacent to the brick Adventist Church.
5-P-10 Discourage the establishment of religious centers within 1,000 feet of one
        another.
5-P-11 Improve streetscaping along East Tenth Street with a landscaped median,
        wide sidewalks, pedestrian amenities (for example, benches and
        trash/recycling receptacles), and street trees.

               Marine Commercial Center
               5-P-12 Undertake active efforts, including land acquisition and assembly, to
                       develop a waterfront activity center at the terminus of Harbor Street,
                       featuring a cluster of Marine Commercial uses, including specialty retail,
                       services, restaurants, marine repair and docking facilities, hotels and other
                       uses.
               5-P-13 Develop a detailed design plan for the City’s new Marine Commercial
                       center, featuring:
                       • Mixed-use village atmosphere;
                       • Walkable layout, with pedestrian amenities;
                       • Public access to the shoreline and views of Browns Island; and
                       • Focus on visitor attractions, as well as traditional marine services.
                       The planned development of the City’s new Marine Commercial center will
                       ensure the cohesive design of a pedestrian-oriented commercial village.
                       Additionally, it will allow the City to work with property-owners in the joint-
                       planning of public open space and waterfront access areas.
               5-P-14 Acquire land at the terminus of Harbor Street for the development of a
                       public park and promenade, providing access to the waterfront and open
                       space at the center of the new Marine Commercial center.
               5-P-15 Encourage redevelopment of the Johns Manville property (designated
                       Marine Commercial). Allow existing Industrial uses to operate until
                       redevelopment occurs (including rebuild, if damaged or destroyed).
                       The Johns Manville site is currently used and valued as a heavy industrial
                       activity directly adjacent to Downtown. Future redevelopment activities within
                       Downtown and construction of a Marine Commercial Center directly across
                       Third Street may create land use conflicts.

Marina/Waterfront Neighborhoods
5-P-16 Support the continued maintenance of redeveloped neighborhoods within
        Downtown.
        Recently redeveloped neighborhoods in the Downtown are a sign of
        reinvestment within the core area. These neighborhoods must be maintained to
        ensure continued redevelopment in surrounding areas.
5-P-17 Pursue the dedication of public open space during the redevelopment of
        infill sites within the Downtown, particularly adjacent to the waterfront
        area.
        The provision of numerous open space areas within the Downtown would
        promote it as a destination for day-trips, featuring such activities as shopping
        and picnicking along the waterfront.
West Tenth Street Neighborhoods                                                          Like other Marina/Waterfront Neighborhoods, the Marina
                                                                                         Park subdivision in Downtown provides residents with pri-
                                                                                         vate waterfront views.
5-P-18 Encourage public acquisition and/or private assembly of neighborhood
        blocks surrounding West Tenth Street for redevelopment to higher density
        housing, including rebuilding of the existing affordable housing stock.
        Although the older residential areas south of Eighth Street provide denser
        housing within the historic grid street pattern, the condition of housing and
        infrastructure in these neighborhoods is generally poor. The provision of high-
        density housing would both redevelop the aging neighborhood and offer
        expanded housing opportunities.
5-P-19 Encourage high-density residential development in Downtown
        neighborhoods, according to the density standards in Table 5-1. Ensure that
        the development program for the West Tenth Street Neighborhoods provides
        for at least 755 housing units, which is the minimum total of units that can
        be built under densities designated by this General Plan.
        Recently constructed residential neighborhoods in the Downtown area have
                                                                                                                                               5-13
PITTSBURG 2020
                      lower densities and introverted street networks. Higher-density housing within
                      the Downtown will contribute to a larger population base and active Downtown
                      streetscape.
               5-P-20 Encourage the development of small-lot single family (SLSF) parcels in
                      Medium Density areas of the West Tenth Street Neighborhoods and
                      Downtown Core. Provide flexible SLSF development standards in the City’s
                      Zoning Ordinance.
                      Construction of SLSF units provides single-family detached homes at
                      affordable housing costs. Reduction of land costs in zero lot-line and small-lot
                      development can provide reasonably-priced housing units with enough rooms
                      for large families.
               5-P-21 Pursue acquisition and development of a new park site, as designated in
                      Figure 5-1. Provide a variety of recreational facilities to serve residents of
                      surrounding neighborhoods.
               5-P-22 During development review, ensure that transitional buffer areas—such as
                      landscaped berms, parking lots, and storage areas—are placed between
                      new residential units and the BNSF railroad tracks along the southern edge
                      of the West Tenth Street Neighborhoods.
               5-P-23 Limit multi-family development in the West Tenth Street neighborhoods to
                      sites more than two acres, and/or sites which encompass all High Density
                      designated land in a given City block. Require all new multi-family
                      residential projects to have a minimum of 20 units, unless the High Density
                      designated land in a given City block is not adequate in size to support that
                      number of units, or unless the City determines that less units, sized to
                      accommodate large family households, better serves the public interest. In
                      such cases, there shall be no less than 16 units within a project.
                      For new multi-family residential projects intended to replace existing units,
                      the developer should acquire enough adjacent parcels to fulfill the minimum
                      30-unit requirement, at a density that is appropriate for the specific location
                      and land use designation.

5-P-24 Improve streetscaping along West Tenth Street with a landscaped median,
           wide sidewalks, pedestrian amenities (for example, benches and
           trash/recycling receptacles), and street trees.
5.3         DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT
Downtown occupies a prominent waterfront location in the City, with good access
from the surrounding neighborhoods and State Route 4. It has a well-defined street
grid with a clear circulation pattern. Buildings front both Railroad Avenue and East
Tenth Street, and a diversity of architectural styles are represented. Downtown is also
undergoing transition and change. Façade renovations have been completed on many
of the historic buildings, and residential development is being constructed.
Downtown’s urban design quality is affected by several components, including
landmarks and views, streetscape, building massing and design, linkages and barriers,
and historical resources. The following sections discuss each component as it relates
to Downtown’s physical character.
LANDMARKS AND VIEWS
Possibly the most noticeable landmark signaling one’s arrival in Pittsburg is neither
within Downtown nor City proper, but in the unincorporated area west of Downtown.
The power plant built by PG&E in the mid-1950’s (now owned by Mirant), with its
450-foot tall smokestacks, is located on the bank of the Suisun Bay near Riverview
Park. From State Route 4, the northerly view of the City is dominated by the structure
as it rises above the horizon. The power plant is a highly visible backdrop to
Downtown, and can be seen from many locations throughout the City.
Railroad Avenue offers views on either end of the street, though a slight offset at
Fifth Street interrupts the visual continuity. Visible from below the curve are the open
hills to the south. An art deco building and Steel Worker statue to the north of the
bend give it the appearance of being the northern terminus. North of the offset,
however, another statue (Fisherman) lies at the real terminus of Railroad Avenue at
                                                                                                  5-15

PITTSBURG 2020
               Third Street. The waterfront lies just beyond the end of Railroad Avenue, and the
               public plaza where the Fisherman statue stands invites the possibility of redesign and
               expansion to allow direct access to the shoreline.
               STREETSCAPE
               Although Downtown Pittsburg was developed in a traditional grid street network,
               several recent residential developments have replaced the grid with introverted,
               curvilinear neighborhood systems. Street trees and landscaping are generally sparse
               in Downtown, except on certain blocks of Railroad Avenue and in Bay Harbor Park,
               located north of Third Street. Buildings in the Commercial Core vary between one
               and two stories in height. Older housing units consist of one-story bungalows and
               some multi-family dwellings, while more recent developments are generally two-
               story single-family structures and townhouses.
               A number of small plazas are scattered throughout the commercial core. They are
               similar in design, and contain bronze statues or sculptures representing various
               aspects of the City’s history. These plazas are located at:
               • Heritage Plaza;
               • The terminus of Railroad Avenue at Third Street;
               • The northeastern corner of the Railroad Avenue/Fifth Street bend; and
               • The intersection of Marina Boulevard and Black Diamond Street (two plazas
                   diagonally facing each other).
               Central Harbor Park and a landscaped pathway connecting Railroad Avenue to a
               parking lot located between Third and Fourth streets are of the same design as the
               plazas. Together, these open spaces afford a greater sense of identity and character to
               Downtown.

                                                                                          5: DOWNTOWN
BUILDING DESIGN
The most distinctive buildings in Downtown are those that make up the New York
Landing Historical District, located in the northern end of the Commercial Core (see
Figure 5-2: New York Landing Historical District). This district was established by
the City to ensure the preservation of structures of historical value. Structures within
the district generally appear as simple, rectilinear buildings set along the streetfront.
Architectural details include cornices, belt courses, and decorative window heads.
Large display windows are common to buildings in this area. Structures in newer,
adjacent commercial areas are simpler in design, with less attention paid to
ornamental details. Residential and commercial buildings are generally in better
condition in the northern portion of Downtown. The redevelopment of businesses at
the southern end of the Commercial Core should extend the sense of the historical
core area by utilizing similar architectural detailing and display as found in the
northern end.
LINKAGES AND BARRIERS
Two major design issues—linkages and barriers within Downtown—must be
addressed to create a more accessible Downtown for both visitors and residents:
• Connection to the Waterfront. The linkage between Downtown and the waterfront
    could be improved, both visually and physically. The two waterfront parks—
    Riverview and Central Harbor—are hidden from view and have limited
    pedestrian access from Railroad Avenue. However, signage improvements, linear
    park linkages, and expanded public access points can create a more unified
    waterfront identity.
• Barriers within Downtown. The BNSF railroad tracks represent both a visual and
    physical barrier to Downtown. Railroad Avenue crosses the BNSF tracks in a
    long overpass that isolates Downtown from southern portions of the City. The
    significance of this barrier has resulted in the tracks being identified as the
    southern edge of Downtown. However, gateway improvements and “way-
    finding” signage leading to Downtown can significantly improve the perception
    of Downtown as a separate, unique district.
                                                                                                   5-17

PITTSBURG 2020
               TRANSITIONS AND BUFFERING
               Buffering and transition is an important issue, especially at the eastern end of
               Downtown, where residential uses come into contact with heavy industrial uses.
               Streetscape improvements and buffering areas are needed to soften abrupt changes
               from one use to another. Buffering areas that allow transitioning between conflicting
               uses may include landscaped berms, parking lots and storage areas, and greenway
               corridors.
               HISTORICAL RESOURCES
               California’s Office of Historical Resources inventories buildings, structures, and
               objects determined to have some historical value. Historical resources found
               throughout the City are described in Chapter 9: Resource Conservation. To recognize
               and preserve the unique historical resources in Pittsburg, the City established the New
               York Landing Historical District in 1981. Buildings in the Historical District were
               constructed between 1914 and 1930, and reflect the architectural styles prevalent
               during that time period. Some structures, while not considered significant in and of
               themselves, enhance the overall character of the district. Figure 5-2 shows resources
               in the New York landing Historical District.
               GOALS: DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT
               5-G-5 Improve streetscapes within the Downtown, including:
                         • Clearing public views of the waterfront and southern hills;
                         • Providing pedestrian amenities;
                         • Strengthening transitions between land uses; and
                         • Increasing landscaping and planting more street trees.
               5-G-6 Provide increased pedestrian connections to and vistas of the Suisun
                       Bay/New York Slough waterfront.

               Streetscape and Architecture
               5-P-25 Continue streetscape beautification efforts within the Downtown, focusing on improving the
                       visual connection between the Commercial Core and the waterfront.
               5-P-26 Encourage the repetition of key historical architectural features—such as windows and
                       displays, cornice details, and roofline/pitch elements—in the redevelopment of commercial
                       structures in Downtown.
               5-P-27 Continue the preservation, rehabilitation, and reuse of historically significant structures
                       within the Downtown (as designated in Figure 5-2).
               5-P-28 Ensure that new construction and remodeling throughout Downtown (including the New
                       York Landing Historical District) are reviewed for design compatibility by the Planning
                       Commission.
               5-P-29 Encourage property-owners of vacant Downtown structures to allow window box displays
                       created by the Historical Society, rather than boarded-up glass storefronts.
               5-P-30 Design and implement a gateway project at the Railroad Avenue underpass between Central
                       Avenue and Tenth Street, providing an identifiable gateway into the Downtown.
                       The construction of a design feature at the Railroad Avenue underpass will provide a distinct
                       entry to the City’s Downtown. A design competition to decide what sort of landmark design
                       feature should be constructed will

                        encourage interest in Downtown redevelopment and potentially spur private
                        investment.
               5-P-31 Develop a “way-finding” system for Downtown Pittsburg. Install uniform
                        signage and banners informing visitors of major attractions, including
                        directions to Downtown from State Route 4 and to the waterfront from
                        Downtown.
                        Another method to establishing a distinct identity for Downtown areas is
                        developing a way-finding system. Uniform signage directing visitors and
                        residents to and throughout the Downtown marks the core area as a special
                        destination.

                        projects adjacent to the industrial uses east of Downtown. Such buffers may
                        include a combination of landscaped berms, parking areas, pedestrian
                        walkways, and storage facilities.
               5-P-33 During redevelopment of the West Tenth Street Neighborhoods, require that
                        the grid street network and pedestrian connections are maintained.
               Railroad Avenue
               5-P-34 During redevelopment of commercial properties along Railroad Avenue,
                        pursue widening of sidewalks north of Eighth Street, as site configuration
                        allows. Allow and encourage outdoor seating and services adjacent to
                        restaurants and other food/beverage sales.
               5-P-35 Retain existing pedestrian-scale lampposts and amenities along sidewalks
                        within Downtown.
               5-P-36 Plant and maintain a double row of trees on either side of Railroad Avenue,
                        extending south to State Route 4.
               5-P-37 Develop standards for placement of pedestrian amenities along sidewalks
                        on Railroad Avenue.

                                                                                                                                    5: DOWNTOWN
        Examples of amenity standards include: benches mid-way down each block;
        bike racks adjacent to major intersections; and planter boxes, newspaper racks,
        and trash/recycling bins at regular intervals.
5-P-38 Encourage developers to orient exterior design elements of Commercial
        Core structures toward pedestrians (for example, large display windows on
        street frontage, weather coverings over entryways), and extend the
        historical flavor of architectural features within the New York Landing
        Historical District to the intersection of Railroad Avenue and Tenth Street.
Open Space and Waterfront Access
5-P-39 Pursue acquisition of the Railroad Avenue terminus by transferring existing
        private recreation facilities due west of the adjacent Medium Density
        Residential neighborhood. Redesign the public plaza to ensure that both
        visual and physical access from Downtown is achieved.
        The residential development at the terminus of Railroad Avenue provides a
        landscaped buffer and recreational area between the street frontage and the
        adjacent small-craft harbor. The redesign and reconstruction of this terminus
        area to allow public access to the marina would significantly improve the City’s
        desired connection between the waterfront and the Downtown core.
5-P-40 Encourage design of the Harbor Street terminus to provide an unobstructed
        view of New York Slough and a 30-foot wide promenade to the waterfront.
        This linear park/promenade should function as a public square, with              Pittsburg’s downtown waterfront marina (sign reads
        buildings oriented toward it and pedestrian amenities leading from East          “Pittsburg Yacht Club”) is an important ecological and
        Third Street to the shoreline.                                                   recreational resource.
        The proposed redevelopment of the Harbor Street terminus will provide the
        City with a tremendous opportunity to enhance visual connections with the
        waterfront area. A well-designed marine commercial development could
        capitalize on the provision of public access to the shoreline.
5-P-41 Improve the pedestrian path along Marina Boulevard, connecting the
        Downtown core to the waterfront/marina area. Provide a wide path right-
                                                                                                                                                5-23

                          lighting.
                          The expansion and development of linear park features along Marina Boulevard
                          would increase the Downtown’s connection with the waterfront/marina area,
                          thereby further contributing to the City’s shoreline identity.
               5.4         ACCESS AND PARKING
               Railroad Avenue serves as the primary access route linking the marina and waterfront
               areas, Downtown Commercial Core, State Route 4, and southern Pittsburg. Most
               streets in Downtown support two-way traffic.
               Downtown Pittsburg was developed in a traditional grid-iron street system, with
               fairly uniform blocks and 9-foot wide sidewalks. The widest streets in Downtown
               include Marina Boulevard, Railroad Avenue, Tenth Street, and Third Street. The new
               Marina Walk development maintains this grid street network. However, four large
               residential developments—Marina Heights, Marina Park, Bay Harbor Park, and
               Village at New York Landing—have replaced the original grid with inward-looking,
               curvilinear street systems with few access points.
               GOALS: ACCESS AND PARKING
               5-G-8 Provide sufficient parking opportunities to support a vibrant Downtown
                        Commercial Core.
               5-G-9 Encourage redevelopment projects to reinforce a walkable grid street layout,
                        integrated with the existing grid network.

POLICIES: ACCESS AND PARKING
Street Network and Parking
5-P-42 Ensure that new Downtown residential projects preserve and continue the
         traditional grid street network. Consider extension of the grid street
         network east of Downtown as existing industrial uses are redeveloped.
         The extension of the grid street network will reinforce the City’s inter-
         connected, walkable urban core.
5-P-43 Provide public parking lots within Downtown, and limit private, single-user
         parking areas. However, ensure the provision of off-street parking facilities
         in periphery Downtown areas to encourage pedestrian movement.
         Parking should be convenient and accessible in order to encourage the
         Downtown as a shopping area.
5-P-44 Reduce off-street parking requirements within High Density Residential
         neighborhoods of the Downtown to one space per housing unit. Allow
         further reductions in parking requirements for new residential projects that
         provide transit-friendly design features.
         Transit-supportive design features include new transit stops/shelters within the
         development plan, pedestrian paths and associated signage to nearby transit
         stops, and bicycle storage facilities.
5-P-45 Consider making all one-way streets two-way by eliminating on-street
         parking, if necessary.
         Two-way streets create a better “urban” character within small-city Downtowns
         by encouraging business development through ease of access.
5-P-46 Investigate use of diagonal on-street parking spaces on Downtown commer-
         cial streets.
                                                                                                   5-25

PITTSBURG 2020
                        Diagonal striping provides additional, easy-to-access on-street parking for
                        commercial areas and narrows the travel lanes to encourage slower-moving
                        traffic.
               Bicycle and Pedestrian Circulation
               5-P-47 Continue to install and maintain crosswalks and landscaped curb
                        extensions at heavily-used intersections within the Downtown.
                        Curb extensions used as traffic calming devices should be designed to be bi-
                        cycle-friendly.
               5-P-48 Design sidewalks in the Downtown Commercial Core that allow for the free
                        flow of pedestrians, and include conveniently located rest areas with shade
                        and seating.
               5-P-49 Develop a bikeway along the Downtown waterfront from Central Harbor
                        Park to the proposed Marine Commercial Center, adjacent to the proposed
                        Marina Boulevard pedestrian path.
               5-P-50 Develop a bikeway connecting the Downtown and waterfront areas to the
                        Civic Center area along Railroad Avenue.
               5-P-51 Create pedestrian and bike path linkages between existing Downtown parks.

6 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
This element provides a policy framework for ensuring Pittsburg’s long-term
economic competitiveness in the region. This element reflects business trends and
available resources, and outlines the City’s economic development objectives to
ensure that economic decision-making is integrated with other aspects of the City’s
development.

PITTSBURG 2020
               6.1     OPPORTUNITIES AND OBJECTIVES
               Pittsburg stands to benefit tremendously in the coming years from improvements
               in regional accessibility brought about by the recent extension of BART to the
               Pittsburg/Bay Point station, potential further extension to Railroad Avenue, and
               the ongoing widening of State Route 4. Since Eastern Contra Costa County is
               expected to account for about half of Contra Costa County’s population increase
               over the next 20 years, Pittsburg will also gain from the economic benefits that
               accompany population and employment growth. As with many other communities
               along the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers, Pittsburg continues its transition
               from an economy historically-based in heavy industry and manufacturing to one
               based on residential service activities—a transition brought about only recently by
               employment and housing trends. Since residential development brings only
               limited economic benefits, Pittsburg must seek ways to enhance revenues from a
               more diverse commercial and industrial job base. In 1997 and 1999, the City
               completed an Economic Vitality Report Card that included a comprehensive
               evaluation of economic development issues and opportunities in Pittsburg.
               Business outreach and market analysis surveys were conducted in 1997, 1999,
               and 2000. The results of these studies provide much of the basis for the policies
               comprising this element of the General Plan.
               ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES
               The overall economic development objectives for Pittsburg include:
               •   Linking land use, transportation, infrastructure, and employment growth with
                   economic development;
               •   Promoting business attraction (business park/large office users), retention
                   (manufacturing base), and expansion (retail sector);
               •   Encouraging employment growth to improve the jobs/housing balance;
               •   Promoting Downtown and waterfront revitalization; and
               •   Encouraging both neighborhood- and regional-scale commercial development.

6.2     ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND THE CITY’S ROLE
Pittsburg’s transportation improvements, expected major population growth, and
transitioning economy can result in significant benefits to the City over the life of
this General Plan. While most economic development activity occurs in the
private sector, the City has a significant role to play in ensuring these trends are
carefully directed and the resulting benefits are maximized. Specifically, the City
must:
•   Ensure that City policies do not impede the needs of businesses to move or
    expand;
•   Facilitate and act as a catalyst for development in strategic market segments;
•   Coordinate and provide for infrastructure improvements; and
•   Generate economic development revenue to support City activities.
A coordinated economic development strategy is also essential for supporting the
City’s community development objectives, such as enhanced community
character, ridgeline preservation, and increased linkages within the City. Such a
strategy should include a managed program of fiscal development, strategic
public improvements, and a balanced approach to land use. This element
envisions two central roles for the City:
1. Promoting development that results in fiscal benefits to the City. The relative
    benefit or burden of various land uses on the City’s General Fund is important
    in considering how future development in Pittsburg should be prioritized.
    Promoting the construction of revenue-generating uses (non-residential uses
    that generate sales and property tax monies), as well as ensuring that each new
    residential development pays its fair share of the costs to provide public
    services, provides the City with a more diverse fiscal base.
2. Maintaining a land use balance. Maintaining a balanced supply of different
    land uses is also critical to the City’s financial health. This balance is
    necessary to attract businesses seeking quality housing opportunities and retail
                                                                                                          6-3

PITTSBURG 2020
                   services, in addition to ensuring that existing transportation capacity can be
                   used more effectively. See Chapter 2: Land Use for policy direction regarding
                   land use distribution.
               ENTERPRISE ZONE
               The California Trade and Commerce Agency (TCA) runs an Enterprise Zone
               program geared toward economically distressed areas throughout the State. The
               purpose of the program is to provide tax incentives to businesses and allow
               private sector market forces to revive the local economy. Pittsburg’s Enterprise
               Zone spans approximately 1,400-acres, including and adjacent to major portions
               of Downtown. The proposed Railroad Avenue BART Station area, business
               commercial acreage between State Route 4 and East Leland Road, and regional
               commercial sites at the eastern edge of town are all included within the Enterprise
               Zone (see Figure 6-1). The availability of deep-water port facilities and rail spurs
               in the City are listed by the State TCA as special advantages of the Pittsburg
               Enterprise Zone. State incentives geared toward the creation of new jobs include:
               •   One hundred percent net-operating loss (NOL) carry-forward programs;
               •   State tax credits for new employee hiring;
               •   Sales tax credits on machinery purchases;
               •   Up-front expensing of certain depreciable property;
               •   Lenders are allowed a deduction from income on the amount of ‘net interest’
                   earned on loans;
               •   Carry forward of unused tax credits to future tax years; and
               •   Fee waivers and/or reductions in designated areas.
               Efforts to market Pittsburg as a more desirable business community feature such
               local incentives as:
               •   One-stop permitting;
               •   A recycling marketing development zone;
               •   On-the-job training programs;

Pittsburg’s future employment growth will continue to outpace that of its
population growth.
FUTURE JOB GROWTH
The opportunities for job growth in Pittsburg between now and 2020 are
impressive. Employment projections derived from the General Plan land use
distribution resulted in a total of 64,630 jobs, an increase of approximately 170
percent. A total of 54,170 commercial jobs and 10,470 industrial jobs will be
available within the Pittsburg Planning Area if all available commercial, office
and industrial acreage is developed by 2020. Table 6-2 shows the net growth in
the employment base in 2020.
Pittsburg is anticipating a significant increase in job growth throughout the
General Plan timeframe. New business commercial centers are expected to
develop and expand at three major locations:
1. Along Willow Pass Road, west of Downtown;
2. Along State Route 4, between the proposed Railroad Avenue BART Station
    and Loveridge Road; and
3. Along West Leland Road, between the Pittsburg/Bay Point BART Station and
    proposed San Marco Boulevard.
Since employment growth is projected to outpace increases in population,
Pittsburg’s /employed residents ratio is projected to increase from the current0.74
to 0.96 in 2020. The Countywide ratio is projected at 0.81. Simply put, the
primary focus of the Economic Development Strategy will be to improve the
City’s ability to carve out more than its share of the new jobs expected and
rebalance the jobs/housing ratio.

                                        LAND SUPPLY AND AVAILABILITY
                                        The availability of industrial and commercial land that can be brought to market
                                        as quickly and as inexpensively as possible is essential to any successful
                                        economic development program. Across East County, much of the land zoned for
                                        nonresidential uses is raw, unimproved land. Most of this unimproved land will
                                        not have the investment needed to make it market-ready for many years.
                                        However, Pittsburg has quite possibly the region’s largest bank of non-residential

land that is currently served by public infrastructure. In addition, Pittsburg serves
as a gateway to East County with excellent regional road and transit access. These
are distinct advantages, for the City’s land availability, location, and access can
provide tremendous opportunities to future large-scale employers.
The Economic Development Strategy proposed in this element of the General
Plan acknowledges the City’s strength in land availability and offers a managed
nonresidential development program that is suited to current and future trends,
maximizes revenue generating opportunities for the City, and provides for
economic diversity.
6.4     ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY
The Economic Development Strategy outlined here provides a framework for
ensuring Pittsburg’s long-term regional competitiveness. While the strategy seeks
to target new businesses and build a more diverse commercial/industrial base, it
also outlines measures to retain and expand existing business establishments.
GOALS: ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY
6-G-1 In partnership with neighboring cities, businesses, and community groups,
        proactively participate in the pooling of resources and development of
        economic opportunities.
6-G-2 Establish economic development priorities and undertake targeted
        investments to facilitate expansion, retention and attraction of businesses
        that meet the City’s economic development objectives.
6-G-3 Undertake a leadership role in the coordination and completion of
        infrastructure improvements, and in the facilitation of environmental
        remediation.
                                                                                                          6-9

PITTSBURG 2020
               6-G-4 Maintain and enhance an attractive climate for conducting business in
                     Pittsburg.
               POLICIES: ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY
               Land Use and Implementation
               6-P-1 Monitor land use and development trends in the City, specifically in the
                     Economic Opportunity Areas established in Policy 6-P-9, to ensure a
                     sufficient supply of land that offers appropriate use designations and
                     development intensities.
                     Monitoring of land use and development at and around strategic locations
                     in the City will ensure that the eventual development of these locations
                     will generate the greatest economic benefit for the community. The
                     coordination of strategic improvements by the City—infrastructure
                     upgrade and extension, environmental remediation, land acquisition or
                     assembly, etc.—may also be required to provide for appropriate and
                     orderly development at these locations.
               6-P-2 Establish an implementation program that specifically outlines tasks to be
                     undertaken, timeframes for completion, resources to be allocated,
                     monitoring, and annual evaluation to ensure the overall success of the
                     initiatives proposed in the Economic Development Strategy.
                     This program would detail the implementation of the Economic
                     Development Strategy presented here and provide the means for
                     measuring overall Strategy performance. Ideally, the program format
                     would include a five-year program horizon with annual budgeting and
                     updates. Specific components would include:
                     • Target investment and strategic improvements;
                     • Target industries;
                     • Revenue enhancement;

                                                                                6: ECONOMIC EVELOPMENT
      •   Redevelopment;
      •   Enterprise Zone opportunities;
      •   Joint Economic Development Zone creation;
      •   Foreign Trade Zone creation;
      •   Land acquisition and assembly;
      •   Development monitoring;
      •   Land inventory;
      •   East County labor composition;
      •   Business climate; and
      •   Marketing.
      The program would allow the City to demonstrate its commitment to
      business attraction—and the expansion and retention of existing
      business—through specific actions and investment decisions. The program
      would actively involve business and community groups, and property
      owners in Pittsburg to access community knowledge and expertise and
      partner in the City’s future.
6-P-3 Assume a leadership role in enhancing environmental quality in the City
      by coordinating the remediation of former industrial and commercial sites
      and by facilitating their redevelopment.
      There are several large sites with high commercial or industrial
      redevelopment potential in the longer term. These sites, which have been
      identified as having leaking underground storage tanks (USTs) or as
      Spills, Leaks, Investigations, and Cleanup (SLIC) sites, include:
      •   Pittsburg/Bay Point BART Station;
      •   Proposed Railroad Avenue BART Station;
      •   USS-Posco and Dow Chemical sites; and
      •   Interchange areas at State Route 4 and Willow Pass Road, Bailey
          Road, Railroad Avenue, and Loveridge Road.
                                                                                                    6-11

PITTSBURG 2020
                      The City can foster redevelopment of these sites by acting as a catalyst
                      and facilitator, particularly where upfront private sector investment is
                      unlikely due to perceived or actual environmental constraints or liabilities.
                      The City could work with the California Environmental Protection
                      Agency’s Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) to determine
                      the eligibility of these lands for the Voluntary Cleanup Program (VCP).
                      The VCP offers a streamlined process whereby the DTSC reviews,
                      maintains oversight of, and signs off on specific remediation activities for
                      voluntary participants. Successful projects receive a remedial action
                      certification at the end of the process. While the State does not offer any
                      financial inducements for the upfront costs associated with site assessment
                      or remediation, the City could use tax increment financing and the Polanco
                      Act to undertake the work and facilitate redevelopment.
               6-P-4 Work with the Pittsburg Chamber of Commerce and the Contra Costa
                      County Workforce Investment Board to promote local business successes
                      and ventures in all parts of the City.
               City Permitting and Ordinances
               6-P-5 Undertake a detailed study to assess the true costs of development and
                      establish an appropriate impact fee schedule to ensure that new
                      development “pays its own way” with respect to infrastructure and
                      servicing.
                      According to recent comparisons, Pittsburg requires lower impact fees
                      levied on new redevelopment. However, if these fees do not cover the
                      costs incurred by the City to service new residential development, then
                      Pittsburg would, in effect, be subsidizing this type of development.
                      Ideally, residential development should pay for as much infrastructure
                      development as the market will bear and leverage the resulting
                      infrastructure improvements for non-residential land and building projects.
                      This is a particularly beneficial relationship since non-residential

      development provides significantly greater economic return than does
      residential development. As the primary goal of the Economic
      Development Strategy is to attract new business and balance the
      jobs/housing ratio, a revised impact fee schedule should charge fees
      appropriate to the development’s public service needs.
6-P-6 Maintain efficient licensing and development permitting procedures and
      regulations.
      Regulation should be appropriate to accomplish the City’s goals without
      being unnecessarily burdensome or time-consuming. Opportunities to
      further streamline procedures should be continuously pursued via a
      periodic review of the system with user input to help identify problem
      areas.
6-P-7 Continue to provide incentives, encourage employment, and promote
      businesses within the City’s Enterprise Zone (see Figure 6-1).
      The availability of tax credits, fee waivers, and business development
      assistance is a tremendous opportunity for many businesses to locate
      within the City’s Enterprise Zone. As high-tech industries expand into
      eastern Contra Costa County, locating in Pittsburg may become a more
      worthy business venture. The City should focus on marketing as an up-
      and-coming business/industrial complex, featuring excellent State and
      local investment incentives.
6-P-8 Continue to encourage and support home-based businesses in Pittsburg.
      As home-based businesses become more and more common, the revenue
      they generate and the employment they provide has become significant.
                                                                                                  6-15

               Economic Opportunity Areas
               6-P-9 Establish Economic Opportunity Areas in Pittsburg, as indicated in Table
                      6-3 and Figure 6-2. Development in these areas must reflect both current
                      and future trends, maximize revenue-generating opportunities for the City,
                      and provide for economic diversity.
                      In 1996, seven original areas in Pittsburg were identified as reflecting the
                      best opportunities for Pittsburg to grow a more diverse economy and
                      better balance the jobs/housing ratio by 2020. One additional area—
                      Railroad Avenue/Harbor Street BART—was added in Table 6-3, while
                      two of the original areas—North Willow Pass and South Residential—
                      were deleted due to preservation of open space and wetlands habitat. It is
                      important that these Economic Opportunity Areas provide for a
                      comprehensive and integrated approach to development/redevelopment,
                      including a full range of public finance and land use planning tools.
               6-P-10 Emphasize Downtown as Pittsburg’s historic center, providing an identity
                      anda sense of place for the entire city by establishing a focused
                      revitalization strategy that integrates the initiatives of the Economic
                      Development Strategy.
                      The importance of Downtown to the City’s evolution beyond a bedroom
                      community cannot be overstated. While Downtown is identified as an
                      economic opportunity area in Policy 6-P-8, this area is sufficiently
                      different in both structure and context as to justify specific mention here.
                      Pittsburg’s Downtown is one of the oldest in the County, and one of few
                      with a waterfront. Downtown design is more fully discussed in Chapter 5:
                      Downtown of this Plan.
                      A revitalization strategy for Downtown should build on the strengths of
                      Downtown, while aggressively working to overcome the obstacles.
                      Initiatives of the Downtown revitalization strategy should specify several

        of the techniques proposed for the citywide Economic Development
        Strategy:
        •   Monitoring of land use and development trends in Downtown to
            ensure a sufficient supply of land of appropriate designation and
            development intensity;
        •   Establishment of a retail and consumer services strategy to attract
            retail and service sector business to key locations in Downtown;
        •   Establishment of criteria for land assembly in Downtown for the
            purposes of redevelopment and revitalization;
        •   Consideration of the feasibility of a convention or performing arts
            center, amphitheater, or other public cultural amenity in or linked to
            the Downtown;
        •   Facilitation of additional attractions and events that bring both
            residents and visitors to the Downtown; and
        •   Preservation and enhancement of historic structures contributing to the
            unique character of the Downtown.
Retail and Consumer Services
6-P-11 Develop a retail and consumer services strategy to attract regional- and
        local-serving non-basic industries, ensure appropriate location, and
        maximize growth opportunities. Incorporate initiatives to retain and
        expand existing retail and consumer services businesses.
        The City must aggressively pursue growth in the retail and service sectors
        for three primary reasons. First, city residents are currently underserved in
        several retail categories, including automotive sales, service stations, and
        home furnishing and appliances. Second, a net retail sales ‘leakage’ worth
        approximately $30.6 million was lost to neighboring communities in 1996,
        sales that did not benefit the City through tax revenues. (Refer to
        discussion in Section 6.2 of the Pittsburg General Plan Update: Existing
        Conditions andPlanning Issues Report, 1998). Third, as retail sales are
                                                                                                          6-17

PITTSBURG 2020
                      lost to neighboring communities, so too are the associated jobs. Overall, it
                      is likely that the demand for additional retail space in Pittsburg over the
                      next 20 years will range between 500,000 and 750,000 square feet. Retail
                      and consumer service uses need to be located in areas with heavy pass-by
                      traffic, good visibility, and image. Pittsburg has a significant advantage
                      over neighboring communities in that it offers a significant supply of
                      available land in locations that make the most sense for retail and service
                      sector uses. The westward orientation of the East County population—
                      jobs, shopping, entertainment, and services are in Bay Area communities
                      to the west—means that Pittsburg will benefit most from traffic and
                      consumers in communities to the east passing through the City.
               Research and Development
               6-P-12 Develop a research and development and office attraction strategy to
                      promote economic diversification, ensure appropriate location, and
                      maximize growth opportunities. Incorporate initiatives to retain and
                      expand existing R&D and office businesses.
                      Research and development (R&D) industry clusters—which include
                      multimedia, plastics, computer-related electronics, health care technology,
                      and business services—are projected to benefit from significant growth in
                      Contra Costa County to 2020, and would certainly provide excellent
                      employment- and revenue-generating opportunities for Pittsburg if the
                      City positioned itself properly to capture this growth.
                      Businesses in these clusters have several locational considerations. Good
                      access from major highways and proximate amenities for employees are
                      very important factors. Locations must project a high-quality image,
                      typically expressed by a high-level of design, landscaping, and
                      maintenance. Such an image is generally provided in campus-style office
                      or business park developments. In addition, prestigious R&D and office
                      tenants will pay a premium for space in high-profile or high-image

       buildings, often a mid-rise or otherwise architecturally interesting building
       with visibility from a major highway.
6-P-13 Create a Research and Development Industry Advisory Council comprised
       of business leaders from within Pittsburg to assist the implementation of
       the R&D and office attraction strategy (Policy 6-P-12).
       The development of an R&D and office attraction strategy would benefit
       greatly from the involvement of the private sector. An R&D Industry
       Advisory Council comprised of industry representatives and other private
       sector interests in Pittsburg could assist the City in the creation of the
       campus-style concept. Specifically, the Council would work with the City
       on various matters related to planning, marketing, and incentives. Planning
       matters include design guidelines, enhanced development standards,
       infrastructure improvements, parking, transit, and other issues related to
       campus-style development. Marketing matters include the promotion of
       Pittsburg as a high amenity, growth-based, industrial activity center for
       R&D and office uses. Finally, incentives matters relate to the appropriate
       use of the City’s authority to promote redevelopment and revitalization in
       support of its community development goals. This includes the use of land
       acquisition, land assembly, redevelopment financing, advance permitting,
       and other tools necessary to maintain a suitable inventory of ready-to-go
       sites for these uses.
Land Assembly and Redevelopment
6-P-14 Establish an inventory of ready-to-go non-residential sites, complete with
       zoning, infrastructure, and environmental clearances. If necessary,
       acquire or assemble sites to ensure availability of sites of adequate size to
       attract industry clusters that meet the City’s development objectives.
       Policy 6-P-9 identifies six Economic Opportunity Areas in Pittsburg.
       While these areas present a variety of challenges, careful planning,
                                                                                                         6-19

                      municipal incentives, and private sector involvement could provide
                      tremendous redevelopment opportunities. The City should engage in land
                      acquisition, assembly, and re-parcelization of sites in Economic
                      Opportunity Areas, particularly if:
                       •   Sites are in strategic or one-of-a-kind locations, such as the Suisun
                           Bay waterfront;
                       •   An inventory of ready-to-go sites are needed to attract targeted
                           industry clusters;
                       •   Reuse of brownfield or other contaminated sites can contribute to
                           environmental remediation;
                       •   Short-term market inefficiencies are overcome; or
                       •   Quality development, attainment of higher intensities, and
                           professional management can be achieved.
               6-P-15 Maximize the City’s public financing tools and consider opportunities for
                      enhancement in order to fund the various economic development
                      initiatives outlined in this Element.
               Amenities and Waterfront Development
               6-P-16 Consider the feasibility of establishing a convention or performing arts
                      center, amphitheater, or other public cultural amenity in or linked to the
                      Downtown or waterfront, or in another appropriate location.
                      This recommendation offers three distinct, yet very important advantages.
                      First, the location of such a facility in the Downtown, or a comparable
                      mixed-use activity center such as the proposed Railroad Avenue BART
                      Station Area, would generate pedestrian traffic and support retail
                      opportunities into the evening hours. Complementary uses, such as
                      restaurants, clubs, and coffee shops, would also tend to locate near where
                      crowds gather.

                                                                                       6: ECONOMIC EVELOPMENT
       Second, such facilities provide a strong image of culture, sophistication,
       and community pride. Such an image is key if Pittsburg is to evolve from
       bedroom community to important regional job center, particularly in the
       attraction of R&D and office complexes.
       Third, such facilities can also result in strong growth in the visitor services
       sector. Guest accommodations, restaurants, movie theaters, and
       entertainment complexes become more economically feasible when a
       significant nearby attraction serves more than the communities that
       immediately surround it. Growth in this sector will also be an important
       part of Pittsburg’s transition to a regional job center, as new businesses
       bring in new clients, conventioneers, and suppliers from outside the area.
6-P-17 Facilitate additional attractions and events that bring both residents and
       visitors to the City, the Downtown, and the waterfront.
       In addition to the consideration of a convention or performing arts center
       in Pittsburg, it is important that the City support and facilitate existing
       events and attractions. Some current events include the Renaissance
       Festival, Heritage Festival, Seafood Festival, August After Hours, Black
       Diamond Blues Festival, and the Pittsburg Holiday Parade. With respect to
       attractions, the City needs to make the most of the unique sites located
       nearby, such as Black Diamond Mines Regional Park and Browns Island
       Regional Shoreline, and integrate the promotion of these attractions with
       other City initiatives.
6-P-18 Ensure that new waterfront development includes enhanced shoreline
       access, some form of public amenity, and an appropriate mix of waterfront
       uses.
       The Pittsburg waterfront should serve as a recreational and commercial
       focus of the City. As such, waterfront uses should enhance this role by
       supporting a mix of complementary uses that include marinas (a small
                                                                                                           6-21

               portion of which may include service and storage facilities), eating and
               drinking establishments, visitor accommodations, parks and open space,
               historic and/or natural interpretive facilities. Waterfront development
               should incorporate or improve connections to Downtown.

7 TRANSPORTATION
This element identifies long-range future transportation needs, primarily through
policies and standards to enhance capacity and provide new linkages to further an
integrated multi-modal transportation system.
The transportation system serving Pittsburg is comprised of the roadway system,
public transportation, and alternative modes, including carpooling, bicycling, and
walking. Several routes of regional significance provide access to Pittsburg: State
Route 4, Pittsburg-Antioch Highway, Kirker Pass Road, Bailey Road, Leland
Road, and Willow Pass Road. State Route 4, which runs east-west and bisects the
City, connects Highway 160 in East Antioch, Highway 242 and I-680 in Concord,
and I-80 in Hercules. A system of surface streets collects and distributes traffic to
and from the highway and regional routes, and between the commercial,
industrial, and residential areas of the City.
Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) provides commuter rail service between
Pittsburg and the rest of the Bay Area via the Pittsburg/Bay Point line. The
Pittsburg/Bay Point BART station is located at the southwest quadrant of the State
Route 4/Bailey Road interchange. Local bus service is provided by Tri-Delta
transit and the County Connection services. Existing bicycle lanes along East
Leland Road, Loveridge Road, Harbor Street, Buchanan Road, and Crestview
Avenue provide access throughout Pittsburg. The Delta De Anza Trail is a multi-
use path connecting Pittsburg to neighboring communities.
PITTSBURG 2020
               7.1               REGULATORY CONTEXT
               The City of Pittsburg has jurisdiction over all City streets and City-operated traffic
               signals. The freeways, freeway ramps, ramp signal lights, and State Routes (such as State
               Route 4) are under the jurisdiction of the California Department of Transportation. The
               transit service providers have jurisdiction over their services. These include BART, Tri-
               Delta Transit and County Connection fixed-route bus service.
               Several regional agencies oversee and coordinate funding for transportation improvement
               programs affecting Pittsburg, including the Contra Costa Transportation Authority,
               TRANSPLAN Regional Transportation Planning Committee, and the Metropolitan
               Transportation Commission.
               CONTRA COSTA TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY
               In 1988, voters in Contra Costa County passed Measure C, increasing the sales tax by ½
               percent for 20 years to finance construction of a specified set of public transit and
               highway improvement projects. This ballot measure created the Contra Costa
               Transportation Authority (CCTA) that oversees the improvements contained in the
               Measure C Growth Management Program, including the widening of State Route 4. In
               2004, County voters approved a 25-year extension of Measure C when they approved the
               Contra Costa County Transportation Sales Tax Expenditure Plan (Measure J). In order to
               qualify for Measure J funding, the CCTA requires each jurisdiction to include a Growth
               Management Element in its General Plan (see Chapter 3: Growth Management).
               CCTA is also the Congestion Management Agency (CMA) that sets State and Federal
               funding priorities for improvements affecting the Contra Costa County Congestion
               Management Program (CMP) Roadway System. CMP roadway system components (or
               Routes of Regional Significance) in the Pittsburg Planning Area include State Route 4,
               Bailey Road (north of Leland Road), Willow Pass Road, West Tenth Street, Leland Road
               (east of Bailey Road), Buchanan Road, a portion of Somersville Road, and Railroad
               Avenue. Proposed Routes of Regional Significance include East Tenth Street, Pittsburg-
               Antioch Highway, Buchanan Bypass, Bailey Road (south of Leland Road), and Leland
               Road (west of Bailey Road). San Marco Boulevard is a Proposed Route of Regional
               Significance proposed by the City of Pittsburg.

TRANSPLAN
Measures C and J requires all Contra Costa County jurisdictions to participate in
the preparation of Action Plans for Routes of Regional Significance to determine
the appropriate measures and programs for mitigation of regional traffic impacts.
TRANSPLAN is the Regional Transportation Planning Committee (RTPC) for
eastern Contra Costa County, comprised of the cities of Antioch, Brentwood,
Oakley, Pittsburg and unincorporated Contra Costa County. One elected official
from each of these jurisdictions serves on the TRANSPLAN Committee. The
Action Plans from the TRANSPLAN Committee are integrated with Action Plans
from other regional transportation planning committees to form the CCTA
Countywide Comprehensive Transportation Plan.
METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION
The transportation planning agency for the entire Bay Area is the Metropolitan
Transportation Commission (MTC). MTC is the clearinghouse for both State and
Federal funds for transportation improvements. Each county’s CMA, including
CCTA, forwards their capital improvement project list to MTC. MTC reviews the
lists submitted by all nine Bay Area counties and submits a regional priority list to
the California Transportation Commission and/or the Federal Highway
Administration for selection of projects to receive funding.
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION
The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) has authority over the
State highway system, including mainline facilities and interchanges. Caltrans
must be involved in and approve the planning and design of improvements for
state highway facilities. State highway facilities in the Pittsburg Planning Area
include State Route 4 and the interchanges at Willow Pass Road, Bailey Road,
Railroad Avenue, and Loveridge Road.
                                                                                                     7-3

PITTSBURG 2020
               7.2        ROADWAY SYSTEM & TRAFFIC STANDARDS
               ROADWAY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM
               The roadway system within the City is based around a conventional suburban
               hierarchy of streets. The top of the hierarchy consists of arterial streets that carry
               large volumes of traffic, while the bottom consists of low-volume local streets
               intended to provide access to adjacent property. Definitions of the roadway
               classifications are presented below, while more specific classification standards
               relating to intersections, driveways, on-street parking, and traffic volumes are
               presented in Table 7-1. A map of the roadway system serving the City of Pittsburg
               is presented in Figure 7-1.
               • Freeways. Freeways are limited-access, high-speed travelways included in the
                   State and Federal highway systems. Their purpose is to carry regional through-
                   traffic (traffic passing through Pittsburg without stopping). Access is provided
                   by interchanges spaced one mile or greater. No access is provided to adjacent
                   land uses. State Route 4 is the only freeway connecting the City of Pittsburg to
                   regional destinations.
               • Major Arterials. Major arterials primarily serve through-traffic. They are
                   generally multi-lane facilities with signalized traffic control at major
                   intersections. Major arterials are typically divided facilities (with raised
                   medians) that provide limited access to abutting development sites as a
                   secondary function. Major arterial examples in Pittsburg include Railroad
                   Avenue, Kirker Pass Road, Willow Pass Road, Bailey Road, Pittsburg-
                   Antioch Highway, Leland Road, Loveridge Road, and Buchanan Road.
               • Minor Arterials. Minor Arterials are intended to provide balance between
                   mobility and access. They carry a mix of local and regional traffic, providing
                   circulation between neighborhoods, activity centers, and highways and other
                   regional routes. Minor arterials are typically two to four lane roadways that
                   also provide access to adjacent development, often using signalized
                   intersections for entry to major generators. Minor arterial examples in
                   Pittsburg include Harbor Street, North Parkside Drive, California Avenue, and
                   Century Boulevard.

    Collectors. Collectors provide land access and traffic circulation within
    residential, commercial and industrial areas. They connect arterials with local
    streets. Collectors are typically designed with two travel lanes, parking lanes,
    planter strips, and sidewalks. Traffic control at intersections is generally
    signalized along these facilities, but can include all-way stop control. Collector
    streets in Pittsburg include Atlantic Avenue, Stoneman Avenue, Gladstone
    Drive, and Yosemite Drive.
• Local Streets. Local streets, also known as minor streets, provide direct access
    to abutting properties as their primary function. Local streets rarely have more
    than two travel lanes, and speed limits are generally kept low (25 mph).           Table 7-2

               EXISTING TRAFFIC VOLUMES
               Traffic data used to define existing roadway and intersection service levels include
               average daily traffic (ADT) and peak hour traffic. The ADT is defined as the total
               number of vehicles passing a point on a roadway, in both directions, on an average
               weekday. Peak hour is defined as the total number of vehicles passing a point on a
               roadway during the busiest one hour in the morning or afternoon on an average
               weekday. Typically, peak hour turning movement volumes are used to measure
               service levels at intersections.
               Historically, State Route 4 has been heavily congested in the westbound direction
               during the weekday morning peak period (7:00 to 9:00 AM) and in the eastbound
               direction during the evening peak period (4:00 to 6:00 PM). The highly directional
               peak hours are the result of significantly more housing than employment in East
               County communities. Based on Caltrans’ mainline counts, volumes on State Route
               4 range from nearly 80,000 to over 90,000 vehicles per day in the vicinity of
               Pittsburg. Weekday volumes generally peak between 5:00 to 6:00 PM, with peak
               hour traffic volumes at nearly 8,000 vehicles per hour. Traffic on State Route 4
               has increased significantly over the past 10 years, about 48 percent, as continued
               housing construction occurs in Antioch and Brentwood.
               Along City streets, traffic volumes have also increased over the past 10 years.
               Traffic volumes along the major arterials in Pittsburg have experienced significant
               increases due to current congestion levels on State Route 4, with many drivers
               finding alternative access along local streets to avoid the congestion. Pittsburg
               experiences substantial through-traffic on local arterials and collectors as
               commuters from adjacent communities use these streets to access Kirker Pass
               Road, a regional connection to Concord, Walnut Creek and the Highway 24/I-680
               junction. Railroad Avenue, Buchanan Road, and Leland Road accommodate the
               greatest amounts of through traffic in Pittsburg.

PROJECTED TRAFFIC VOLUMES
Traffic projections for buildout of the General Plan were developed using the East
County Travel Demand Forecasting Model. This model was developed and
adopted by CCTA for regional transportation planning. It produces both average
daily traffic projections and peak hour turning movement projections at key
intersections. The model encompasses the entire County, but is focused on the
communities of North Concord, Bay Point, Pittsburg, Antioch, Oakley and
Brentwood. The General Plan Diagram (Figure 2-2) and associated buildout
projections (Section 2.3) constitute model assumptions for Pittsburg. Within the
remainder of the region, land use assumptions equal year 2025 employment and
population projections developed by the Association of Bay Area Governments
(ABAG). Additionally, the traffic projections reflect planned and improved street,
highway and interchange improvements within Pittsburg and throughout the
region.
Table 7-3 compares existing average daily traffic volumes with year 2025 traffic
projections. Substantial increases in traffic are projected for key roadway
segments in Pittsburg. Traffic volumes on State Route 4 will double over the next
25 years, due partly to growth in Pittsburg, but primarily due to substantial growth
in the Eastern Contra Costa County communities of Antioch, Oakley, Brentwood,
and growth in other communities along State Route 4 such as Discovery Bay.
Regionally important through routes such as Bailey Road, Railroad Avenue/Kirker
Pass Road, Leland Road, and Pittsburg-Antioch Highway will experience
substantial growth in traffic volumes, with increases ranging from 35 percent to
over 200 percent. Other key streets in Pittsburg will also experience growth
ranging from 15 percent to nearly 300 percent. This growth on local Pittsburg
streets is a combination of locally generated traffic and through traffic seeking
alternative routes to congested highways and regional routes.
According to the CCTA East County Model used to generate projected traffic
volumes for year 2025, increases in freeway traffic in Contra Costa County are
expected to be most substantial along State Route 4 in the vicinity of Pittsburg and
Antioch. Table 7-4 shows projected vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and vehicle
hours traveled (VHT) for Pittsburg and Contra Costa County under buildout of the
proposed General Plan. Total VMT are expected to exceed 18,250 on roadways
within the Planning Area.

7-G-6  Locate high traffic-generating uses so that they have direct access or
       immediate secondary access to arterial roadways.
7-G-7  Complete arterial roadway improvements required to mitigate traffic
       impacts of an approved project before the project is fully occupied.
       Arterial improvements should be completed by creating funding sources,
       which include but are not limited to Traffic Mitigation Fees,
       Development Agreements, and Assessment Districts.
POLICIES: STREET SYSTEM AND TRAFFIC STANDARDS
7-P-1  Require mitigation for development proposals that are not part of the
       Traffic Mitigation Fee program which contribute more than one percent
       of the volume to an existing roadway or intersections with inadequate
       capacity to meet cumulative demand.
        Development projects that contribute to future traffic congestion on existing
        roadways shall provide mitigation to ensure adequate future capacities.
        Traffic analysis of development plans will determine the proportion of
        cumulative impact each project is creating.
7-P-2  Use the adopted Regional and Local Transportation Impact Mitigation
       Fee ordinances to ensure that all new development pays an equitable
       pro-rata share of the cost of transportation improvements. Review the
       Traffic Impact Mitigation Fee schedule annually and update every five
       years at a minimum.
7-P-3  Review and update the City’s Engineering Design Standards for each
       functional roadway classification, according to Table 7-1.
        Roadway standards are illustrated in the City’s Engineering Design
        Standards for typical midblock applications. Additional right-of-way may
        be needed for turn lanes at some intersection approaches.
                                                                                                    7-15

PITTSBURG 2020
               7-P-4     Require that all traffic studies be conducted by professional
                         transportation consultants selected by the Planning and Building and
                         Engineering Departments, with the City acting as the lead agency.
                         Ensure that all costs associated with the traffic study are paid by the
                         applicant.
               7-P-5     Apply for federal Congestion Mitigation Air Quality grant funding,
                         designed to improve air quality through roadway improvement projects.
               Level of Service (LOS) Standards
               7-P-6     Ensure that all Regional Routes of Significance within the City maintain
                         the following traffic levels of service (LOS) standards (applicable to non-
                         freeway routes and routes not subject to a Traffic Management
                         Program):
                               LOS mid D (peak hour volume to capacity ratio less than or equal
                                to 0.85) at intersections along major arterials, except for
                                intersections along Bailey Road;
                               LOS high E (peak hour volume to capacity ratio less than or equal
                                to 0.99) at intersections along Bailey Road between West Leland
                                Raod and State Route 4; and
                               LOW mid E (peak hour volume to capacity ratio less than or equal
                                to 0.95) at intersections on Kirker Pass Road..
               7-P-7     Endeavor to implement Transportation Element improvements prior to
                         deterioration in levels of service below those set forth in Goal 7-G-1.
                          Development approvals should require reasonable demonstration that traffic
                          improvements necessary to serve the development will be in place in time
                          to accommodate trips generated by the project.
               7-P-8     Ensure that all non-Regional Routes within the City (not designated as
                         Routes of Regional Significance in Figure 7-2) maintain the following
                         traffic levels of service (LOS) standards based on their location in rural,

        semi-rural, suburban, urban or downtown areas, as designated in Figure
        7-2:
              Rural – LOW low C (peak hour volume to capacity ratio less than
               or equal to 0.74)
              Semi-rural – LOS high C (peak hour volume to capacity ratio less
               than or equal to 0.79)
              Suburban – LOS low D (peak hour volume to capacity ratio less
               than or equal to 0.84)
              Urban – LOS high D (peak hour volume to capacity ratio less than
               or equal to 0.89)
              Downtown – LOS high D (peak hour volume to capacity ratio less
               than or equal to 0.89)
         Specific improvements should be identified and implemented on the basis
         of detailed traffic studies or Environmental Impact Reports. Improvements
         may include intersection approach lane expansion, related channelization
         improvements and traffic signal installations.
7-P-9   Implement the intersection improvements (including signalization and
        additional or reallocated lanes) as illustrated in Appendix A.
7-P-10 Require mitigation for development proposals which result in projected
        parking demand that would exceed the proposed parking supply on a
        regular and frequent basis.
Highways and Arterial Streets
7-P-11 Maximize the carrying capacity of arterial roadways by controlling the
        number of intersections and driveways, minimizing residential access,
        implementing Transportation Systems Management measures, and
        requiring sufficient on-site parking to meet the needs of each project (see
        also Table 7-1).                                                            State Route 4, pictured here from the Harbor Street overpass, is
                                                                                    a major highway that bisects the City.
                                                                                                                                                7-17

                       Additional guidelines for arterial access include providing smooth
                       ingress/egress to development. This includes designing parking areas so that
                       traffic turning into the parking areas does not stack up on the arterial
                       roadway; combining driveways to serve small parcels; and maintaining
                       adequate distance between driveways and intersections to permit efficient
                       traffic merges. In the built environment, roadway right-of-way may not be
                       available to increase arterial capacity. Therefore, improving the efficiency
                       of existing arterials through Transportation Systems Management (TSM)
                       measures should be one of the first considerations to meet level of service
                       standards. TSM measures include signal coordination, channelization and
                       signal improvements at intersections, and implementation of new traffic
                       control technology.
               7-P-12 Continue to collect fees, plan and design for the future construction of
                      Buchanan Bypass. Ensure preparation of a feasibility and environmental
                      impact study to determine the precise alignment, costs, mitigation
                      measures, and impacts on adjacent uses.
               7-P-13 Upgrade or extend the hillside access routes from Bailey Road,
                      Buchanan Road, Kirker Pass Road, and proposed San Marco Boulevard,
                      as development potential warrants.
               7-P-14 Increase access to alternative north-south routes providing connection to
                      State Route 4, other than Railroad Avenue.
               7-P-15 Support Caltrans’ planned improvements to the Railroad Avenue and
                      Loveridge Road interchanges in conjunction with State Route 4 widening
                      projects. Work with Federal, State and regional authorities to ensure
                      timely completion of these projects needed to adequately serve local
                      circulation needs.
               7-P-16 Continue to collect fees for the extension of West Leland Road to Willow
                      Pass Road, subject to the Traffic Mitigation Fee program. As established
                      by nexus, require new development adjacent to the extension to dedicate
                      right-of-way and construct or fund new intersections and frontage
                      improvements.

7-P-17 Pursue the design and construction of an interchange/overpass at State
         Route 4 and Range Road. Work with Caltrans to design an interchange
         facility that will accommodate future traffic demands.
7-P-18 Approve construction of the proposed San Marco Boulevard (Bailey
         Bypass). Ensure preparation of a feasibility and environmental impact
         study to determine the precise alignment, costs, mitigation measures, and
         impacts on adjacent uses. Evaluate topographic and geologic
         constraints, and projected traffic generation rates. Consider a road
         alignment within the Restricted Federal Easement area, if abandoned,
         for access to potential residential neighborhoods.
7-P-19 Rebuild the interchange/overpass between Willow Pass Road, Range
         Road, North Parkside Drive, and the BNSF Railroad tracks for safe and
         efficient movement of auto and bicycle traffic.
7-P-20 Encourage motorists to use State Route 4 for the peak-hour commute,
         rather than using arterial streets in Concord and other East County
         cities.
Collectors and Local Streets
7-P-21 Design local residential streets and implement traffic-control measures
         to keep traffic below 5,000 vehicles per day.
7-P-22 Avoid adding traffic roadways carrying volumes above the standards,
         and consider traffic control measures where perceived nuisance is
         severe.
7-P-23 Develop procedures and guidelines to mitigate neighborhood traffic
         impacts in areas where traffic speeds or volumes exceed posted speed
         limits or standards established above.
          Measures that may be considered include:
         • Installation of way-finding signs on arterial routes that encourage
              motorists to use routes that do not pass through residential areas.
                                                                                                 7-19

PITTSBURG 2020
                         • Operational changes such as signalization, turn lanes and extended
                             turning bays on arterial streets that encourage their use as inter-
                             community connectors.
                         • Traffic calming measures such as curb extensions or gateway
                             features at intersections on streets leading into residential areas to
                             inform motorists that they are entering a neighborhood area.
                         • Community educational and awareness programs to promote
                             selection of routes within the City that do not pass through residential
                             areas.
               Goods Movement
               7-P-24 Continue to designate appropriate truck routes, and discourage
                         unnecessary through traffic in residential areas.
               7-P-25 Require trucks accessing the industrial land uses east of Downtown to
                         use the Pittsburg/Antioch Highway in order to bypass the Creeds/Central
                         Addition neighborhood.
               7.3       TRANSIT AND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION
               Figure 7-3 depicts existing and proposed transit services within the City.
               TRI-DELTA TRANSIT BUS SERVICE
               Tri-Delta Transit serves Eastern Contra Costa County including the cities of
               Pittsburg, Antioch, Oakley, Brentwood, and the unincorporated areas of East
               County, including Bay Point. All buses have bicycle racks and are wheel chair lift
               equipped. Within Pittsburg, Tri-Delta Transit operates seven bus routes serving all
               areas of Pittsburg. The primary lines serving Pittsburg carry approximately 3,400
               passengers per day.
               Tri-Delta’s future service plan includes expanding service near the Railroad
               Avenue junction with State Route 4 (the location of the proposed Railroad Avenue

COUNTY CONNECTION TRANSIT SERVICE
The County Connection transit service, operated by the Contra Costa County
Transit Authority (CCCTA), serves most Contra Costa County cities, with limited
service to East County areas. County Connection operates Line 930 through
Pittsburg, which originates in Walnut Creek and travels on Ygnacio Valley
Road/Kirker Pass Road to Buchanan Road. Its terminus is at the Hillcrest Park &
Ride Lot in Antioch. Route 930 serving Pittsburg has consistently fallen below
CCCTA’s productivity thresholds, resulting in service reductions in 1997. County
Connection has no immediate plan to increase its service in the East County.
BART Service
The Pittsburg/Bay Point BART Station is located at the southwest quadrant of the
State Route 4/Bailey Road interchange. During weekdays, scheduled trains
complete 75 round-trips between the Pittsburg/Bay Point BART Station and other
Bay Area destinations. The Pittsburg/Bay Point line had an average weekday
ridership of approximately 7,200 passengers in 1997, an increase of 23 percent
since the station opened in 1996. BART projects ridership at this station is
anticipated to grow 6 percent annually through the year 2005. BART also provides
express bus service between the Pittsburg/Bay Point Station, Antioch and
Brentwood (Routes PE and PE1).
BART’s future service plan includes adding 30 new trains to its present 43 online
trains and reducing headways to accommodate the increase in service. In addition,
BART expects to provide an additional 350 parking spaces at the Pittsburg/Bay
Point Station by the year 2005. BART’s short-range transit plan (1997-2005) does      The Pittsburg/Bay Point BART Station, which connects the

GOALS: TRANSIT AND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION
7-G-8  Cooperate with public agencies and other jurisdictions to promote local
       regional public transit serving Pittsburg and provide an express bus
       system between Pittsburg, Brentwood, Oakley, Antioch, and the
       Pittsburg/Bay Point BART Station.
        The City should encourage transit development, expansion, coordination
        and aggressive marketing throughout eastern Contra Costa County to serve
        a broader range of local and regional transportation needs including
        commuter and express service.
7-G-9  Continue to support public and private organizations’ efforts to provide
       paratransit service for the elderly and disabled.
POLICIES: TRANSIT AND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION
7-P-26 Require mitigation for development proposals which increase transit
       demand above the service levels provided by public transit operators and
       agencies.
7-P-27 Support the expansion of the existing transit service area and an
       increase in the service levels of existing transit. Support increased Tri-
       Delta and County Connection express bus service to the Pittsburg/Bay
       Point BART Station to reduce traffic demand on State Route 4.
7-P-28 Encourage the extension of BART to Railroad Avenue within the median
       of State Route 4. Cooperate with BART and regional agencies to develop
       station area plans and transit-oriented development patterns.
7-P-29 Preserve options for future transit use when designing improvements for
       roadways. Ensure that developers provide bus turnouts and/or shelters,
       where appropriate, as part of projects.
                                                                                                7-23

PITTSBURG 2020
               7-P-30 Work with Tri-Delta and planning area residents to plan for local bus
                      routes that more effectively serve potential riders within local
                      neighborhoods.
               7-P-31 Work with Tri-Delta and County Connection to schedule signal timing
                      for arterials with heavy bus traffic, where air quality benefits can be
                      demonstrated.
               7-P-32 Support efforts by public agencies and/or private interests to promote
                      regional heavy and light passenger rail transit as an alternative or
                      adjunct to BART, with connections to BART and other multi-modal
                      transit.

7.4         BIKEWAYS AND PEDESTRIAN MOVEMENT
BICYCLE FACILITIES
The City of Pittsburg maintains limited bikeways and storage facilities for local
residents. Existing on-street bicycle facilities include portions of East Leland Road
and Railroad Avenue, Kirker Pass Road, Buchanan Road, Harbor Street, Willow
Pass Road, Crestview Drive, and Loveridge Road. Additionally, the Delta de Anza
Trail, which runs east-west throughout the length of the City, provides a multi-use
trail that local bicyclists may use. Local bicycle facilities include bike paths, bike
lanes, and bike routes:
• Bike paths are paved facilities that are physically separated from roadways
     used by motor vehicles by space or a barrier and are designated for bicycle
     use. Existing bike paths in Pittsburg are multi-use paths and permit not only
     bicycles, but also pedestrians, skaters, scooters, and handicapped persons in
     wheelchairs. (Caltrans Class I facility)
• Bike lanes are lanes on the outside edge of roadways reserved for the
     exclusive use of bicycles. Bike lanes are designated with special signage and
     pavement markings. (Caltrans Class II facility)
• Bike routes are roadways recommended for use by bicycles and often connect
     roadways with bike lanes and bike paths. Bike routes are designated with signs
     only. (Caltrans Class III facility)
In 2001, TRANSPLAN and the City adopted the East Contra Costa County
Bikeway Plan, which designates on-street bike facilities (bike lanes and/or routes).
Bicycle lanes are planned for all major streets, including West Leland Road,
proposed San Marco Boulevard, Montezuma Street, and Century Boulevard. Table
7-5 and Figure 7-4 describe existing and planned future bike lanes in Pittsburg.
                                                                                                     7-25

PEDESTRIAN FACILITIES
Pedestrian facilities include sidewalks, paths, pedestrian bridges, crosswalks, and
crossing signals. Most streets in Pittsburg have sidewalks on both sides with
signals and crosswalks at signalized intersections to accommodate pedestrian
circulation.
The grid street pattern in Downtown, coupled with appropriate pedestrian facilities
and linkages to waterfront paths, enable a walkable urban core. However, some
older streets in the City contain sporadic pedestrian facilities. Pedestrian facility
improvements will improve safety for pedestrians and also encourage the use of
alternative modes of transportation.
GOALS: BIKEWAYS AND PEDESTRIAN MOVEMENT
7-G-10 Study the feasibility of a comprehensive network of on- and off-road bike
          routes to encourage the use of bikes for commute, recreational and other
          trips.
           A continuous network of safe and convenient bikeways has the potential to
           connect neighborhoods with major activity centers, parks, schools,
           employment centers, civic uses, the waterfront, and the County bicycle
           system.
7-G-11 Coordinate with neighboring communities and regional agencies to
          establish a continuous regional system of bicycle and pedestrian
          facilities.
7-G-12 Seek assistance from major employers and developers in implementing
          programs to encourage use of bikes for commute purposes.                    The City strives to provide a variety of bicycle facilities
                                                                                      such as the bike trail along EBMUD Row (at West Leland

PITTSBURG 2020
               7-G-14 Develop urban design and streetscape standards and guidelines to
                        improve pedestrian environments and accessibility in new development
                        projects and in Downtown.
               7-G-15 Encourage walking as a regular means of transportation for people who
                        live within a half-mile walk of school, work, or routine shopping
                        destinations.
               7-G-16 Ensure that current bicycle-friendly roadways, featuring wide shoulders
                        or marked bicycle lanes, are not redesigned to improve traffic LOS,
                        unless all other alternative roadways possible to alleviate congestion are
                        exhausted.

               7-P-33 Require mitigation for development proposals which result in potential
                        conflicts, or fail to provide adequate access, for pedestrians and
                        bicycles.
               7-P-34 As part of development approval, ensure that safe and contiguous routes
                        for pedestrians and bicyclists are provided within new development
                        projects and on any roadways that are impacted as a result of new
                        development..
               7-P-35 Work with school districts, school administrators and parents of
                        elementary school students to develop a “suggested routes to school”
                        program for students who bicycle and walk.
               7-P-36 Ensure continued compliance with Title 24 of the Uniform Building
                        Code, requiring removal of all barriers to disabled persons on arterial
                        and collector streets.

Pedestrian Facilities
7-P-38 Develop a series of continuous pedestrian systems within Downtown and
         residential neighborhoods, connecting major activity centers and trails
         with City and County open space areas.
          Sidewalks should be creatively designed to invite safe use by pedestrians,
          and be free of obstacles, such as newspaper racks, bus benches, utility
          poles, and fire hydrants.
7-P-39 Ensure that residential and commercial developments provide pedestrian
         pathways between lots for direct routes to commercial centers, schools,
         and transit facilities.
7-P-40 Ensure provision of sufficiently wide sidewalks and pedestrian paths in
         all new residential development.
7-P-41 Ensure the provision of multi-use trails or trailheads within new hillside
         developments, preferably connecting to the regional trail network.
7-P-42 Improve pedestrian crossing safety at heavily used intersections by
         installing crossing controls that provide adequate time for pedestrians to
         cross the street.
Bicycle Lanes, Paths and Facilities
7-P-43 Provide adequate roadway width dedications for bicycle lanes, paths,
         and routes as designated in Figure 7-4.
7-P-44 Coordinate with Contra Costa County to develop a city-wide Bicycle
         Master Plan by year 2005. Cooperate with the Contra Costa County
         RTPC in implementing construction of bicycle facilities within the
         Bicycle Action Plan.
7-P-45 During review of development projects, encourage secure bicycle
         facilities and other alternative transportation facilities at employment
         sites, public facilities, and multi-family residential complexes.
                                                                                                   7-31
PITTSBURG 2020
               7-P-46 Construction or expansion of roadways and intersections within the City
                      shall not result in the severance of an existing bicycle route, unless an
                      alternative exists or is provided.
               7-P-47 Develop a multi-use bicycle path (approx. 2.5 miles) along the
                      abandoned railroad tracks north of Willow Pass Road, providing linkage
                      between Downtown and the Stake Point/Marina area.
               7-P-48 Ensure that construction of bulb-outs and curb extensions at
                      intersections for pedestrian safety does not endanger bicyclists by
                      forcing them into traffic lanes.
               7-P-49 Pursue construction of a bicycle path connecting Railroad Avenue to
                      North Parkside Drive through City Park. Include appropriate signage
                      and storage facilities.
               7-P-50 Improve signage, notifying vehicles of bicyclists at dangerous
                      intersections and underpasses, such as the Railroad Avenue/State Route
                      4 interchange.
               7-P-51 Consider redesigning the Railroad Avenue linear park to accommodate
                      bicycles. Ensure that future greenways throughout the City contain
                      multi-use paths.
               7-P-52 Require that new arterial and collector streets accommodate bicyclists.
               7-P-53 Require that any grind and overlay of existing arterial and collector
                      streets consider that needs of bicyclists.
               7-P-54 Amend Engineering standards to require the use of bicycle grates on all
                      new catch basins and storm drain inlet replacements on streets.

7.5         TRANSPORTATION DEMAND MANAGEMENT
Transportation Demand Management (TDM) programs are intended to reduce the
amount of peak period (rush hour) traffic on City roadways and highways.
Employees are encouraged to reduce their use of the single-occupant automobile
as the primary mode of transportation to the workplace, and to travel during non-
peak times. In order to fulfill the requirements of the CMP and the growth
management requirements of Measure J, all jurisdictions within Contra Cost
County must adopt a TDM Ordinance or Resolution.
Many major employers in East County have TDM programs, although the
requirements for these programs have been overturned in the state legislature1.
Employers should be encouraged to have TDM programs and new employment
centers should be designed to incorporate on-site showers, bicycle storage
facilities, and transit shelters where appropriate.
The City should consider developing a program of bicycle circulation
improvements, including bike paths, bike lanes, and bike routes. Opportunities to
connect private development to bicycle facilities should be included in future
planning studies. Adding bicycle lanes to roadway widening projects and bicycle
detection loops with new signal installations should be considered as part of the
City’s Capital Improvement Program.
Typical components of TDM programs include:
•   A carpool/vanpool match program
•   Preferential parking for carpools and vanpools
•   Secure bicycle storage facilities
•   On-site shower facilities
•   Flex-time or staggered work hours that begin and/or end outside the peak
    commute hours

  Bay Area Air Quality Management District’s Regulation 13, Rule 1, requiring employers with over 100
employees to decrease the average vehicle ridership was overturned.

               • On-site shuttle bus service to transit stations
               • A commitment to future shuttle bus service to BART stations
               GOALS: TRANSPORTATION DEMAND MANAGEMENT
               7-G-17 Encourage major employers to develop and implement Transportation
                      Demand Management programs to reduce peak-period trip generation.
               POLICIES: TRANSPORTATION DEMAND MANAGEMENT
               7-P-55 Encourage major employers (for example: USS-POSCO, DOW
                      Chemical, City of Pittsburg) to adopt Transportation Demand
                      Management programs that would reduce peak-period trip generation by
                      15 percent or more.
               7-P-56 Favor Transportation Demand Management programs that limit vehicle
                      use over those that extend the commute hour.
                       Programs such as ridesharing and public transit reduce overall vehicle travel
                       while flex-time and staggered work hours simply shift traffic to less
                       congested times of day.
               7-P-57 During review of development plans, encourage major employers to
                      establish designated carpool parking areas and secure bicycle facilities
                      in preferable on-site locations (for example, under parking shelters or
                      closest to main entryways).
               7-P-58 Allow the reduction of transportation impact fees on new non-residential
                      development commensurate with provision of Transportation Demand
                      Management measures.
                       Project proponents taking advantage of reductions must agree to adopt and
                       implement specified TDM measures as a condition of project approval.

8 OPEN SPACE, YOUTH AND RECREATION
This element outlines the City’s policy approach to developing parks, open spaces,
and trails, in addition to supporting recreational, cultural, and educational programs
and facilities.
The City’s park system provides a variety of community and neighborhood parks and
facilities for local residents. The majority of the open space acreage within the
Planning Area (4,590 acres) consists of three large passive recreational areas – Black
Diamond Mines Regional Preserve, Browns Island Regional Shoreline, and
Stoneman Park. Local and regional trails traversing the City provide connections to
and from local neighborhoods, commercial districts, and parks. In addition, the City
provides limited access to the Suisun Bay shoreline.
Expansion of recreational/educational programs for local youth, and provision of
additional recreational/cultural facilities is projected within buildout of this General
Plan. Other public facilities, including water and sewer, solid waste, and fire
protection, are discussed in Chapter 11: Public Facilities.

               • Linear Parks. Often located along natural or man-made corridors such as rivers or
                  rail lines, linear parks provide landscaped paths for walking and biking. Ideally,
                  linear parks create linkages between other parks, community facilities, and
                  neighborhoods. The City is currently developing a linear park along the Eighth
                  Street portion of the former Sacramento Northern Railroad right-of-way.
               • Mini-Parks. Mini-parks are usually small play areas or green spaces designed for
                  small children or for visual purposes. When designed for special groups, mini-
                  parks should be located near those populations, such as family housing areas or
                  senior centers. There are currently five mini-parks in Pittsburg, as well as the
                  Heritage Plaza corridor system in Downtown.
               Open Space
               • Regional Preserves. The primary purpose of Regional Preserve areas is the
                  conservation of natural resources. Browns Island Regional Shoreline, which is
                  accessible only by boat, is a refuge for migrating shorebirds. The Black Diamond
                  Regional Preserve, located south of Pittsburg in Contra Costa County, offers tours
                  of abandoned coal mining tunnels and many miles of hiking trails. Both preserves
                  under the jurisdiction of the East Bay Regional Park District (EBRPD) are within
                  Pittsburg’s Planning Area.
               • Open Space. Open space, as designated by the General Plan, consists of privately-
                  owned, undeveloped land. Steep, unstable hillside areas in new residential
                  developments are considered open space areas, as well as large tracts of open
                  land beyond the proposed limits of urban growth. Most open space areas consist
                  of natural grassy slopes, cattle grazing, and/or wildlife habitat.

Pittsburg’s Public Works Department manages the maintenance of the City’s park
facilities, while the Recreation Department manages the operation of the parks. The
Planning and Building and Engineering Departments are responsible for acquisition
and development of park facilities. Pittsburg has approximately 312 acres of parkland
within the City’s local park system, ranging in size from quarter-acre mini parks to
the 190-acre Stoneman Park. Pittsburg’s park facilities are described in Table 8-1.
All of the City’s neighborhood parks are located near collector streets in residential
neighborhoods, while community parks lie along arterial roadways to serve the larger
City population. Central Harbor Park is located along the waterfront adjacent to
Downtown, providing public access to this tremendous aquatic resource. City Park is
a valuable community park that lies between the Civic Center and Downtown
Pittsburg, featuring several baseball diamonds, volleyball courts, and a large group
picnic area with bandstand. Stoneman Park consists primarily of picnic facilities and
passive recreational facilities, including hiking trails along grassy canyons, directly
adjacent to Pittsburg’s Delta View Golf Course.                                         Stoneman Park (located on West Leland Road, just west of
                                                                                        Golf Course) provides a variety of leisure opportunities for
                                                                                        City residents.
The pace of parkland acquisition in Pittsburg has decreased in the last decade.
Although the City’s park standard remains at five acres per 1,000 residents, only 2.9
acres of additional parkland per 1,000 new residents has been achieved since 1988.
However, currently proposed park sites will provide the City with additional
neighborhood parks intended to serve the residential population. The addition of the
proposed park sites listed in Table 8-2 will increase the City’s parkland to
approximately 404 acres. Consideration of the City’s linear park facilities (Eighth
Street, Sante Fe, and Columbia) brings the City’s parkland total to 417 acres,
resulting in a total of 4.5 acres of parks per 1,000 residents in 2020 (assuming a
buildout population of 93,340).
                                                                                                                                                   8-5

PARK DEDICATION AND IMPROVEMENTS
The City currently maintains a neighborhood and community park standard of five
acres per 1,000 residents, the maximum permitted under the Quimby Act, which also
forms the basis of the City’s dedication and park fee requirements. Virtually all
parkland over the last 10 years has been acquired through dedication and not through
active acquisition. While this process has allowed the City to acquire developed
parkland, in many instances the parks dedicated by residential developers are not
highly visible or accessible. Land dedication has been useful in ensuring provision of
pockets of open space as part of planned developments; however, these open spaces
generally do not include park amenities.
The two street lighting and landscaping maintenance districts in the City help to
ensure that City parks are improved and maintained as needed, by assessing a voter-
approved $77.18 per unit. Revenues from the maintenance districts are very limited
and other sources have been, and will continue to be, necessary for further park
improvements.
                                                                                                                                                   8-7

        The demand by new residential development for parks and open space facilities
        is a well-known calculation among Californian cities, but the additional
        demands on park facilities by employees of local businesses (for example,
        eating lunch in a park or jogging along the waterfront after work) who are not
        residents must also be considered.
8-P-6   Revise the City’s Park Dedication Ordinance to define useable area for
        parkland dedication requirements. Proposed park sites should be:
        • Designed such that 80 percent of the site has slopes of less than 3
             percent that are suitable for active recreational play;
        • Sized according to the City’s park standard of 5 acres per 1,000
             residents (for example, a 200-unit subdivision would yield about 600
             residents, and a dedication requirement of 3 acres);
        • Available for year-round use, so that detention basins are not
             designated as parkland or shared park facilities; and
        • A minimum of 2 contiguous acres in new residential neighborhoods.
8-P-7   Encourage the development or provision of facilities that cater to diverse
        recreational interests.
        These facilities could provide hard-surface courts in-lieu of turf areas, which
        include but are not limited to activities such as tennis, skateboarding,
        hand/racquetball, bocce ball, basketball, volleyball, badminton, and roller hock-
        ey. These may be provided within existing parks or constructed as specific-use
        facilities.
Design and Natural Resources
8-P-8   Preserve areas of riparian and other wildlife habitat, oak woodland, and
        other significant biotic resources within parks. Design park improvements
        to be compatible with the preservation of such resource areas.
                                                                                                                           8-9

                                                                           When in-lieu fees are collected, ensure that they are spent acquiring and

8-P-12 Ensure that all parks acquired through dedication are at least 2 acres in size within
       new residential developments (target 5 acres). Accept smaller visual open space
       areas in new commercial and industrial development for parkland dedications.
       Several of the newer mini-parks contained within residential developments lack
       necessary park amenities, such as benches. The provision of visual open space as
       parkland dedication in commercial developments is reasonable. However, residential
       developments must provide more usable open space areas.
8-P-13 Limit parkland dedications to flat, usable parcels within new residential
       neighborhoods (see Policy 8-P-6 above). Ensure that such park sites provide open,
       grassy areas for informal recreational play (such as football or soccer).
8-P-14 Develop a maintenance-funding plan for all City parks. Consider participation in
       parkland maintenance districts as a condition of development approval for new
       residential subdivisions.
       Maintenance of existing and new parks is essential in the on-going use of developed
       parkland. A citywide plan for funding the maintenance and improvement of all City
       parks will ensure that the citizens of Pittsburg derive the full benefits of City parkland.
       Requiring new residential development to secure funding sources for the maintenance
       of new parks will allow the City to continue developing and maintaining recreational
       facilities on a limited budget.
8-P-15 Work with PG&E to obtain ownership of lands within the transmission corridor,
       south of State Route 4 (as designated on Figure 2-2), for development of a
       community park.
8-P-16 Encourage dedication of public parks in new residential developments with more
       than 150 units.
       Current and proposed parks are not sufficient to meet City’s park standard (See
       Policy 8-P-1). In addition to the parks identified in Figure 8-1 and Table 8-2, the
       City should consider new sites to add to its park system.
                                                                                                                                   8-11

       to inform visitors of wildlife species and educational programs associated with
       the island.
8-P-18 Cooperate with regional agencies to develop a “Bay to Black Diamond”
       trail through the City, providing a diversity of passive recreational
       opportunities and unique vistas.
       The passive recreational uses currently available at Black Diamond Mines
       include miles of hiking, biking and jogging trails. The City should promote the
       extension of these trails north through the City, connecting local park facilities
       with the Suisun Bay waterfront and Black Diamond Mines Regional Preserve.
8-P-19 Cooperate with East Bay Municipal Utility District to ensure continued
       public access to the Delta De Anza Trail, along the Mokelumne Aqueduct
       right-of-way.
8-P-20 Pursue the development and extension of local and regional trails
       throughout the Planning Area by utilizing available public utility rights-of-
       way including:
                                                                                                                          8-13

                      • Kirker Creek. The Kirker Creek easement could be developed as a
                           creekside trail, connecting other trails and open spaces throughout the
                           City with the hiking trails in the Black Diamond Mines Regional
                           Preserve.
                      • Contra Costa Canal. The Contra Costa Canal provides a meandering
                           right-of-way throughout the southern portion of Pittsburg. A trail along
                           this right-of-way could link several neighborhoods with the Railroad
                           Avenue commercial corridor.
                      • PG&E Utility ROW. PG&E holds a right-of-way for the power/utility
                           lines that run north-south from the southern hills to the power plant on
                           the waterfront, an ideal corridor for public access.
                      These rights-of-way are all considered privately owned open space, but may
                      have development potential for recreational trails. Where possible, use trails
                      and linear parks to connect other parks and recreational facilities within the
                      Planning Area.
               8-P-21 Encourage new residential development in hillside areas to develop public
                      trails and/or trailheads providing connections to other regional and local
                      open spaces.
                      Hillside residential subdivisions are developed using clustering techniques to
                      avoid steep, unstable slopes. Recreational trails, however, can be provided
                      through the open space pockets to provide residents with access to the larger
                      trails network within the Pittsburg Planning Area.
               8-P-22 Preserve land under Williamson Act contract in agriculture, consistent with
                      State law, until urban services are available and expansion of development
                      would occur in an orderly and contiguous fashion.

8.4       WATERFRONT ACCESS
Parks and recreation areas along the City’s waterfront can take advantage of one of
Pittsburg’s most identifiable resources, the Delta shoreline. Historically, Pittsburg’s
waterfront was used for docking, fishing and canning, and shipping of coal. Black
Diamond Mines was the first source of fossil fuel discovered in California, and
railways bisected the Planning Area to transport coal and cargo to Suisun Bay. Later,
steel, chemical production, and other heavy industries developed along the eastern
shore, while Concord Naval Weapons Station spread out to the west.
Currently, the small portion of waterfront adjacent to Downtown consists of small-
craft marinas. However, both physical and visual public access to and along the
shoreline is lacking. Although nearly three miles of shoreline lie within the city
limits, only two small recreational areas—Central Harbor Park and Riverview Park—
provide public access to the waterfront. Along the City’s shoreline east of
Downtown, heavy industrial uses on privately-owned land continue to dominate.
Public access, in the form of shoreline trails or smaller park access points, would
maximize the City’s use of this limited natural resource. Waterfront development
standards may require wider setbacks from both residential and industrial
development projects to provide the City with desired waterfront access.
Views from the public spaces, including Downtown and street rights-of-way, to the
Delta shoreline are also limited. Waterfront development standards should also
ensure that new development projects are designed to provide maximum views of the
shoreline. Increasing the shoreline’s presence within Pittsburg can provide local
residents with an improved sense of community identity.
                                                                                                                        8-15

               8-G-5  Maximize public access to and recreational facilities along the City’s
                      waterfront areas.
               8-G-6  Improve linkages between the waterfront, Downtown core, and other
                      recreational open spaces within the City.
               8-G-7  Promote improved views of the shoreline from public parks and rights-of-
                      way.
               POLICIES: WATERFRONT ACCESS
               8-P-23 Develop standards for all new waterfront development that ensure adequate
                      setbacks from the mean high tide line. Encourage, where possible, provision
                      of public access to the shoreline.
                      A waterfront development setback will ensure that new development along the
                      water provides adequate space for a shoreline trail allowing residents access to
                      the Suisun Bay.
               8-P-24 During review of development plans, pursue preservation of lands where
                      streets terminate at the waterfront. Such lands should be improved as public
                      open space, ensuring that undisturbed views of Suisun Bay and New York
                      Slough are preserved.
                      The development of lands at street terminuses for waterfront parks will provide
                      City residents with views of and identifiable public access to the Delta
                      shoreline.
               8-P-25 Emphasize the importance of public views of the shoreline (from public
                      spaces and rights-of-way) when reviewing new development projects along
                      the water.
                      Work with developers to ensure that new development along the waterfront,
                      particularly adjacent to Downtown, provides both site tenants and the larger
                      public with views of the Delta shoreline. Inform developers of this City policy

       projects.
8-P-26 Explore all potential improvements to fully integrate the City’s shoreline
       into the urban fabric, including:
       • Waterfront Parks. Pursue and develop small pockets of open space that
           provide physical and visual access to the waterfront.
       • Waterfront Trail/Bikeway. A linear park along the shoreline, featuring a
           path for both walking and biking, would encourage more vibrant
           activity along the waterfront.
       • Landscaping. Plant low-growing and flowering greenery near
           waterfront access points to extend streetscaping to the shoreline.
       • Linear Trail Connections. The City’s current linear trail network within
           Downtown and adjacent residential neighborhoods could be extended to
           provide convenient access to waterfront parks and activities.
       Increased shoreline access, improved landscaping and amenities in accessible
       areas, as well as linkages to nearby neighborhoods and Downtown, would draw
       more residents and visitors to Pittsburg’s Downtown area. Any linear park con-
       nection made to provide access to the shoreline will improve residents’ sense of
       identity with the waterfront.

                                                             community. Because of Pittsburg’s ethnic and socio-economic diversity, the City
                                                             must provide a wide variety of recreational and education programs at low costs.
                                                             Fortunately, Pittsburg maintains a variety of recreational facilities, including
                                                             community centers, a swimming pool, baseball diamonds and basketball courts, a
                                                             golf course, nature trails, and a community theatre.
                                                             Nearly one-third of Pittsburg’s population is age 17 or younger. A high proportion of
                                                             youths, who are free from classes in mid-afternoon, creates a definite need for
                                                             recreational and cultural programs within the City. The development of teen facilities

                                                             Additionally, as Pittsburg’s population ages, there is likely to be a greater demand for
                                                             senior services and activities. The development of a Senior Center provides local

                                                             health and diet programs, and social events.
                                                             There are many private cultural programs and groups within Pittsburg that need
                                                             significant cultural facilities in which to meet and perform. However, local
                                                             community centers are aging and library collections are becoming antiquated. High
                                                             priority should be placed on the development of such facilities, potentially in

           youth to meet and interact, or to participate in after-school, athletic, or
           cultural activities.
       • Gymnasium. A large gymnasium would provide the City with more
           opportunity to get youth involved in local sports leagues and after-
           school drop-in games, such as basketball.
       • Skateboard Park. Construction of a skateboard park would provide
           challenging topography in a controlled environment for local
           skateboarders. The City is currently working on the development of such
           a facility.

Educational facilities within Pittsburg include elementary and secondary schools, a
community college, and a public library. All of the public schools in Pittsburg are
within either Pittsburg Unified School District or Mount Diablo Unified School
District. However, a few residential blocks in the southeast portion of the City are
located within the Antioch School District boundaries. Public school district
boundaries and facilities are identified in Figure 8-2.
In addition to elementary and secondary schools, two continuation schools, two
private parochial schools (Saint Peter Martyr School and Lighthouse Christian Center
School), and Los Medanos Community College operate within the Planning Area.

Planning Area) include three elementary schools (grades K-5), one middle school
(grades 6-8), and one continuation school. Several MDUSD schools within the
Pittsburg Planning Area have reached or are nearing capacity. The expansion of
residential development into the southern hills will also result in the need for
additional MDUSD school sites within city limits. Proposed schools include San
Marco Elementary School, and potential conversion of an existing school site within
the Planning Area to a high school facility.

Total enrollment for 1999-2000 was 21,338 students, including PUSD, MDUSD, Los
Medanos Community College, private schools, and alternative education. Analysis of
enrollment figures versus school capacities indicates that a majority of schools are
currently operating above capacity (eight elementary schools, two middle schools,
and Pittsburg High School). On average, Pittsburg Unified School District is
operating at 113 percent of capacity.

ENROLLMENT PROJECTIONS
Enrollment projections based on California Department of Finance age cohort
projections and General Plan buildout estimates result in an increase of
approximately 4,415 students within PUSD and MDUSD by 2020. Table 8-6 shows
that the student body of PUSD will increase by 13 percent, while new residential
development proposed for the southwestern portion of the City will double MDUSD
enrollment.

Retaining all existing school sites in PUSD will allow future classes to drop below
capacity limits within most PUSD facilities. However, MDUSD must begin planning
the construction or conversion of school sites in order to accommodate anticipated
population growth – two additional elementary schools and one high school will be
needed by General Plan buildout. Proposed school sites are listed in Table 8-7.
Additional school sites may be identified through negotiations with the school
districts to accommodate population growth within the Southwest Hills subarea.

               LIBRARY SERVICES
               The Pittsburg branch of the Contra Costa County Library is located at 80 Power
               Avenue. It is one of 23 branches within the County Library system. Programs held at
               the Pittsburg branch include Story Time for children ages three to five, an
               Introduction to Guide Dogs family program, and other special events. The Friends of
               the Pittsburg Library hold various book sales and fund-raising events to keep the
               library collection up-to-date, as well as volunteer with restocking and organizing
               book shelves during library hours.
               GOALS: EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES
               8-G-10 Ensure that school facilities maintain adequate capacity to provide for
                           current and projected enrollment.
               8-G-11 Develop land uses, activities and connections surrounding Los Medanos
                           Community College to foster linkages between the campus and the
                           community.
               POLICIES: EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES
               8-P-39 Work with Mount Diablo Unified School District to ensure that the timing of
                           school construction and/or expansion is coordinated with phasing of new
                           residential development.

       The distribution and growth of residential land uses as projected by the General
       Plan have a significant effect on projected school enrollment. The City is
       currently reviewing a number of proposed residential subdivisions in the
       southern portion of the City. Mount Diablo Unified School District must ensure
       that adequate school facilities are provided for the youth population of these
       growing areas. The Schools Master Plan should consider the General Plan land
       use distribution and plan school locations and improvements accordingly.
8-P-40 Encourage the MDUSD to reopen the former Pacifica High School or
       cooperate with MDUSD to identify possible sites for the construction of a
       new high school facility and/or middle school facility, or both.
       Current residents of the Pittsburg Planning Area located within MDUSD boun-
       daries use high school facilities that are located within adjacent communities,
       such as Concord.
                                                                                        Highlands Elementary serves approximately 700 Pittsburg
8-P-41 As part of development review for large residential subdivisions (greater children.
       than 100 units), evaluate the need for new school sites. If needed,
       encourage subdivision design to accommodate school facilities and
       cooperate with the school districts in acquisition of those sites.
8-P-42 Cooperate with local school districts to develop joint school/park facilities,
       which provide an increased variety of recreational opportunities close to
       many residential areas. Additionally, work with school districts to develop
       public parks adjacent to school facilities.
       Joint school/park planning provides more opportunity for recreational uses near
       residential areas with reduced design, construction, and maintenance costs to
       both parties. Cooperation with the school districts on the four proposed school
       sites listed in Table 8-7 would provide a dramatic increase in recreational
       facilities for local youth.
                                                                                                                                               8-27

               8-P-43 Emphasize the integration of land uses and activities surrounding Los
                      Medanos Community College. Encourage physical connections between the
                      College and surrounding neighborhoods, commercial areas, and open
                      space resources.
                      As planned expansions of the campus take place, connections between the
                      college and surrounding residential and commercial areas become more
                      important. Encourage use of the Delta De Anza Trail by students, since the
                      bikeway provides excellent connections to residential areas within the City. As
                      the area between State Route 4 and East Leland Road is redeveloped, such
                      connections can help the new urban uses and Los Medanos Community College
                      complement one another.
               8-P-44 Pursue joint-planning of recreational and cultural facilities on Los
                      Medanos Community College campus. Work with the community college
                      Board to allow public access to recreational facilities and programs.
                      College campuses often provide exceptional recreational and cultural facilities
                      for use by enrolled students. Partnering with the community college Board may
                      tremendously increase the facilities and programs available to local residents.
               8-P-45 Promote use of the educational and cultural resources available at the
                      Pittsburg Library.

                                                            wetland communities, and scattered stands of trees.

                                                            The Planning Area contains a significant amount of open space, which is valuable
                                                            as both a visual resource and as habitat for oak woodlands, wetlands and riparian

                                                            The topography of the southern portion of Pittsburg is such that relatively smaller
                                                            ridgelines filter into and merge with larger ridgelines. These larger ridgelines,
                                                            which are designated as major ridgelines in Figure 9-1, are the highest and most

                                                            Area where coal was mined. The discovery of coal in the 1850s led to construction
                                                            of Black Diamond Mines, the first source of fossil fuel in California. Sand mining
                                                            was also conducted starting in the late 1920s. Due to competition from other ener-

               mining operations, as well as the former mining towns of Nortonville and
               Somersville, can still be found in the southern hills. While coal mining no longer
               takes place, livestock still graze in the hills.
               There are currently no significant mineral deposits or active mining operations in
               the Planning Area. The hills south of City limits may contain mineral deposits,
               though their significance is not known. A small portion of the hills is considered
               farmland of local importance. Over 3,500 acres of land in the Planning Area is
               currently under Williamson Act contracts, which entitle landowners to property
               tax reductions in exchange for preserving their land as agricultural or open space.
               Williamson Act contracts are automatically renewed each year for at least 10
               years, unless cancellation is sought. These lands are considered agricultural
               preserves.
               VEGETATION AND WILDLIFE
               Historic vegetation in Pittsburg included native grassland, oak woodlands, riparian
               communities, and coastal salt and brackish marshes. Figure 9-1 shows the
               vegetative communities within the Planning Area.
               The Planning Area hosts an abundance of vegetation types, with a diverse
               population of plant species. Vegetative communities can be divided into two
               categories based on habitat sensitivity:
               • Level One communities are those that are or most closely resemble (in form
                   and function) native habitats. Within the Planning Area, these include
                   grassland, salt marsh-pickleweed series, seasonal wetland, riparian woodland,
                   and the open waters of Suisun Bay.
               • Level Two communities are areas that have been significantly altered by
                   humans and include development and landscaping. These areas provide
                   minimal habitat for native vegetation and wildlife.
               Human intervention and development have altered the landscape, restricting
               natural vegetation primarily to undeveloped hillside areas. The southern third of
               the Planning Area is largely undeveloped open space with large expanses of

rolling grassy hills, while the northern edge consists of salt and brackish
marshlands at New York Slough. These natural areas may be suitable for several
threatened and endangered plant and animal species, such as the Western pond
turtle, California red-legged frog, San Joaquin kit fox, Berkeley kangaroo rat,
Tricolored blackbird, White-tailed kite, Mt Diablo manzanita, Alkali milk-vetch,
Diamond-petaled poppy, and Mason’s lilaeopsis. Areas of particular biological
concern within the Planning Area include Browns Island Regional Shoreline and
Black Diamond Mines Regional Preserve and environs. Special status species
which may be found within the Planning Area are listed in Table 9-1.
WETLANDS
Wetlands are ecologically productive habitats that support a variety of both plant
and animal life. The importance and sensitivity of wetlands has increased with
population growth as a result of their role as recharge areas and filters for water
supplies. However, much of the region’s wetlands have been filled for urban
development. Two types of wetlands occur within the Planning Area:
• Fresh emergent wetlands within Pittsburg occur in Kirker Creek, Lawlor
     Ravine, and several of their tributaries located in the Mount Diablo foothills.
     This habitat is generally considered one of the most productive habitats for
     wildlife because it offers water, food and cover. Habitat modification in the
     northern planning area has severely reduced the vegetative structure of the
     habitat and its overall value for wildlife.
• Saline emergent wetlands, found along tidal salt marshes, serve as an
     important habitat for many threatened species such as the California clapper
     rail, salt marsh harvest mouse, and California black rail.
                                                                                                           9-5

GOALS: BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES AND HABITAT
9-G-1  Protect conservation areas, particularly habitats that support special status species,
       including species that are State or Federally listed as endangered, threatened, or
       rare (see Table 9-1).
9-G-2  Guide development in such a way that preserves significant ecological resources.
9-G-3  Support the reclamation of wetlands and marshlands along local industrial
       waterfronts.
POLICIES: BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES AND HABITAT
9-P-1  Ensure that development does not substantially affect special status species, as
       required by State and federal agencies and listed in Table 9-1. Conduct assessments
       of biological resources as required by CEQA prior to approval of development
       within habitat areas of identified special status species, as depicted in Figure 9-1.
        Development located in or adjacent to these ecologically sensitive areas must complete
        a site-specific assessment of biological resources as part of the development review
        process. The City’s environmental review process would be used to impose appropriate
        mitigation measures as required by State and federal agencies to reduce impacts on
        sensitive habitat and special status species.
9-P-2  Establish an on-going program to remove and prevent the re-establishment of
       invasive species and restore native species as part of development approvals on
       sites that include ecologically sensitive habitat.
        Non-native vegetation originally introduced as landscaping, such as giant reed,
        currently threaten habitat for threatened and endangered plant and animal species
        within the City. Guidelines should be developed that include a list of native species that
        may be planted as part of landscaping associated with future development. Drought
        tolerant and low maintenance species should be emphasized. Removal of invasive
        species may also be required if they are a notable fire hazard in parks or open space.
                                                                                                                        9-11

               9-P-3     Participate in the development of a regional Habitat Conservation Plan
                         (HCP) and consider its adoption for preservation of native species
                         throughout eastern Contra Costa County.
               Hillside Protection
               9-P-4     Revise and readopt the City’s Hillside Planned Development District to
                         regulate urban growth in the southern hills. Include development
                         standards as part of the zoning district, and refer to it during project
                         review.
                          Development standards within the Hillside Planned Development District
                          should limit development in hillside areas, emphasizing 1) retention or
                          stabilization of unstable slopes, 2) major and minor ridgelines as designated
                          by Figure 4-2, and 3) creeks, swales, and wetlands that contribute to hillside
                          drainage (See also Chapter 10: Health and Safety for discussion on slopes
                          and drainage).
               9-P-5     Work with Contra Costa County, the East Bay Regional Park District,
                         and the City of Antioch, to expand the regional open-space system in the
                         southern hills to preserve California annual grasslands habitat.
               9-P-6     In order to preserve viewsheds of the southern hills, preserve major
                         ridgelines (shown in Figure 9-1) throughout the Planning Area. Revise
                         the Municipal Code per Policy 4-P-1: building pads and structural
                         elements shall be located at least 150 feet away from (horizontally) the
                         crest of a major ridgeline.
               9-P-7     During the design of hillside residential projects, encourage clustering
                         of housing to preserve large, unbroken blocks of open space, particularly
                         within sensitive habitat areas. Encourage the provision of wildlife
                         corridors to ensure the integrity of habitat linkages.
               9-P-8     As a condition of approval of new development, ensure revegetation of
                         cut-and-fill slopes with native plant species.

                                                                                                                 9: RESOURCE CONSERVATION
         In addition, planting on some existing slopes could contribute to Pittsburg’s
         image and would be a justified public cost.
Creekways and Wetlands
9-P-9   Establish creek setbacks along riparian corridors, extending a minimum
        of 50 to 150 feet laterally on each side of the creekbed. Setback buffers
        for habitat areas of identified special status species and wetlands may be
        expanded as needed to preserve ecological resources.
9-P-10 Prohibit development within creek setback areas, except as part of
        greenway enhancement (for example, trails and bikeways). Encourage
        developers to reserve space outside of the creek setbacks where
        endangered species habitat makes trail development inappropriate.
9-P-11 Ensure that riparian corridor characteristics are retained. Encourage
        the retention and/or reestablishment of creeks in the design of new
        development.
9-P-12 Protect and restore threatened natural resources, such as estuaries, tidal
        zones, marine life, wetlands, and waterfowl habitat.                           Pittsburg’s downtown waterfront marina (sign reads
                                                                                       “Pittsburg Yacht Club”) is an important ecological and
         While much of the marshland and mudflats in the Planning Area are intact,     recreational resource.
         potential for reclamation exists in areas where these have been destroyed,
         especially along the industrial waterfronts. Potential for this reclamation
         may exist as some of these sites are converted to other uses.
         A potential way to promote the value of Pittsburg’s natural resources is
         through education. The City could heighten public awareness of the
         importance of local marshlands for roosting and nesting sites for migrating
         waterfowl by creating interpretive facilities with educational displays along
         the marshlands when possible.
9-P-13 Ensure that special-status species and sensitive habitat areas are
        preserved, as required by State and federal agencies, during
        redevelopment and intensification of industrial properties along the
                                                                                                                                              9-13

                         Suisun Bay waterfront. Limit dredging and filling of wetlands and
                         marshlands, particularly adjacent to Browns Island Preserve.
               9-P-14 Work with industrial property-owners along the waterfront to improve
                         urban runoff and water quality levels within Suisun Bay wetlands.
               9.2       DRAINAGE AND EROSION
               The developed portions of the Pittsburg Planning Area are within two major
               watersheds: the western portion of the Lawlor Creek watershed, which drains into
               Suisun Bay, and the central and eastern portions of the Kirker Creek watershed,
               which drains into the New York Slough. In addition, there are six minor
               watersheds. Major and minor watersheds within the Planning Area are shown in
               Figure 9-2.
               The existing drainage system in Pittsburg is comprised primarily of channelized
               creeks fed by groundwater, surface runoff, and underground storm drains. The
               City maintains the system within incorporated areas. In unincorporated areas,
               responsibility for storm drain maintenance lies with the Contra Costa County
               Flood Control District. Development within the watersheds has the potential to
               lead to erosion of sediment and increases in surface water run-off entering the
               City’s storm drainage system.
               The storm drain facilities under the Contra Costa Canal also have the potential to
               become impaired if sedimentation were to occur from new upstream development.
               Obstruction of storm drains could cause sedimentation and debris to enter the
               Canal right-of-way, and potentially overtop into the Canal and/or exert pressure
               and damage the Canal lining or other facilities. This would result in contamination
               of Contra Costa Water District’s potable water supply.
               Pittsburg’s creeks are also a key part of the City’s open space network. They are
               valuable physical, aesthetic, recreational, and ecological assets. Protection of
               creeks not only preserves surface water quality, but also reduces flood risks,
               preserves bio-diversity and habitat, minimizes erosion of stream banks, and
               prevents downstream siltation.

               GOALS: DRAINAGE AND EROSION
               9-G-4  Minimize the runoff and erosion caused by earth movement by requiring
                      development to use best construction management practices (BMPs).
               9-G-5  Preserve and enhance Pittsburg’s creeks for their value in providing
                      visual amenity, drainage capacity, and habitat value.
               9-G-6  Preserve and protect the Contra Costa Canal from storm drainage and
                      runoff contaminating the City’s municipal water supply.
               POLICIES: DRAINAGE AND EROSION
               9-P-15 As part of development plans, require evaluation and implementation of
                      appropriate measures for creek bank stabilization, as well as necessary
                      Best Management Practices (BMPs) to reduce erosion and
                      sedimentation. Encourage preservation of natural creeks and riparian
                      habitat as best as possible.
               9-P-16 Establish development standards for new construction adjacent to
                      riparian zones to reduce sedimentation and flooding. Standards should
                      include:
                      • Requirements that low berms or other temporary structures such as
                          protection fences be built between a construction site and riparian
                          corridor to preclude sheet-flooding stormwater from entering the
                          corridors during the construction period.
                      • Requirements for installation of storm sewers before construction
                          occurs to collect stormwater runoff during construction.
               9-P-17 To prevent flood hazards in the Kirker Creek watershed, ensure that new
                      development minimizes paved areas, retaining large blocks of
                      undisturbed, naturally vegetated habitat to allow for water infiltration.

        Additional flood control mitigation may include intermixing areas of

9-P-19 As part of the City’s Zoning Ordinance, establish regulations for the
       preservation of mature trees. Include measures for the replacement of all
       mature trees removed.
        Trees are valuable along creeks and watersheds because their root systems
        help stabilize topsoil and reduce erosion.
9-P-20 As part of project review and approval, establish maintenance districts
       to ensure uniform maintenance for selected channels and creeks.

       storm-water facilities impacted by potential project runoff.
        Calculate potential sedimentation and runoff based on the maximum storm
        event and determine necessary capacity of the downstream drainage system.
        If the project presents potential downstream sedimentation, runoff or
        flooding issues, require additional mitigation including but not limited to
        limitations on grading, construction only in dry seasons, and funding for
        downstream improvements, maintenance, and repairs.

               POINT SOURCES
               “Point” sources—fixed structures or land uses—can potentially affect surface and
               groundwater supplies by discharging into the local storm drain system. These
               discharges consist mostly of effluent from industrial facilities and municipal
               wastewater systems, and are regulated under the Federal Water Pollution Control
               Act of 1972, more commonly known as the Clean Water Act. Waste discharges
               are regulated through the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
               (NPDES), with specific requirements established in each NPDES permit. NPDES
               permits are required for stormwater runoff in urban areas, and are administered by
               the California Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB).
               Because watersheds are not limited to municipal boundaries, regional watershed
               protection and pollution prevention efforts are important to maintaining the health
               of the local water supply. Pittsburg participates in a joint municipal NPDES
               permit with all other cities in Contra Costa County, under the County’s Clean
               Water Program. In addition to these regulations, the San Francisco Bay Region
               Basin Plan stipulates that discharges into cold or warm water habitats should not
               increase the natural temperature of the receiving waters by more than five degrees
               Fahrenheit.
               Many of the City’s industrial and service commercial sites are sources of soil and
               groundwater contamination. Examples of substances released by these businesses
               are petroleum hydrocarbons, metals, and volatile organic compounds.
               Contamination may be due to leaking under ground storage tanks, surface
               chemical releases, and accidental spills. The RWQCB identifies and monitors
               contaminated sites, and publishes listings of sites known to cause soil and
               groundwater pollution.
               NONPOINT SOURCES
               “Nonpoint” sources of pollution include general pollutants from streets, open
               areas, and urban lands. Runoff from these sources is generally not collected and
               directed into a wastewater treatment plant because it is difficult to regulate and

manage. This includes runoff from roads and parking lots due to leaking cars and
exhaust emissions, as well as industrial emissions and erosion.
The hills south of the city limits consist primarily of rangeland. Thus, the only
potential sources of surface water pollution are organic waste produced by cattle,
runoff from the area’s few inhabitants, and residue and debris from vehicles
traveling on Kirker Pass Road. These materials are ultimately washed into local
stream and drainage channels and carried by Kirker Creek through the City and
into the Delta.
BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES
In order to address several potential pollution sources, the City has developed a set
of Best Management Practices (BMPs). The southern portion of Kirker Creek,
New York Slough, and Suisun Bay are all identified as resources of special
recreational and habitat value, and have been assigned high priority for their
restoration. The focus of the BMPs is to ensure the City’s water resources are not
degraded by stormwater runoff. These practices include street sweeping, storm
drain stenciling, above and below ground facility inspections, household
hazardous waste programs, spill cleanup, reduction of herbicide and pesticide use,
diversion and treatment of runoff, and annual catch basin maintenance.
The City must also implement BMPs to the maximum extent practicable in order
to comply with the joint municipal NPDES permit, under the County’s Clean
Water Plan. The City has developed a Stormwater Management Plan to help
ensure compliance with the NPDES permit.

9.4       AIR QUALITY
Three types of air pollutants affect air quality in Pittsburg – criteria air pollutants,
toxic air contaminants, and odors and nuisances. The major source of air
pollutants in Pittsburg is motor vehicle emissions. Heavy commute patterns
throughout the San Francisco Bay Area have resulted in poor regional air quality
levels. However, newer model vehicles are producing ‘cleaner’ auto emissions,
and will counteract the negative air quality impacts associated with increased
vehicle use.
Criteria and toxic air contaminants (as described below) are controlled by the Bay
Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD). The City has a more direct
role in regulating odors and nuisances, and the release of particulate matter at
construction sites.
CRITERIA AIR POLLUTANTS
Criteria air pollutants—carbon monoxide, ozone, and particulate matter, including
nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, PM-10, and lead—are most pervasive in urban
environments, and state and national ambient air quality standards have been
established for them. The Bay Area’s topographical and wind factors reduce local
concentrations of criteria air pollutants in Pittsburg. Motor vehicles are expected
to continue to be a major source category for regional emissions.
Residential, industrial and commercial development in Pittsburg contributes to
regional emissions. Emissions are also generated through industrial and
                                                                                                              9-21

                                                             and other local dust sources, and may experience elevated concentrations of
                                                             carbon monoxide along congested freeway segments and at congested

                                                             The primary role of cities in achieving and maintaining regional air quality is
                                                             through land use decision-making, which can affect vehicle miles traveled, and
                                                             through other measures to manage the emission of pollutants. BAAQMD
                                                             identifies specific Transportation Control Measures (TCMs) which, together with
                                                             other approaches, may help reduce emissions in Pittsburg, contributing to regional
                                                             pollution control efforts.
                                                             TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANTS
                                                             Toxic air contaminants are those pollutants that occur at relatively low
                                                             concentrations and are associated with carcinogenic or other adverse health
                                                             effects, but for which no ambient air quality standards have been established.
                                                             These pollutants are typically carcinogens, mutagens, or reproductive toxins.
                                                             Regulation of toxic air contaminants is achieved through federal and State controls
                                                             on individual sources. The preferred technique for reducing toxic air emissions is
                                                             source reduction, and as part of a local control strategy in the Bay Area, all

                                                             required emission controls and limits.
                                                             The ambient background of toxic air contaminants is the combined result of many
                                                             diverse human activities, including gasoline stations, automobiles, dry cleaners,

ODORS AND NUISANCES
Odors and nuisances include those emissions which occur infrequently but which
have the potential to generate citizen complaints. BAAQMD records indicate that
certain industrial facilities in Pittsburg occasionally generate citizen complaints.
Increased buffering of incompatible uses and control of dust from construction are
potential local approaches to controlling odors and nuisances.
AIR QUALITY MONITORING STATIONS
BAAQMD operates a regional network of air pollution monitoring stations that
provide information on ambient concentrations of criteria air pollutants and toxic
air contaminants. The City’s main monitoring station is located at 583 West Tenth
Street, near the Mirant (formerly PG&E) power plant. This monitoring station was
built after the power plant went into commission, to ensure that the plant did not
negatively affect air quality levels on adjacent sites.
SENSITIVE RECEPTORS
Some people are more sensitive than others to air pollutants. Heightened
sensitivity may be caused by health problems, proximity to the emissions source,
and duration of exposure to air pollutants. Sensitive receptors are facilities that
house or attract children, the elderly, people with illnesses, or others who are
especially sensitive to the effects of air pollution. Hospitals, schools, convalescent
facilities, and residential areas are examples of sensitive receptors which should be

9-P-33 Encourage new residential development and remodeled existing homes
          to install clean-burning fireplaces and wood stoves.
           Residential woodburning is a growing source of localized air pollution.
           Woodsmoke released from fireplaces and wood stoves contains carbon
           monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and PM-10. Pollution can be reduced by
           installing gas fireplaces or EPA certified wood heaters.
9.5     HISTORICAL AND CULTURAL RESOURCES
Pittsburg is the site of a number of historical and archeological resources. While
only about one-third of Pittsburg has been studied for cultural resources, five
archeological sites are known to exist. In addition, historical resources from
Pittsburg’s coal and steel eras are still present. The existence of both historical
buildings and archeologically sensitive areas in Pittsburg speak to the importance
of policies that preserve such aspects of the City’s heritage.
HISTORICAL RESOURCES
Pittsburg played an important role in the history of Contra Costa County. As one
of the earliest industrial centers in the County, the City’s historical resources
encompass a broad range of activities. Resources from various aspects of the
City’s history reflect its role in industry, transportation, the military, and
entertainment:
• Industry. The discovery of coal in the 1850s led to construction of Black
    Diamond Mines, the first source of fossil fuel in California. In 1911, Columbia
    Steel Company (later US Steel, now USS-POSCO) opened its doors within
    Pittsburg.
    Then in 1916, production began at the Western Chemical plant (now DOW
    Chemical), which has become the largest non-refinery chemical production
    complex in the western United States. Small-scale fishing fleets docked out of
    Pittsburg Marina throughout the 1920s, and several canneries sprung up along
    the waterfront to accommodate the fishing industry.
                                                                                                         9-25

               • Transportation. Early railroads were constructed along Railroad Avenue and
                    across the Pittsburg-Antioch Highway to transport coal from Black Diamond
                    Mines to the San Joaquin River for shipment. Shipping operations were
                    conducted from a small wharf on New York Slough.
               • Military. Built in 1942, Camp Stoneman served as a staging and embarkation
                    facility for troops during World War II and the Korean conflict. The base was
                    deactivated in 1954.
               • Entertainment. The Black Diamond Theater (1909) and the Palace Theater
                    (1910), both on York Street, were the first theaters to present movies in Contra
                    Costa County. Vogue Theater (circa early 1930's) on Railroad and Central
                    Avenues is also historically significant.
               New York Landing Historical District
               To recognize and preserve the unique historical resources in Pittsburg, the City
               established the New York Landing Historical District in 1981. District boundaries
               were determined by researching the history and architectural significance of
               buildings in the area. Buildings in the Historical District were constructed between
               1914 and 1930, and reflect the architectural styles prevalent during that time
               period. Some structures, while not considered significant in and of themselves,
               enhance the overall character of the district.
               The Historical District is located at the core of Downtown Pittsburg. Railroad
               Avenue forms the central spine of the district, which has the following boundaries:
               Third Street to the north, Sixth Street to the south, Cumberland Street to the east,
               and Black Diamond Street to the west. This area is associated with many
               significant historical events, including the Rancho Los Medanos land grant, the
               first post office in Contra Costa County (built in the 1840s and initially located at
               Second and Black Diamond Streets), and sites of early fishing canneries,
               steamboat shops (for loading coal) and steel mills. The City’s historical resources
               are listed in Table 9-2 and illustrated in Figure 9-3 (except Resources 27-33,
               which are located outside of the New York Landing Historical District vicinity).

                                     The Pittsburg Planning Area encompasses a number of environmental settings including those where
                                     archeological sites may be found. Most Native American archeological sites in Pittsburg are in the form
                                     of small to large shell middens, some of which may contain human remains. These sites tend to be
                                     situated on alluvial flats and along historic margins, as well as near sources of water.
                                     The Planning Area contains a number of Native American archeological and historical areas that may be
                                     considered sensitive. An area that may be considered sensitive could mean one or more of the following:
                                     • Archeological sites have been identified in these areas;
                                     • Based on current knowledge, there is a high probability of identifying unrecorded archeological sites;
                                          or
                                     • Archeological sites have been identified in this area and there is a high potential for identifying
                                          additional sites.

PITTSBURG 2020
               Pittsburg's waterfront location and industrial history make the existence of addi-
               tional archeological resources likely. Archeological surveys are appropriate for
               specific plans and large project development activities. If site conditions indicate
               the presence of archeological resources, all building activity should cease until
               appropriate mitigation measures are in place.
               GOALS: HISTORICAL AND CULTURAL RESOURCES
               9-G-12 Encourage the preservation, protection, enhancement and use of
                         structures that:
                         • Represent past eras, events and persons important in history;
                         • Provide significant examples of architecture;
                         • Embody unique and irreplaceable assets to the City and its
                              neighborhoods; and
                         • Provide examples of the physical surroundings in which past
                              generations lived.
               9-G-13 Encourage municipal and community awareness, appreciation, and
                         support for Pittsburg’s historic, cultural, and archeological resources.
               POLICIES: HISTORICAL AND CULTURAL RESOURCES
               9-P-34 Encourage the preservation of varied architectural styles that reflect the
                         cultural, industrial, social, economic, political and architectural phases
                         of the City’s history.
               9-P-35 Expand the role of the City’s Historical Resources Commission,
                         currently responsible for only the New York Landing Historical District,
                         to include all historical resources. The Commission should be
                         responsible for designating historical resources, and acting as the
                         community’s liaison on these issues. However, the role of reviewing
                         development proposals and remodelings in the Historical District should
                         be transferred to the Planning Commission.

9-P-36 Provide for the educational and cultural enrichment of this and future
       generations by fostering knowledge of our heritage.
       Education and cultural enrichment of Pittsburg’s citizens will be a key
       element in the preservation of Pittsburg’s historical and cultural resources.
       The Historic Resources Commission should implement interpretive
       facilities within the Historical District, including displays and signs to
       promote education and understanding of existing historical resources.
9-P-37 Redefine the New York Landing Historical District to designate and
       preserve historical structures not currently located within the district
       boundaries.
       There are several structures outside the geographically distinct boundaries
       of the Historical District (See Figure 9-3: Historical Resources) that are
       important reflections of the City’s history: for example, Black Diamond
       Grammar School (West Eighth and Black Diamond Streets), Pittsburg
       Seventh Day Adventist Church (East Ninth and Los Medanos Streets), Saint
       Peter Martyr Church (West Eighth and Black Diamond Streets),
       Presbyterian Church (East Leland Road), and Hindu Temple (Crestview
       Drive). While these are not part of the Historical District, these resources
       are important and should be protected accordingly.
9-P-38 Explore mechanisms to incorporate Pittsburg’s industrial heritage in
       historic and cultural preservation.
       Pittsburg is one of the few Bay Area communities with a strong industrial
       past. The City’s past can be preserved through adaptive reuse of buildings,
       as is already occurring in downtown, and incorporation of aspects and relics
       of old structures in new public parks and open space. Emphasis should be
       placed on the preservation of relics from the coal, steel and canning
       industries that provided the base upon which the City developed.
9-P-39 Ensure the protection of known archeological resources in the City by
       acquiring a records review for any development proposed in areas of
                                                                                                          9-31

                      known resources. If such resources are found, limit urban development
                      in the vicinity or account for the resources.
               9-P-40 In accordance with State law, ensure the preparation of a resource
                      mitigation plan and monitoring program by a qualified archeologist in
                      the event that archeological resources are uncovered.
                       CEQA requires the evaluation of any archeological resource on the site of a
                       development project. State law also protects these resources. City
                       involvement in the identification, mitigation, and monitoring of project
                       impacts on these resources will ensure the protection of Pittsburg’s cultural
                       heritage.
               9-P-41 If archeological resources are found during ground-breaking for new
                      urban development, halt construction immediately and conduct an
                      archeological investigation to collect all valuable remnants.
               9-P-42 Develop an identification and preservation system for cultural
                      resources—those places or structures that qualify as “important” or
                      “unique” to local community, ethnic, or social groups.
               9-P-43 During redevelopment and rehabilitation of older residential units,
                      ensure that the development process complies with the lead testing
                      requirements established by Bay Area Air Quality Management District,
                      Contra Costa County Environmental Health District, and Housing and

10 HEALTH AND SAFETY
This element intends to identify and mitigate risks posed by geologic and seismic
conditions, prevent man-made risks stemming from use and transport of hazardous
materials, and ensure that local emergency response agencies are prepared for
potential disaster relief. Fire protection in urban and wildland areas is addressed in
Chapter 11: Public Facilities (Section 11.4: Fire Protection).

               10.1       GEOLOGY AND SEISMICITY
               The Pittsburg Planning Area is part of the geologically young and seismically
               active San Francisco Bay Area region. The composition of geologic material,
               topography, and groundwater conditions affect the severity of geologic hazards. In
               some soils, earthquake waves may be amplified and other areas may be
               susceptible to liquefaction and/or landslides.
               GEOLOGY
               Pittsburg consists of two general topographic zones: the lowland zone and the
               hillside zone. The lowland zone corresponds to estuarine and flatland soils, and
               the hillside zone includes steep slopes and rocky soils.
               • Lowland zone:
                    −   Estuarine (coastal) areas are underlain by Bay Mud, which consists of
                        unconsolidated silt and clay with abundant organic material, local peat,
                        sand, and gravel lenses or discontinuous beds (USGS, 1973). Local
                        deposits of artificial fill occur along the margins of Suisun Bay,
                        particularly around the power plant and in filled channels. Old fill
                        (generally placed before the 1950s) typically consisted of heterogeneous
                        material. Engineering challenges associated with coastal areas include
                        weak compressible soils and risk of liquefaction.
                    −   Flatland areas of Pittsburg are underlain by alluvial deposits,
                        unconsolidated flood-plain deposits, sand, silt, gravel, and clay, irregularly
                        interstratified.
               • Hillside zone:
                    −   Hillside areas of the City consist primarily of tilted marine sedimentary
                        and volcanic rocks that range in age from Paleocene to Pliocene. Hillside
                        areas in the western and southern portions of the Planning Area contain
                        steep slopes, weak bedrock, and local landslide deposits. The following
                        discussion of landslides, soil creep, debris flow, and hazards associated
                        with historic coal mining pertains mainly to the hillside zone.

                                                                                       10: HEALTH & SAFETY ELEMENT
Landsliding
Sedimentary rocks in the hillside zone have variable composition. These rocks are
generally weak and susceptible to erosion. Consistent weathering has further
weakened the rocks in many locations. Landslide deposits often occur along
deeply incised stream channels where erosion has undercut the channel banks.
Fracture planes occur throughout the southern hills and cuts made in these areas
are particularly susceptible to slope failure.
The strong ground motions that occur during earthquakes are capable of inducing
landslides where unstable soil conditions already exist. The portions of the
Planning Area having the greatest susceptibility to landsliding are hilly areas
underlain by weak bedrock units on slopes greater than 15 percent. Figure 10-1
illustrates lands within the Planning Area that are unstable; significant portions of
the southern hills are identified. Figure 10-1 also identifies those areas with slopes
greater than 30 percent. Residential and other sensitive development located
within these areas is at risk of property damage due to geologic accidents.
Soil Creep and Debris Flow
Expansive soils on moderate to steep slopes are subject to soil creep—a
downslope movement that occurs gradually as the soil shrinks and swells over
several years. Tilted fences observed in the southeastern Planning Area indicate
that soil creep has occurred. Construction practices that steepen existing slopes,
add weight to slopes by placing fill, or increase the rate of natural soil saturation
through landscape irrigation, can accelerate natural soil creep or induce it in areas
where it might not otherwise occur.
Slopes greater than about 20 percent are also susceptible to debris flows, sudden
soil slumps that occur when the ground is fully saturated by heavy rainfall.
Although debris flows can occur on any type of slope, they are more likely to
occur when runoff is concentrated within swales and gullies. Unlike soil creep,
debris flows can pose an immediate hazard to life and property.
                                                                                                               10-3

Historic Coal Mining
The Black Diamond area coal deposits (within the Domingene Formation) are
located in the southeastern portion of the Planning Area. Past mining activities
followed two principal coal seams to a depth of more than 550 feet below the
ground surface.
Access tunnel and ventilation shafts constructed as part of the mining operation
were generally located at the heads of ravines, where erosion had naturally worn
away portions of the hillside overlying the coal. Most access tunnels were well
documented, and have been relocated and sealed over the years. Ventilation shafts,
however, are more numerous and their locations are poorly documented. These
shafts were typically sealed through construction of timber floors placed about ten
feet below the ground surface and then backfilled to grade during closure of the
mine. The timber floors deteriorate over time and ventilation shafts can collapse,
creating soil slumps. Remaining mine openings provide a connection to a
labyrinth of subsurface tunnels which can contain cave-ins and unexpected drop-
offs. Pockets of poisonous carbon monoxide or methane gas may also be present.
Seismic Hazards
Eastern Contra Costa County, like the San Francisco Bay Area as a whole, is
located in one of the most seismically active regions in the United States. Major
earthquakes have occurred in the vicinity of Pittsburg in the past and can be
expected to occur again in the near future. Fault recurrence and slip rate data are
being obtained from marsh core samples, while uplifted fault areas are being
interpreted by detailed mapping of landform features and historical aerial
photography.
Table 10-1 describes the fault hazards located in the region, while Figure 10-2
illustrates fault hazards within the Pittsburg Planning Area. Historically active
faults (exhibiting evidence of movement in the last 200 years) in Contra Costa
County include the Concord, Hayward, and Clayton-Marsh Creek-Greenville

               faults. Two potentially active faults (showing evidence of movement within the
               last two million years) in the Planning Area include Franklin and Antioch faults.
               The largest active fault in the region, the San Andreas Fault, is located about 40
               miles west of Pittsburg.
               Geologic records indicate that there has been extensive differential movement
               along a series of northwest-trending splays of the Clayton and Black Diamond
               Area faults. These splays are centered within the Mount Diablo foothills, but
               extend into the southern portion of the Planning Area. These isolated faults are
               currently considered to be inactive. For planning purposes, however, these fault
               branches should be considered possible earthquake sources. Seismic activity on
               these relatively minor faults would not be expected to generate earthquakes of
               large magnitude and would probably not cause surface faulting.
               Groundshaking
               The intensity of groundshaking that would occur in Pittsburg as a result of an
               earthquake in the Bay Area would depend on the magnitude of the earthquake, the
               distance from the City, and the response of the geologic materials at the site.
               Ground shaking intensity is described using the Modified Mercalli Scale, which
               ranges from I (not felt) to XII (wide-spread devastation). When various earthquake
               scenarios are considered, groundshaking intensities will reflect both the effects of
               strong ground accelerations and the consequences of ground failure.
               According to the distribution of groundshaking intensity mapped by the
               Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG), a large earthquake on the
               Concord-Green Valley fault would produce the maximum ground shaking
               intensities in the City with Modified Mercalli intensity IX in Bay Mud deposits
               along Suisun Bay, north of State Route 4. Modified Mercalli intensity IX would
               cause damage to buried pipelines and partial collapse of poorly built structures.
               Strong ground shaking of Mercalli intensity VIII would occur locally along creek
               beds in inland portions of the City. However, most of Pittsburg is projected to
               experience ground shaking of intensity VII on the Modified Mercalli scale, which
               is associated with non-structural damage.
10-8
Landsliding is also likely to result from strong groundshaking, primarily where
unstable soil conditions already exist. Steep slopes underlain by weak bedrock,
particularly on northerly facing hillsides, are most susceptible to earthquake-
induced landsliding (please see discussion of landsliding in above Geology
section).
Liquefaction
Liquefaction is the rapid transformation of saturated, loose, fine-grained sediment
to a fluid-like state because of earthquake groundshaking. Liquefaction has
resulted in substantial loss of life, injury, and damage to property. In addition,
liquefaction increases the hazards of fires because of explosions induced when
underground gas lines break, and because the breakage of water mains
substantially reduces fire suppression capability.
Liquefaction hazard in Pittsburg ranges from very low to high. ABAG has
identified most of the lowland areas adjacent to Suisun Bay as being highly
susceptible to liquefaction hazards (see Figure 10-1). Alluvial fan and terrace
deposits that underlie most of Pittsburg have low liquefaction potential, and
upland areas that are underlain by bedrock have very low liquefaction potential.
Inundation from Seiche and Tsunami
Earthquakes can cause tsunami (“tidal waves”) and seiches (oscillating waves in
enclosed water bodies) in the Bay. Portions of the City located adjacent to Suisun
Bay are susceptible to potential tsunami or seiche inundation. However, projected
wave height and tsunami run-up is expected to be small in the interior portions of
the San Francisco Bay. Some coastal inundation and damage could occur if a
tsunami or seiche coincided with very high tides or an extreme storm.

               10-G-5 Limit urban development in high-risk areas (such as landslide areas,
                        flood zones, and areas subject to liquefaction) to low-occupancy or open
                        forms of land use.
               10-G-6 Limit development on slopes greater than 30 percent (as delineated on
                        Figure 10-1) to lower elevations, foothills, and knolls.

               Slopes and Erosion
               10-P-1 Ensure preparation of a soils report by a City-approved engineer or
                        geologist in areas identified as having geological hazards in Figure 10-
                        1, as part of development review.
               10-P-2 Restrict future development from occurring on slopes greater than 30
                        percent (as designated in Figure 10-1) over the 900 foot elevation
                        contour, and on major and minor ridgelines (as delineated in Figure 4-
                        2).
               10-P-3 Regulate the grading and development of hillside areas for new urban
                        land uses. Ensure that such new uses are constructed to reduce erosion
                        and landsliding hazards:

                                                                                  10: HEALTH & SAFETY ELEMENT
       • Limit cut slopes to 3:1, except where an engineering geologist can
           establish that a steeper slope would perform satisfactorily over the
           long term.
       • Encourage use of retaining walls or rock-filled crib walls as an
           alternative to high cut slopes.
       • Ensure revegetation of cut-and-fill slopes to control erosion.
       • Ensure blending of cut-and-fill slopes within existing contours, and
           provision of horizontal variation, in order to mitigate the artificial
           appearance of engineered slopes.
10-P-4 Limit future extension of development into the southeast hills, where
       there are high levels of risk due to previous coal mining. Ensure proper
       geotechnical analysis and mitigation for proposed development on
       slopes less than 30% south of Buchanan Bypass.
10-P-5 Ensure that Bay Area Air Quality Management District requirements are
       implemented around construction sites to reduce wind velocity and soil
       transport at the sites.
10-P-6 Encourage the use of water-sprinkling trucks at large construction sites
       to keep the exposed soil moist during construction.
10-P-7 As part of the development approval process, restrict grading to only
       those areas going into immediate construction as opposed to grading the
       entire site, unless necessary for slope repair or creek bed restoration.
       On large tracts of land, avoid having large areas bare and unprotected;
       units of workable size shall be graded one at a time.
10-P-8 During development review, ensure that new development on unstable
       slopes (as designated in Figure 10-1) is designed to avoid potential soil
                                                                                                          10-11

                        creep and debris flow hazards. Avoid concentrating runoff within swales
                        and gullies, particularly where cut-and-fill has occurred.
               Geologic Hazards
               10-P-9 Ensure geotechnical studies prior to development approval in geologic
                        hazard areas, as shown in Figure 10-1. Contract comprehensive
                        geologic and engineering studies of critical structures regardless of
                        location.
               10-P-10 As part of development approval, ensure that a registered engineering
                        geologist be available at the discretion of the City Engineer to review
                        reports submitted by applicants in the geologic hazard areas identified in
                        Figure 10-1. Project proponents shall pay all costs associated with
                        engineering studies related to geologic hazards.
               10-P-11 Form geological hazard abatement districts (GHADs) prior to
                        development approval in unstable hillside areas (as designated in Figure
                        10-1) to ensure that geotechnical mitigation measures are maintained
                        over the long-term, and that financial risks are equitably shared among
                        owners and not borne by the City.
               10-P-12 Evaluate the feasibility of implementing a hazard reduction program for
                        existing residential development in unstable hillside areas (as designated
                        in Figure 10-1). This would include inspection of structures for
                        conformance with the Building Code.
               10-P-13 During rehabilitation and redevelopment of industrial properties along
                        the Suisun Bay waterfront, ensure that geotechnical mitigation measures
                        are used to prevent collapse of structures in the event that liquefaction
                        occurs.
               10-P-14 Review and amend City ordinances, including the Building Code, that
                        regulate development in potentially hazardous locations to ensure
                        adequate protection from geologic hazards.

Seismic Hazards
10-P-15 Develop standards for adequate setbacks from potentially active fault
         traces (as designated in Figure 10-2) for structures intended for human
         occupancy. Allow roads to be built over potentially active faults only
         where alternatives are impractical.
10-P-16 Ensure compliance with the current Uniform Building Code during
         development review. Explore programs that would build incentives to
         retrofit unreinforced masonry buildings.
          Unreinforced masonry buildings are particularly vulnerable to earthquakes.
          Possible programs to encourage retrofit could include transfer taxes on
          property sales, which can be used by the owner to pay for seismic retrofit
          work; reduced permit fees; and grants or low-interest loans to offset retrofit
          costs. However, special consideration should be given to masonry buildings
          that are in the City’s historic core. The City’s Building Division should
          work with building owners to maintain and reserve such structures.
10-P-17 Ensure detailed analysis and mitigation of seismic hazard risk for new
         development in unstable slope or potential liquefaction areas (as
         designated in Figure 10-1). Limit the location of critical facilities, such
         as hospitals, schools, and police stations, in such areas.
                                                                                                                 10-13

               10.2       FLOOD CONTROL
               The developed portions of the Pittsburg Planning Area are within two major
               watersheds: Kirker and Lawlor creeks. The western portion of the Planning Area
               is within the Lawlor Creek watershed, which drains into Suisun Bay. Kirker Creek
               encompasses the central and eastern portions and drains into New York Slough.
               There are six minor watersheds in addition to Kirker and Lawlor creeks. Figure
               10-3 shows the major and minor watersheds in the Planning Area.
               The Kirker Creek watershed has an overall area of 8,539 acres and is the most
               significant watershed in the Planning Area. Approximately seven miles in length,
               the creek originates in the southern hills and flows north along Nortonville Road
               through the City. In the southern hills, the creek and its tributary channels have
               sufficient capacity to carry peak stormwater flows. Further downstream, however,
               natural flow capacity declines as the creek channel flattens. Urbanization north of
               Buchanan Road further decreases capacity as the channel becomes restricted and
               enclosed by storm drain culverts. Reduction in permeable soils caused by
               development also increases the total volume and rate of runoff.
               Most of the Lawlor Creek watershed south of Bay Point is undeveloped, though
               some residential development exists south of State Route 4. Most runoff is
               conveyed by natural channels except for storm drains located in developed areas
               and culverts under State Route 4. Minor watersheds are located west of Lawlor
               Creek, between Lawlor and Kirker Creeks, and adjacent to the northeastern
               boundary of the Kirker Creek watershed north of State Route 4. Local minor
               watersheds are drained by small natural channels with no official names.
               100-YEAR FLOOD PLAIN
               According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), a majority of
               Contra Costa County’s creeks and shoreline lie within the 100-year flood plain.
               Areas with high flood hazards are the islands and adjacent mainland in the San
               Joaquin-Sacramento River Delta in East Contra Costa County. Certain portions
               within the Pittsburg Planning Area, located along Suisun Bay, are particularly sus-
               ceptible to floods. However, most flood-prone areas in Pittsburg are marshland,

                        10-15
PITTSBURG 2020
               and are not potential development sites under the General Plan. Areas within the
               100-year flood plains, as shown in Figure 10-3, include:
               • Browns Island;
               • Shoreline and adjacent uninhabited marshland north of the BNSF Railroad
                   tracks in Bay Point;
               • Portions of the industrial area in northeast Pittsburg beginning at the shoreline,
                   including Kirker Creek, then following the creek upstream to its terminus in
                   the hills south of the City; and
               • Along Lawlor Creek in the northwestern portion of the City.
               Additionally, many of the culverts between State Route 4 and the Contra Costa
               Canal are undersized, which cause floodwaters to pond and overflow the banks of
               Kirker Creek. Local areas potentially affected by the flooding of Kirker Creek
               include residential neighborhoods, two parks (Buchanan and Small World) and
               two schools (Highlands Elementary and Hillview Junior High). Further upstream,
               inadequate channel capacity causes localized flooding at the USS-Posco and Dow
               Chemical plants.
               FLOOD CONTROL MANAGEMENT
               The City is responsible for maintaining the flood control system within the
               incorporated area, including Kirker Creek. In the unincorporated parts of the
               Planning Area, the County Flood Control District (FCD) maintains major channels
               and creeks over which they hold land rights. The County Department of Public
               Works maintains road drainage systems and several detention basins. However,
               most of the Planning Area, particularly the Kirker Creek Watershed, is not
               managed by FCD. The City’s Stormwater Management Plan identifies
               deficiencies and improvements to the storm drain system, while the Storm Drain
               Maintenance Plan addresses maintenance requirements for Lawlor and Kirker
               Creek watersheds.

GOALS: FLOOD CONTROL
10-G-7 Locate development outside of flood-prone areas unless mitigation of
        flood risk is assured.
10-G-8 Ensure that new development mitigates impacts to the City’s storm
        drainage capacity from storm water runoff in excess of runoff occurring
        from the property in its undeveloped state.
POLICIES: FLOOD CONTROL
10-P-18 Evaluate storm drainage needs for each development project in the
        context of demand and capacity when the drainage area is fully
        developed. Ensure drainage improvements or other mitigation of the
        project’s impacts on the storm drainage system appropriate to the
        project’s share of the cumulative effect.
10-P-19 Assure through the Master Drainage Plan and development ordinances
        that proposed new development adequately provides for on-site and
        downstream mitigation of potential flood hazards.
10-P-20 Develop and implement a Storm Flooding Mitigation Fee Program to
        fund required drainage improvements during construction of new
        development.
         Cooperate with the County Flood Control District in developing a Storm
         Flooding Mitigation Fee Program for incorporated and unincorporated lands
         within the City’s watersheds.
10-P-21 Encourage the formation of flood control assessment districts for those
        areas within the 100- and 500-year flood plains (as designated in Figure
        10-3). Encourage new hillside developments to form flood control
        assessment districts to accommodate runoff and minimize downstream
        flooding, if determined to be necessary.
                                                                                                           10-17

PITTSBURG 2020
               10-P-22 Ensure that pad elevations on newly constructed habitable buildings are
                       one foot above the 100-year floodplain, as determined by FEMA.
               10-P-23 Ensure that all new development (residential, commercial, or industrial)
                       contributes to the construction of drainage improvements in the Kirker
                       Creek and other watersheds in the Planning Area, as required by the
                       City’s adopted ordinances.
               10-P-24 Allow the construction of detention basins as mitigation in new
                       developments. Ensure that detention basins located in residential
                       neighborhoods, schools, or child-care facilities are surrounded by a
                       gated enclosure, or protected by other safety measures.
                        The enclosure of detention basins, particularly in areas where small children
                        are present, is necessary to ensure the safety of local residents when
                        recessed areas are saturated with floodwaters.
               10-P-25 Ensure adequate minimum setbacks to reduce potential for property

                       permeable landscape.
               10-P-27 Adopt practices for development and construction on sites where the
                       erosion potential is moderate to severe.
               10-P-28 Bench terraces should be used where areas of long slopes may create a
                       stormwater gradient flow. Berms should be constructed between any
                       riparian corridor and the construction site to preclude sediment-laden
                       stormwaters from entering riparian zones.
               10-P-29 During the review of development plans, require all commercial projects
                       to construct on-site retention facilities. Such facilities could be in the
                       form of landscape features or underground swells.

          Ensure that all development projects build on-site retention basins during
          initial site preparation to store run-off water generated by construction

10.3      HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
Contra Costa County is one of the largest generators of hazardous waste in the
state. The majority of this waste comes from industries located along waterfronts.
Approximately two-thirds of hazardous waste generated in the County is treated
on-site, while one-third is transported to hazardous waste management facilities.
HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT IN PITTSBURG
Many industrial operations in Pittsburg involve the use or production of hazardous
materials. Most significant are the petroleum and chemical processing plants in the
northeastern portion of the City. According to the City’s Hazardous Waste
Management Plan (HWMP), 11 large-quantity generators produced approximately
79,500 tons of hazardous waste in 1989. Of this, about 45 percent was treated on-
site and 55 percent was shipped off-site for treatment or recycling. Potential
hazards include the toxicity, flammability, and explosivity of petroleum and
chemical materials.
The HWMP estimates that about 2,300 metric tons of hazardous waste is produced
by small-quantity generators per year (projected in 1990). The majority is in the
form of waste oil from vehicle maintenance shops. Hazardous waste reduction
efforts by large generators are estimated to have decreased the amount of waste
produced by more than 80 percent since 1990. This primarily resulted from
improved production processes at industrial facilities, such as USS-Posco.
                                                                                                             10-19

               HAZARDOUS WASTE STORAGE AND LEAKAGE SITES
               The California Regional Water Quality Control Board annually reports sites in the
               Bay Area with leaking underground storage tanks and sites with environmental
               problems due to leaks and spills. There are approximately 54 sites in Pittsburg
               included in the Leaking Underground Storage Tank list, which are identified as
               having soil and/or groundwater contamination resulting from leaks or other
               discharges from tanks and/or associated piping. There are also 12 Spills, Leaks,
               Investigations, and Clean-up (SLIC) sites within the City, which are large sites
               with environmental problems due to accidental releases of toxic substances such
               as metals, volatile organic compounds, and petroleum hydrocarbons.
               The State requires the upgrade or replacement of tanks and piping installed before
               1984, when California's Underground Storage Tank (UST) program and more
               stringent tank requirements came into effect. This requirement was established by
               the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ten years ago to ensure that facility
               owners, especially those depending on petroleum for providing critical services
               (e.g., hospitals, police and fire departments), have their USTs upgraded.
               TRANSPORT OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
               The California Highway Patrol and California Department of Transportation have
               primary responsibility in regulating the transportation of hazardous waste and
               materials. Recently, the City designated roadways within Pittsburg that are
               acceptable for transport of hazardous materials. These roadways are all located
               within the industrial areas north of State Route 4, including:
               •    Loveridge Road
               •    Pittsburg-Antioch Highway
               •    Tenth Street/Willow Pass
               •    North Parkside Drive
               For many years, explosive materials were regularly shipped to Concord Naval

Weapons Station by highway and rail, including the BNSF and Southern Pacific
railroads. Pipelines traversing the Planning Area carry natural gas, crude oil, and
refined petroleum products. These pipelines, found throughout Contra Costa
County, cross fault lines, unstable slopes, and areas underlain by soft mud and
peat. While the County Office of Emergency Services has prepared emergency
and disaster plans, the proximity of hazardous materials to populated areas
nonetheless represents a potential safety threat.
GOALS: HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
10-G-9 Minimize the risk to life and property from the generation, storage, and
          transportation of hazardous materials and waste by complying with all
          applicable State regulations.
10-G-10 Encourage redevelopment of areas with potential hazardous materials
          issues. Pursue a leadership role in the remediation of brownfield sites
          throughout Pittsburg.
POLICIES: HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
10-P-31 Cooperate with other public agencies in the formation of a hazardous-
          materials team, consisting of specially-trained personnel from all East
          County public safety agencies, to address the reduction, safe transport,
          and clean-up of hazardous materials.
           Contra Costa Water District is supportive of the formation of a hazardous
           materials team, particularly as it relates to the Contra Costa Canal system
           and Suisun Bay/Sacramento River Delta water quality.
10-P-32 Designate and map brownfield sites to educate future landowners about
          contamination from previous uses. Work directly with landowners in the
          clean-up of brownfield sites, particularly in areas with redevelopment
          potential.

                         to residential neighborhoods and community focal points, such as
                         Downtown.
               10-P-34 Identify appropriate regional and local routes for transport of hazardous
                         materials and wastes. Ensure that fire, police, and other emergency
                         personnel are easily accessible for response to spill incidences on such
                         routes.
               10-P-35 Require historical assessments and/or sampling as part of the
                         environmental review process for redevelopment projects in the
                         Loveridge and Northeast River subareas. Ensure that contamination
                         from industrial waste is mitigated before redevelopment occurs.
               10.4       EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT
               In 1999, Pittsburg approved an update to the 1996 Emergency Response Plan that
               addresses potential impacts from a major earthquake, hazardous materials
               incident, flood, national security emergency, wildfire, landslide, or dam failure.
               The objectives of the plan are to reduce injury, loss of life, and destruction of
               property through effective management of emergency forces.
               The Emergency Plan indicates that a major earthquake in the San Francisco Bay
               Region would result in widespread damage, large numbers of casualties, and
               disruption of infrastructure such as transportation, utility service, emergency
               services, and medical response. It is likely that Pittsburg would experience non-
               structural property damage and utility service interruptions following strong
               seismic activity on the Concord-Green Valley Fault. However, the potentially
               catastrophic effects of an earthquake on the Hayward Fault would more than likely
               exceed the response capabilities of both the City and the County.
               A particular concern for the City is the possibility of an earthquake triggering an
               industrial disaster. The density of petroleum and chemical industries and the trans-
               shipping of military explosives result in large quantities of potentially explosive,
               flammable and poisonous materials being stored, processed and transported

through Pittsburg and throughout the County. The City works together with
industry to encourage modernization and seismic retrofit of industrial facilities.
GOALS: EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT
10-G-11 Ensure emergency response equipment and personnel training are
          adequate to follow the procedures contained within the Emergency
          Response Plan for a major earthquake, wildland fire, or hazardous
          substance event.
POLICIES: EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT
10-P-36 Maintain, modernize, and designate new sites for emergency response
          facilities, including fire and police stations, as needed to accommodate
          population growth.
10-P-37 Prepare and disseminate information to local residents, businesses, and
          schools about emergency preparedness and evacuation routes, including
          hazardous materials spills.
10-P-38 Ensure that critical facilities, including medical centers, police and fire
          stations, school facilities, and other structures that are important to
          protecting health and safety in the community, remain operative during
          emergencies.
10-P-39 Strive to maintain a ratio of 1.8 sworn            police officers per 1,000
          residents.

11.1 WATER SUPPLY AND DISTRIBUTION
Pittsburg obtains raw water from the Contra Costa Water District (CCWD),
through the Central Valley Project (CVP). The CCWD’s current contract for its
entire service area is for 195,000 acre-feet per year (af/y), or 174 million gallons per
day (mgd). However, these allocations are subject to regulatory or other temporary
restrictions that may be imposed arising from drought or other conditions. In
addition to its CVP contract, CCWD has negotiated water rights with a number of
local districts and private entities, including the East Contra Costa Irrigation
District. These agreements bring CCWD's total annual supply to 242,700 af/y. The
City also supplements its CCWD water supply with two wells, located at City Park
and at Dover Way and Frontage Road. Combined yield of both wells in Pittsburg is
1,500 af/y.
The City operates its own water treatment plant and associated infrastructure
facilities, which primarily serve customers within City limits. The Pittsburg
treatment plant currently operates at 16 to 18 mgd for City accounts. Although it is
restricted to 24 mgd by State Health Department permitting and stringent water
quality regulations, the plant has a hydraulic design capacity of 32 mgd. This
design capacity is sufficient to meet the 2020 maximum day requirements of 30.5
mgd.
Treated water is distributed throughout Pittsburg via a 122-mile system of
pipeline, in addition to several pump stations and seven reservoirs. Recent
construction of the Oak Hills IV Reservoir and Highlands Reservoir, both along
the City’s southern boundary, bring the City’s year 2000 reservoir capacity to 16.9
mgd.
HISTORIC WATER USE
In the last decade, water consumption in Pittsburg ranged from a high of 208
gallons per capita per day (gpcd) in 1988 to a drought-induced low of 138 gpcd in
1991. The greatest amount of water use occurs during the summer months, when
usage is heavily influenced by extensive landscape irrigation. Population growth is
the primary factor affecting the City's water demand. In 1995, per capita water use
                                                                                                          11-3

For CCWD to issue a Confirmation Letter (of water supply) to the City of
Pittsburg for new annexation areas, CCWD needs: (1) inclusion approval from
USBR, and (2) issuance of a de minimis determination that the cumulative increase
in water demand does not exceed 5 percent of the projected buildout water
demands as presented in the Los Vaqueros Project (LVP) EIR/S (1993; Table 1).
The projected buildout water demands for the eight areas currently outside the
LVP Planning Area is 930 af/y, or half of one percent (.005) of LVP critical year
buildout demand. This demand, when combined with other known projects,
currently falls within the acceptable five percent deviation; however, development
timing with respect to other future projects will be a factor for issuance of de
                                                                     1

               WATER CONSERVATION
               Water conservation first became an issue during the 1976-77 drought, and then
               again with the 1991 drought. Initial conservation measures involved requiring the
               installation of water meters and increasing the use of drought-tolerant plants in
               public landscaping. In addition, residents voluntarily reduced water use. The City
               also implements various Best Management Practices aimed at water conservation,
               as a signatory to the Urban Water Management Council.
               Pittsburg's current water conservation program includes education and public
               information, municipal water management programs, regulations involving
               landscaping and requirements for efficient water use during shortages, and an
               increased capacity of its water treatment plant. Six additional conservation
               measures are currently being implemented by the City, including a water rate
               structure to encourage conservation, stricter plumbing codes, public education,
               water-efficient landscaping, studying expanded reclaimed water usage, and a leak
               detection survey and repair program. Finally, the construction of the new Delta
               Diablo Sanitation District Reclamation Plant will provide residential, business, and
               City-owned properties with recycled water supplies for landscaping.
               GOALS: WATER SUPPLY AND DISTRIBUTION
               11-G-1     Available water supply and distribution capacity should grow proportionally
                          with development patterns and water usage trends. Update City’s Water
                          Master Plan to implement General Plan growth projections.
               11-G-2     Continue to implement water conservation policies to ensure adequate
                          supplies of water in the future.
               POLICIES: WATER SUPPLY AND DISTRIBUTION
               11-P-1     Continue using the Urban Water Management Plan as the mechanism for
                          detailed water supply planning, implementation, and conservation.
               11-P-2     Implement, as needed, replacements and/or expansions to the existing system
                          of water mains through the City’s Capital Improvement Program.

11-P-3 Continue water district and user conservation efforts to help reduce demand
       in light of recent Contra Costa Water District raw water reductions.
       In an attempt to preserve Delta species and habitat, the Central Valley
       Project mandated reductions in the amount of raw water available to the
       CCWD. Current water conservation efforts in the City include:
       •     Implementation of a water rate structure that encourages conservation;
       •     Implementation of plumbing code changes requiring ultra-low-flow
             toilets in new construction;
       •     Continuance of public education on water conservation;
       •     Passage of a Water-Efficient Landscape Ordinance for new large-scale
             landscaping;
       •     Study of expanded reclaimed water usage; and
       •     System-wide water audit/leak detection survey and repair program.
11-P-4 Work with Contra Costa Water District to develop a program ensuring
       adequate provision of raw water supplies during potential emergency water
       demands.
       Although the current available supply is adequate to accommodate future
       growth under normal conditions, the City should continue to stress
       water conservation policies in case of unforeseen shortfalls or periods of
       drought.
11-P-5 Work with Contra Costa Water District in planning the development of new
       pressure zones as needed to ensure adequate fire flows in hillside areas.
       As the City expands into the southern hills, additional water pressure
       zones may be required to provide higher elevations with sufficient water
       for fire protection, particularly as these areas are more susceptible to
       urban/wildland fire hazards. The need for these should be examined as
       part of the next update of the Urban Water Management Plan.
                                                                                                     11-7

PITTSBURG 2020
               11-P-6  Continue water conservation efforts from industrial facilities.
                       Water conservation efforts by industrial users can significantly decrease
                       water consumption, especially during peak demand periods. Measures
                       relevant to industrial users include continued enforcement of the 1992
                       Water-Efficient Landscape Ordinance and participation in a wastewater
                       reclamation feasibility study. If proven feasible, implementation of the
                       Landscape Ordinance in conjunction with use of reclaimed wastewater
                       for landscape irrigation can help to reduce industrial water demand.
               11-P-7  Ensure that new residential, commercial, and industrial development equitably
                       shares costs associated with providing water services to areas of urban
                       expansion within the Planning Area.
               11-P-8  Develop and implement a Recycled Water Ordinance, requiring the
                       installation and use of recycled water supplies from the new Delta Diablo
                       Sanitation District Reclamation Plant.
               11-P-9  Cooperate with Contra Costa Water District to ensure compliance with
                       District regulations and State law for new development requiring annexation
                       to the Contra Costa Water District service area. Cooperate with Contra Costa
                       Water District in processing all necessary information to allow a determination
                       if Los Vaqueros facilities can be used to service new annexation areas.
               11-P-10 Cooperate with federal agencies to ensure that new development requiring
                       inclusion in the Contra Costa Water District Central Valley Project contract
                       service area addresses all requirements of federal statutes and regulations,
                       including the National Environmental Policy Act and Endangered Species Act.
                       Encourage project developers to provide all required information for
                       consultation purposes, if necessary, under Endangered Species Act Sections 7
                       or 10, or a Habitat Conservation Plan.

11.2 WASTEWATER COLLECTION AND TREATMENT
Sewer services in the Planning Area are provided by the City and the Delta Diablo
Sanitation District (DDSD). The City maintains and owns the local sewage
collection system, and DDSD owns and operates the collection system in Bay
Point. The District also owns and operates regional interceptors and the sewage
treatment plant located north of the Pittsburg-Antioch Highway. DDSD’s service
area encompasses Pittsburg, Bay Point, and Antioch.
The oldest portions of Pittsburg's sewage collection system were constructed in the
early part of this century to serve what is now Downtown. The system has since
evolved into two distinct sections: the older portion north of State Route 4, and the
portion serving newer areas south of the highway. Sewer lines serving residential,
commercial, and industrial development north of State Route 4 drain to DDSD’s
Pittsburg Pump Station located south of Marina Park; wastewater from
developments south of State Route 4 enters the DDSD interceptor system on
Pittsburg-Antioch Highway.
The City’s collection system consists of approximately 95 miles of sewer lines
ranging in diameter from 6 to 36 inches, and one sewage lift station. The DDSD        Table 11-2
treatment plant—located north of Pittsburg-Antioch Highway, just east of
Pittsburg City limits—has the capacity to treat approximately 16.5 million gallons    Wastewater Flow Projections, Pittsburg

               POLICIES: WASTEWATER COLLECTION AND TREATMENT
               11-P-11 Work with Delta Diablo Sanitation District in planning the expansion of the
                        wastewater treatment plant.
               11-P-12 Pursue replacement and/or expansion of the City’s trunk sewer system, as
                        demand increases, particularly in newer portions of the system south of State
                        Route 4.
                        New development south of State Route 4 places increased demand on the
                        City’s aging sewer collection system. The expansion of the trunk sewer
                        system would ensure adequate capacities for future growth, particularly
                        during heavy rainfall when inflow/infiltration levels are high.

11-P-14 Restrict construction of sensitive receptors, such as residential units, schools or
        churches, within 1000 feet of wastewater treatment units. Prohibit
        construction of sensitive receptors within 0.5 miles of the wastewater
        treatment plant.
        This policy maintains the District’s current buffer for both safety and
        odor impacts. Although not currently in use, the District stores large
        volumes of acutely hazardous materials on-site for potential use in
        wastewater treatment that could cause extensive harm to receptors upon
        accidental release. Furthermore, this policy will contribute to the
        reduction of costs the District pays for extensive odor control.
11-P-15 Work with Delta Diablo Sanitation District to promote the use of recycled
        water for irrigation of large planted areas, such as business/industrial campus
        projects, City parks, and street medians.
        The District is constructing a Reclamation Plant and significant pipelines,
        with a scheduled start-up date in late 2000, to deliver recycled water to
        two power plants and several parks in the City of Pittsburg. Discovery of
        safe uses of reclaimed wastewater will ultimately result in using less
        potable water for landscape irrigation and reducing overall raw water
        demands. Both the Delta Energy Center and the Los Medanos Energy

GOALS: SOLID WASTE
11-G-6    Continue reduction and recycling efforts within the City to divert increasingly
          larger portions of the waste stream from local landfills.
11-G-7    Manage solid waste so that State diversion goals are met.
POLICIES: SOLID WASTE
11-P-19 Support the implementation of program tasks within the Source Reduction
          and Recycling Element.
11-P-20 Work with Pittsburg Disposal Services to increase participation in curbside
          recycling programs for residential neighborhoods.
11-P-21 Promote the importance of recycling industrial and construction wastes.
          Industrial and commercial uses create significantly higher waste streams
          than do residential uses. The diversion of recyclable materials from
          commercial and industrial uses would greatly reduce the waste tonnage
          sent to local landfills each day.

Fire Hazard Areas
Wildland fire risk can be determined through a system developed by the California
Division of Forestry. The system rates fire risk by analyzing three conditions:
• Frequency of critical fire weather;
• Percentage of slope within a given area; and
• Existing vegetation (density and type).

Areas in Pittsburg representing the greatest risk are in the hills south of the City,
which are brown and dry for much of the year. Wildland fires in East Contra Costa
County are a continuous threat, with the highest risk occurring during the
wildland fire season, from June to October. Much of the threat is due to open
grasslands abutting residential developments. As Pittsburg continues to expand,
more of these urban-rural interface areas are created.
GOALS: FIRE PROTECTION
11-G-8   Require development in areas of high fire hazard to be designed and
         constructed to minimize potential losses and maximize the ability of fire
         personnel to suppress fire incidents.
POLICIES: FIRE PROTECTION
11-P-24 Amend the subdivision regulations to include a requirement for detailed fire
         prevention and control, including community firebreaks, for projects in high
         and extreme hazard areas.
         Areas of high and extreme fire hazard include the Planning Area’s
         southern hills. Preparation of detailed fire prevention plans will ensure
         that new development in extreme hazard areas accounts for potential fire
         hazards and control measures. The construction of fire-breaks in areas of
         extreme fire hazard, such as estate residential development in hillside
         areas, will increase the District’s chances of halting and subduing a
         potential wildland fire incident.
11-P-25 Review and amend ordinances that regulate development in potentially
         hazardous locations to require adequate protection, such as fire-resistant
         roofing, building materials, and landscaping.
         Using fire-resistant construction materials and landscaping will both
         slow the pace at which fire spreads and improve the likelihood that the
         structure will survive a fire incident.
                                                                                                     11-17

PITTSBURG 2020
               11-P-26 Cooperate with Contra Costa County Fire Protection District to ensure that
                          new or relocated fire stations are constructed on appropriate sites within the
                          1.5-mile response radii from new or existing development.
                          Further development in the southern hills may necessitate the
                          construction of a new fire station by 2020. Additional fire protection
                          facilities may be necessary to ensure the safety of residents within urban-
                          rural interface hazard areas.
               11-P-27 Cooperate with Contra Costa County Fire Protection District in obtaining sites
                          to either relocate or establish new fire stations within City limits to provide
                          more efficient response times.
               11-P-28 Cooperate with Contra Costa County Fire Protection District in obtaining a site
                          for a new fire station (or relocation of Station 86) in the vicinity of State Route
                          4 and west of Bailey Road.
               11-P-29 Ensure adequate road widths in new development for fire response trucks, per
                          the subdivision regulations.
               11.5 PUBLIC UTILITIES
               Construction of City-owned capital facilities and infrastructure must keep pace
               with the rate of urban development. The provision of public utilities, such as
               electricity, telephone, and cable connections, is integral to the development of
               urban land uses.
               MULTI-USE OF UTILITY CORRIDORS
               The existing PG&E power line corridor bisects the City of Pittsburg from the
               Mirant (formerly PG&E) Power Plant along Suisun Bay in the north to the rolling
               hills in the southern portion of the Planning Area. This corridor is currently used
               only as an open space area over which power transmission lines and towers stand.
               The City could work with Mirant to transform this underutilized corridor into
               more useful public space, such as open space habitat or trails, parks and playing
               fields.

             habitat corridor within the City.
         • Recreational uses. Parks, playing fields, and trails linked to the
             regional network would be a tremendous opportunity for the City.
11-P-32 Ensure the designation of service corridor easements or routes when required
        for tentative map or specific plan approval.
        Ensure the provision of public utilities to all new urban development by
        requiring utility corridor easements in development plans.
11-P-33 As a condition of approval, ensure that all new and redevelopment projects
        underground utility lines on and adjacent to the site.
        Undergrounding of all utilities in new and redeveloped areas will
        significantly improve the appearance of City streets and views.

12 NOISE
This element outlines a comprehensive program of achieving acceptable noise
levels throughout Pittsburg, and ensures compliance with State noise
requirements. Significant noise sources in Pittsburg include major transportation
corridors, such as State Route 4 and arterial roadways.
PITTSBURG 2020
               12.1       NOISE MEASUREMENT
               Noise can be defined as a sound or series of sounds that are intrusive, irritating,
               objectionable and/or disruptive to daily life. Noise varies widely in its scope,
               source, and volume, ranging from individual occurrences such as a lawn mower to
               the intermittent disturbances of rail yard whistles to the fairly constant noise
               generated by traffic on freeways.
               Noise is primarily a concern when in the vicinity of noise-sensitive uses such as
               residences, schools, churches, and hospitals. Noise is controlled around other uses
               as well, although levels rarely exceed the recommended maximum. The known
               effects of noise on humans include hearing loss, communication interference, sleep
               interference, physiological responses, and annoyance.
               NOISE MEASUREMENT
               Three aspects of community noise are important in determining responses, and
               are therefore measured and described when assessing the noise environment:
               1. Level (that is, magnitude or loudness) of the sound. Sound levels are measured
                   and expressed in decibels (dB), with 10 dB roughly equal to the threshold of
                   hearing and 120 dB the threshold of pain.
               2. Frequency composition or spectrum of the sound. Frequency is a measure of
                   the pressure fluctuations per second, measured in units of hertz (Hz).
               3. Variation in sound level with time, measured as noise exposure. Most
                   community noise is produced by many distant noise sources, including
                   identifiable events of brief duration, such as power plant stack “blows”, which
                   cause the community noise level to vary from instant to instant. A single
                   number called the equivalent sound level or Leq describes the average noise
                   exposure level over a period of time.
               When noise levels are reported, they are expressed as a measurement over time in
               order to account for variations in noise exposure. Levels also account for varying
               degrees of sensitivity to noise during daytime and nighttime hours. The

Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) and Day-Night Noise Level (Ldn)
both reflect noise exposure over an average day with weighting to reflect this
sensitivity. The CNEL is the reference level for State Noise Law and is used to
express major continuous noise sources, such as aircraft or traffic.
Knowledge of the following relationships is helpful in understanding how changes
in noise and noise exposure are perceived:
• Except under special conditions, a change in sound level of 1 dB cannot be
     perceived;
• A 3 dB change is considered a “just-noticeable” difference;
• A 5 dB change is required before any noticeable change in community
     response would be expected. A 5 dB change is often considered a significant
     impact; and
• A 10 dB change is subjectively heard as an approximate doubling in loudness
     and almost always causes an adverse community response.
12.2        EXISTING NOISE
The major sources of noise in Pittsburg include auto traffic on arterial streets and
State Route 4, and railroad pass-bys. Noise produced by industrial facilities has an
insignificant effect on the City’s noise environment. As part of the General Plan
Update process, a community noise analysis was performed to evaluate existing
noise conditions in the City, as shown in Figure 12-1.
TRAFFIC NOISE
Traffic noise depends primarily on the speed of traffic and the percentage of truck
traffic; traffic volume does not have a major influence on traffic noise levels. The
primary source of noise from automobiles is high frequency tire noise, which
increases with speed. In addition, trucks and older automobiles produce engine
and exhaust noise, and trucks also generate wind noise. While tire noise from
autos is generally located at ground level, truck noise sources can be located as
                                                                                      12-3

high as to 15 feet above the roadbed due to tall exhaust stacks and higher engines;
sound walls are not effective for mitigating such noise unless they are very tall.
According to common practice, maximum noise levels of 60 dB are considered
“normally acceptable” for unshielded residential development. Noise levels from
60 to 70 dB fall within the “conditionally unacceptable” range, and those in the 70
to 75 dB range are considered “normally unacceptable.”
Traffic Noise Levels
The Pittsburg Planning Area is subject to noise impacts from a number of
transportation corridors. Roads and highways, or portions thereof, that impact
sensitive receptors (that is, produce noise levels greater than 60 dB) include:
• State Route 4;
• Port Chicago Highway;                                                             Train traffic, a source of noise in the City, is shown in this rail

• Pittsburg-Antioch Highway;
• Bailey Road;
• Willow Pass Road;
• East Leland Road;
• Railroad Avenue;
• Buchanan Road;
• Harbor Street; and
• Loveridge Road.
By far the greatest contributor to noise in the Planning Area is traffic on State
Route 4, producing noise levels exceeding 60 dB over approximately 2,000 feet
(more than one-third mile) both north and south of the highway. This area
includes adjacent neighborhoods throughout the length of the highway.

12.4    NOISE POLICIES
GOALS: NOISE
12-G-1 Protect public health and welfare by eliminating or minimizing the effects of
       existing noise problems, and by preventing increased noise levels in the future.
12-G-2 Encourage criteria such as building design and orientation, wider setbacks,
       and intense landscaping in lieu of sound walls to mitigate traffic noise along all
       major corridors, except along State Route 4.
12-G-3 Continue efforts to incorporate noise considerations into land use planning
       decisions, and guide the location and design of transportation facilities to
       minimize the effects of noise on adjacent land uses.
POLICIES: NOISE
12-P-1 As part of development review, use Figure 12-3 to determine acceptable uses
       and installation requirements in noise-impacted areas.
        Figure 12-3 is based on land use and noise exposure compatibility levels in
        Appendix A of the State of California General Plan Guidelines. The table is
        consistent with the provision of State law that requires special noise
        insulation for new multi-family housing units within 60 dB Ldn noise
        exposure contours. The table’s land use categories do not correspond to the
        land use classifications on the General Plan Land Use Diagram, but to actual
        uses in development projects.
12-P-2 Work with Caltrans to provide sound walls designed to reduce noise by 10 dB
       in residential areas along State Route 4.
12-P-3 Support implementation of State legislation that requires reduction of noise
       from motorcycles, automobiles, trucks, trains, and aircraft.

12-P-4  Require noise attenuation programs for new development exposed to noise
        above normally acceptable levels. Encourage noise attenuation programs that
        avoid visible sound walls.
12-P-5  Require that applicants for new noise-sensitive development, such as schools,
        residences, and hospitals, in areas subject to noise generators producing noise
        levels greater than 65 dB CNEL, obtain the services of a professional
        acoustical engineer to provide a technical analysis and design of mitigation
        measures.
12-P-6  Ensure that new noise-sensitive uses, including schools, hospitals, churches,
        and homes, in areas near roadways identified as impacting sensitive receptors
        by producing noise levels greater than 65 dB CNEL (Figure 12-1), incorporate
        mitigation measures to ensure that interior noise levels do not exceed 45 dB
        CNEL.
12-P-7  Require the control of noise at the source through site design, building design,
        landscaping, hours of operation, and other techniques, for new development
        deemed to be noise generators.
12-P-8  Develop noise attenuation programs for mitigation of noise adjacent to
        existing residential areas, including such measures as wider setbacks, intense
        landscaping, double-pane windows, and building orientation muffling the noise
        source.
12-P-9  Limit generation of loud noises on construction sites adjacent to existing
        development to normal business hours between 8:00 AM and 5:00 PM.
12-P-10 Reduce the impact of truck traffic noise on residential areas by limiting such
        traffic to appropriate truck routes. Consider methods to restrict truck travel
        times in sensitive areas.

CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION
Housing is a basic human necessity and the need for housing is shared by all residents. People
want living spaces where they feel they have dignity, where they can express their individuality,
and where they can be comfortable and healthy. Safe, well-maintained housing is a basic
necessity that transcends age, race, income, and marital status. As such, the City of Pittsburg
strives to provide a diversity of housing types, costs, and locations to serve the variety of needs
and wants of local residents.
ROLE OF HOUSING ELEMENT
The California Legislature has identified the attainment of a decent home and suitable living
environment for every citizen as the State’s major housing goal. Recognizing the important role
of local planning programs in the pursuit of this goal, the Legislature has mandated that all cities
and counties prepare a Housing Element as part of the comprehensive General Plan. Section
65583 of the Government Code sets forth the specific components to be contained in a Housing
Element. State law further requires Housing Elements to be updated at least every four to eight
years to reflect the changing housing needs of a community. Pittsburg’s Housing Element was
last updated and adopted in 2010 and covered the period of 2007–2014. This Housing Element
update is for the planning period of 2015–2023.
Further, California’s Housing Element law requires that each city and county develop local
housing programs to meet its “fair share” of existing and future housing needs for all income
groups. The Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) is responsible for developing and
assigning these regional housing need allocations, referred to as RHNA, to Bay Area jurisdictions.
California Government Code Section 65583(a)(7) requires an “assessment of housing need and
inventory of resources and constraints relevant to the meeting of these needs.” Thus, the
Housing Element must contain the following:
        An analysis of population and employment trends.
        An analysis of household characteristics.
        An analysis of special housing needs.
Chapter 1 – Introduction                                                                             1-1

        An analysis of publicly assisted housing developments that might convert to non-assisted
         housing developments (referred to as at-risk housing).
        An analysis of the City’s fair share of regional housing needs.
        An inventory of land suitable for residential development.
        An analysis of governmental and non-governmental constraints on the improvement,
         maintenance, and development of housing.
        An analysis of opportunities for energy conservation.
The purpose of these requirements is to develop an understanding of the existing and projected
housing needs within the community and to set forth policies and programs that promote
preservation, improvement, and development of diverse housing types and costs throughout
Pittsburg. This Housing Element covers the period 2015–2023 and was prepared in compliance
with California General Plan law pertaining to Housing Elements.
GOALS, POLICIES, AND PROGRAMS
This Housing Element provides policies and programs to address the mandated goal for equal
access for all people to a suitable living environment described above. The element also
identifies the particular issues facing Pittsburg in attaining that goal. The Pittsburg Housing
Element is an eight-year plan to identify strategies and programs that focus on:
        Fostering development of a variety of housing types, densities, and prices to balance the city’s
         housing stock and meet Pittsburg’s regional fair share housing needs for people of all income
         levels.
        Promoting the expansion of affordable housing stock, including that which accommodates
         special needs households.
        Eliminating housing discrimination.
        Improving and preserving the existing affordable housing stock, where feasible and
         appropriate.
        Enhancing the visual quality of Pittsburg’s residential neighborhoods.
Chapter 1 – Introduction                                                                                  1-2

DATA SOURCES
The main source for data utilized in this document was the Housing Element Data Profile compiled by
ABAG and distributed in January 2014. ABAG generated the Data Profiles to assist jurisdiction in the
region in the preparation of their Housing Element updates for the 2015-2023 cycle. The primary
sources of data for the ABAG Data Profiles included the US Census Bureau, 2000 and 2010 Census files;
2007–2011 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year data files; 2009–2011 ACS 3-year files, 2005–2009
CHAS data based on the 2005–2009 ACS 5-year data product; and California Department of Finance,
Demographic Research Unit E-5 tables, if applicable to Pittsburg.
Several additional data sources were used to supplement the Housing Element Data Profile for Pittsburg.
These additional data sources include housing market information, such as home sales, rents, and
vacancies, as updated by City surveys and property tax assessor’s files and public and nonprofit
agencies’ data on special needs groups, the services available, and gaps in the service delivery system. In
some instances, City of Pittsburg staff interviewed individuals; those data sources are specified in
footnotes.
PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
The Pittsburg Housing Element was developed with the collaborative efforts of residents, stakeholders,
service providers, housing developers, and elected and appointed officials. Opportunities for input on
the Housing Element were provided through various forums.
To kick off the Housing Element process, the Planning Department presented Housing Element 101
public workshops at regularly scheduled Planning Commission (March 11, 2014) and Community
Advisory Council (August 6, 2014) meetings. At those public meetings, a Housing Element Policy Fact
Sheet detailing housing element law and general information related to the Regional Housing Needs
Allocation was distributed.
In July 2014, Planning staff requested interviews with eleven identified local housing stakeholders
including representatives from the Pittsburg Housing Authority, Pittsburg Housing Successor Agency,
Contra Costa Homeless Program, La Clinica (local health provider), Discovery Builders (market-rate
developer), Domus Development (affordable housing developer), Public Advocates (housing advocate),
Building Industry Association (housing developer advocates), individuals including Federal Glover
(Contra Costa County Supervisor), Gregory Osorio (housing advocate/interested party), and Tom LeFleur
Chapter 1 – Introduction                                                                                    1-3

(housing service provider and advocate). Nine of the identified stakeholders responded to the request
and provided valuable insight into the primary housing-related issues facing Pittsburg.
To encourage participation by the public at large, a community-wide survey (in English and Spanish) was
made available to the public between July 18, 2014, and August 18, 2014. To incentivize participation,
the City raffled a gift certificate to a local business to all those who completed the survey and entered
contact information for future Housing Element–related notifications. The survey was publicized in an
article in the East Contra Costa Times on July 30, 2014, and notice was posted on City Facebook accounts
and distributed to all known neighborhood listservs in the city. Hard copy flyers advertising the survey
were posted at the Pittsburg Library and City Hall, on the City’s website, and at the Senior Center and
were mailed to all local churches and nonprofit organizations that operate in the city. In total, the City
received approximately 306 responses to the survey. Stakeholders and public responses to the online
survey provided valuable input and suggestions with regard to community concerns related to housing,
housing needs, policies, programs, and strategies to address those concerns and needs.
PUBLIC REVIEW OF THE DRAFT 2015–2023 HOUSING ELEMENT
The draft Housing Element was released for public review and comments on the City’s website on
December 4, 2014. The Draft Housing Element was made available on the City’s website and hard copies
were available at the Pittsburg Public Library and at the Planning Counter for public review. The City
accepted written comments on the draft document and the public was invited to a public meeting on
December 18, 2014, where the City accepted verbal comments on the document. The community
provided comments at the public meeting on the inclusionary housing ordinance, housing needs data,
commercial linkage fee, lot coverage, and sustainability. All comments were summarized and responses
were incorporated into the final draft Housing Element.
RELATIONSHIP TO THE GENERAL PLAN
The 2015–2023 Housing Element is a key component of the Pittsburg General Plan. The last
comprehensive update of the General Plan was adopted by the City of Pittsburg in 2001. California
Government Code Section 65300.5 states that “the general plan and elements and parts thereof
comprise an integrated, internally consistent, and compatible statement of policies.” The purpose of
requiring internal consistency is to avoid policy conflict and provide a clear policy guide for the future
maintenance, improvement, and development of housing in the city.
Chapter 1 – Introduction                                                                                   1-4

As part of the Housing Element update process, the goals, policies, and implementing programs in other
General Plan elements have been comprehensively reviewed for internal consistency. Due to the
passage of Assembly Bill 162 relating to flood protection in 2007, the City may be required to amend the
Safety and Conservation Elements of the General Plan. If amendments are needed, the Housing Element
will be amended to be consistent with the Safety and Conservation Elements.
STREAMLINED HOUSING ELEMENT SUBMITTAL
The City’s 2015–2023 Housing Element was prepared in accordance with the California Department of
Housing and Community Development’s streamlined update procedures. The streamlined update is a
voluntary approach that may be used by local governments finding that much of the information in the
previously adopted and HCD-certified Housing Element (2007–2014) is still current and/or particular
conditions and circumstances have not significantly changed since the last update. HCD established
criteria for streamlined review eligibility with which the City is in substantial compliance. Specifically, the
City had a certified 2007–2014 Housing Element that was adopted by the City Council and found to be in
compliance with State Housing Element law by HCD, and the City has implemented specific programs
related to emergency shelters, supportive and transitional housing, and density bonuses in accordance
with state law. Further, the City has adopted a Reasonable Accommodations Ordinance (City Council
Ordinance No. 15-1389).
In accordance with the streamlined updated procedures, the City has prepared a draft 2015–2023
Housing Element showing key changes. Where there were significant changes or updated information
such as the Introduction, Chapter 2, Housing Needs Assessment, and Chapter 5, Housing Plan, the City
submitted wholly new and clean documents. Please note that revised and new programs included in
Chapter 5 are underlined for easy reference. Chapter 3, Housing Opportunities and Constraints, and
Chapter 4, Housing Resources, are provided in track changes.
Further, the required streamlined documents, Attachment 1 - Implementation Review, Attachment 2 -
Completeness Checklist, and Attachment 3 - Streamlined Update Template, are included with this draft
submittal.

CHAPTER 2 HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
The Housing Needs Assessment is the foundation for developing the City of Pittsburg’s housing goals,
policies, and programs outlined in Chapter 5 of this Housing Element. This chapter analyzes relevant
population and housing characteristics to determine the housing needs of the residents of Pittsburg.
This assessment includes demographics, household characteristics, special housing needs, and
housing characteristics.
REGIONAL POPULATION AND ECONOMIC CONTEXT
Pittsburg is located in Contra Costa County, one of the nine counties that make up the San Francisco
Bay Area, which had a regional population of 7.1 million people in 2010. In 2011, the regional
economy employed approximately 3.5 million people. The Health, Education, and Recreation
occupational sector employ the most residents; other significant employment sectors include
Manufacturing, Construction, Retail, Government, and Finance.
Contra Costa County has a population of slightly more than 1 million people, making it the third
largest county in the region. The county experienced a slight growth in employment between 2000
and 2011 with an average annual growth rate of approximately 0.6 percent per year. Residential
growth continued to be a common trend among the cities in Contra Costa County; from 2000 to
2010, approximately 31,200 new households were added to the county, which is less than in previous
periods but represents strong household growth among the region’s counties.

POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS
The type and amount of housing needed in the county is in part determined by the characteristics of the
population such as age, lifestyle preference, and employment and population growth trends. These
characteristics also influence residents’ ability to afford housing in the area. This section outlines
population characteristics and their impact on housing needs.
POPULATION TRENDS
Pittsburg has grown significantly over the last few decades, from approximately 33,000 residents in 1980
to 63,264 residents in 2010, or an average rate of 2.4 percent per year. According to the California
Department of Finance, the City’s population was estimated at 66,368 in 2014.
While a small portion of the growth in the 1980s was the result of annexations of unincorporated areas
in the southern hills, this overall increase reflects high levels of relocation to the city. According to
projections provided by the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG), Pittsburg is estimated to
grow to approximately 91,600 residents and 27,510 households by 2040. The City’s rate of population
growth is projected to remain steady at an average 1.3 percent per year from 2010 to 2040.
Despite a slowing rate of population growth, ABAG projects that the City’s population and households
will grow at a faster rate than the county in general. Table 2-1 compares population and household
growth over time for Pittsburg and Contra Costa County as a whole.

AGE CHARACTERISTICS
Housing needs are impacted by the population’s age characteristics since needs and preferences adjust
as people age. Accordingly, different age groups have varying housing needs depending on lifestyle,
family type and size, income-earning ability, and housing preference. Understanding these
characteristics is essential in determining Pittsburg’s appropriate housing needs.
Table 2-2 compares age distribution for the population of Pittsburg and Contra Costa County in 2010.
The City has a higher proportion of young people than the county with 31 percent of the City’s
population under 18 years compared to 27 percent for the same age group in the county overall. Also,
Pittsburg has fewer persons 55 and older, accounting for 19 percent of the city’s population versus 24
percent of the county’s population.

Table 2-3 shows an increase in population 55 and older in Pittsburg and Contra Costa County, mirroring
a national trend as the baby boomer generation, persons born between 1946 and 1964, continues to
age. In the City, the 55- to 64-year-old age group increased by approximately 70 percent from 2000 to
2010, while the number of persons 65 years and older increased by almost 17 percent during the same
period. Nevertheless, Pittsburg’s population remains comparatively young with 54 percent of its
population under the age of 35, compared to 45 percent for the county overall.
As shown in Table 2-3, Pittsburg’s age trends are not unusual. Contra Costa County’s proportion of 55 to
64 year olds also increased significantly from 2000 to 2010, while the age group comprising children
aged 19 and younger shows much slower growth at approximately 4 percent for the City and 7 percent
for the county. After the baby boomer generation, the 20- to 34-year-old age group experienced the
largest growth in both Pittsburg and the county at approximately 30 percent and 21 percent,
respectively.

EDUCATION
Education is often positively correlated with the type of employment and level of income earned, and the
type of housing that residents are able to afford. In general, educational attainment in Pittsburg is lower than
that of the county. Table 2-6 compares educational attainment for the City and for the county based on
American Community Survey (ACS) data (2008–2012). Approximately 22 percent of Pittsburg residents age
25 and older has less than a high school degree, in comparison to 11 percent of county residents.
Educational attainment generally drives household incomes; lower education levels lead to lower
incomes and a higher incidence of unemployment. Approximately half of all Pittsburg residents have a
high school degree or less, limiting the type of employment opportunities available to a large share of its
residents. Furthermore, approximately 17 percent of residents hold a bachelor’s degree or higher,
compared to approximately 39 percent of county residents.

EMPLOYMENT
About half of the employed citizens of the City work in the areas of Manufacturing,
Construction, and Retail, which typically require less formal education. Approximately 26
percent of Pittsburg’s total employment is in the manufacturing, wholesale, and transportation,
agriculture, and construction sectors, and about 54 percent is in financial and professional,
health, education, and recreation, which is slightly lower than the countywide average of about
58 percent in those sectors. Table 2-7 compares employment by industry for 2005 for both
Contra Costa County and Pittsburg.

Employment Growth
According to ABAG, there were approximately 14,180 jobs in Pittsburg in 2010. ABAG projects
the number of jobs in the City to increase to about 19,800 in 2040. From 2010 to 2040,
Pittsburg’s employment growth is projected to keep pace with employment growth in the
county, at an annual average rate of about one percent per year between 2010 and 2040.

declines in home values.
Between 2009 and 2013, unemployment rates declined as shown in Chart 2-
1, and it is reasonable to assume that the decline will continue as the
economy rebounds. Despite the overall decline in unemployment over the
past five years, Pittsburg still had a higher rate of unemployment at 11.8
percent than the county at about 7.4 percent in 2013.

HOUSEHOLD CHARACTERISTICS
Household characteristics provide insight into local housing needs, including unit sizes, affordability,
tenure, and supportive housing types to accommodate households with special needs. Local household
characteristics can also help to identify areas of acute housing needs such as households living in
overcrowded conditions, senior households, or persons with disabilities in need of supportive services.
This section describes household characteristics, which include household type and size, income levels,
and the presence of special needs populations, as well as other characteristics.

In addition to Chart 2-2, Table 2-11 summarizes household type and average household sizes for
Pittsburg and Contra Costa County. City households tend to be larger than county households with an
estimated average household size of approximately 3.2 persons per household in the City compared to
2.7 persons per household for the county overall. Pittsburg families are also more likely to contain more
persons than Contra Costa County families overall, at 3.59 persons per family in Pittsburg compared to
3.23 persons per family in the County. The larger household sizes imply a need for larger units.

Housing Costs and Affordability, below.
Household Income by Income Category
This section estimates household income distribution by income category as defined by the California
Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD). The state requires each jurisdiction to address its
housing needs by the following income categories:
        Extremely low-income, defined as an annual household income at or below 30 percent of the
         area median income (AMI)
        Very low-income, defined as annual household incomes 31 to 50 percent of AMI
        Low-income, defined as annual household incomes 51 to 80 percent of AMI
        Moderate-income, defined as annual household incomes 81 to 120 percent of AMI
        Above moderate-income, defined as annual household incomes above 120 percent of AMI
Median household income levels are estimated annually by the US Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) to provide updated income limits that are used to set rents and to qualify households for
income-restricted housing. The median income levels are then adopted by HCD. From the median household
income estimates, HCD calculates income limits for very low-, low-, and moderate-income households. These
income limits form the basis for evaluating housing affordability by income group.
Table 2-13 provides a 2012 estimate of household income distribution by income group for Pittsburg and Contra
Costa County. Based on household distribution estimates for 2012, approximately 31 percent of Pittsburg
households are extremely or very low-income, earning 50 percent or less of the area median income for a family
of four. Approximately 18 percent are low income and 21 percent are moderate income. In comparison to the
county overall, City households encompass a significantly larger proportion of extremely low-, very low-, and
low-income households, accounting for 49 percent of Pittsburg households compared to 34 percent countywide.
Further, the City has a lower percentage of above moderate-income households at 30 percent as compared to
47 percent countywide.
Much of the socioeconomic information described earlier in the Housing Needs Assessment corroborates these
distribution estimates, indicating a large proportion of low- and middle-income households but proportionally
fewer higher-income households in Pittsburg. The household income data also supports previous Housing
Element policies to encourage more executive housing to attract higher-income households to Pittsburg as well
as to continue to supply affordable market-rate housing to support the existing population.

Extremely Low Income Households
According to the 2007-2011 American Community Survey, there are a total of 3,125 extremely low-income households in Pittsburg. Of
those 2,155 (69%) are renters and 970 (31%) are owners.
Pittsburg must provide an estimate of the projected extremely low-income housing needs. Per HCD guidelines, 50 percent of the City’s very low-
income RHNA number qualifies as extremely low income. Therefore, the City is estimating approximately 50 percent of its very low-income
regional housing need to be an extremely low-income housing need. In other words, of the 392 very low-income housing units needed, the City
is estimating 196 units for extremely low-income households. Most, if not all, extremely low-income households will require rental housing. The
extremely low-income households will likely face housing problems such as overpaying, overcrowding, and/or accessibility issues as a result of
their limited incomes. Also, many of the extremely low-income households will fall within a special needs category (disabled, seniors, large
families, or female-headed households) and require supportive housing services.

 2. Homeless Populations and Subpopulations Reports are based on point-in-time counts of homeless persons completed by County Continuums of Care (CoC). The count is conducted on one day/night during the last week of
 January on a biannual basis. As such, the data collected is a “point‐in‐time” (PIT) count and is therefore not meant to represent the number of individuals who experience homelessness over the course of a year. The 2013
 count took place on January 29, 2013, and the morning of January 30, 2013.

SPECIAL NEEDS GROUPS
In order to accurately determine housing needs, special needs groups must be taken into consideration, particularly due
to their greater difficulty in finding decent and affordable housing. Special need populations often have unique housing
needs beyond affordability. For example, persons with physical limitations or limited mobility often require accessible
ground-floor units, and seniors can need on-site care. Homeless persons often need transitional housing and drug and
alcohol treatment services before placement in more stable permanent housing. State Housing Element law defines
“special needs” groups to include the following: senior households, female-headed households with children, large
households, disabled persons, developmentally disabled persons, homeless persons, and agricultural workers. This
section describes the housing needs of each of these groups in Pittsburg and the percentage of those groups in the

SENIOR HOUSEHOLDS
According to 2010 US Census data, approximately nine percent of Pittsburg residents are seniors,
defined as persons 65 years and older. The special needs of senior households are due to primarily three
concerns: seniors live on a fixed income, have higher health care costs, and are more likely to have some
form of a disability. The senior population may also lack private transportation and at-home care
facilities.
Special concerns for senior citizens need to be considered during project design review. The most
significant concerns include:
         Senior citizens are less mobile than younger age groups; more consideration should be given to
          appropriate housing and site design.
         Senior citizens generally prefer to be autonomous and maintain independent living lifestyles. In order
          to support this lifestyle choice, seniors need access to convenient services, including full-service
          shopping and health care facilities, social service and activity centers, and public transportation.
         Senior citizens occasionally require financial assistance to remain in the home they own.
         Seniors citizens generally prefer to be a part of a community and not isolated.
         Senior citizens are concerned about physical and psychological security, more so than younger age
          groups.
Senior households often have to make difficult decisions about whether to pay their rent/mortgage
payments or pay for medical care. Approximately 40 percent of Pittsburg’s senior households have
income less than $30,000 a year. Although the City’s proportion of lower-income senior households is
generally higher than the countywide average, senior households with low incomes are prevalent
throughout the county. Approximately 63 percent of senior-headed households in Pittsburg and nearly
49 percent of those households in the county have income less than $49,999. Senior households are
presented by income category in Table 2-15.

FEMALE-HEADED HOUSEHOLDS
Female-headed households may need special consideration and assistance to accommodate their
housing needs. More specifically, female-headed single-parent households with children often need
accessible day care, healthcare, and other support services in addition to affordable and safe housing.
Generally, female-headed households have lower incomes, are more likely to be in poverty, and have
higher family and child care expenses, limiting their opportunities for finding affordable and quality
housing. According to 2010 US Census data, 2,361 female-headed family households with children under
18 lived in Pittsburg, accounting for approximately 24 percent of all families. This is a higher proportion
than in the county overall, where approximately 17 percent of households were female-headed
households with children under 18.

As shown in Table 2-16, approximately 27 percent of female-headed single-parent households were in
poverty in comparison to about 12 percent of City households overall. The result is a demonstrated
housing need in Pittsburg to accommodate female-headed households by collocating affordable housing
with child care facilities in close proximity to other support services.

LARGE HOUSEHOLDS
Large households are those with five or more people. Large households have special housing needs
because there is a limited supply of adequate and appropriately sized housing that is also affordable.
Large households on a limited budget may be more at risk for overcrowding and/or overpayment. Low-
income large households may rent or own a smaller home in an effort to save money in order to pay for
other necessities including transportation, food, and clothing. According to 2010 US Census data, there
are 4,314 large households in Pittsburg, representing approximately 23 percent of all households.
Pittsburg contains a significantly higher proportion of large households than Contra Costa County, where
approximately 13 percent of households contain five persons or more.

DISABLED PERSONS
Disabled persons have special housing needs because many live on a fixed income, lack housing choices
that are both affordable and accessible, and generally have higher health care costs. Disabled persons
may also require modifications to their home to accommodate their disability and may need on-site
supportive services, depending on the disability. There are primarily five different types of special needs
as defined below.
        Sensory and Physical Limitation: difficulty seeing, difficulty hearing, or difficulty walking
         (even with glasses and hearing aids)
        Mental Disability: difficulty in learning, remembering, or concentrating
        Going Outside Home Limitation: difficulty going outside the home alone to shop or visit a
         doctor’s office
        Employment Limitation: difficulty working at a job or a business
        Self-Care Limitation: difficulty dressing, bathing, or getting around inside the home
Disability encompasses a wide range of conditions, which impact housing needs differently. Many
people who are disabled are still able to live at home independently or with friends or family members.
So that a disabled person can maintain an independent lifestyle, often a home may need to be modified
to increase accessibility or space for in-home assistance.

DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES
Senate Bill (SB) 812 requires that the City include an analysis of the special housing needs of individuals
with developmental disabilities within the community. According to Section 4512 of the Welfare and
Institutions Code, a “developmental disability” means a disability that originates before an individual
attains age 18 years, continues, or can be expected to continue, indefinitely, and constitutes a
substantial disability for that individual, which includes mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and
autism. This term also includes disabling conditions found to be closely related to mental retardation or
to require treatment similar to that required for individuals with mental retardation, but does not
include other handicapping conditions that are solely physical in nature.
Many developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently in a conventional housing
environment. More severely disabled individuals require a group living environment where supervision
is provided. The most severely affected individuals may require an institutional environment where
medical attention and physical therapy are provided. Because developmental disabilities exist before
adulthood, the first issue in supportive housing for the developmentally disabled is the transition from
the person’s living situation as a child to an appropriate level of independence as an adult.
The California Department of Developmental Services currently provides community-based services to
approximately 243,000 persons with developmental disabilities and their families through a statewide
system of 21 regional centers, four developmental centers, and two community-based facilities. The
Regional Center of the East Bay (RCEB) located in Concord, CA is one of 21 regional centers in California
that provides point of entry to services for people with developmental disabilities. The center is a
private, nonprofit community agency that contracts with local businesses to offer a wide range of
services to individuals with developmental disabilities and their families.
According to the RCEB and the Housing Consortium of the East Bay, the RECB serves 986
developmentally disabled persons in Pittsburg. As shown in Table 2-21, just over half of these residents
are age 21 or younger and thus are likely to live at home with family and receive services through public
schools.

A number of housing types are appropriate for people living with a development disability: rent-
subsidized homes, licensed and unlicensed single-family homes, Section 8 vouchers, special programs
for home purchase, HUD housing, and SB 962 homes. The design of housing-accessibility modifications,
the proximity to services and transit, and the availability of group living opportunities represent some of
the types of considerations that are important in serving this special needs group. Incorporating
“barrier-free” design in all new multi-family housing (as required by California and federal fair housing
laws) is especially important to provide the widest range of choices for disabled residents. Special
consideration should also be given to the affordability of housing, as people with disabilities may be
living on a fixed income.

Pittsburg does not own or manage its own homeless shelters; however, nonprofit organizations provide homeless
services in the city (Table 2-24).
EMANCIPATED YOUTH
Emancipated youth includes persons who reach the age of 18 years old and are emancipated from foster
care or from dependency and delinquency systems. In 2010, the California Legislature approved
Assembly Bill (AB) 12 creating a new category of “non-minor dependents.” Non-minor dependents are
permitted to remain in the youth foster system until the age of 21 years, subject to certain eligibility
requirements that the youth (1) be completing a high school or equivalent program; (2) be enrolled in
college or vocational education program; (3) be employed a minimum of 20 hours a week; (4) be
participating a program to remove barriers to employment; or (5) have a medical condition preventing
accomplishment of the previous requirements.
According to the California Department of Social Services, nearly 65 percent of the youth emancipating
from child welfare services in California do so without a place to live.1 According to the Contra Costa
County Children and Family Services Bureau, approximately 125 to 150 children age out of the foster
system in Contra Costa County per year. However, approximately 180 persons between the ages of 18
and 21 participate in the foster system as non-minor dependents pursuant to AB 12. Currently, Contra
Costa County has 60 Transitional Housing Placement Plus (THP-Plus) Program–funded beds for
emancipated youth, as well as other services and transitional housing opportunities such as counseling,
medical assistance, and other services targeted specifically to emancipated youth with disabilities,
developmental delays, or who are homeless.2 As shown in Table 2-24 above, transition age youth was
included in the sheltered PIT homeless counts in 2013.
Implementation of AB 12 provides youth an additional three years in the system to become better
prepared for a successful transition to adulthood and self-sufficiency through education and
employment training opportunities. However, youth at 18 or at 21 will face challenges emerging from
the foster care system. With the high cost of living in California and the lack of a “safety net” in the form
of financial or emotional help from parents or caregivers, these persons face disproportionately higher
rates of unemployment, lower educational achievement, and higher rates of incarceration, dependence
on public assistance, substance abuse, and homelessness than the population at large. In addition, many
in this population lack rental and credit histories and financial assistance, making it more difficult for
them to obtain housing.

Transitional housing developments aimed at assisting emancipated youth should provide multi-family
rental units that are small or available to be shared among several people and that are affordable to
extremely low- and very low-income households. Housing developed for this population should also
include on-site or nearby job training and placement services, computer facilities, social, psychological
and health services, and childcare facilities, among other support services.
DAY LABORERS AND FARMWORKERS
Day laborers and farmworkers play an important role in the local economy of a community and
California’s agriculture sector. According to the 2010 US Census, 145 Pittsburg residents were identified
as working in the farming, fishing, or forestry occupations. Currently, agriculture is not a strong industry
in the City, and ABAG’s 2013 projections estimate that this trend will continue. Because Pittsburg has a
relatively small farmworker population, their housing needs are not a major component of the Housing
Needs Assessment. Because day laborers are a transient population, there are few statistics indicating
the number of day laborers in Contra Costa County or Pittsburg in particular. Monument Futures, a
nonprofit organization located in Concord that offers job skills, educational, and social support services
to day laborers, assists about 250 people a year who live in central and east Contra Costa County.3
While Pittsburg does not have a significant number of farmworkers and other agricultural workers,
people employed as day laborers and seasonal workers experience the same issues with obtaining
affordable housing faced by farmworkers in other communities. Specifically, these groups often do not
have a rental or credit history or other required documents, making it difficult to secure affordable or
adequate housing. In addition, day laborers are not guaranteed a steady stream of income because their
jobs and weekly income tend to fluctuate. Because these groups lack adequate documentation and
guaranteed income to obtain safe and affordable housing, they are susceptible to paying higher rents or
living in overcrowded or substandard conditions. Housing strategies to assist these groups may include
provision of large, family-sized affordable rental housing and flexible standards for verifying rental or
credit histories. Another potential strategy would be to partner with a nonprofit group or day laborer
advocacy organization that could take out ground leases in rental housing and sublease the units to day
laborers.

As of 2013, the city had a slightly higher overall vacancy rate
(approximately seven percent) than the county (approximately six
percent); vacancy rates for both jurisdictions have nearly doubled since
2008.4 Vacancy rates have likely increased in Pittsburg due to the high
number of foreclosures in eastern Contra Costa County, and specifically in
Pittsburg, during the reporting period. Table 2-25 compares housing stock
and vacancy rates for Pittsburg and Contra Costa County provided by the
2010 Census and the DOF for 2013.

  Note that vacancy rates reported by the Department of Finance represent both owner-occupied and renter-occupied units.

HOUSING GROWTH
Pittsburg accounts for approximately six percent of total housing units in the county. According to data
provided by the DOF, approximately 50,351 new housing units were built in Contra Costa County from
2000 to 2013. In the same time period, Pittsburg added about 3,155 units. Approximately 2,500 of these
housing units were built from 2000 to 2008, prior to the Great Recession; about 655 units were built
from 2009 to 2013. A higher proportion of single-family units were built in the city than in the county
overall. Approximately 92 percent of new housing built in Pittsburg during this time was detached
single-family housing, compared to 81 percent in the county. Table 2-26 compares housing estimates for
the City and the County.

HOUSING SIZE BY TENURE
According to US Census data, approximately 60 percent of the housing stock in Pittsburg is owner-
occupied and 40 percent is renter-occupied, compared to 67 and 33 percent for Contra Costa County,
respectively. As with most cities, Pittsburg contains a significant supply of smaller renter units with two
or fewer bedrooms, while owner-occupied housing units are more likely to have three or more
bedrooms. Only 14 percent of Pittsburg’s total rental housing stock has four or more bedrooms, while
40 percent of for-sale units have four or more bedrooms. The limited supply of large rental units can
lead to overcrowding among large low-income families who cannot afford to purchase a home.5

HOUSING CONDITIONS
A housing conditions survey was conducted in August 2008 to better understand the city’s
housing rehabilitation and replacement needs. Housing Element project staff surveyed 487
addresses (1,023 units) that were approximately five percent of the housing stock within
selected U.S. Census block groups containing a concentration of 50 percent, or more, of
housing built prior to 1970. Census block groups having a preponderance of units built before
1970, compared to the city overall, are likely to have higher concentrations of units in need of
rehabilitation or replacement.
According to HCD, housing age can serve as an indicator of the maximum potential housing
rehabilitation need within a city. Unless well maintained, older housing stock can pose health,
safety and welfare problems for occupants. Even with normal maintenance, dwellings over 40
years of age can deteriorate, necessitating significant rehabilitation.
The windshield survey analyzed the exterior condition of existing housing units, reviewing each
unit’s (1) foundation; (2) roof and chimney; (3) electrical; (4) windows; (5) siding, stucco and
other exterior surfaces; and (6) overall site drainage and external conditions. Residential
structures scored into the following housing condition categories: “sound,” “minor,”
“moderate,” “substantial” or “dilapidated.” Units defined as sound, are in generally good
condition and do not require rehabilitation. Units defined as in minor condition require non-
structural repairs but are otherwise in sound condition.
Units defined as in moderate condition require some structural improvements as well as major
façade improvements. Units defined as substantial would require significant structural and
façade improvements nearing the improved value of the home. Finally, units defined as
dilapidated are homes where the cost to rehabilitate the home is more than the cost to
demolish and rebuild a comparable unit on the same site.
Overall Housing Conditions Findings
In total, the survey evaluated 362 single-family addresses, 4 live-work addresses, 76 duplex
addresses, 43 multi-family (3-50+ units per structure) addresses, and two mobile home parks.
Approximately 84 percent of addresses were in sound condition, nine percent in minor
condition and seven percent in moderate condition. Although no dilapidated units or units

Areas in Need of Housing Rehabilitation
Four of the selected census tract block groups contained 26 percent or more units that were in
minor or moderate condition. Among those, three had units where 10 percent or more were in
moderate condition. The specific neighborhoods in question are Tenth Street (on both sides of
Railroad Avenue), Central Addition (west of Harbor Street), Heights/West Boulevard, and the
southern half of Willow Cove. High School Village had more than 10 percent of units in
moderate condition, and should equally be an area of concern. See Error! Reference source not
found. for a map of areas in need of housing rehabilitation.
Total Housing Rehabilitation Need
The percentages derived from the windshield survey for housing in sound, minor and moderate
condition were applied to Pittsburg’s total housing stock in order to obtain an estimate of the
city’s overall housing rehabilitation need. This analysis revealed that one-third of duplexes,
triplexes and quadriplexes are in minor and moderate condition. Mobile homes scored the
highest (100 percent in sound condition), but this score can be misleading given the difficulty in
scoring a single address containing over 40 units requiring different levels of rehabilitation.
Overall, the two surveyed mobile home parks were in good condition, with only some of the
structures requiring repair. Only three percent of structures with 5 units or more need moderate
rehabilitation. Single-family homes need approximately five percent moderate rehabilitation,
and seven percent minor rehabilitation. According to the Planning Department, the percentage
of units in need of rehabilitation from 2008 to present remains similar.

OVERCROWDING
Overcrowding occurs when housing costs are high relative to income, necessitating that families reside
in smaller homes than are appropriate based on their household size. Overcrowding also tends to result
in increased neighborhood traffic, deterioration of homes, and a shortage of on-site parking. Therefore,
maintaining a reasonable level of occupancy and alleviating overcrowding is an important contributor to
quality of life.
Chapter 2 – Housing Needs Assessment                                                                                                                       2-37

Overcrowding affects about 16 percent of households in Pittsburg and about ten percent of households
in the county. Overcrowding rates also vary significantly by income and type and by household tenure.
Generally, lower-income households that rent experience a disproportionate share of overcrowding. In
Pittsburg, ten percent of renter households live in overcrowded conditions, a higher rate than among
owner households, which is about five percent.

COST BURDEN
Housing cost burden occurs when households pay more than 30 percent of their monthly income for
housing expenses (rent or mortgage, utilities, homeowner or renter insurance, and property taxes for
homeowners only). In many parts of California, particularly urban areas, it is not uncommon for
households to experience a housing cost burden. However, to the extent that cost burden is often
disproportionately concentrated among the most vulnerable members of a community, maintaining a
reasonable level of housing cost burden is an important goal.
Housing cost burden is a significant problem throughout the Bay Area. In Contra Costa County, 35
percent of all households pay more than 30 percent of their income on housing. In Pittsburg,
approximately 50 percent of households are cost burdened with a much higher proportion of very low-
and low-income households—35 percent combined—experiencing the problem. Table 2-33 provides a
profile of cost burden in Pittsburg by income and tenure.

HOUSING COSTS AND AFFORDABILITY
The cost of housing relative to the income of residents serves as an indicator of the extent of housing
problems in a given community. For example, if housing costs are high relative to median household
income, there tends to be a higher prevalence of excessive cost burden and overcrowding. This section
summarizes the costs and affordability of the housing stock to Pittsburg residents.
Home sales prices have shifted dramatically over the last year and have increased affordability among
low- and moderate-income households. Despite the availability of affordable for-sale housing, creditors
are much more hesitant to provide financing to low- and moderate-income households without a
substantial down payment and good credit history. Thus, while home prices have dropped, many homes
will remain unattainable to low- and moderate-income households.
HOME SALES TRENDS
Table 2-34 and Table 2-35 compare home sales in Pittsburg and east Contra Costa County (defined as
the cities of Antioch, Oakley, Pittsburg, Brentwood, and the unincorporated communities of Bay Point
and Discovery Bay) in 2013. As shown in the tables, the median price for homes sold in Pittsburg
containing two-, three-, and four-bedrooms was $150,000, $230,000, and $305,000, respectively. The
median price for all homes sold in the City during this period was $260,000. By comparison, the median
price for all homes sold in east Contra Costa County was $304,000. While the median sales price was
higher in east Contra Costa County than it was in Pittsburg, the median price per square foot was slightly
higher in Pittsburg ($156) than in east Contra Costa County ($154). This data may indicate that
homebuyers in the City were willing to pay more for less living area than they were in east Contra Costa
County. It’s also an indication of available entry-level or first-time homebuyer homes that are sized
smaller than move-up homes, which are larger but achieve lower values per square foot. Reflective of
this trend, homes sold in Pittsburg were on an average of about 300 square feet smaller than homes
sold in east Contra Costa County.

As shown in Table 2-36, from 2001 to 2007, the price per square foot of homes in Pittsburg and east
Contra Costa County increased an average of 8.6 and 8.2 percent per year, respectively, not accounting
for inflation. However, in 2007, average home sales price per square foot decreased dramatically in both
Pittsburg and east Contra Costa County, by 42.8 and 40.8 percent, respectively. In June and July of 2001,
the median home price in Pittsburg was $250,000; by 2007, for the same two months, the median home
price had risen to $432,000. In June and July of 2008, the median home sale price had decreased to
$260,000. This precipitous fall in home prices returned east Contra Costa County to 2001 prices, not
accounting for inflation. After the reduction in 2008, home sale prices stabilized and increased slowly
between 2008 and 2013. By June and July 2013, the median house price rose about 1.4 percent for
Pittsburg and about 2.7 percent for east Contra Costa County. However, the majority of the equity gain
realized by homeowners in the early to mid-2000s was lost in 2008 due to the recession.

FORECLOSURES
Subprime mortgages—granted to borrowers with weak, or subprime, credit histories—played a
major role in the over-inflation of housing prices and the increase in foreclosures in Pittsburg
and the rest of the United States in the late 2000s. The foreclosure crisis led to an oversupply of
homes for sale at or below market rate. Also as a result of the foreclosure crisis, lenders
adjusted lending practices to make credit less available to those with blemished credit or who
could provide little to no down payment on a home.
As shown in Table 2-37, according to DataQuick, foreclosures in Contra Costa County increased
by 118 percent from the second quarter of 2007 to the second quarter of 2008, most likely a
result of predatory lending practices and the slowing housing market described above. As of the
second quarter of 2014, foreclosure filings had decreased by about 81 percent since 2008,
indicating that the worst of the foreclosure crisis is past.

As shown in Chart 2-5, rents increased in Pittsburg and the County from 2012 to 2014 at a
similar pace. This increase in rental prices is a result of the reduction in for-sale housing
following the foreclosure crisis combined with tightening of credit available to homebuyers.
Households who might have otherwise bought or owned a home are renting instead. Also,
households that experienced foreclosure in the late 2000s entered the rental housing market,
reducing the available supply of rental housing.

HOUSING AFFORDABILITY
A community’s housing affordability can be measured by evaluating market prices for homes compared
to the number of residents who are able to afford for-sale housing. According to HUD standards, a home
is affordable if it is suitably sized and costs the household 30 percent or less of its gross monthly income.
In other words, suitable affordable housing should not result in a cost burden, paying more than 30
percent of a household’s gross monthly income, nor overcrowding, requiring more than one person per
room.6 While this standard is helpful for purposes of analysis, housing affordability varies by income
group, with extremely low-income households having greater challenges accessing housing affordable at
their incomes versus above moderate-income households that are able to spend significantly more on
housing. This analysis evaluates housing affordability by income group (i.e., extremely low, very low,
low, moderate, and above moderate).
To evaluate the affordability of the housing stock in Pittsburg, housing cost information collected for
2013 and described in the previous section was compared to household income limits in 2013. Table 2-
37 presents the maximum amount that a household can pay for housing each month (e.g., rent or
mortgage, utilities, home insurance, and property taxes) without exceeding the 30 percent income-
housing cost threshold.7 Calculations of affordable for-sale home prices are based on an annual interest
rate of 5 percent for a standard 30-year mortgage and a 10 percent down payment. Calculations were
derived using the Zillow Affordable Home Price Calculator (http://www.zillow.com/mortgage-
calculator/house-affordability/).
This amount can be compared to market prices for single-family homes and condominiums and
apartment rents to determine what types of housing a household can afford. As noted in Table 2-32
above, in 2013, the median price for a two-, three-, and four-bedroom home in Pittsburg was $150,000,
$230,000, and $305,000, respectively. According to Table 2-36, the average rent for a studio, one-, two-,
and three-bedroom home was $776, $1,076, $1,223 (assumes one bathroom), and $1,516, respectively.
Numbers highlighted in bold in Table 2-39 below indicate an inability for each household type/size to
afford the market-rate home or rental price for an equivalent sized home.

  HCD and HUD define cost burdened as paying more than 30 percent of a household’s gross monthly income toward housing. The 30
   percent standard is also applied to set affordable rents for income-restricted units.

AFFORDABILITY BY HOUSEHOLD INCOME
As presented in Table 2-39, extremely low-, very low-, and low-income households generally cannot
afford market-rate rental or for-sale housing in Pittsburg. While home prices may be affordable for
smaller very low-income households, they are out of the affordable range for larger very low-
income households and all extremely low- and very low-income households. In general, low- and
moderate-income households are able to afford the average rental or median priced for-sale
housing in Pittsburg. However, large family (three or more persons) low-income households cannot
afford to purchase an equivalent home with three or more bedrooms. The following information
describes housing affordability by income group in more detail.
       Extremely Low-Income Households. Extremely low-income households earn 30 percent or less
        of the area median income (AMI). The maximum affordable home price for an extremely low-
        income household ranges from $40,000 for a one-person household to $57,700 for a five-person
        household. Extremely low-income households cannot afford homeownership in Pittsburg,
        regardless of household size.
        In addition, market rents exceed the affordable housing payment for an extremely low-income
        household, which can afford to pay $327 to $441 in rent per month, after accounting for utilities.
        In practical terms, this means that a one-person household cannot afford an average priced studio
        without assuming a cost burden or doubling up. The problem is exacerbated for larger extremely
        low-income households.
       Very Low-Income Households. Very low-income households earn between 31 and 50 percent of
        the AMI. The maximum affordable home price for a very low-income household ranges from
        $90,970 for a one-person household to $135,800 for a five-person household.
        Similar to extremely low-income households, very low-income households may have difficulty
        locating suitable and affordable rental housing in Pittsburg. The maximum rental housing
        payment for a very low-income household ranges from $655 to $946 per month, depending on
        household size. With the average rents in Pittsburg ranging from $796 for a studio to $1,516 for a
        three-bedroom unit, the average very low-income household cannot afford to pay the average
        rental price for a home, regardless of household size.
       Low-Income Households. Lower-income households earn between 51 and 80 percent of the
        AMI. The maximum affordable home price for a low-income household ranges from $143,500 for
        a one-person household to $217,300 for a five-person household. With the median studio and one-
Chapter 2 – Housing Needs Assessment                                                                       2-48

         bedroom home in Pittsburg selling for $61,000, and $150,000, respectively, smaller low-income
         households may be able to afford to purchase a market-rate home in Pittsburg. However, low-
         income households with three or more people would have difficulty locating an affordable two-
         bedroom and larger for-sale home and may seek to economize and live in a smaller home.
         A low-income household can afford to pay $995 to $1,472 in rent per month, depending on the
         household size. With the average rents in Pittsburg ranging from $776 for a studio to $1,516 for a
         three-bedroom unit, all except for a five-person low-income household would be able to rent an
         adequately sized apartment without assuming a cost burden.
        Moderate-Income Households. Moderate-income households earn between 81 and 120 percent of
         the AMI. The maximum affordable home price for a moderate-income household ranges from
         $268,100 for a one-person household to $409,000 for a five-person household. With the average
         two-, three-, and four-bedroom home in Pittsburg selling for $150,000, $230,000, and $305,000,
         respectively, moderate-income households would be able to afford a typical for-sale home in
         Pittsburg.
         A moderate-income household can afford to pay $1,800 to $2,713 in rent per month, depending
         on the household size. With the average rents in Pittsburg ranging from $776 for a studio to
         $1,516 for a three-bedroom unit, median-income households can afford to pay the average rental
         price for a home in Pittsburg, regardless of household size.
        Above Moderate-Income Households. Above moderate-income households have incomes over
         120 percent of AMI. Above moderate-income households do not have difficulty affording suitable
         market housing, for sale or rental, in Pittsburg.
Essential to these assumptions is the ability of very low-, low-, and moderate-income households’
ability to secure home financing with an annual interest rate of 5 percent for a standard 30-year
mortgage and a 10 percent down payment, which has become increasingly difficult in the current
financial climate. Households with poor credit histories or unsteady employment will struggle to
secure home financing, regardless of whether they can afford to make payments on the home.

AT-RISK RENTAL HOUSING
Affordable housing options for lower-income households are generally limited to rental housing.
Therefore, preserving the existing affordable rental housing stock is an important goal for the City
of Pittsburg. Most affordable rental housing units in the city were achieved through subsidy
contracts and deed restrictions/affordability covenants in exchange for rehabilitation and

affordability controls and revert to market-rate uses. For instance, development projects are
typically considered at risk due to: (1) the prepayment provisions of HUD-insured mortgage loans;
(2) expiration of Section 8 contracts; and (3) expiration of restrictions on mortgage revenue bonds.
The following describes in detail these conditions.
        Prepayment of HUD loans: In the mid-1960s, the federal government provided low-interest
         financing or mortgage insurance to housing developers in return for guaranteeing that rents
         remain affordable to lower-income households. After 20 years, the owners could prepay the
         mortgages and lift their rent restrictions or maintain the affordability controls until their
         mortgages were paid off.
        Section 8 Program: In the mid-1970s, the federal government created the Section 8 program to
         encourage the production of affordable rental housing. Under the Section 8 program, HUD
         provided a 15- or 20-year agreement to provide rental subsidies to property owners in return for
         making the units affordable to very low-income households. The income is typically the
         difference between 30 percent of the household’s income and a negotiated fair market rent for
         the area.
        Bond Financed Projects: State, County, and local governments have the authority to issue tax-
         exempt mortgage revenue bonds to provide below-market-rate financing for rental housing
         construction. State and federal law require that multi-family projects built with tax-exempt bond
         proceeds set aside a portion of units as affordable to lower-income households for a specified
         period of time. The typical contractual period is 10 to 15 years. After the term expires, the
         property owners may rent the units at market rates.
AFFORDABLE RENTAL UNITS AT RISK BETWEEN 2015 AND 2025
State law requires that the City assess the risk of losing affordable rental housing over a 10-year
planning period. Table 2-42 identifies at-risk housing in the city, defined as multi-family rental
housing that is at risk of losing its status as housing affordable for low- and moderate-income
tenants due to the expiration of federal, state, or local agreements as described in more detail
above. For this Housing Element, the at-risk analysis covers the period from January 31, 2015,
through January 31, 2025.
Pittsburg contains 261 multi-family units at risk of conversion to market rate; all other assisted
housing units are preserved or at low risk of conversion due to nonprofit ownership or long-term
Chapter 2 – Housing Needs Assessment                                                                       2-51

affordability restrictions. Two of the at-risk developments are financed through Section 8 and
governed by HUD. One of these developments, Lido Square, contains 162 units divided into 88 two-
bedroom units and 84 three-bedrooms, is privately owned, financed through Section 8, and
governed by HUD. Lido Square’s 40-year commitment with HUD to remain affordable could expire
as early as 2016. However, the 162 low-income units within Lido Square are at low risk of conversion
due to a trust agreement with HUD and an intention to maintain affordability at the complex.8
The other at-risk Section 8 development is East Santa Fe Avenue Apartments, comprising 19 units
divided into studio and one-bedroom apartments. The apartment complex is owned and managed
by Shelter, Inc. of Contra Costa County, an independent, charitable nonprofit organization whose
mission is to prevent and end homelessness for low-income residents of the county. Based on the
organization’s mission, the East Santa Fe Avenue Apartments are at a low risk of conversion. 9
Woods Manor is a Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) project whose tax income credits were
set to expire within 15 years of December 1, 1988, the date on which they were placed in service
(estimated at 2003). Woods Manor is an 80-unit multi-family apartment complex composed of eight
one-bedroom units, 32 two-bedroom units, 28 three-bedroom units, and 12 four-bedroom units.
The complex is owned by Bridge Housing, an affordable housing developer. In 2009, Bridge Housing
applied for and received an $800,000 commitment in Contra Costa County HOME funds (at $10,000
per unit), triggering new affordability restrictions lasting a minimum of ten years.10 Due to the new
affordability restrictions and Bridge Housing’s mission to provide housing to low-income families,
Woods Manor is currently not at risk of conversion due to new restrictions.

PRESERVATION OPTIONS
The appropriate preservation options depend largely on the type of project at risk and the type of
financing used to make the units affordable. Two methods are available to ensure there is no net
loss of at-risk units converting to market rate within the planning period: the units must be acquired
and preserved or new affordable units must be constructed to replace those lost in conversion.
Either of those options will ensure affordable controls and price restrictions are extended under
federal, state, and local programs. The cost of acquiring and preserving the units is estimated to be
less than replacement through new construction. Preservation typically requires rent subsidies to
cover the difference between market-rate and assisted rents.
Chapter 2 – Housing Needs Assessment                                                                                                                              2-53

Rent Subsidies
Netting out the 80 Woods Manor units which are under new HOME funding restrictions, leaves a
total of 181 units at risk of converting during the planning period. If all 181 units at risk converted to
market-rate prices, the estimated rent subsidy would cost $100,484 per month or approximately
$1.2 million annually, not including the cost of potential rehabilitation.

Replacement Cost Analysis
The following analysis estimates the cost of replacement or preservation of assisted housing units at
risk of conversion to market rate. The cost analysis will enable decision-makers to use a "bottom
line" approach to evaluate proposals targeted to preserve units at risk of conversion. The
replacement cost analysis attempts to approximate costs of rebuilding affordable units under current
building prices and conditions that are comparable in size to the units at risk of conversion.
Table 3-1 provides a residential development cost summary for single-family, townhome, and multi-
family development costs and accounts for land acquisition and improvement, construction costs,
and fees. According to this analysis, a 20-unit multi-family development (with an average unit size of
1,000 square feet) would cost about $4.3 million to construct or about $213,386 per unit. Therefore,
Chapter 2 – Housing Needs Assessment                                                                                                                               2-54

the estimated cost of replacing all 181 multi-family units is estimated at approximately $39 million
not including the rent subsidies required to keep the units affordable to very low- and low-income
households.
Based on this analysis, the cost of replacement far outweighs the costs associated with a continuation
of rent subsidies throughout the next Housing Element period. Therefore, the most economical
solution would be to continue offering subsidies to households in need of assistance and to provide
support to property owners to retain affordable housing assets. The Housing Element includes
Program (P-4.2-B) to monitor the progress of Section 8 renewal and facilitate the process whereby the
City can assist in the maintaining the long-term affordability of these developments.
REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATION
State law establishes that regional councils of government are to identify for each city and county the
“fair share allocation” of the most recent Regional Housing Needs Determination. For the most recent
Regional Housing Needs Determination, which was released in July 2013, ABAG aligned the Regional
Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) with the region’s first Sustainable Communities Strategy pursuant to
Senate Bill 375, requiring that each region plan for future housing needs and complementary land uses
which in turn must be supported by a transportation investment strategy with a goal of reducing
greenhouse gas emissions. Needs are assessed for the period from 2014 through 2022. In turn, cities
and counties must address these local shares of regional housing in their housing elements. ABAG’s
RHNA for Pittsburg is summarized in Table 2-44.
The Bay Area’s sustainable growth framework is built around Priority Development Areas (PDAs) and
Priority Conservation Areas (PCAs). PDAs are existing neighborhoods near existing or planned transit or
high frequency bus lanes nominated by local jurisdictions as appropriate places to concentrate future
growth. On July 16, 2007, the Pittsburg City Council adopted Resolution 07-10845, establishing three
PDAs within the city limits. These areas are the future eBART Station area at Railroad Avenue,
downtown Pittsburg, and the Pittsburg/Bay Point BART Station area in partnership with Contra Costa
County. Since the establishment of the PDAs, the City has adopted the Railroad Avenue eBART Specific
Plan (November 2009) and the Pittsburg/Bay Point BART Master Plan (October 2011). Both of these
Station Area Plans were funded through grants from the Metropolitan Transportation Commission
(MTC) and the Contra Costa Transit Authority (CCTA), with significant input from ABAG and the Bay Area
Rapid Transit District (BART).
Chapter 2 – Housing Needs Assessment                                                                    2-55

The City’s share of the regional housing need will be met with a variety of strategies (e.g., available and
appropriately zoned land, units built since the beginning of baseline RHNA period, second units).
However, the primary method for addressing the adequate sites requirement will be through the
implementation of the adopted Railroad Avenue Specific Plan and the Pittsburg/Bay Point BART Master
Plan for the identified PDAs in conjunction with the identification of available vacant and non-
vacant/underutilized sites that are suitable, appropriately zoned, and ready for development.

PROGRESS IN MEETING THE 2014-2022 RHNA GOAL
Table 2-45 details the number of housing units that have been approved for development and are
planned for construction during this RHNA planning period (see Table 4-2 for detailed project
information). This housing will be available for occupancy during this RHNA period and thus will
contribute to the City’s ability to address the 2014–2022 RHNA. After accounting for approved housing
units, Pittsburg has a remaining housing need of 196 extremely low-, 196 very low-, 131 low-, 244
moderate and 136 above moderate-income units. In addition to these approved projects, there are
several residential development projects in the pipeline that are undergoing environmental review
and/or entitlement process. Projects in the pipeline include Montreux (365 single family residential
units), Tuscany Meadows (917 single family residential units and up to 365 multi-family units), and
Esperanza Apartments (300 multi-family units).

CHAPTER 3 HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES AND CONSTRAINTS
The provision of adequate and affordable housing is an important goal of the City. As a result,
the City has proactively implemented a variety of programs, incentives, and development
standards to encourage the development, maintenance, and improvement of affordable
housing. Despite these policies to encourage the development of affordable housing, a variety
of factors including environmental considerations, market mechanisms, and government
regulations influence and may constrain the development of housing. This section identifies
those constraints.
MARKET CONSTRAINTS
Land costs, construction costs, and market financing contribute to the cost of housing
investment and can potentially hinder the production of new affordable housing. Although
many constraints are driven by market conditions, jurisdictions have some leverage in instituting
policies and programs to address the constraints.
LAND COST
A key component of residential development costs is the price of raw land. The diminishing
supply of residential land combined with fairly high demand keeps land cost relatively high in
the Bay Area. However, residential land prices have fallen dramatically since the pre-recession
peak. From 2007 to 2008, sales prices for residential lots in Pittsburg ranged from $54 to $146
per square foot, according to RealQuest data. While a search of Multiple Listing Service data
revealed few transactions in recent years, sales prices were recorded at as low as $6.61 per
square foot in June 2014 (data provided by Redfin.com). Note that land prices can vary greatly
based on location, development potential, and many other factors.
Chapter 3 – Housing Opportunities and Constraints                                                 3-1

SITE DEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION COST
The costs to develop new housing include land improvements, site preparation, and the actual cost to
construct the housing units. A portion of the total cost to develop new housing is associated with
government fees that mitigate the impact of new development on local infrastructure and services.
These costs are discussed in more detail in Section 0, Governmental Opportunities and Constraints.
From 2001 to 2007, the price of housing in the Bay Area rose at a much higher rate than family income,
thus reducing the opportunity for homeownership for a growing percentage of the residents. Since
2007, home prices in outlying areas of the Bay Area, including Pittsburg, have depreciated, making
homes more affordable and slowing the pace of housing development. The median home price in
Pittsburg fell from approximately $432,000 in June and July of 2007 to $260,000 in 2013 (full year).
Site development costs vary greatly depending on the location and topography of the land, its proximity
to available infrastructure, and other project characteristics that affect the type and extent of
improvements that are necessary to support residential use on the property. According to Building-
cost.net, a housing construction cost resource that calculates the total estimated cost of building a new
home (land costs not included), the estimated total construction cost of a 2,000-square-foot home with
four walls, an attached two-car garage, central heating and air, and average building materials is
$226,065. The cost of building a multi-family unit is generally lower then a single-family unit. RS Means
estimated that a typical multi-family unit would cost approximately $144,000 to construct.
Governmental fees can range from approximately $42,646 per unit for a multi-family unit to $64,741 for
a larger single-family home (Tables 3-1 and 3-7).

  This analysis assumes that a single developer would purchase raw land, provide the necessary infrastructure and improvements for home construction, and build the homes. In many cases, the
   development process is performed by two separate entities: the land developer who purchases, entitles, and makes site improvements, and the homebuilder who purchases the lots and builds the
   homes. In this scenario, overall costs may increase, as both the land developer and the homebuilder expect to achieve profits.

MORTGAGE AND REHABILITATION FINANCING
The availability of financing affects a person’s ability to purchase or improve a home. In the early 2000s,
mortgage interest rates and access to loans became more readily available to a larger pool of potential
buyers, with an increased portion offered to households with greater credit risk. In 2005, the average
interest rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage was approximately 5.8 percent compared to 7.2 percent in
2001. In September of 2008, the average 30-year fixed loan had climbed to 6.7 percent annual interest.2
Due to the nationwide economic recession, interest rates for residential loans dipped and are currently
(2014) averaging about four percent.3 While interest rates are lower, lending standards have become
more restrictive, making it difficult for many households to qualify for a mortgage. Lenders closely
scrutinize household income, credit history, and the overall risk of the loan. Thus, while interest rates
are lower, the limited access to home financing and available credit has reduced the pool of buyers able
to purchase a home. Furthermore, the lack of credit not only affects homebuyers and homeowners but
also developers and rental property owners who want to improve their properties.

GOVERNMENTAL OPPORTUNITIES AND CONSTRAINTS
RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
The City of Pittsburg has four residential base districts and two downtown residential districts:
RR (Rural Residential) District, RS (Single-Family Residential) District, RM (Medium-Density
Residential) District, RH (High-Density Residential) District, RMD (Downtown Medium-Density
Residential) District and RHD (Downtown High-Density Residential) District. The following
section presents each residential zoning district.
The RR District applies in rural areas that include orchards, croplands, grasslands, agricultural
lands, or related uses, and very low-density rural residential areas, not exceeding one housing
unit per five acres.                                                                                 RS District: Site Area per Dwelling
The RS District designation includes most of the single-family neighborhoods in Pittsburg. This        Site Area                Sq. Ft.
district was specifically created to retain the low-density character of these areas, and its     RS-4                   4,000
development standards are structured accordingly. Minimum lot sizes range from 4,000 to           RS-5                   5,000
40,000 square feet. The RS District includes five subdistricts with a range of corresponding      RS-6                   6,000
minimum lot sizes, summarized in the table to the right.                                          RS-10                  10,000
The RM District is intended to allow small-lot single-family homes and smaller multi-family       RS-40                  40,000
residential developments. The minimum lot size is 3,000 square feet. There is a 28- to 35-foot
height limit depending on whether the type of development is single-family detached or multi-
family apartments/condominiums. This classification is inclusive of single residency occupancy
(SRO) development, as there is not a minimum bedroom count for the type of development
permitted in the RM District. Development of SROs would be subject to the same limitations,
requirements, and incentives as multi-family residential development in the RM District.
Chapter 3 – Housing Opportunities and Constraints                                                                                        3-5

The RH District provides opportunities for intensive, high-density residential development and
institutional uses with relatively high land coverage—including single-family attached units, apartment
complexes with 20 or more units, and condominiums—at appropriate locations in the city. RH District
density is typically between 14 and 25 units per acre; however, multi-family projects that incorporate
more than the minimum number of affordable units required under Pittsburg Municipal Code Chapter
18.86 (Inclusionary Housing) are permitted an increase in maximum density up to 40 dwelling units per
acre. Specifically, for each two percent increase in deed-restricted lower-income units offered above the
inclusionary housing requirement, lot area per unit may be reduced 100 square feet per unit and
minimum lot area may be reduced 2,000 square feet to a maximum of 1,100 square feet per unit and a
minimum lot area of 22,000 square feet. If a project meets the criteria described above, the flexibility in
development standards (including but not limited to parking minimums, setbacks, height limits, and
minimum open and private storage space per unit) is granted as a by-right development standard upon
request as part of the design review process. This classification is inclusive of SRO development, as there
is not a minimum bedroom count for the type of development in the RH District. Development of SROs
would be subject to the same limitations, requirements, and incentives as multi-family residential
development in the RH District.
Downtown Residential Districts include medium- and high-density residential districts (RMD and RHD).
These districts provide opportunities for residential development with increased land coverage for
attached or detached single-family residences and multi-family residences, such as townhouses,
apartment complexes with 16 or more units, and condominiums. Duplexes and multi-family dwellings in
these districts that do not meet the minimum lot size or density, such as triplexes and fourplexes, and
that are existing as of the effective date of the Zoning Ordinance codified in Title 18 (May 2007) are
considered legal nonconforming and are allowed to remain. RMD District density is typically between 12
and 18 units per acre, and RHD District density is typically between 18 and 30 units per acre; however,
multi-family residential developments that incorporate more than the minimum number of affordable
units required under PMC Chapter 18.86 (Inclusionary Housing) are permitted an increase in maximum
density up to 40 dwelling units per acre. Specifically, for each two percent increase in deed-restricted
lower-income units offered above the inclusionary housing requirement, lot area per unit may be
reduced 100 square feet per unit and minimum lot area may be reduced 2,000 square feet to a
maximum of 1,100 square feet per unit and a minimum lot area of 22,000 square feet. If a project meets
the criteria described above, the flexibility in development standards (including but not limited to
parking minimums, setbacks, height limits, and minimum open and private storage space per unit) is
granted as a by-right development standard upon request as part of the design review process. This

classification is inclusive of single residency occupancy (SRO) development, as there is not a minimum
bedroom count for the type of development in the RHD/RMD Districts. Development of SROs would be
subject to the same limitations, requirements, and incentives as multi-family residential development in
the RHD/RMD Districts. The more recently developed neighborhoods, especially at the city’s southern
fringe, are typified by suburban-style, residential development—large expanses of solely residential
subdivisions with layouts dominated by cul-de-sacs and few through-streets and often built within
peripheral walls. Because grocery stores and other commercial uses are primarily limited to Railroad
Avenue, Leland Road, Bailey Road, and Loveridge Road, Pittsburg’s emerging residential neighborhoods
are located at increasing distances from basic shopping facilities.
Table 3-2 presents development standards for these districts including minimum lot area, maximum
coverage/floor area, minimum setbacks, and maximum height.

   Planning Commission finds that the site encompasses an entire city block and that the area of the given city block is not adequate in size to support 20 or more units. Alternatively, the Planning
   Commission may find that a multi-family development consisting of fewer than 20 units would better serve the public interest because more than 50 percent of the units in the development would be
   rental units with three or more bedrooms. Upon making one or both of the findings stated above, minimum site area may be reduced to no less than 18,000 square feet.

RESIDENTIAL USES IN NONRESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICTS
It is important to consider potential constraints to housing development in nonresidential districts, as
there is significant residential development potential located on sites not zoned exclusively for
residential development. Table 3-3 indicates the parameters for residential uses in the City’s
Commercial, Governmental/Quasi-Public, and Mixed Use Districts.
Chapter 3 – Housing Opportunities and Constraints                                                                                                                                                          3-9

Multi-family residential uses are permitted in all Commercial Districts provided they are located above
or adjacent to ground-floor office, restaurant, or retail use on the same site, subject to design review.
Projects with multi-family residential units above or adjacent to office, restaurant, or retail uses on the
same site are permitted an increase of up to 0.25 floor area ratio (FAR) over that allowed in the
applicable base district, provided that the residential floor area comprises no less than 25 percent and
no more than 75 percent of the total square footage of building developed on-site.
The development standards in all commercial districts are generally conducive to housing development,
although some constraints to higher-density housing do exist. In the CO (Commercial Office), CN
(Neighborhood Commercial), CC (Community Commercial), and CS (Service Commercial) Districts, a 10-
to 15-foot side and 15- to 20-foot front setback requirement could make development difficult on
smaller sites. However, the Municipal Code allows front and corner side yard reductions to a minimum
of 5 feet in CN and CC Districts for buildings with a pedestrian-oriented design. The CW (Waterfront
Commercial), CP (Pedestrian Commercial), and CSD (Downtown Service Commercial) Districts have no
front setback requirement, and only require minimum setbacks if the site is adjacent to residential uses,
allowing for an increased development envelope.
Height limits allow three stories in the CO and CN Districts (35 feet). Higher-density, mixed-use projects
with podium parking could be difficult in the CO and CN Districts due to these height restrictions.
However, high-density, mixed-use development with podium parking is feasible in the CC and CP
Districts where the height limit is 60 feet.
Lot coverage and FAR limits also apply in all commercial districts. The CN District has the lowest lot
coverage at 40 percent compared to 60 percent in the CS, CSD, and CW Districts and 100 percent in the
CP District. The CC District allows 50 percent lot coverage. The Municipal Code also contains flexible
standards in that it permits lot coverage and FAR increases up to 50 percent in the CN District and up to
55 percent and an 0.25 additional FAR on the base district allowance for mixed-use developments in all
commercial districts. Notwithstanding the increase, the lower lot coverage and FAR in the CN District is
appropriate in that the district is intended to provide neighborhood-serving retail stores developed at a
smaller scale to reflect the surrounding detached single-family residential neighborhoods.
The GQ (Governmental/Quasi-Public) District permits single-family and multi-family residential
development provided that the Planning Commission or City Planner, as appropriate, finds that the land
will not be needed in the future for a public/institutional use. Applications for residential development
on properties in the GQ District are processed under the most appropriate zoning district standards
based on surrounding land uses and as determined appropriate by the City Planner.
Chapter 3 – Housing Opportunities and Constraints                                                           3-10

The M (Mixed Use) District is located in areas adjacent to existing and planned future transit facilities
and is intended to promote multimodal, high-density, mixed-use environments by locating high
concentrations of residents and employees in close proximity to transit stations and routes.
In 2009, the City adopted the Railroad Avenue Specific Plan (Specific Plan) for the roughly 1,075 acres
surrounding the planned eBART station at the intersection of State Route 4 and Railroad Avenue. eBART
is an approximately 10-mile extension of BART from the current terminus of Pittsburg/Bay Point, at the
western end of town, east through Pittsburg to a new terminus at Hillcrest in Antioch. BART anticipates
that the project will be completed and in service in 2017. The Specific Plan is intended to focus
development on the approximately 50 acres with a Mixed Use General Plan land use designation. In the
areas closest to the eBART station, approximately 17 acres allow development up to 65 units per acre,
approximately 27 acres allow development up to 30 dwelling units per acre, and approximately 7 acres
allow development up to 50 dwelling units per acre with ground-floor nonresidential uses up to 1.0 FAR.
While ground floor commercial uses are required in the Mixed Use District, residential uses are not
required in some of the areas closest to the eBART Station. Flexible development standards and
parking maximums with reductions in parking for affordable and senior housing developments will make
construction at the allowable densities possible on the proposed infill sites.
In 2011, the City adopted the Pittsburg/Bay Point Master Plan (Master Plan) covering approximately
195 acres around the existing Pittsburg/Bay Point BART Station. The Master Plan is intended to facilitate
mixed-use, high-density, transit-oriented development in close proximity to existing transit services.
According to the adopted Master Plan, the BART-owned property is a mix of High Density Residential
(approximately 4 acres) with a permitted density range of 50 to 70 units per acre; ground-floor retail (a
little over 1 acre); flex space (approximately 3 acres) allowing a range of 1.0 to 2.0 FAR and densities
between 20 and 70 units per acre; parking (a little over 3 acres) with ground-floor retail uses and a
public plaza. An adjacent 20-acre privately owned parcel is designated Medium Density Residential with
a permitted density range of 20 to 40 units per acre. Like the Railroad Avenue Specific Plan, flexible
development standards and parking maximums with reductions in parking for affordable and senior
housing developments will make construction at the allowable densities possible on the proposed infill
sites.

PARKING REQUIREMENTS
The City’s parking requirements for residential districts vary by housing type,     Table 3-4 Parking Requirements
the number of units, and parking needs. Single-family units and mobile homes
are required to have two off-street parking stalls per dwelling. At least one of
                                                                                     Residential Type                 Required Spaces

unbundling the cost of parking and housing, allowing shared parking, and
parking pricing when a measurable demand arises. During the last Housing
Element planning period, the City also processed parking reductions for
affordable housing developments consistent with the requirements set forth in
Senate Bill 1818.

spaces are required to be covered reduces the overall cost of providing parking
and makes the requirements more feasible for smaller sites.
SPECIAL HOUSING TYPES: USES AND STANDARDS
The Municipal Code contains definitions for the several special housing types. The Municipal Code’s
definition of family is “one or more persons, including any resident servant, who occupy a dwelling unit
and live as a single housekeeping unit as distinguished from a group occupying a hotel, club, shelter,
fraternity or sorority house.” Therefore, the Municipal Code does not distinguish between people who
are related and living as a family and those who are unrelated and living as a family (such as roommates
or residents of a residential care facility or foster home), provided they live as a single housekeeping unit
with shared common areas and kitchen and bathroom facilities.
Manufactured Homes and Mobile Homes are permitted in all residential districts and mobile home
parks. Manufactured homes may be located in any residential district where a single-family dwelling is
permitted and are subject to the same restrictions, provided the manufactured home receives a
certificate of compatibility as part of the zoning approval. However, manufactured homes are not
permitted in a designated historic district.
Congregate Care Residential Facilities are defined in the Zoning Ordinance as a building on a site
designed and typically devoted to housing persons of impaired physical or mental capacities, such as the
frail elderly or the handicapped, and offering limited 24-hour nonmedical care. This type of facility
typically contains small individual dwelling units of only one or two rooms with a small kitchen to allow
independent living; provides common dining, recreational, and social facilities; and offers minimal
convenience services such as housekeeping and transportation. These facilities are permitted in the RS-
6, RM, RMD, RH, and RHD Districts, provided such uses are separated from each other by a minimum
distance of 300 feet, measured from any point on the outside wall of the structure(s) housing the
facility. This use is also permitted in the CO and CC Districts with a use permit and in the CN District
provided it is located above or adjacent to ground-floor commercial uses.
Group Residential Facilities is defined in the Zoning Ordinance as shared living quarters without
separate kitchen or bathroom facilities for each room or unit. This classification includes a
boardinghouse, dormitory, fraternity, sorority, convent, and private residential club. These facilities are
permitted pursuant to approval of a use permit in the RM, RMD, RH, RHD, and CO Districts.
Chapter 3 – Housing Opportunities and Constraints                                                             3-15

Limited Residential Care Facilities are defined in the Zoning Ordinance as a 24-hour nonmedical care
facility for six or fewer persons in need of personal services, counseling, supervision, protection, or
assistance in order to sustain the activities of daily living. Facilities typically include foster homes, group
homes, and assisted living services with shared kitchen and dining facilities. This classification includes
only those services and facilities licensed by the State of California. A total of 37 licensed community
care facilities with 469 beds are located in Pittsburg.
Pursuant to state law, the Pittsburg Zoning Ordinance permits licensed residential care facilities with six
or fewer beds in all residential districts, provided such uses are separated from each other by a
minimum distance of 300 feet, measured from any point on the outside wall of the structure(s) housing
the facility, which is consistent with Health and Safety Code Section 1520.5. Although the Pittsburg
Municipal Code is consistent with the Health and Safety Code, the Health and Safety Code is not
consistent with the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act (Sections 5115 and 5116) of the
California Welfare and Institutions Code, which declares that mentally and physically disabled persons
are entitled to live in normal residential surroundings. The use of property for the care of six or fewer
disabled persons is a residential use for the purpose of zoning. A State-authorized, certified, or licensed
family care home, foster home, residential care facility, or group home serving six or fewer disabled
persons or dependent and neglected children on a 24-hour-a-day basis is considered a residential use
that is permitted in all residential zones. No local agency can impose stricter zoning or building and
safety standards on these homes than otherwise required for homes in the same district.
Protective Residential Care Facilities are defined as 24-hour nonmedical care for seven or more
persons, including wards of the juvenile court, in need of personal services, supervision, protection, or
assistance essential for sustaining the activities of daily living and includes only those facilities licensed
by the State. These facilities are currently permitted with a use permit in the CO and CN Districts and in
the RM and RH Districts.
Supportive Housing is defined as a residential facility in which there is no limit on length of stay, that is
occupied by a target population, and that is linked to on- or off-site services that assist the supportive
housing resident in retaining the housing, improving the residents’ health status, and maximizing the
residents’ ability to live and, when possible, work in the community. Supportive housing is currently
permitted in the RM and RH Districts. Since the 2007–2014 Housing Element planning period, HCD has
clarified the definition of supportive and transitional housing to include multi- and single-family
residential development and to clarify that such uses must be permitted in and treated as a residential
use, subject only to the regulations that apply to the same use type in the same zone. Housing Element
Program P-2.3.C requires the City to amend the Zoning Ordinance to redefine supportive and
Chapter 3 – Housing Opportunities and Constraints                                                               3-16

transitional housing to be consistent with Health and Safety Code Sections 50675.2 and 50675.14 and to
allow supportive and transitional housing as residential uses subject only to restrictions applicable to
other residential uses of the same type in the same zone.
Emergency Shelters is defined in the Zoning Ordinance as housing with minimal supportive services for
homeless persons that is limited to occupancy of six or fewer months by a homeless person. No
individual or household may be denied emergency shelter because of an inability to pay. Emergency
shelters are an allowable use in the CS (Service Commercial) District, provided the shelter complies with
the standards set forth in the Municipal Code. The CS district is ideal to accommodate an emergency
shelter and there are approximately 50.6 acres of vacant land with four sites available for development
ranging from 1.1 to 40.6 acres in size. Refer to Appendix B for a map of vacant sites. Such standards as
allowed by state law include maximum occupancy at no more than 25 beds, submittal of a management
plan, establishment of a minimum distance of 300 feet between emergency shelters, provision of a
client intake area, a minimum of two off-street parking spaces, and, exterior lighting. Additional
requirements for refuse storage areas and building site maintenance are set forth in section 18.80.035
and 18.82.050 of the municipal code. This use is not permitted in other zoning districts.
Transitional Housing is defined in the Zoning Ordinance as multi-family residential facilities designed to
assist persons in obtaining the skills necessary for independent living in permanent housing and that has
the following components:
        Support service programs that include regular individualized case management services.
        Use of a dwelling unit by a resident in a structured living environment, which use is conditioned upon
         compliance with the transitional housing rules and regulations.
        A rule or regulation which specifies an occupancy period of no fewer than 30 days and no more than
         24 consecutive months.
Currently, these facilities are permitted in the RM, RMD, RH, and RHD Districts and in all commercial
districts, provided the facilities are located adjacent to or above ground-floor commercial uses, which is
consistent with the development regulations for all multi-family residential development in commercial
districts. Since the 2007–2014 Housing Element planning period, HCD has clarified the definition of
supportive and transitional housing to include multi-and single-family residential development and to
clarify that such uses must be permitted in and treated as a residential use, subject only to the
regulations that apply to the same use type in the same zone. Implementation of Housing Element
Chapter 3 – Housing Opportunities and Constraints                                                               3-17

Program P-2.3.C, would bring the City into conformance with the current interpretaitons of state law
related to transitional housing.
Accessory Dwelling Units or “Second Units” are permitted in all residential districts or Planned
Development (PD) Districts on each lot that has a single-family dwelling. Applications for zoning
approval to build accessory units are processed ministerially and are subject to design and development
requirements set forth in the Zoning Ordinance. Specifically, the accessory unit must be limited in size to
50 percent or less of the total finished heated floor area of the primary dwelling unit or 750 square feet,
whichever is less. In addition, the unit must include one uncovered off-street parking space, which may
be in tandem with required parking for the primary dwelling unit. Current City requirements for
accessory dwelling units comply with state law. The City has included programs in this Housing Element
such as the reduction or waiver of fees to encourage the construction of second family units.
Farmworker Housing. The Zoning Ordinance permits farm labor housing in the Open Space (OS) District.
The OS District permits accessory living quarters by right and caretaker’s quarters with the approval of a
use permit.
The OS District boundaries generally follow the boundaries of the Open Space General Plan land use
designation which contains about 40 percent of the City’s Planning Area. The OS District accommodates
any greenbelts and/or urban buffer areas that may be designated in the future. Greenbelts are open
space, parkland, and agricultural areas located outside urban areas, as opposed to urban parks located
in developed areas. The majority of the OS acreage is for resource conservation that does not allow
construction on the land, rather than for agriculture, thereby further supporting the reduced need for
farmworker housing.
Single Residency Occupancy. A single residency occupancy (SRO) unit is a small (200 to 350 square feet)
residential unit intended to serve a single individual. SROs provide affordable housing for individuals and
can serve as an entry point into the housing market for formerly homeless people. The Pittsburg
Municipal Code does not contain a minimum number of square footage or bedrooms per multi-family
unit and therefore does not specifically regulate SROs. Rather, such units would be processed as multi-
family residential developments and subject to the same standards and requirements as those
developments.

ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH FLEXIBLE DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS AND CITY POLICIES
The City provides several mechanisms to facilitate the provision of a diversity of housing types to
address needs in the community. These mechanisms include the PD (Planned Development) District,
density bonuses in accordance with state law, and the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance. In addition,
2007–2014 Housing Element policies and programs support additional density bonuses and incentives
for mixed-income projects that include special needs housing (General Plan Policy 13-P-2.1(F)). The
flexibility provides additional support for granting flexibility from development standards for projects
that meet community objectives such as affordable and special needs housing. These policies and
programs are proposed to be carried forward into the 2015–2023 Housing Element as P-2.1(A–H), which
set forth financial and regulatory incentives, concessions, and allowances for development of housing
for special needs populations in the city. All of these regulations allow flexibility from the base district
development standards and are not considered to be constraints on housing development.

Planned Development District
In order to permit more creative and flexible designs for residential development than would ordinarily
be permitted in the base residential districts, the City established the PD (Planned Development)
District zoning classification. A residential PD District is essentially a custom-tailored zoning district that
may allow a variety of lot sizes, tenure, and types of housing (zero lot line, couplets, common wall and
detached housing, owner and rental) in one development. PD Districts allow variation in location and
arrangement (clustering) of units, height requirements, and variation in yards and setbacks. This
flexibility encourages preservation of open space, creativity in site design, and provision of
neighborhood amenities to increase the quality of design and life of residents. It also allows developers
to address specific geological or environmental factors on the site.
The specific purpose of the PD District is to:
         Establish a procedure for the development of large parcels of land in order to reduce or eliminate the
          rigidity, delay, and inequity that otherwise would result from application of zoning standards and
          procedures designed primarily for small parcels.
         Ensure orderly and thorough planning and review procedures that will result in quality urban design.
         Encourage variety and avoid monotony in large developments by allowing greater freedom in
          selecting the means to provide access, light, open space, and amenities.
         Provide flexibility, consistent with the General Plan, from the rigid land use and development
          regulations found in base districts in order to take advantage of unique land use or site characteristics.
         Encourage allocation and improvement of common open space in residential areas, and provide for
          maintenance of the open space at the expense of those who will directly benefit from it.
         Encourage the preservation of serviceable existing structures of historic value or artistic merit by
          providing the opportunity to use them imaginatively for purposes other than that for which they were
          originally intended.
         Encourage the assembly of properties that might otherwise be developed in unrelated increments to
          the detriment of surrounding neighborhoods.
Entitlement Procedures for PD District Zoning
To establish a new PD District, a developer must submit a re-zoning application. An application for
rezoning could take between 6 and 15 months to process depending on the number and complexity of
Chapter 3 – Housing Opportunities and Constraints                                                                    3-21

additional entitlements and the environmental analysis required for the project. For most new projects,
the rezoning application would be processed concurrently with a tentative map, site plan, or other
development project application. In all instances, the proposed PD District must be found to be
consistent with the General Plan, including density; however, all other development standards such as
setbacks, parking, height limits, and lot coverage are determined by the developer in the creation of the
site plan. This flexibility in development standards afforded through the PD District process allows
developers to submit plans for small-lot single-family, attached townhouses, clustered development,
and other site plans to support a variety of types of residential development.
The process for amending a PD District is the same process used for amending a base zoning district and
therefore is consistent and predictable to the public. The application fees are the same as those applied
to a conventional rezoning or zone text amendment. All of the requirements for a PD District, including
procedures for rezoning, are clearly laid out in the Zoning Ordinance as a separate zoning district and
chapter. Both a rezoning and zone change amendment for PD Districts require Planning Commission
review and City Council approval, as would zoning text amendments and zone changes for all base
districts.
While PD Districts have most often been associated with single-family residential development in the
city, recent approvals show that PD District zoning can also be used to develop high-density mixed-use
development. For example, the Vidrio project, involved an application for PD District zoning to support
high-density mixed-use development in the heart of downtown Pittsburg on three contiguous infill
blocks totaling 5.2 acres. The project was approved with 38,000 square feet of ground-floor commercial
development along Railroad Avenue and 195 residential units above and on the rear portions of the
blocks. Due to the economic downturn, only Blocks B and C of the PD District were constructed in
accordance with the approved PD District standards.
Density Bonus and Flexible Development Standards
The Zoning Ordinance offers provisions for density bonuses and incentives to developers who agree to
construct a specified percentage of housing units for very low- or low-income households or for senior
citizens, consistent with Government Code Sections 65915 through 65918.
In addition to a density bonus in accordance with state law, the City offers incentives for developers that
are consistent with the Government Code such as flexible development standards (increased height,
reduced setbacks, increased lot coverage) and flexible parking standards. For example, in 2009, the City
Council approved a 100 percent affordable project (Siena Court Senior Apartments) with an approximate
Chapter 3 – Housing Opportunities and Constraints                                                           3-22

56 percent density bonus over the maximum allowable density (111 units where 60 would be
permitted), in addition to variances from the minimum storage space per unit requirement (to provide
186 cubic feet where 200 cubic feet per unit is required) and a variance from the maximum number of
off-street parking spaces for residential and commercial uses to a ratio of 0.9 parking spaces per unit.
More recently, the Planning Commission approved an extension of design review approval for the Los
Medanos Apartments, a 30-unit 100 percent affordable multi-family residential development on a 0.49-
acre vacant lot. The Planning Commission approved the project with an approximately 50 percent
density bonus (30 units where 20 would be permitted) and a reduction in on-site laundry facilities (to
provide three washer/dryer sets where six are required), on-site private storage space (to provide 88
cubic feet of storage where 200 cubic feet is required), and a variance in off-street parking spaces to a
ratio of one parking space per unit.
Inclusionary Housing Ordinance
On November 15, 2004, the City Council adopted Ordinance No. 04-1229 adding Chapter 18.86,
Inclusionary Housing, to the Municipal Code. The Inclusionary Housing Ordinance contains minimum
requirements for provision of affordable units in developments according to the type of development
(ownership and rental). The purpose of the City’s Inclusionary Housing Ordinance is to establish
minimum requirements, incentives, and alternative measures by which to ensure the provision of safe,
decent, and affordable housing for all segments of the city’s population, regardless of household
income. Minimum affordability requirements are summarized in 0 by income group and by tenure and
development type.

Chapter 3 – Housing Opportunities and Constraints                                                                                                                3-24

The ordinance specifically requires that these affordable units be constructed on-site or that the
developer fulfill one of the alternative means of compliance described below. Additionally, the
ordinance specifies that the set-aside affordable units must be “comparable” units in type, bedroom
mix, and exterior appearance to the market-rate units and that there must be a greater number of off-
site units than those required on-site under the ordinance. They must also be constructed and have had
final inspections for occupancy prior to issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy for the related market-
rate units in any residential project that is developed in a single phase.
Incentives for On-Site Compliance
The City offers incentives for on-site compliance as outlined in Pittsburg’s Municipal Code Section
18.86.060. Incentives include:
        Allowing affordable units to be at most 10 percent smaller in square footage than market-rate units;
        Allowing ownership units to be constructed on smaller lots;
        Allowing affordable units to have fewer bathrooms and different interior design, finishes, and features
         than market-rate units in the same residential development;
        A reduction in off-street parking requirements for affordable units provided that the development is
         located downtown or within walking distance (generally half a mile) of transit facilities; and/or
        Deferment of parkland, traffic mitigation, and other building inspection fees.
In addition, to provide an incentive for the development of larger family units (four or more bedrooms),
developers are offered credit toward the inclusionary requirement of one and one-quarter per larger
family unit.
Alternative Means of Compliance
The ordinance does not permit exemptions to the affordability requirement. However, it does allow
alternative means of compliance for all or a portion of the affordable housing requirement. Alternative
means of compliance may be provided in one of four ways: (1) off-site construction; (2) fee in lieu of
construction; (3) dedication of land; or (4) purchase of off-site covenants.
Alternative means of compliance for all or a portion of the affordable housing requirement are subject
to the discretion of the City Council, which may approve the request upon finding that the requested
off-site compliance measure would provide an opportunity for public benefit not otherwise obtainable
Chapter 3 – Housing Opportunities and Constraints                                                                3-25

through on-site construction. In the event that a developer is permitted to fulfill the inclusionary
requirement through an alternative means of compliance, no building permit would be issued for the
market-rate portion of the project until the developer has constructed and received a Certificate of
Occupancy for the affordable units or received a certification from the City Manager’s Office that the
developer has made satisfactory and complete arrangements to meet the affordable housing
requirement.
In the event that the developer is permitted to pay in-lieu fees as an alternative means of compliance,
the ordinance specifically directs that in-lieu fees be expended exclusively to provide or assure
continued provision of affordable housing through acquisition, construction, development assistance,
regulation, financing, rent subsidies, and for costs of administering programs that serve those ends.
Affordability Terms/Restrictions
The Inclusionary Housing Ordinance contains affordability restrictions/requirements to ensure that the
affordable units provided remain as such. These restrictions are implemented through an Affordable
Housing Agreement that identifies the specific units designated as affordable, the affordable sales/lease
price of the units, and the provisions and stipulations of the ordinance. An Affordable Housing
Agreement is required prior to the approval of a final map (for ownership projects) or issuance of a
building or grading permit (for rental projects), and developers cannot sell or lease units for occupancy
until an agreement is reached on this documentation.
Specific affordability restrictions specified in the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance and implemented by
the Affordable Housing Agreement include:
        Deed Restrictions – The ordinance assures the affordability of the reserved units by requiring a
         minimum deed restriction of 55 years for rental and 45 years for owner housing.
        For-Sale Units – The ordinance assures the affordability of the reserved units by requiring a
         minimum 45-year deed restriction for owner housing. In the case of owner-occupied affordable units
         that are transferred during the required term, renewed restrictions shall be entered into on each change
         of ownership during the 45-year renewal term. Affordable units that are owner-occupied and for
         which the City Council has executed an equity participation agreement with the developer of the
         residential project shall not be subject to the minimum 45-year term required by this subsection. The
         maximum sales price permitted on resale of an affordable unit designated for owner-occupancy shall
         be the lower of (a) fair market value, or (b) the seller’s lawful purchase price under this chapter,

         restrictions shall allow the City a right of first refusal to purchase any affordable owner-occupancy
         unit at the maximum price that could be charged to a purchaser household at any time the owner
         proposes sale.
        Enforcement – The ordinance also contains provisions for the enforcement of its requirements. A
         person who violates the affordable housing restrictions, such as selling or renting an affordable unit at
         a price or rent exceeding the maximum allowed or to a household not qualified, is subject to civil
         action and any other proceeding or method permitted by law.
Conclusions
The Inclusionary Housing Ordinance provides incentives to balance the development of affordable
housing requirements with market-rate housing development and contains an incentive for developers
to create larger family-sized units (four or more bedrooms) by offering credits toward the overall
inclusionary requirement.
However, the 2009 California appellate court decision in Palmer/Sixth Street Properties v. City of Los
Angeles found that inclusionary requirements to establish maximum rents (to ensure affordability to
lower-income households) or require developers of rental housing to pay a fee in lieu of imposing rent
restrictions may be in violation of the Costa-Hawkins Act, which disallows rent control on newly
constructed units. Because of the court’s decision and a potential conflict with state law, the City of
Pittsburg has not imposed an inclusionary housing requirement on new multi-family rental housing.
Proposed Program P-2.4 (G)is included in this Housing Element planning period to consider how to
revise the existing inclusionary housing requirements to be consistent with the Costa-Hawkins Act and
related court decisions.
In addition to potential legal violations for rental requirements, market constraints can make application
of inclusionary requirements on for-sale housing difficult to enforce. The Inclusionary Housing
Ordinance’s provision that allows persons to sell their unit at market rate if the price is lower than the
affordable home price makes it difficult to sell inclusionary units in the current market and under the
more stringent mortgage requirements. There is not an incentive to buy an inclusionary unit with resale
restrictions if it is possible to buy a market-rate unit without resale restrictions at a comparable price.
The City will re-evaluate this provision during the planning period to ensure the ongoing feasibility and
appropriateness of its inclusionary provisions in accordance with Housing Element Program P-4.2 (C).

LOCAL DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
As is common in many cities, Pittsburg requires developers to obtain a series of approvals, or
entitlements, before constructing any new development in the city, in order to ensure that new
development is consistent with the City standards of design, health, and safety. The length of
the entitlement process can vary greatly depending on the environmental analysis required for
the project (see discussion of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) in Section 3.3)
and requires payment of planning permit and Engineering and Building plan check and permit
fees. An analysis of the development approval process and fees indicates that the City of
Pittsburg is not overly restrictive in its requirements for development approval, the processing
time required for development, or its fee structure. The entitlement and development process
for Pittsburg is expeditious and comparable to surrounding communities. The City places an
emphasis on customer service and providing developers with assistance early in the
development process. Tools such as online display of development standards on the City’s
website and free pre-application project review by all City departments (separate from the
formal Preliminary Plan Review application) assists developers in ensuring that application
submittals are nearly complete and in compliance with the Municipal Code on initial application
for a development permit. The pre-application review process also provides developers with a
sense of potential conditions of approval for a project, such as installation of infrastructure and
frontage improvements, design review conditions, or other potential issues, prior to the
application submittal.
Applicable submittal requirements for all application types are outlined in the Municipal Code
and in the Planning Department “Submittal Checklist” handout. All applications, submittal
requirements, and fee information are available at the Permit Counter in City Hall and can also
be downloaded from the City’s website. The process is further streamlined by the practice of
asking the Planning Commission to review all applications for a development project in one
meeting (for example, an application for rezoning is typically taken to the Commission along
with subdivision, design review, and other entitlements). The Planning Commission meets twice
each month, and projects subject to a CEQA categorical or statutory exemption are usually acted
on within six to eight weeks of submittal of a complete application. The City is able to expedite
the planning review process for housing projects because the Planning Commission has both
quasi-judicial land use and design review approving authority.
Chapter 3 – Housing Opportunities and Constraints                                                   3-28

Design Guidelines
All residential, commercial, and industrial development in Pittsburg is subject to the
Development Review Design Guidelines adopted by the Planning Commission on May 14, 1996
(Planning Commission Resolution No. 8927) with updated Green Building Development Review
Design Guidelines adopted by the Planning Commission on November 9, 2010 (Planning
Commission Resolution No. 9864). The Design Guidelines are provided to developers early in the
planning application process to give them as much guidance as possible. The City realizes that
minimal or unclear verbal direction costs time and money to the applicant. The City believes
that conveying development standards and guidelines early in the process avoids such pitfalls.
The City’s Design Guidelines are not excessive and have not been identified as a cost burden by
either private homebuilders or local nonprofit homebuilders in the production of affordable
housing since they were adopted in 1996 and updated in 2010. It is essential to note that the
Design Guidelines are guidelines, not standards for development; therefore, many
developments meet some but not all of the Development Review Design Guidelines and may
still obtain design review approval. Although the Design Guidelines could not in any way be
construed as overly burdensome or requiring a burdensome level of architectural detail or
design, the Planning Commission will typically approve projects if they substantially, but not
wholly, meet the Design Guidelines.
All applications for development and redevelopment are evaluated according to the Design
Guidelines as part of the design review process that is conducted either by staff (see discussion
about delegated design review below) or as evaluated by the Planning Commission. Guidelines
pertaining to residential units include:
        Use of high quality building materials.
        All architectural detailing and materials to be carried around to all sides of a structure (360
         degree architecture).
        Variation in scale/massing to break up massive structures, including varying setbacks along
         streets to provide complexity to the building frontages.
        Use of masonry walls along arterial streets to provide noise and visual buffers to residential
         development.
        Appropriate locations for landscaping.
Chapter 3 – Housing Opportunities and Constraints                                                        3-29

The recently updated Green Building Development Review Design Guidelines introduce
sustainable design attributes to the neighborhood and building design process. Guidelines
pertaining to sustainable residential development include:
       Provision of solar panels or “solar-ready” roofs and design parameters related to building
        orientation to maximize alternative energy systems and green roofs.
       Landscaping and housing designs to maximize passive heating and cooling such as inclusion
        of cool roofs, expanded overhangs, and water conservation technologies.
       Neighborhood and subdivision design guidelines related to lot layout, landscaping, common
        open spaces, bicycle and pedestrian connectivity, and provision of easily accessible bicycle
        storage.
Guidelines pertaining to multi-family complexes include all of the above in addition to screening
of all mechanical equipment, design of carports to match pitch and roof material as the main
structures on the site, provision of a covered area near unit entries, design and location of
parking lots so that they are not the major focus from the street, and high quality material and
design standards for trash enclosures. Green Building Development Review Design Guidelines
pertaining to multi-family development include promotion of alternative energy systems such as
solar panels, solar hot water systems, and small wind turbines; provision of common open
spaces on green roofs; parking lot design to minimize impervious spaces; provision of electric
vehicle charging stations; and convenient, secure bicycle storage options.
Typical Entitlement Process for Single-Family Residential Development
Developers seeking approval of a new for-sale single-family development consistent with
applicable General Plan and Municipal Code requirements need only file tentative map (if
applicable) and design review applications. Smaller projects (four or fewer units) typically take
two to 15 months to process depending on the complexity of the parcel map and the level of
environmental analysis required for the project. Residential projects of five or more units
require additional time, due to the processing of a major subdivision map if required. These
applications typically take six to 24 months to process and typically include concurrent design
review of the project. It is essential to note, however, that a parcel map or subdivision map is
Chapter 3 – Housing Opportunities and Constraints                                                    3-30

only required if the development is being sold to the occupant such as for-sale single-family
residential and multi-family residential development sold as condominiums.
For projects involving multiple entitlements (i.e., subdivision, design review, use permit,
variance, or other entitlement) and environmental review mandated by CEQA, all entitlements
and environmental analysis are processed concurrently.
Typical Entitlement Process for Multi-Family Residential Development
Developers seeking approval of multi-family rental developments consistent with applicable
General Plan and zoning requirements need only file a design review application that could take
between two to six months to process depending on the level of environmental review required
for the project and whether the applicant is seeking multiple entitlements for the project (i.e., a
use permit or variance). With regard to environmental review, whenever possible, planning staff
seeks to exempt affordable housing developments constructed on sites of less than 5 acres in
size where the project will not result in an environmental impact from CEQA under CEQA
Guidelines Section 15332, Infill Development Projects.
Several entitlements granted during the 2007–2014 Housing Element planning period illustrate
the fact that timing for design review entitlement has not been impacted with regard to a
request for a density bonus in accordance with state law. Specifically, three multi-family
residential development projects (Los Medanos Family Apartments on Frontage Road, Siena
Court Senior Apartments, and Los Medanos Apartments on Ninth and Los Medanos) whose
developers requested density bonuses in addition to incentives/concessions (including but not
limited to reductions in parking, increased height allowance, reduced setbacks, and reduced
private storage space per unit) took approximately two months, four months, and six months to
process, respectively.
Use Permit Process
“Use” is defined as the purpose for which a site or structure is arranged, designed, intended,
constructed, erected, moved, altered, enlarged, or for which either a site or a structure is or
may be occupied or maintained. The Pittsburg Municipal Code contains land use regulations for
each district in the city. In the use schedule, “P” means permitted, “L” designates use
classifications subject to certain limitations prescribed under a separate section titled
Chapter 3 – Housing Opportunities and Constraints                                                   3-31

“Additional use regulations,” and “U” designates use classifications permitted with approval of a
use permit.
A use permit is typically processed in 6–12 weeks depending on the completeness of the
application. Applications for a use permit are made to the Planning Department, along with a
fee of $800 (for uses proposed to occupy an existing building and/or non-sensitive use) or
$2,500 (for uses proposed to occupy new buildings and/or sensitive uses typically defined as a
use permit for alcohol-related uses, live entertainment, and/or adult businesses). In addition to
the application and fee, the applicant must submit a written description of the business, a site
plan, a floor plan, and postage for public hearing notices for all owners of property within 300
feet of the proposed use.
Granting of a use permit is a discretionary decision by the Planning Commission, which must
make specific findings that the use will not be detrimental to the city or surrounding
neighborhood and is consistent with the zoning and General Plan and will not create a nuisance
or enforcement problem, among other findings (Municipal Code Section 18.16.040). The
Commission may impose reasonable conditions (Conditions of Approval) to the granting of a use
permit as it considers necessary to (1) carry out the purpose and intent of the Municipal Code
and the land use district in which the property is located; (2) comply with the General Plan;
(3) protect the public health, safety, and general welfare; and (4) ensure that the operation of
the use is compatible with existing and potential uses on properties in the surrounding area
(Municipal Code Section 18.20.030).
Post-Planning Entitlement Procedures
Plan check review of construction level site development documents submitted to the
Engineering Department after tentative map and/or design review approval may take up to four
months and require review of grading and improvement plans, soils reports, hydrology
calculations, compliance check with conditions of project approvals, and approval of final maps,
when applicable. Plan check review of building permits by the Building Division may take 45 days
and entails review for compliance with conditions of approval and adopted building codes.
Permits for large single-family subdivisions may take one to three weeks longer due to
additional review and approval of individual plot plans for compliance with the building code,
Planning conditions of approval required by the approval, and mitigation measures identified in
the CEQA documentation.

Delegated Design Review
On August 26, 2003, the Planning Commission adopted Resolution No. 9444, which was
subsequently amended on September 25, 2012, with the adoption of Resolution No. 9918,
delegating design review authority of small, noncontroversial projects to the Zoning
Administrator in an effort to expedite the review process without compromising the
development review process. Amendments added clarification on procedures related to calling
projects up for Planning Commission review and on the types of wireless telecommunications
projects subject to administrative review. Projects subject to delegated design review include:
   Freestanding signs                                Building additions smaller than 2,500
                                                       square feet
   Wireless telecommunication antennas
                                                      Change in building color
   Minor storefront remodel
                                                      Addition of a new model in an approved
   Minor alterations to existing parking lots and
                                                       subdivision
    landscaping
                                                      Ancillary structures
Processing an administrative design review application requires that staff submit a written
Notice of Intent to Exercise Delegated Design Review Authority to the Planning Commission at
the first Commission meeting after receipt of the application; the notice includes a short
description of the project. If the Commission does not call the item up for full Commission
review, the Zoning Administrator may approve or conditionally approve the project. This
expedited design review process generally takes only 30–45 days from application submittal. To
date, one housing developer has taken advantage of this expedited design review process to
add a new home model. In addition, several apartment complexes have filed applications to
change building colors and develop minor additions to existing structures under the delegated
design review process.
Given administrative remedies, development roadblocks in Pittsburg are minimal and
developers are provided a streamlined and efficient process to obtaining development permits.

Building Codes and Requirements
Building codes are essential to ensure safe housing, though excessive standards can constrain
the development of housing. The City’s building code also requires new residential construction
to comply with the federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which regulates accessibility
for disabled persons. Although these standards and the time required for inspections increase
housing rehabilitation or production costs, the intent of the codes is to provide structurally
sound, safe, and energy-efficient housing and to address the housing needs of all residents in
the community.
All development in Pittsburg is required to adhere to building construction standards that
conform to the California Building Code (Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations). The City
of Pittsburg enforces building codes and regulations through its development review process.
The City reviews local ordinances and regulations on an ongoing basis to evaluate whether
changes are necessary or desirable and consistent with changing state law. As a standard
practice, the City does not impose additional local requirements to the California Building Code
standards; however, the City added proposed Programs P-2.6 (A through D)in this Housing
Element planning period to provide incentives to exceed minimum energy efficiency standards
set forth in Title 24; work with public and private financing entities to develop a grant or long-
term loan program to fund solar panels on single-family and multi-family residential
developments; and, to expand green building design principles.
Code Enforcement
Code enforcement activities in Pittsburg are complaint driven and are not targeted toward
specific income groups or neighborhoods. Complaints received are distributed to the Code
Enforcement Officer responsible for the city “quadrant” in which the complaint was generated.
Code enforcement is handled by the Pittsburg Police Department with assistance from the
Planning Department and Building Division.
On February 21, 2006, the City Council adopted Ordinance No. 06-1259 establishing a
Residential Rental Inspection Program. The program requires identification and registration of
all rental properties in the city (approximately 10,000 properties), physical inspection of
properties, and, if needed, issuance of correction notices and citations in order to gain
compliance with the standards set forth in the California Building Code and the Pittsburg
Municipal Code. Currently, approximately 5,400 properties are enrolled in the program.
Chapter 3 – Housing Opportunities and Constraints                                                  3-34

Housing for Persons with Disabilities
As noted in Chapter 2, Housing Needs Assessment, persons with disabilities have a number of
housing needs related to accessibility of dwelling units including access to transportation,
employment, and commercial services, and alternative living arrangements that include on-site
or nearby supportive services. To ensure this population’s needs are being met, the City requires
that all new and rehabilitated housing developments comply with California building standards
(Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations) and federal requirements for accessibility.
Procedures for Ensuring Reasonable Accommodations
The City actively promotes the development of housing that meets the needs of persons with
disabilities. The City provides reasonable accommodations to persons requesting modifications
to the homes for accessibility improvements. A Reasonable Accommodations Ordinance was
adopted by the City in February 2015 (City Council Ordinance No. 15-1389. The purpose of the
ordinance is to allow flexibility from a zoning law or other land use regulation, policy, or practice
if it acts as a barrier to fair housing opportunities. The ordinance provides definitions,
applicability, application requirements, a review procedure, and findings for reasonable
accommodation requests. The ordinance will require that the Zoning Administrator make a
decision on the request within 30 days of the application is deemed complete.
In addition to the Reasonable Accommodations Ordinance described above, the City of Pittsburg
Planning and Engineering Departments and Building Division review all proposed site plans, as
well as areas surrounding proposed developments including but not limited to rights-of-way,
curb cuts, sidewalks, and landscaping, to ensure the proposed areas are compliant with Title 24,
Housing Accessibility Regulations.
Efforts to Remove Regulatory Constraints for Persons with Disabilities
The City currently imposes a minimum distance of 300 feet between residential care facilities for
six or fewer persons, which is consistent with Health and Safety Code Section 1520.5. As noted
above, state law is not consistent on this point; however, the City plans to continue to enforce
the 300-foot limit between residential care facilities in order to avoid over-concentration of
facilities in one geographical area or neighborhood and to support integration of these facilities
into neighborhoods.
Chapter 3 – Housing Opportunities and Constraints                                                     3-35

As described in Special Housing Types, the City’s Zoning Ordinance provides for the
development of group care facilities for persons with disabilities. Specifically, residential care
facilities serving six or fewer persons are permitted by right in all residential zones, provided
they are located 300 feet from the nearest adjacent residential care facility (Health and Safety
Code Section 1520.5). Group care facilities for more than six persons are defined as protective
residential care facilities and are conditionally permitted in the RM, RH, CO and CN
(Neighborhood Commercial) District. An analysis of recent approvals for protective residential
care facilities serving more than seven people shows that the City is not overly burdensome or
restrictive. In 2007, a use permit was approved for Alamo Way Elderly Care Center to allow a
nonmedical care facility of up to 10 elderly people in a single family home. In 2006, the City
approved a use permit for the East County Women’s Program to allow a nonmedical residential
facility for up to 15 women recovering from drug and alcohol abuse (with three detoxification
beds) adjacent to a transitional housing facility for up to eight women who would graduate from
the program in a Medium Density Residential District. In March 2010, the Planning Commission
adopted Resolution No. 9835 to expand the East County Women’s Program use permit from a
total of 15 beds to 35 beds. Specific conditions applied to these facilities included a requirement
that facilities be renovated to comply with building and fire codes to accommodate group
facilities (if necessary), on-site management and supervision, prohibition against loitering
outside of the establishment, adequate parking facilities for staff, and elimination of any
exterior evidence of the operation of the facility (to preserve the residential nature of the
surrounding neighborhood).
The City Council adopted Ordinance No. 07-1284 on May 21, 2007, amending the Zoning
Ordinance to require that all dwelling units designated for occupancy by senior citizens be
handicapped accessible. During the 2007–2014 Housing Element planning period, the Housing
Rehabilitation Loan Program provided eligible seniors and disabled property owners an
opportunity to make handicap accessibility repairs to their homes. In 2014, the City entered into
an agreement with Contra Costa County to participate in a countywide housing rehabilitation
loan program. According to the agreement, the City will provide funding to the County Housing
Authority to administer the program for Pittsburg participants.

FEES AND EXACTIONS
The City of Pittsburg collects fees and exactions from developments to cover the costs of
processing permits and providing the necessary services and infrastructure related to new
development. Planning fees are calculated based on the average cost of processing a particular
type of application.
0 provides a hypothetical comparison between planning, building, and engineering fees charged
to develop a single-family and multi-family development. The average cost to develop a multi-
family unit (approximately $43,300) is significantly less than the cost to development a single-
family unit (approximately $63,437). Based on the typical development costs as shown in Table
3-1, the fees for a single-family unit make up about 16.5 percent of the total development costs,
and for a multi-family unit fees constitute 20.2 percent of total development costs.

Site Improvements
Site improvements are an important component of new development and include water, sewer,
circulation, and other infrastructure improvements needed to make development feasible. The
City of Pittsburg requires the payment of fees for the provision of off-site extensions of water,
sewer, storm drain systems, roads, and other public infrastructure improvements or
construction.
Requiring developers to construct site improvements and/or pay fees toward other
infrastructure costs, the provision of public services, and needed utility systems increases the
cost of housing; however, it is a necessary cost of development that ensures residential
development is properly served with services and facilities. The cost of constructing frontage
improvements is passed on to the developer as a result of limited public resources due in part to
the passage of Proposition 13 in 1978, which significantly compromised a jurisdiction’s ability to
raise property taxes to finance infrastructure and public improvements.
The vast majority of multi-family residential developments is single-parcel, infill developments
and can take advantage of existing roadways, utilities, and other improvements that serve the
sites. This reduces the total cost to developers who are developing high-density infill projects.
The City provides incentives for these types of projects such as reductions in minimum parking
standards and credits for previous development when calculating fees for water and sewer
connections. When a project, such as a large-scale subdivision on previously undeveloped land,
is accepted, frontage improvements would include, but not be limited to:
        Construction of streets, curbs, gutters, and sidewalks.
        Installation of water, sewer, and storm drain facilities.
        On-site drainage and compliance with National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
         Requirements (Provision C.3).
        Parkland dedication requirements or fees.
        Installation of necessary utilities and dedication of utility easements.
        Landscaping improvements.
Chapter 3 – Housing Opportunities and Constraints                                                  3-39

While these improvements are necessary to ensure that new housing meets the local
jurisdiction’s development goals, the cost of these requirements represents a significant share
of the cost of producing housing on previously undeveloped land.
In addition to the site-specific improvements identified above, developers of multi-family
residential developments must also pay Facility Reserve Charges (monthly payments for water,
sewer, and fire assistance) for each unit. School fees are also calculated at the time of building
permit issuance and are based on the total square footage of residential development. See
Table 3-7 above for the estimated costs of these fees for a single-parcel, multi-family
development and a multi-parcel subdivision.
Local and Regional Transportation Fees
All builders of new residential developments must pay regional and local traffic mitigation fees
set by the County and the City in order to mitigate traffic impacts due to residential growth. The
local traffic mitigation fee (LTMF) is collected at the time of building permit issuance and is
adjusted annually to the Construction Cost Index (CCI). Further, the local fee may be increased
at the City Council’s discretion based on revised cost estimates for roadway and transit facilities
and other factors that demonstrate an increase is needed to offset traffic impacts caused by
new development. In 2014, local transportation mitigation fees were $7,709 for single-family
development, $4,699 for multi-family development, $3,086 for retirement community
development, and $1.49 per square foot of commercial/industrial development. The fee
amounts were determined through a study prepared by Fehr & Peers Transportation
Consultants and dated December 2007.
The City of Pittsburg also participates in a regional transportation impact fee program. Pittsburg
is one of five jurisdictions (including Antioch, Oakley, Brentwood, and Contra Costa County) in
the East Contra Costa Regional Fee and Financing Authority (ECCRFFA), a joint powers authority
established in 1994 with the jurisdiction to collect traffic mitigation fees. The purpose of the
regional transportation impact fee program is to support an overall regional transportation
system in the East County area that serves expected future travel demand. The fee amounts
were set by the East Contra Costa Regional Fee Program Update (2005) prepared by Fehr &
Peers Transportation Consultants. The nexus study contains a list of capital improvements
projects, cost estimates to construct those projects, and projections of future land development
in the East County area based on regional population projections and the regional travel
demand model to arrive at the fee. The study also accounted for additional local, regional, state,
Chapter 3 – Housing Opportunities and Constraints                                                   3-40

and federal funding sources to reduce the full fee established in the nexus study. Using this
analysis, ECCRFFA established a subsidized fee for single-family, multi-family, commercial, office,
and industrial development. The fee amounts were differentiated for development types
because they produce different traffic generation rates (i.e., market-rate single-family
residential generates different trip rates than affordable multi-family residential or commercial
development).
In 2010, the City of Pittsburg withdrew from ECCRFFA and established the Pittsburg Regional
Transportation Development Impact Mitigation (PRTDIM) Program with a set of fees based on
specific projects located in Pittsburg that serve a regional purpose (i.e., eBART extension and the
James Donlon Roadway Extension). The PRTDIM fee amounts were developed through an
update in September 2010 of the East Contra Costa Regional Fee Program Update, dated June
16, 2005, prepared by Fehr & Peers Transportation Consultants. At that time, the PRTDIM fee
for residential development was $15,795 per single-family residential unit and $9,700.50 per
multi-family residential unit, which was lower than ECCRFFA’s rates at $17,795 per single-family
unit and $10,924 per multi-family unit. In June 2010, the City of Pittsburg entered into a
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with local developers regarding Pittsburg’s regional
traffic fee which set those fees. In August 2013, the City of Pittsburg re-joined ECCRFFA with the
adoption of a Third Amendment to the Joint Exercise of Powers Agreement. In 2014, Pittsburg’s
regional transportation fees (except those subject to the 2010 MOU) came into alignment with
ECCRFFA’s, which were set at $12,374 per single-family unit and $7,596 per multi-family unit (a
full 88 percent subsidy from the full fee as determined in the nexus study). Like the local fee, the
regional traffic fee is collected at issuance of building permits and the fees are adjusted annually
to the current CCI.
The local and regional fee nexus studies base the fees on a list of projects necessary to
accommodate future traffic demand. As noted above, fees are differentiated into different
categories broadly defined as single-family residential, multi-family residential, retirement
community, commercial, office, and industrial (as well as “other,” which is based on peak-hour
trip as determined). Other types of residential development such as accessory dwelling units,
mixed use (combined commercial and residential), and transit-oriented development (which
may discourage driving automobiles through reduced parking and other policies) were not
specifically accounted for in the nexus studies that determined the fees. Thus the local and
regional nexus studies may warrant an update to account for these types of development and to
set fees for different types of development at different rates.
Chapter 3 – Housing Opportunities and Constraints                                                    3-41

Community Facilities Districts and Other Monthly and Annual Fees
There are two Community Facilities Districts (CFDs) and a citywide Lighting and Landscape
District (LLD) in Pittsburg. CFD and LLD fees are paid on an annual basis as follows:
        CFD (Police Services) – $529.40 per unit per year.
        CFD (Park Maintenance) – $54.55 per unit per year.
        Citywide LLD (Landscaping Maintenance) – $102.18 per single-family residential unit per
         year. For multi-family developments, the calculation is $102.18 multiplied by a residential
         benefit factor established by the City. For example, for a 20-unit multi-family residential
         development, the residential benefit factor is 13.80 x $102.18 equaling $1,410.08 per year.
In addition to these fees, there are other geographically specific Mello Roos and other CFD fees,
depending on the area of the potential development. For example, in June 2014, the City
adopted a one-time development fee due at issuance of building permits for certain properties
in the Railroad Avenue Specific Plan area. The fees are tiered so properties closest to the future
station would pay more than those located farther away. Specifically, properties within one-
quarter mile of the future station would pay $2,000 per residential unit and $1.50 per square
foot of commercial development, while properties outside the half-mile radius would pay $660
per residential unit and $0.49 per square foot of commercial space. The funds would be used to
construct the future eBART station and streetscape improvements envisioned in the Specific
Plan. These fees, while minimal, could be seen as an added cost for residential development;
however, CFDs and citywide districts are seen as a way for the City, which operates on limited
revenues, to provide additional, ongoing police coverage and park maintenance services whose
costs rise every year.

STATE AND COUNTY REQUIREMENTS
Certain steps in the development process are mandated by the State rather than local law and
may result in additional time and costs to developers. Accordingly, these costs are eventually
passed on to the consumer. While builders often argue that local government delays and red
tape factor into the high cost of housing, they may be unaware that these requirements are
often outside of local control. Potential State-mandated development review requirements
include but are not limited to:
        Enforcement of California Building Code including Title 24 Building and Energy Efficiency
         Standards.
        Amendment of the General Plan and/or Zoning Ordinance to ensure consistency between
         permitted land uses and the proposed project.
        Filing and review of tentative parcel, tract, and final maps consistent with the requirements of
         the Subdivision Map Act. The act requires local jurisdictions to process completed
         applications for tentative maps within 50 days.
        Compliance with the California Environment Quality Act (CEQA). To fulfill required
         environmental analysis, the City must make a determination as to whether a project can be
         cleared with a Categorical or Statutory Exemption, or require additional environmental
         analysis through the preparation of an initial study and negative/mitigated negative
         declaration or environmental impact report (EIR). Each level of CEQA analysis contains
         minimum public review periods (ranging from 0 days for an exemption to over 45 days for an
         EIR) and minimum posting requirements.
        Adherence to Regional Water Quality Control Board and California Department of Fish and
         Wildlife regulations/opinions as they pertain to grading, drainage, and wildlife habitat.
        Implementation of regulations under the federal Clean Water Act and National Pollutant
         Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Program.
Local governments are required by law (Assembly Bill 844) to complete the processing of most
discretionary actions six months from the date the application is deemed complete and within
one year if an EIR is required. In some instances, the City allows parallel tracking of Engineering
Department and Building Division permit review of projects during the Planning Department
entitlement process. Developers may submit plans to the Engineering Department and Building
Chapter 3 – Housing Opportunities and Constraints                                                         3-43

Division for plan check prior to a Planning Commission decision subject to the discretion of the
City Engineer. These concurrent applications are considered “at risk,” and developers are not
provided refunds in plan check fees if the project is not approved as proposed. Therefore, the
practice is only recommended for projects that are noncontroversial and small in scale.
Growth Control Ordinance/Contra Costa County Measure C and Measure J
As part of the County’s Measure C Transportation Improvement and Growth Management
Expenditure Program, adopted in 1988, the City was required to incorporate a Growth
Management Element into its General Plan. In 2004, County voters approved a 25-year
extension to Measure C, known as the Contra Costa County Transportation Sales Tax
Expenditure Plan (Measure J). The Growth Management Element includes traffic level of service
standards, programs for routes of regional significance, performance standards for public
facilities, and a five-year Capital Improvement Program.
The intent of the Growth Management Element is to ensure balance between new urban
development and public facilities. Fees collected by the City are used for local street
maintenance and improvements (see Local and Regional Transportation Fees discussion above).
The Growth Management Element is not considered a constraint to housing development but
ensures that new development can be accommodated by the public facilities systems. Further, it
facilitates regional interaction and cooperation in identification and funding of improvements
and development.
CONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS
The following text summarizes the conclusions and recommendations from Section 0,
Governmental Opportunities and Constraints.
With regard to flexibility for parking requirements, the Planning Commission currently has the
authority to reduce parking requirements on residential projects near transit facilities, in the
downtown area, and for infill residential developments. Further, parking for senior units is
determined as part of the design review process.
One possible change to ensure that the City’s limited supply of RM and RH zoned land both
within the downtown area and throughout the city is efficiently used would be to codify the
minimum density standards (in addition to the maximum standards) set forth in the General
Plan. Such provisions would effectively prohibit the development of low-density single-family
Chapter 3 – Housing Opportunities and Constraints                                                3-44

detached homes on vacant multi-family sites so as to preserve these sites for higher-density
housing. However, this would eliminate the flexibility built into the development process for
owners of property.
Pursuant to Senate Bill (SB) 2, in the last Housing Element cycle, the City adopted a new use
classification for supportive housing as defined in California Health and Safety Code Section
50675.14(b). Supportive housing is permitted in multi-family districts and subject to the same
limitations as multi-family housing in commercial zoning districts. The City adopted Ordinance
No. 09-1322 in December 2009 to include a definition of supportive housing and eliminate the
minimum 1,000-foot distance requirements from transitional housing to a school, liquor store,
tavern, or other transitional housing establishment. However, regulations governing supportive
and transitional housing were refined with the adoption of Assembly Bill (AB) 745, which took
effect in January 2014. AB 745 provides new definitions for supportive housing, transitional
housing, and target population. Further, the regulations removed cross-references limiting
those uses to multi-family districts in order to allow the uses in all residential districts, subject
only to the regulations that apply to the same use type in the same zone. Housing Element
Program P-2.4 (G) would address those changes in the next housing element cycle.
Multi-family residential development, including SROs for extremely low-income households, is
permitted in all commercial districts, provided it is located above or adjacent to ground-floor
commercial uses, subject to design review approval. As an incentive for such development, the
Municipal Code allows projects with multi-family residential uses above or adjacent to
commercial uses on the same site with an increase of up to 0.25 FAR over that permitted in the
applicable base district, provided the residential floor area comprises no less than 25 percent
and no more than 75 percent of the total square footage of the building developed on the site
(Municipal Code Section 18.52.010).
The City’s Planned Development District zoning and density bonus standards provide flexibility
to developers to develop various housing types in various districts. In addition, the density
bonus law is consistent with state law. Both of these City policies provide methods for making a
variety of residential types, including SROs which are subject to the same regulations as multi-
family residential development, feasible in the city. In addition, the City’s current and proposed
Housing Elements contain provisions to support flexible development standards and additional
density bonuses over and above those afforded by the PD District zoning designation and state
Density Bonus Law (Housing Element Policies P-2.1 (C through H)).

ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
CEQA (CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT) REGULATIONS
All discretionary projects acted on by a public agency are required to be analyzed under CEQA
prior to project approval. CEQA regulations are intended to identify and mitigate all potentially
significant environmental impacts associated with a development project. In many cases, infill
development may fall under a Statutory or Categorical Exemption, which streamlines the CEQA
review process for certain types of projects. The State provides that residential infill projects on
sites 5 acres and smaller that comply with both the City’s General Plan and zoning regulations
can generally be exempted from CEQA under a Class 32 exemption. This streamlined review
recognizes that infill developments generally have few if any environmental impacts. A project
cannot be categorically exempt if it can be seen with reasonable certainty that it may cause a
significant environmental impact, even if it meets all the other criteria of a given categorical
exemption.
Not all developments fall into a categorical exemption. Depending on the complexity of the
project and the potential impacts, an initial study may be prepared by City staff or an outside
consultant at the applicant’s expense. In addition, the applicant would be required to finance
required studies to determine impacts on the environment that could potentially include a
traffic study, noise study, air quality study, biological resources analysis, geotechnical report,
and potentially Phase I or Phase II Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) reports depending on
the potential for the presence of hazardous materials on the site.
The initial study is completed to determine if there will be environmental impacts and includes
mitigation measures to reduce or eliminate those impacts to a level of less than significant. If no
significant impacts are identified, a negative declaration is prepared. If impacts and mitigation
measures are identified that will mitigate the impacts to a level of less than significant, a
mitigated negative declaration is prepared. If the initial study concludes that there are potential
negative impacts that must be further analyzed, an environmental impact report (EIR) is
prepared. An EIR includes alternatives to the project in order to determine the relative costs and
benefits of the project as they relate to the environment.

Each of these processes has specific public comment periods and notification requirements
ranging from 0 days for an exemption to over 45 days for an EIR. Preparation and adoption of an
EIR can take a year or longer. The cost of multiple environmental studies and an EIR for a large-
scale project could likely exceed $100,000.
EAST CONTRA COSTA HABITAT CONSERVATION PLAN (HCP)
The purpose of the East Contra Costa County HCP is to protect and enhance ecological diversity
and function within the rapidly urbanizing region of eastern Contra Costa County. To that end,
the HCP describes how to avoid, minimize, and mitigate, to the maximum extent practicable,
impacts on protected species and their habitats and wetlands while allowing for the growth of
selected regions of the county and the cities of Pittsburg, Clayton, Oakley, and Brentwood. The
city falls entirely within the East Contra Costa County HCP Inventory Area. While the majority of
the residentially and commercially zoned properties are identified and mapped entirely of
developed land cover types (urban, turf or aqueduct), some sites within the HCP Inventory Area
are identified as containing natural land cover types (including, but not limited to ruderal,
grassland, wetland, oak savanna, oak woodland, non-native woodland, and aquatic) and are
therefore subject to the requirements of Pittsburg Municipal Code Section 15.108. For project
sites larger than 1 acre and identified as containing natural land cover types, the project
applicant shall comply with all HCP requirements which include the submittal of an HCP
application and payment of all applicable HCP fees prior to the issuance of a grading or building
permit.

CHAPTER 4 HOUSING RESOURCES
This Chapter analyzes the physical, administrative, and financial resources available for the
development, rehabilitation, and preservation of housing in Pittsburg. Land Inventory presents
the availability of residential land (vacant and underdeveloped) in the city, as well as the City’s
progress to date with units built, in progress, or approved in meeting its share of the Regional
Housing Need Allocation (RHNA) for new housing production from 2014 to 2022. Affordable
Housing Policies and Requirements sections present City policies and requirements to assist and
encourage the development of affordable housing for lower-income households. A section on
Administrative Resources and Financial Resources below discuss the financial and administrative
resources available to support housing activities, programs, and construction and to assist in
implementing the Housing Plan discussed in Chapter 5 of this Element. The final section,
Opportunities for Energy Conservation, describes how the City incorporates energy conservation
techniques into all housing construction.
These sections of the Housing Element address the requirements of Government Code Sections
65583 and 65583.2, requiring a parcel-specific inventory of appropriately zoned, available, and
suitable sites that provide realistic opportunities for the provision of housing to all income
segments within the community.
APPROVED HOUSING IN THE CITY OF PITTSBURG, 2014
Table-4-1 details the number of housing units that have been approved for development and
are planned for construction during this RHNA planning period. This housing will be available for
occupancy during this RHNA period and thus will contribute to the City’s ability to address the
2014–2022 RHNA. After accounting for approved housing units, Pittsburg has a remaining
housing need of 196 extremely low-, 196 very low-, 131 low-, 244 moderate and 136 above
moderate-income units. This Housing Element contains a diverse set of policies and actions that
are intended to facilitate the construction, preservation, and rehabilitation of housing to meet
the community’s remaining housing needs for all income levels.

As shown in Table 4-2, five approved housing developments will provide a total of 1,122
residential units. The Alves Ranch and Sky Ranch developments will include a mix of affordable
and market-rate housing. Los Medanos Apartments development is an affordable project that
will offer 30 units affordable to low-income households.

LAND INVENTORY
The City’s evaluation of adequate sites contains a list of sites by zone and General Plan
designation. The site suitability analysis demonstrates that these sites are currently available
and unconstrained in order to provide realistic development opportunities prior to October 31,
2022 (the end of the RHNA period). To demonstrate the realistic development viability of the
sites, the analysis also discusses (1) whether appropriate zoning is in place, (2) the applicable
development standards and their impact on projected development capacity and affordability,
(3) existing constraints including any known environmental issues, and (4) the availability of
existing and planned public service capacity levels.
The City’s land inventory was developed with the use of a combination of resources including
the City’s GIS database, updated Assessor’s data, projects in the pipeline, and pending
applications, as well as review of the City’s Land Use Element and Zoning Ordinance. Several
sites are also located in designated Priority Development Areas (PDA) that have been specifically
identified by the City and regional planning agencies Metropolitan Transportation Commission
(MTC) and Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) for development
densification/intensification through the MTC/ABAG FOCUS planning process. There are three
PDAs in the City of Pittsburg: the Railroad Avenue Specific Plan area, the Pittsburg/Bay Point
Master Plan area, and Downtown Pittsburg Plan. The inventory also includes an estimate of
potential development capacity for these sites based on mid-range development scenarios that
are consistent with the City of Pittsburg 2020 General Plan Environmental Impact Report (EIR)
and historic development patterns in the city. This, in addition to any other site constraints
and/or limitations, is identified as the “realistic capacity” of the subject site.
The tables and figure in this chapter illustrates sites appropriate for housing development for
the 2014–2022 RHNA period. These sites represent vacant or underutilized residentially
designated land available for new development and selected public/institutional designated
land where residential development is permitted “by right,” if determined to be surplus
property not needed for further public use. Tables 4-3 and 4-4 list vacant and underutilized sites
that are zoned for residential development. These tables are intended to illustrate the wide
range of sites available for residential development that could be developed during this RHNA
period. Tables 4-3 and 4-4 include details such as parcel number, acreage, General Plan and
zoning classification, and the potential range of residential development density. The tables also
include a “realistic capacity” of development which is typically less than the maximum permitted
on site, and indicates availability of utilities and any potential site constraints and details (see
Chapter 4 - Housing Resources                                                                        4-4

 detailed discussion below). Between 2,901 and 8,763 housing units are projected on
 approximately 500 acres of vacant and underutilized sites within City limits. This land has a
 realistic capacity to be developed into approximately 5,000 housing units.
 Of the 25 identified sites in Tables 4-3 and 4-4 and shown on Figure 4-1, 14 are located within
 PDAs (boundaries are also shown on Figure 4-1), and are covered by existing specific and master
 plans or zoning regulations that allow higher densities and more intense land uses in close
 proximity to transit, which is supportive of Plan Bay Area, which is the regional sustainable
 community strategy. The PDA sites total approximately 110 acres, with a minimum development
 potential of about 1,740 units and a maximum development potential of about 5,260 (not
 including density bonuses), and an assumed realistic capacity of about 2,300 units based on the
 program-level EIRs developed for the respective plans.

Vacant Parcels
The land inventory includes 19 vacant sites. Each site may contain one or more parcels for a
total of approximately 435 acres of vacant land available to accommodate residential
development. According to current General Plan and zoning designations, the minimum number
of units that could be developed on the identified vacant sites is 2,127 and the maximum is
5,466. The realistic unit capacity is 3,870 units, estimated at approximately 70 percent of the
allowable capacity (maximum permitted density) on the vacant sites. Of the 19 vacant sites, six
have current applications in the entitlement process. For those sites, the realistic capacity is
based on the actual number of units proposed in the active application. A mid-range of about 50
percent of allowable capacity was assumed for the remaining vacant parcels that are not the
subject of current entitlement applications (see further discussion about realistic capacity
assumptions below). The parcels are located within Residential (R), Governmental/QuasiPublic
(GQ), and Planned Development (PD) zones.
Underutilized Parcels
The land inventory includes seven underutilized sites; each site may contain one or more parcels
for a total of approximately 64 acres of land available to accommodate a variety of residential
development. According to current zoning, the minimum number of units that could be
developed on the identified underutilized sites is 774 and the maximum is about 3,297. The
realistic unit capacity of 1,136 is approximately 34% of the allowable capacity on the
underutilized sites to allow for a conservative estimate since the sites are currently developed
with other uses or structures. The parcels are located within the GQ, CC (Community
Commercial), PD and R zones.
The City has entitled several projects that were located on sites identified as “underutilized” in
previous planning periods. For example, the previously entitled Vidrio project, is a high density
mixed-use development located in the heart of downtown Pittsburg on three contiguous infill
blocks that were previously developed with mainly vacant, low-scale commercial structures. The
blocks combined (measuring 1.98 acres, 1.61 acres, and 1.74 acres, respectively) totaled 5.33
acres. The project was approved with 38,000 square feet of ground floor commercial
development along Railroad Avenue and 195 residential units above and on the rear portions of
the blocks. Due to the economic downturn, only Block B of the Vidrio project was constructed in
accordance with the approved site plan; however, the Siena Court Senior Apartments was
recently constructed (2010) on the southernmost 1.98-acre block formerly known as Block C of
Chapter 4 - Housing Resources                                                                      4-17

the Vidrio project. The Siena Court Senior Apartments contains 111 senior-restricted units
affordable to very low- and low-income households over and adjacent to approximately 10,000
square feet of commercial development.
Underutilized site A is six acres in size and is currently designated Low Density Residential
(allowing up to seven units per acre). It is currently developed with a small commercial building
that was built in 1970 and is currently used as a landscaping business; approximately 99 percent
of the lot is vacant and undeveloped at this time.
Underutilized sites B, C, D and G are located within identified PDAs. Sites B, C and G are located
within the Railroad Avenue Specific Plan PDA and Site D is located within the Pittsburg/Bay Point
BART PDA. Potential development on these sites has already been assessed through program-
level EIRs. The realistic capacity assumptions for these sites were estimated based on the
existing specific plans and certified EIRs, which assumed a mid-range of development on the
site.
Underutilized site B is a City-owned parcel within one-quarter of the future eBART station. It is
currently occupied by a vacant commercial structure that was constructed in 1972 and a parking
lot.
Underutilized site C contains a warehouse building under single, private ownership located on a
key opportunity site within one-quarter mile of the future eBART station. The warehouse
building was constructed in the late 1940s/early 1950s as part of Camp Stoneman and it house
various contractors and low-intensity automotive uses. The property owner participated
throughout the Railroad Avenue Specific Plan planning process and is amenable to
redevelopment of the parcels once the eBART station is completed (estimated in 2017).
Underutilized site G is currently occupied by a vacant commercial structure that was built in
1974 and housed a car dealership until about 2010. Since that time, the building has been
vacant and the property is advertised for sale as a mixed-use development opportunity within
one-half mile of the future eBART station. There has been some interest in rezoning the
property for high-density residential uses; however, there is no current application on file.
Underutilized site D is currently occupied by BART-owned parking for the Pittsburg/Bay Point
BART station. BART and the City recognize that surface parking is an inefficient use of land at
this site and have entered into an Exclusive Negotiating Agreement to conduct a phased
development of the site with transit-oriented development and structured parking. This vision

for the site is articulated in the Pittsburg/Bay Point BART Master Plan, which was adopted in
2010 along with certification of a program-level EIR for the plan.
Underutilized Site F is a vacant parcel owned by the Contra Costa County Junior College District.
It is adjacent to Los Medanos College, and is constrained by a water feature and limited access.
Currently zoned GQ (Governmental/Quasipublic), the site could be developed with high density
residential uses for student and/or teacher housing.
Small Sites
The land inventory includes three sites that are one acre or less in size. To illustrate the
feasibility of these sites for residential development during this Housing Element period,
recently approved projects on less than one-acre sites include Entrata, 28 low-income units built
on a 0.62-acre site; East Street Estates, eight low-income units under construction on a 0.63-
acre site; and Cornwall/Trinity Orchards, a development of three single-family units on a 0.3-
acre site.
Large Sites
The sites inventory contains ten large sites that are over ten acres in size (vacant site nos. 7, 8,
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 19 and underutilized sites D, E and F). Of those, site nos. 7 and 8 are identified
as Low Density Residential, site nos. 10 through 14 are identified as High Density Residential,
and vacant site 19 as well as underutilized site D are identified as Mixed Use, and underutilized
sites E and F are Governmental/Quasipublic.
While these sites may not be appropriately sized to be developed as 100 percent federally and
state-subsidized affordable housing, it is appropriate to identify these sites as eligible for
residential development during the Housing Element planning period and to assume that a
certain amount of affordable housing will be located on them due to codified inclusionary
housing requirements, particularly for the large, single-family sites that will be developed as for-
sale housing (site nos. 7 and 8). The adopted Inclusionary Housing Ordinance (Pittsburg
Municipal Code chapter 18.86) requires developers to set aside between 15 percent and 20
percent of new residential development for very low-, low-, and/or moderate-income
households, or to enter into a Development Agreement to meet affordable housing goals. With
regard to the large sites that are zoned for High Density Residential uses which would most
likely develop into rental housing, one of the sites (Site D) is publicly owned and a portion will
Chapter 4 - Housing Resources                                                                          4-19
likely be developed as affordable housing if the City can negotiate a development agreement or
similar interest since affordable housing is in the public interest.
All of the large sites are or will be subject to Development Agreements or Exclusive Negotiating
Agreements between the City and developers. Development Agreements (described on page 4-
24) between the City and a future developer would be utilized to ensure that a certain
percentage of the development is set aside for affordable housing. Exclusive Negotiating
Agreements are typically used to define the timeline for negotiating the deal points of a
Development Agreement. See Section 4.3, Affordable Housing Policies and Requirements, for
further discussion about Development Agreements.
Large site nos. 19 (23 acres) and D (26.4 acres) are part of the Pittsburg/Bay Point Master Plan
area. These sites are identified regional PDAs, and are expected to develop as mixed-use, mixed
density transit-oriented developments in accordance with local and regional plans.
The Alves Ranch Master Plan, a recently approved project, illustrates the feasibility of a large
site to yield a rich mix of market rate and affordable housing. For example, the Development
Agreement for the Alves Ranch Master Plan (total of 47 acres), specified 560 residential units
could be developed on-site. Of those 560 units, 123 were to be set aside as affordable to very
low-, low-, and moderate- income households with 91 rental units contained within a multi-
family structure on the site, and the remaining 32 scattered throughout the development as “for
sale” housing affordable to low- and moderate-income households. The Master Plan covers a
site totaling approximately 47 acres, and was approved in 2009 with a total of 14 acres for
commercial development and 560 residential units accomplished through a variety of residential
development types including small lot single-family, townhouse-style, and multi-family
residential units.
Mixed Use and Commercial Sites
Vacant site nos. 16 (3.6 acres), 17 (2.2 acres), 18 (1.05 acres), 19 (23 acres), 20 (7.4 acres), 21
(1.9 acres), and underutilized sites B (1 acre), C (7 acres), D (26.4 acres) and G (3.9 acres) total
77.45 acres of Mixed Use zoned property that allow high density residential uses within the
Railroad Avenue Specific Plan and Pittsburg/Bay Point BART Master Plan areas. These sites can
be developed as mixed use or as exclusively commercial development.
The Railroad Avenue Specific Plan area contains a total of 1,076 acres, wherein approximately
50 acres are zoned for mixed-use development. Of those 50 acres scattered throughout the
Chapter 4 - Housing Resources                                                                        4-20

Specific Plan site, 27.05 acres were identified as potential housing sites in this Housing Element.
These sites were identified as potential housing sites in this Housing Element because they are
publicly owned and are either vacant or underutilized (i.e., used as parking lots or as old vacant
commercial structures) and are therefore more likely to develop under Development
Agreements that would specify minimum densities.
In order to account for potential development of nonresidential uses on these sites, the capacity
analysis assumes the minimum development potential on these sites (30 units per acre) rather
than the mid-range assumption (48 units per acre). Assuming the absolute minimum allowable
residential development on identified mixed use sites in the Railroad Avenue Specific Plan area,
which could potentially develop at higher densities under current development standards,
deliberately underestimates the potential development in the plan area; however, this
assumption would offset the potential for some of the acreage with mixed-use zoning in the
specific plan area to develop solely as commercial uses with no residential component. It is also
important to note that these assumptions do not account for density bonuses for affordable
housing as permitted under state law and the respective specific plan.
Sites 19 and D are part of the Pittsburg/Bay Point Master Plan, which was adopted by the City
Council in 2010. The master plan site is composed of three separate parcels that are acting as
one large site under the master plan. The assumptions for the master plan site were based on
the Program EIR assumptions as detailed in Tables 4-2 and 4-3. The entire master plan area will
be developed in phases with earlier phases developed closer to 20 to 30 units per acre and later
phases developed at up to 65 units per acre, not counting density bonuses. Phasing the
development will allow higher densities to occur once the market has been tested and can bear
more expensive construction costs.
Underutilized site G is located in the Railroad Avenue Specific Plan boundaries (it is within one-
half mile of the future eBART station); however, it is outside of the Specific Plan PD and Mixed
Use General Plan land use designation. Rather, it has a Community Commercial (CC) district
zoning and General Plan land use designation. The Pittsburg General Plan and Zoning Ordinance
allow for multi-family residential development on all commercially zoned lands, and allows for
an increased 0.25 FAR on top of the base FAR to accommodate the increased square footage for
a mixed-use development provided that the residential portion of the mixed-use development
comprises no less than 25 percent and no more than 75 percent of the developed square
footage on-site. For purposes of a realistic assumption for development on-site, it was assumed
Chapter 4 - Housing Resources                                                                       4-21
that the site would be developed with 0.75 FAR with 50 percent of the development being used
for residential purposes (with 1,000 square foot units).
SITE ASSESSMENT BY INCOME CATEGORY
Table 4-5 summarizes Pittsburg’s realistic affordable housing capacity by zoning designation and
potential household income category. The potential income category allocation assumes that
low-income units would be developed primarily as multi-family rental units in districts that allow
for higher density and mixed-use development such as the High Density Residential (RH),
Downtown High-Density Residential (RHD), GQ, and PD (small infill sites in identified Railroad
Avenue Specific Plan) districts; moderate-income units would be developed as market rate
rental units, condominiums and small lot single-family development the Downtown Medium-
Density Residential District (RM), Downtown Medium-Density Residential District (RMD), PD,
and GQ districts; and, above moderate-income units would be developed as high-end
condominiums and single-family homes on various lot sizes in the RS, PD (hillside and large
sites), and GQ districts.
In calculating affordability on low- and medium-density sites where small or large lot single-
family, for-sale residential development would occur, 15 percent of the realistically developable
units was allocated to extremely/very and low-income category (consistent with the
requirements of the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance) and the remainder was split between
moderate- and above moderate-income categories. All assumptions are based on municipal
code requirements and market research presented earlier in the report, as well as standard
housing development practice that higher-density residentially zoned properties are more likely
than lower-density sites to be developed as rental housing by nonprofit housing developers.
Despite these assumptions and the conservative estimates described above in determining the
“realistic capacity” of the sites, these assumptions do not preclude low-income housing from
being developed in low- and medium-density residential districts and the PD district (specifically
the small lot infill sites within the Railroad Avenue Specific Plan area) due to the requirements
set forth in the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance and due to State Density Bonus Law. For
example, the recently approved Siena Court Senior Apartments is located in a PD district with a
maximum of 30 dwelling units per acre. Under State Density Bonus Law, the developer was
granted a density of 56 units per acre because the project will be entirely affordable to very low-
and low-income households. Tables 4-3 and 4-4 in conjunction with the already approved
housing development shown in Table 4-2 illustrate that the City has more than an adequate
Chapter 4 - Housing Resources                                                                       4-22

amount of land appropriately zoned with existing or pending infrastructure and limited
constraints to accommodate the City’s remaining RHNA allocation (Table 4-1).

The majority of the vacant key opportunity sites are close to shopping, schools, bicycle trails,
and transit stops and were identified as suitable infill residential development. Density bonuses,
inclusionary housing requirements, HOME funds, and other public subsidies (such as tax credit
and CDBG funds) may also be needed to make units affordable to extremely low- and very low-
income households. The sites most suitable for housing affordable to very low- and low-income
households (vacant site nos. 7, 11, 13, 14, 18, 19 and underutilized sites B, D and F) are publicly
Chapter 4 - Housing Resources                                                                                                                                           4-23

owned parcels located in close proximity to BART, the planned eBART station, or a major arterial
with good bus service because proximity to transit and commercial services makes affordable
housing grant applications more competitive. It is also assumed that a certain number of
affordable housing units would be located within the other vacant and underutilized parcels that
do not have existing development agreements, in that the remainder of the vacant and
underutilized parcels would be subject to the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance (where it can be
applied or negotiated through a development agreement). Some of the sites suitable for very
low-income housing were identified in downtown and on large parcels of private land located in
close proximity to BART which, by virtue of potential development agreement(s), density
bonuses, and Housing Element policies supporting inclusionary housing, make them suitable as
sites for very low-income households.
Where there is an adequate amount of land available at appropriate densities to meet the
community’s needs for housing affordable to moderate- and low-income households, other
tools (such as inclusionary housing) and/or incentives (such as HOME funds, tax credit funding,
density bonuses, or parking reductions) may be necessary to meet the City’s RHNA for extremely
low- and very low-income households. The City has no assurance that tax credits can be
obtained during the reporting period or that development on these sites is financially feasible.
Market data for 2013 indicates that the median price of market rate single-family homes in the
city and east Contra Costa County were $260,000 and $304,000, respectively, affordable to
some low-, moderate-, and above moderate-income households (Tables 2-29 and 2-30).
Recently constructed residential projects built in the city (Bancroft Gardens, Rose Glen, Stanford
Place II, La Almenara, Siena Court Senior Apartments, and Entrata) contain units affordable to
low- and moderate-income households. It is reasonable to assume that new market rate single-
family homes and apartments built during this reporting period would fall within these same
income categories, even without public subsidy, an inclusionary housing requirement, or a
density bonus request under state law.
Realistic Capacity Assumptions
The realistic capacity for each site was calculated based on the following factors:
        Approved subdivision on the parcel(s);
        Vesting tentative map application and environmental documentation prepared for site;
        Approved entitlements for a project on the parcel(s);
Chapter 4 - Housing Resources                                                                      4-24

        DDA and Design Review application;
        Previous land use proposals for the parcel(s);
        Pittsburg/Bay Point BART Master Plan;
        Railroad Avenue Specific Plan; or
        Reflection of surrounding development.
Tables 4-2 and 4-3 provide specifics about each parcel’s utilities and existing constraints, as well
as the basis for the realistic capacity calculation assumption for each parcel. The realistic
capacity is assumed to be a mid-range density for residential development based on the General
Plan assumptions for Low, Medium and High Density Residential development (Table 1.1-2, City
of Pittsburg General Plan EIR). Mid-range was calculated between the minimum and maximum
densities permitted where a specific assumption was not included in the General Plan Draft EIR,
such as for residential development on commercial sites (underutilized site G). In the case of
Mixed Use sites where zoning regulations would allow for mixed use of exclusively commercial
development, the capacity analysis assumed the minimum development potential on the sites in
order to offset the potential that some sites within Mixed Use districts would not develop with
residential uses. Please see the discussion of Mixed Use sites under Section 4.2, Land Inventory,
above.
Table 4-6, Typical Residential Projects by Zone and General Plan Category, contains densities for
various residential projects recently approved in the city. As recent development projects
developed at a wide range of densities, a mid-range generally appears to be a sound
assumption. The City assumes that approximately half of the developers will develop at the high
range and half will develop at the low range of allowable density standards. The City’s General
Plan EIR, the Railroad Avenue Specific Plan EIR, and the Pittsburg/Bay Point BART Master Plan
EIR analyzed the mid-range of development in order to avoid over-mitigating the allowable
development permitted within the city.
While the mid-range of density is assumed to be the “realistic capacity” of each site, it is
essential to note that nothing would preclude a developer from developing at the maximum
potential development allowed for the site after accounting for required development
standards (lot coverage, setbacks, height, etc.) and parking. While development standards and
parking requirements could be considered constraints to maximum potential of development,
the State Density Bonus Law (SB 1818) and City Housing Element Policies P-1.4 (B), P-1.6 (B), and
Chapter 4 - Housing Resources                                                                        4-25

P-2.1 (F & G) support flexible development and parking standards for affordable housing
developments. In fact, those policies were used during the 2007–2014 Housing Element
planning period to allow for reduced setbacks, reduced parking, and other standards to support
development of affordable housing. For example, a recently approved 100 percent affordable
project (Siena Court Senior Apartments) was approved with an approximate 56 percent density
bonus over the maximum allowable density (111 units where 60 would be permitted), in
addition to variances from the minimum storage space per unit requirement (to provide 186
cubic feet where 200 cubic feet per unit is required), and a variance from the maximum number
of off-street parking spaces for residential and commercial uses to a ratio of 0.9 parking spaces
per unit.

Infrastructure Availability
All but three of the identified sites are located within Pittsburg city limits and have access to
appropriate services and facilities, “including sewage collection and treatment, domestic water
supply, and septic tanks and wells” (Gov. Code Section 6558.3 1.A). The three sites not located
within the Pittsburg city limits (vacant site nos. 7, 8, and 12) are the subject of current planning
applications which are in the public review of Draft EIR stage. The applications and EIRs include
annexation and development of the units detailed in Tables 4-2 and 4-3. Details of each parcel are
located in Tables 4-2 and 4-3 that contain information about whether infill sites are currently served
by utilities, including a discussion of where utilities are anticipated to be in place within this Housing
Element time frame. All the sites within this land inventory have utilities available to projects
proposed on these sites, or may be extended to the site, and would be a condition of approval for a
proposed project.
The City has prepared a Water System Master Plan (2000, with amendments in 2001, 2004, 2006,
and 2010) and a Wastewater Collection System Master Plan (April 2003), both of which incorporated
and accounted for land use and demand projections based on existing land uses, the General Plan,
and information on specific developments provided by the City’s Development Services Department.
The plans were also updated to include the future annexations areas (vacant site nos. 2, 3, and 10).
As outlined in the sections above, land currently set aside for residential development in the City’s
General Plan and Zoning Map has been analyzed in the Water and Wastewater Collection Master
Plans, and can accommodate the allocated regional housing need. The Contra Costa Local Agency
Formation Commission (LAFCO) analyzed the master plans as part of the 2007 Water and
Wastewater Municipal Services Review for east Contra Costa County and concluded that there was
sufficient capacity to accommodate anticipated population growth to 2030 (Contra Costa LAFCO:
Water and Wastewater Municipal Services Review for East Contra Costa County, Section 4.0).
Further, in accordance with SB 1087, the City adopted Resolution 06-10576 to grant priority capacity
allocation to affordable projects.
Environmental Constraints
There are no known environmental constraints on the identified sites that would prohibit
development with residential uses. Vacant site no. 15 is adjacent to the 100-year flood plain;
however, this issue could be addressed through engineering and compliance with California
State Building Code.
Chapter 4 - Housing Resources                                                                              4-28

AFFORDABLE HOUSING POLICIES AND REQUIREMENTS
The following requirements and City policies assist and encourage the development of
affordable housing for lower income households:
INCLUSIONARY HOUSING ORDINANCE
As previously discussed in the Governmental Opportunities and Constraints section of Chapter 3
the City’s Inclusionary Housing Ordinance requires new development to provide affordable
housing. The total number of units generated through the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance since
its adoption is five and consists of two very low- and three low-income housing units (Delta
Hawaii Senior Apartments). The majority of deed-restricted units set aside for very low-, low-,
and moderate-income units were guaranteed through development agreements between the
Redevelopment Agency and private or nonprofit developers.
DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS
All new residential and mixed-use development with a residential component proposed within
the city is subject to Inclusionary Housing Ordinance requirements. While there are very limited
exemptions to this ordinance, one exemption is granted to projects that are subject to a
development agreement and include an affordable housing component approved by City
Council (PMC section 18.86.020 D1).
A Development Agreement is an agreement between the City and a developer for the
development of property. Development Agreements typically contain a description that
establishes the use of the property as well as general design characteristics; a time schedule for
completion of the project; City financial or other assistance; financing provisions; use covenants;
and minimum affordability requirements among other sections. Much of the affordable
residential development within the city during the last Housing Element planning period (2007–
2014) was accomplished through Development Agreements between the Redevelopment
Agency and nonprofit and for-profit developers.
All of the affordable housing projects listed in Table 2-44, Projects Approved or Pending Since
January 2007, were accomplished through Development Agreements.
For-profit projects subject to a approval of a Development Agreement are typically for-sale
developments and included Sky Ranch (373 single-family lots). The approval contained

Conditions of Approval providing the developer with various options for meeting the affordable
housing requirement..
DENSITY BONUS INCENTIVE PROGRAM
The City offers a Density Bonus program as described in Section 3.2, Governmental
Opportunities and Constraints. . Further, the Railroad Avenue Specific Plan and Pittsburg/Bay
Point BART Master Plan contain policies related to density bonuses for affordable housing in the
areas closest to existing and planned transit.
ADMINISTRATIVE RESOURCES
Pittsburg has access to a limited variety of existing and potential administrative sources
available for affordable housing activities. It is essential to note that the most important and
effective tool for constructing deed-restricted affordable housing was the Redevelopment
Agency of the City of Pittsburg, which as abolished in December 2011 in accordance with state
law and court decisions related to the law. The dissolution of the Redevelopment Agency is
described in detail below.
The following section describes the key housing governmental and nonprofit resources in
Pittsburg.
GOVERNMENTAL RESOURCES
Several local, state, and federal housing programs provide financial assistance to very low-, low-,
and moderate-income households for monthly housing costs, rehabilitation, and down payment
assistance. However, while the City has taken advantage of many opportunities—including
redevelopment projects, Community Development Block Grants, rehabilitation, and other
federal housing programs—the amount of money available for housing development is less than
needed to meet local needs.
Housing Authority
The Pittsburg Housing Authority’s (Housing Authority) mission is “to promote adequate and
affordable housing and a suitable living environment free from discrimination.” The primary
function of the Housing Authority is to administer HUD’s Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher
Program and the Section 8 First Time Home Buyer Program. The Housing Authority administers a
Chapter 4 - Housing Resources                                                                       4-30

total of 948 housing choice vouchers under the Section 8 program (see Section 4.5, Financial
Resources). To monitor the quality of the Housing Authority’s Section 8 housing stock,
inspections are conducted on an annual basis.
Successor Agency to the Redevelopment Agency of the City of Pittsburg
The Redevelopment Agency of the City of Pittsburg (Agency) was active in shaping the city since
the adoption of its first redevelopment plan for the Marina View Redevelopment Project Area in
1962. In 1993, the Agency merged all project areas, established over the years, into a single
redevelopment project area, the Los Medanos Community Development Project Area. The Los
Medanos Project Area comprised approximately 64 percent of the land area within city limits.
On June 28, 2011, Governor Jerry Brown signed Assembly Bill (ABX1) 26, which was
subsequently upheld by the California Supreme Court in California Redevelopment Association,
et al. v. Ana Matosantos, et al., amending California Redevelopment Law and dissolving
redevelopment agencies, effective February 1, 2012. This legislation upheld the legality of state
budget bills to dissolve redevelopment agencies and redirect redevelopment agency assets and
funds to state obligations. All Pittsburg Redevelopment Agency activities were thus suspended
with the exception of scheduled payments and obligations established prior to June 28,
2011. On January 17, 2012, the City Council of the City of Pittsburg adopted Resolution 12-
11753, approving the new role of the Housing Authority (Housing Successor Agency) to assume
all rights, responsibilities, and functions related to housing, which includes housing
administration originally undertaken by the Agency and all functions related to the Community
Development Block Grant (CDBG) program.
The Housing Successor Agency, under the authority of the Housing Authority, handles the
administration and distribution of all CDBG funds such as rehabilitation loans to preserve the
City’s housing stock and to make it energy efficient and accessible for seniors and persons with
disabilities. The Housing Successor Agency also disburses CDBG funds, in conjunction with
organizations, that support quality of life programs for seniors, youth, people with disabilities,
female heads of household, and others needing technical and financial assistance in the city.
The decision to eliminate redevelopment agencies by the state has resulted in far fewer
resources for affordable housing projects, elimination of blight, economic development, and
infrastructure improvements. In fact, all of the affordable housing developments listed in Table
2-44 were subsidized by the Agency through direct funds or disposition of land below market
Chapter 4 - Housing Resources                                                                      4-31

value. The impact of the loss of this tool for the creation of affordable housing at the local level
cannot be underestimated.
NONPROFIT RESOURCES
Nonprofit organizations are key players in the development and preservation of affordable
housing opportunities in Contra Costa County. The following are nonprofit organizations active
in Pittsburg.
Habitat for Humanity
Habitat for Humanity is a nonprofit agency dedicated to building affordable housing and
rehabilitating homes for lower-income families. Habitat builds and repairs homes with the help
of volunteers and partner families. Habitat homes are sold to partner families at no profit with
affordable or no-interest loans. Volunteers, churches, businesses, and other groups provide
most of the labor for the homes. Government agencies or individuals usually donate land for
new homes.
Pacific Community Services, Inc.
Pacific Community Services, Inc. (PCSI) is a HUD-certified counseling and fair housing agency that
is located in Old Town Pittsburg. During the last Housing Element planning period (2007–2014),
PCSI received funding from Community Development Block Grants and the former
Redevelopment Agency to provide counseling, classes, workshops, and general information to
low- and moderate-income, first time homebuyers participating in the City of Pittsburg First
Time Homebuyer Program. PCSI also provides assistance with tenant/landlord disputes, and
handles housing discrimination complaints in collaboration with Bay Area Legal Aid, which
provides on-site legal services five to seven times a month in addition to on-call phone
assistance. Fair housing and discrimination complaints are taken in person and over the phone
by PCSI counselors who work with the tenants to determine if the complaint has merit as a
discrimination issue. If it is determined that the complaint is a tenant/landlord issue and not a
discrimination issue, PCSI counselors will offer dispute resolution. If it is a discrimination or legal
issue, the complaint is referred to Bay Area Legal Aid, the California Department of Fair
Employment and Housing, and/or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD), as appropriate. PCSI’s services are advertised once a month in the East County Times, on
housing advocacy and governmental websites, and in the community services section of the
phone book.

FINANCIAL RESOURCES
There are a variety of existing and potential funding sources available for affordable housing
activities, many of which are competitive on a state or region-wide level. The following section
describes the key local, state, County, and federal resources currently used in Pittsburg to fund
affordable housing programs as well as social and community development activities within the
city.
FEDERAL RESOURCES
Federal resources available to support development, rehabilitation, and subsidy of affordable
housing in Pittsburg include:
Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Funds
The CDBG program provides funds for community development activities. The program is
flexible in that the funds can be used for a variety of activities. Eligible activities include, but are
not limited to, acquisition and/or disposition of real estate or property, public facilities and
improvements, relocation, rehabilitation of housing, homeownership assistance, and clearance
activities. The City was allocated $611,887 in CDBG funds for the 2013–2014 fiscal year. These
funds currently support programs to provide assistance to households needing affordable
housing, specifically households with special needs, and are used for the acquisition and/or
rehabilitation of affordable housing.
Throughout the last Housing Element planning period (2007–2014), CDBG funds were used to
support a variety of programs, including but not limited to: the Section 8 First Time Homebuyer
Program; the City’s Housing Rehabilitation Loan Program and rehabilitation services for seniors
and the disabled (Rebuilding Together Diablo Valley); housing counseling programs (PCSI)
services for seniors (Meals on Wheels, Senior Outreach Services, Contra Costa Senior and Legal
Services, and financing for services at Stoneman Village I and II senior housing development);
services for women and children (Community Violence Solutions, Cambridge Community Center,
Contra Costa Child Care Council, STAND! Against Domestic Violence, and Northern California
Family Center); services for the disabled (Independent Living Resource, St. Joseph’s Center for
the Deaf and Hard of Hearing, Bedford Center, New Connections HIV/AIDS Services, and Lions
Center for the Visually Impaired); services for the homeless and those suffering from substance
abuse issues (New Connections Substance Abuse and Shelter Inc.), food programs (Food Bank of
Chapter 4 - Housing Resources                                                                            4-33

Contra Costa and Solano, and Loaves and Fishes of Contra Costa), legal services (La Raza Centro
Legal, Inc.), local programming such as code enforcement, police services, and recreational
services for community youth and seniors, among other programs.
HOME Funds
The purpose of the HOME Investment Partnerships Act (HOME) program is to expand the supply
of decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable housing for very low- and low-income families and
households. The program provides formula grants to states and localities to fund a variety of
activities including building, buying, and/or rehabilitating affordable housing for rent or
homeownership or providing direct rental assistance to low-income people. HOME funds are
awarded annually to participating jurisdictions. States and local governments are permitted to
use HOME funds for grants, direct loans, loan guarantees or other forms of credit
enhancements, or rental assistance or security deposits. The City is not an entitlement
jurisdiction that receives HOME funds directly from HUD. Rather, the City is part of the Contra
Costa County HOME Program Consortium in partnership with the County and participating
jurisdictions; therefore, HOME funds utilized by the City would be granted by Contra Costa
County.
Mortgage Credit Certificate Program
The Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC) Program, authorized by Congress in the Tax Reform Act
of 1984, provides financial assistance to first-time homebuyers for the purchase of a new or
existing home. In 1985, the state adopted legislation authorizing local agencies, such as Contra
Costa County, to make MCCs available in California. Contra Costa County MCCs can be used in all
cities as well as the unincorporated areas of the county. The Contra Costa County Community
Development Department administers the program.
Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program
The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program is a federal program that provides rental
assistance to very low-income persons in need of affordable housing. The Section 8 program
offers a voucher that pays the difference between the payment standard and what a tenant can
afford to pay, which HUD has determined is 30 percent of their gross adjusted income for rent
and utilities. HUD, through the City’s Housing Authority, pays the remainder of the rent directly
to the landlord. Under the Housing Choice Voucher Program, households are responsible for
Chapter 4 - Housing Resources                                                                     4-34

finding appropriate housing within the private market. Households who receive vouchers can
select units that are above or below market rate units; however, if a household chooses to
occupy a unit where costs are greater than market rate, then the household is expected to pay
the additional amount. Voucher recipients are not permitted to pay greater than 40 percent of
their monthly income to housing costs.
The Housing Authority issues vouchers from a waiting list that includes local households, and
tenants transferring to the city. When issuing vouchers from the waiting list, the Housing
Authority ranks applicants in order to the following preferences, which are in compliance with
HUD regulations: 1) Veteran/Resident; 2) Veteran/Non-Resident; 3) Resident/Non-Veteran; and
4) Non-Resident/Non-Veteran.
As of 2014, the Housing Authority administered 1108 Section 8 Vouchers. Approximately 948
vouchers were issued through the Housing Choice Voucher program and 160 vouchers were
issued through the Veteran’s Affairs Supportive Housing program (VASH). Participants included
525 elderly/disabled households, 519 family households and 63 other households. The Section
8 waiting list has 281 households and due to the limited funding from the U. S. Dept. of Housing
and Urban Development and the low attrition rate of 3% for the program, these families
continue to remain unassisted since 2006.
STATE AND LOCAL RESOURCES
There are a variety of state and local resources that have been used for housing development
and rehabilitation for homeowners and renters as well as community development programs.
Some of the resources detailed in Table 4-6, Financial Resources for Housing Activities, have
been used by the City of Pittsburg and some may be used in the future to accomplish the goals,
policies, and programs set forth in this Housing Element. Two of those resources are described
in more detail below.
Inclusionary Ordinance/In-lieu Fees
As discussed previously in Chapter 3, Governmental Opportunities and Constraints, Pittsburg’s
Inclusionary Housing Ordinance requires new development to provide affordable units, offering
additional financial incentives and options for alternative compliance. Since the ordinance was
adopted in 2004, a total of five affordable housing units (two units set aside for very low-income
households, and three units set aside for low-income households) were recorded for the Delta
Hawaii Senior Apartments. The 2009 California appellate court decision in Palmer/Sixth Street
Chapter 4 - Housing Resources                                                                      4-35

Properties v. City of Los Angeles found that inclusionary requirements to deed restrict units or to
pay a fee in-lieu of deed restricting units may be in violation of the Costa-Hawkins Act, which
allows property owners to set base rents on newly constructed units. Because of the court’s
decision and a potential conflict with state law, the City of Pittsburg does not impose an
inclusionary housing requirement on new, multi-family rental housing. However, for-sale single-
and multi-family developments continue to be subject to the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance.
Affordable Housing and Sustainable Communities (AHSC) Program
In September 2014, the Strategic Growth Council (SCG) released draft guidelines for the
Affordable Housing and Sustainable Communities (AHSC) Program, which would be funded
through the auction proceeds from the California Air Resources Board’s (CARB) Cap and Trade
Program and appropriated to the state’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF). It is estimated
that 20 percent of the GGRF will be allocated to the AHSC Program on an annual basis beginning
in fiscal year 2015–16. The purpose of the AHSC Program is to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions through projects that implement land use, housing, transportation, and agricultural
land preservation practices to support infill and compact development, and that support related
and coordinated public policy objectives. The AHSC Program will be administered by the SGC
and implemented by the California Department of Housing and Community Development and
the California Natural Resources Agency in consultation with CARB.
Starting in 2015, the AHSC Program will provide grants and low-interest loans to projects
classified as one of two types. The first type of project is a transit-oriented development (TOD)
project that locates residential/mixed-use developments with an emphasis on affordable
housing development near high-quality transit systems. These projects must have a residential
component with at least 20 percent of the total residential units restricted for affordability
(levels of affordability have not been specified). The second type of project is an integrated
connectivity project (ICP) designed to reduce GHG emissions by increasing connectivity between
land uses and improved transit access and service. According to the draft guidelines, the
minimum and maximum loan or grant award for a TOD project would be $1 million and $15
million, respectively. The minimum and maximum award for an ICP project is $500,000 and $8
million, respectively.
The AHSC Program is particularly applicable to the City of Pittsburg because 14 of the identified
parcels in the City’s inventory (see Tables 4-2 and 4-3) are located in PDAs adjacent to existing or
planned transit.

OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENERGY CONSERVATION
According to the U.S. Department of Energy, the residential sector accounts for 22 percent of
the country’s annual energy use with 43 percent of residential energy used for space heating
and cooling; 18 percent used for water heating; and 6 percent used for lighting.1 Energy
conservation provides the dual benefits of promoting environmental sustainability and reducing
households’ monthly energy costs, which is a component of long-term housing affordability.
Opportunities for residential energy conservation exist at all scales, from individual home
appliances to city design. Building design, construction techniques, street layouts, location of
housing in close proximity to transit and services, and zoning all affect energy consumption and
can therefore be used to support its reduction.
Constructing new homes with energy-conserving features, in addition to retrofitting existing
energy-inefficient structures, can result in energy conservation. Examples of energy
conservation opportunities include:
       Sealing a home’s building envelope (doors, windows, walls, foundation, roof, and insulation)
        to prevent energy leaks that increase heating and cooling costs.
       Installing energy-efficient appliances, lighting, and mechanical systems (heating, ventilation,
        and air conditioning).
       Installing a “cool roof” that reflects solar radiation to lower cooling costs and reduce the
        urban heat island effect.
       Designing and orienting buildings to take advantage of natural systems such as sun, shade,
        and wind, which can provide heating, cooling, and energy-generation opportunities.
Chapter 4 - Housing Resources                                                                                                                                   4-40

        Supporting attached housing design, which reduces the number of exterior walls per unit and
         results in lower per unit heating and cooling costs.
        Promoting infill development, especially along transportation corridors, to use existing
         infrastructure and services.
State law (Government Code Section 65583 [a][8]) requires local governments to address energy
conservation issues when updating a Housing Element. According to the California Department
of Housing and Community Development, these elements should contain an analysis of
opportunities for residential energy conservation. It is the intent of this requirement to promote
energy-efficient housing systems and building design as well as the use of energy-saving
features and materials during construction.
STATE OF CALIFORNIA
Two major state initiatives focus on energy conservation and directly relate to housing issues:
energy-efficient building code standards and GHG emissions reductions. These are described
below.
State Energy Efficiency Requirements for New Construction (Title 24)
All new construction in Pittsburg is subject to the requirements of the California Energy
Commission’s Title 24 energy efficiency standards. Each city and county must enforce these
standards as part of its review of building plans and issuance of building permits. These
standards apply to building components, such as wall and ceiling insulation, thermal mass, and
window to floor area ratios, and are designed to reduce heat loss and energy consumption. The
Title 24 requirements also apply to major remodeling projects, such as home additions.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction (Assembly Bill 32)
In 2006, the California legislature adopted the California Global Warming Solutions Act
(Assembly Bill [AB] 32) in response to the threat global warming poses to California’s public
health and economic and environmental well-being. The legislature has found human activity to
be one of the leading contributors to increasing levels of GHGs, including carbon dioxide and
methane. The state has declared that GHG emissions contribute to increasing average global
temperatures and to changes in climate throughout the world. The purpose of the act is to
Chapter 4 - Housing Resources                                                                        4-41

reduce GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 (25 percent reduction over current levels) and
then to further reduce GHG emissions to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.
The California Air Pollutions Control Officers Association (CAPCOA), which represents local air
districts, produced a report on ways to reduce GHG emissions at the local level, including steps
that cities and counties can take to contribute to the goals of AB 32. At the local level, CAPCOA
recommended the adoption of General Plan policies and implementation measures that
encourage energy conservation through community layout and design. Many of the
recommendations are relevant for residential energy conservation, including the following:
        Promote walkability through a highly connected street system with small blocks.
        Promote mixed-use neighborhood centers and TOD.
        Promote the use of fuel-efficient heating and cooling equipment and other appliances.
        Encourage green building designs in both new construction and building renovation,
         including reflective roofing and energy-efficient building materials.
        Encourage building orientations and landscaping that enhance natural lighting and sun
         exposure.
        Encourage the expansion of neighborhood-level retail and services, as well as public transit
         opportunities throughout the area to reduce automobile use.
        Encourage the development of affordable housing throughout the community, as well as
         development of housing for elderly and low- and moderate-income households, that is near
         public transportation services.
These principles can be achieved mainly with development of parcels identified in Tables 4-2
and 4-3 and shown in Figures 4-1 and 4-2, above, that are located in PDAs where high-density,
mixed-use development is encouraged in close proximity to existing and planned transit.
ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS
Pacific Gas and Electric
Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) offers several programs to promote energy
conservation including incentives for energy conservation, rebate programs for old appliances,
Chapter 4 - Housing Resources                                                                         4-42

and free energy audits. It also provides public education and outreach programs to publicize
energy-saving tips. PG&E customer assistance programs for lower-income households are listed
below:
          California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE) is PG&E’s discount program for low-income
           households and housing facilities. CARE provides a 20 percent discount on monthly energy
           bills and waives recent surcharges for low-income households. The program applies to single-
           family homeowners, tenants who are metered or billed by landlords, and group living
           facilities.
          Family Electric Rate Assistance (FERA) is a discount program for families of three or more
           with low- to moderate-income. The program is available to both single-family and multi-
           family residential customers.
          Energy Partners Program is one of PG&E’s financial assistance programs that provide
           qualified low-income customers free weatherization measures and energy-efficient appliances
           to reduce gas and electricity usage. The work usually involves attic insulation, door
           replacement, door weather-stripping, and minor home repair.
          Relief for Energy Assistance for Community Help (REACH) is a one-time energy assistance
           program for low-income homeowners who cannot pay their utility bill because of a sudden
           financial hardship. The program is targeted to the elderly, disabled, sick, working poor, and
           unemployed. Eligibility is determined by the Salvation Army and requires a household
           income that does not exceed 200 percent of the federal poverty level.
PG&E also offers reduced rates for residential customers dependent on life support equipment,
or with special heating and cooling needs caused by certain medical conditions. The utility also
offers a balanced payment plan for customers who experience higher heating or cooling costs
during the extreme weather months.
Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program
The California Department of Community Services and Development has a Low-Income Home
Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) to assist low-income homeowners with weatherization and
energy bills.1 The LIHEAP Weatherization Program is implemented by Contra Costa County and
provides free weatherization services such as attic insulation, caulking, water heater blanket,

heating/cooling system repair, and other conservation measures. LIHEAP also provides
payments for weather-related or energy-related emergencies and financial assistance to eligible
households.
THE CITY OF PITTSBURG POLICIES AND PROGRAMS
The current Housing Element has one policy and seven programs aimed at promoting “smart
growth” and residential energy conservation in new construction and rehabilitation projects.
Smart growth goals are to achieve a unique sense of community and place; expand the range of
transportation, employment, and housing choices; equitably distribute the costs and benefits of
development; preserve and enhance natural and cultural resources; and promote public health.
This is achieved through compact, high-density, transit-oriented, pedestrian- and bike-friendly
development with a mix of uses. Mixed-use development promotes the proximity of a variety of
uses including residential, public, office, retail, health, and child care services in order to create a
complete neighborhood. Overall, smart growth invests time, attention, and resources in
restoring community and vitality to center cities and placing new mixed-use development near
transit resources. Housing Element policies direct the City to place new residential development
near transit resources and encourage the incorporation of energy conservation design features
in existing and future residential developments, to conserve resources and reduce housing
costs.
Current housing element policies and actions include the following:
        Encourage the incorporation of smart growth site planning principles in new subdivisions as
         part of a comprehensive update of the development review design guidelines.
        Evaluate new subdivisions for passive solar and cooling opportunities, consistent with the
         Subdivision Map Act.
        Enforce the state energy conservation standards for new residential construction and additions
         to existing structures.
        Continue to offer rehabilitation loans and possibly grants to low- and moderate-income
         homeowners to improve the energy efficiency of their residence and/or replace existing
         energy-inefficient appliances.
Chapter 4 - Housing Resources                                                                            4-44

        Support the use of solar heating and other environmentally sound, energy-efficient methods
         for heating and cooling homes, consistent with adopted building, mechanical, and plumbing
         codes.
        Create incentives such as a density bonus or priority permitting for developments that exceed
         state energy efficiency standards by 20 percent as part of a comprehensive update of the
         development review design guidelines.
        Work with the Pittsburg Power Company and other private donors to develop a grant or long-
         term loan program fund to fund the installation of solar panels on single-family and multi-
         family residential developments to reduce energy consumption and provide savings to
         property owners and residents.
During the last Housing Element planning period (2007–2014) the City adopted citywide Green
Building Design Guidelines (Planning Commission Resolution No. 9864), introducing green
building design and neighborhood design attributes to the Development Review process. The
guidelines include strategies to conserve water use, promote clean local air quality, and
facilitate consumer and resident access to alternative energy technologies. In addition, the City
implemented smart growth design principles through the adoption of the Railroad Avenue
Specific Plan and the Pittsburg/Bay Point BART Master Plan. The specific plan and the master
plan contain design standards and policies to support an increase in walking and using
alternative forms of transit through development of mixed land uses, short street blocks, and a
variety of housing types to provide opportunities for energy conservation at both the individual
building and neighborhood levels. In addition, the City of Pittsburg and the Redevelopment
Agency have invested millions of dollars in capital improvements and economic and residential
developments in Old Town, the city’s downtown area. This investment is the foundation to
establishing a compact, walkable core within central Pittsburg.
Conclusion
One-fifth of national energy consumption is attributed to the residential sector. Maintaining
policies and programs that support energy conservation across all levels of residential
development promotes a healthier environment and increases long-term housing affordability.
The City enforces Title 24 standards to increase energy conservation in new construction and
works with PG&E to promote weatherization and energy-conserving rehabilitation of existing
structures. The City is also implementing a neighborhood-level approach to energy conservation
Chapter 4 - Housing Resources                                                                          4-45

through the establishment of PDAs and the adoption of plans to support high-density mixed-
use housing in close proximity to services and transit.. This approach will result in the
densification of development at employment and transportation nodes and will provide a
variety of housing and transportation options to support smart growth goals.
Chapter 4 - Housing Resources                                                              4-46
CHAPTER 5 HOUSING PLAN
This Housing Plan is a statement of Pittsburg’s commitment to maintaining, preserving,
improving, and developing housing opportunities for all segments of the community. The plan
contains goals, policies, and objectives, as well as implementing programs to achieve a high
quality, balanced housing stock that accommodates the needs of existing and future Pittsburg
residents. The Housing Plan must achieve the following:
        Ensure that adequate sites will be available through appropriate zoning and development
         standards and with public services and facilities needed to meet the needs of all income levels
         throughout the planning period.
        Assist in the development of adequate housing to meet the needs of extremely low-, very
         low-, low-, and moderate-income households.
        Address and, where appropriate and legally possible, remove governmental constraints to the
         maintenance, improvement, and development of housing.
        Conserve and improve the condition of existing affordable housing stock.
        Promote housing opportunities for all persons regardless of race, religion, sex, sexual
         orientation, marital status, ancestry, national origin, or color.

ACCOMPLISHMENTS UNDER THE 2007–2014 HOUSING ELEMENT
A critical part of the City’s housing strategy is to evaluate the program achievements of the
2007–2014 Housing Element in relation to the goals, policies, and actions outlined in the
element. The purpose of this assessment is to determine the effectiveness of previous housing
policies and programs and whether modifications are appropriate. This evaluation provides
valuable information on how successful these programs have been in achieving stated
objectives and addressing local needs.
The review and evaluation of prior achievements is also a requirement of state law. California
Government Code Section 65588 requires that the evaluation assess:
1. The appropriateness of the housing goals, objectives, and policies in contributing to the
     attainment of the state housing goal;
2. The effectiveness of the Housing Element in attainment of the community’s housing goals
     and objectives; and
3. The City’s progress in implementation of the Housing Element.
SUMMARY OF PROGRAM ACHIEVEMENTS
The previous element contained five housing goals related to (1) fostering development of a
variety of housing types, densities, and prices to balance the City’s housing stock and meet
Pittsburg’s regional fair share housing needs for people of all income levels; (2) promoting the
expansion of the City’s affordable housing stock, including that which accommodates special
needs households; (3) eliminating housing discrimination; (4) improving and preserving the
existing affordable housing stock where feasible and appropriate; and (5) enhancing the visual
quality of Pittsburg’s residential neighborhoods.
The following is a summary of the City’s achievements under the 2007–2014 Housing Element.
Refer to Appendix A for a more detailed evaluation of the effectiveness of each program.
Chapter 5 - Housing Plan                                                                         5-2

Housing Goal I:         Foster development of a variety of housing types, densities, and prices to
                        balance the City’s housing stock and to meet Pittsburg’s regional fair
                        share housing needs for people of all income levels.
Applicable Policies:
       Ensure there is an adequate supply of mixed use and residentially zoned land of
        appropriate densities to accommodate existing and anticipated housing needs through
        2020.
       Ensure the construction of larger, high-end housing in the southern foothills, downtown,
        along the waterfront, and throughout the City to provide moderate- and above
        moderate-income housing opportunities and to increase economic activity within the
        City.
       Encourage the development of small-lot single-family infill developments suitable for
        first-time homebuyers, empty nesters, and single-parent households.
       Support the construction of multi-family housing in close proximity to transit, arterials,
        shopping, and public services.
       Encourage the construction of second family units that allow extended families to live
        near each other, increase the affordable and rental housing stock, and provide income
        assistance to homeowners.
       Develop an adequate housing supply downtown to support ground-floor neighborhood-
        serving retail and service establishments along Railroad Avenue.
       Meet Pittsburg’s fair share regional housing needs.
Program accomplishments under Goal I include identification of three Priority Development
Areas (PDAs) in the City in support of the region-wide Sustainable Communities Strategy;
adoption of the Railroad Avenue Specific Plan and Pittsburg/Bay Point BART Master Plan to
support the development of high-density, mixed-use transit villages in two of the identified
PDAs; rezoning of vacant and underutilized land deemed appropriate for mixed-use or higher-
density residential use; amendment of the Zoning Ordinance to allow greater usage of land for

residential purposes; and support of annexation of vacant land that is appropriate for residential
use, when adjacent to the city limits.
In addition, the City approved 1,555 residential units during the 2007–2014 Housing Element
planning period including nine units for extremely low-income households, 66 for very low-
income households, 330 for low-income households, 353 for moderate-income households, and
797 for above moderate-income households. The City exceeded production goals set forth for
low- and moderate-income households (223 and 296, respectively), but fell short of meeting the
allocations for very low- and above moderate-income households. Overall, the City approved
approximately 80 percent of the RHNA for the 2007–2014 Housing Element planning period.
Housing production during this time frame was adversely impacted by a severe global recession,
which resulted in a significant number of foreclosures of existing housing and nearly halted new
housing production. This planning period also saw the dissolution of the City’s Redevelopment
Agency, which provided a significant source of financing including land dispensation to
affordable housing developers in the city.
Housing Goal II:         Promote the expansion of the city’s affordable housing stock, including
                         that which accommodates special needs households.
Applicable Policies:
        Provide incentives to developers who assist the City in meeting affordable housing
         needs, including units to accommodate special needs households: female-headed
         households, seniors, disabled, large families, emancipated youth, seasonal and
         temporary workers, and the homeless.
        Accommodate the development of housing that is accessible to disabled persons and
         facilitates aging in place.
        Support efforts to provide temporary, transitional, and permanent housing in the city
         and surrounding area for homeless people.
        Increase homeownership opportunities for very low-, low-, and moderate-income
         households.

        Increase the supply of rental housing available and affordable to extremely low-, very
         low-, low-, and moderate-income households and in particular large families.
        Encourage the incorporation of energy conservation design features in existing and
         future residential developments to conserve resources and reduce housing costs.
        Utilize smart growth principles in the site planning of new subdivisions to enhance the
         quality of life of Pittsburg residents.

QUANTIFIED OBJECTIVES
As described above, the City of Pittsburg will utilize a number of approaches to meet its
projected housing needs. The Housing Element is required to establish the maximum number of
housing units the City believes can be constructed, rehabilitated, and preserved over the
planning period from January 2014 to July 2022.
While the City will strive, through the implementation of the goals, policies, and programs
delineated in Section 5.2, Housing, Goals, and Programs, to attain the quantified objectives,
Pittsburg cannot guarantee that these needs will be met, given the loss of the Redevelopment
Agency as a financing tool, the limited financial resources, and the inapplicability of inclusionary
requirements to rental housing due to conflicts with state law. Meeting these housing needs will
depend in part on the availability of private funding sources, new public subsidies and grants
such as the cap-and-trade program, and funding levels of state, federal, and county housing
programs. Additionally, economic forces can heavily influence the housing market as tax credit
and other forms of financing have grown increasingly competitive since the loss of the
Redevelopment Agency as a financing tool.
The quantified objectives assume optimum conditions for the production, rehabilitation, and
preservation of housing. However, many factors, including physical and market conditions, can
affect the timing and cost of meeting a community’s housing needs. As stated earlier in this
document (Table 4-1), the City has already approved 1,122 housing units at a variety of income
levels, and there is enough appropriately zoned acreage detailed in Tables 4-2 and 4-3, Vacant
and Underutilized Parcel inventories, to accommodate the RHNA for this planning period.
However, the loss of previously used financing tools and the competitiveness of new funding
mechanisms have placed significant challenges on the construction of new market-rate and
affordable housing. Despite these significant challenges, the City will make every effort to meet
its RHNA and continue to pursue available state and federal resources to facilitate the
production of affordable housing in the city during the planning period. Table 5-1 summarizes
Pittsburg’s quantified objectives for the planning period.
