                                                    INTRODUCTION
The City's General Plan guides the use and protection of various resources to meet community purposes. It reflects
consensus and compromise among a wide diversity of citizens' preferences, within a framework set by State law. The
General Plan is published in separately adopted sections, called elements, which address various topics.
The Land Use Element represents a generalized blueprint for the future of the City of San Luis Obispo. Required by State
law, it is the core of the General Plan. Starting with conditions at the time of adoption, the Land Use Element sets forth a
pattern for the orderly development of land within the City's planning area. This pattern should be based on residents'
preference and on protection of natural assets unique to the planning area. The Element also describes the expected level
of population growth resulting from construction of the kinds of housing units included in the plan, as well as the kinds of
new commercial and industrial development that are responsive to the City's economic needs.
The City's planning area coincides with the County's San Luis Obispo planning area (Figure 1), and encompasses about
72,600 acres. It can be generally described to include most of Montana de Oro State Park, as well as Cuesta College, Camp
San Luis Obispo, and the California Men’s Colony. It is bounded by the coastal zone to the west and the Los Padres
National Forest to the east. The southern portion of the planning area includes the Irish Hills, See Canyon and Squire
Canyon. It contains the rural areas surrounding the City of San Luis Obispo, the inland portion of the Avila Beach urban
area and the village of Los Ranchos/Edna. The General Plan also defines a smaller geographic boundary, referred to as the
Land Use and Circulation Element (LUCE) Planning Subarea which contains the urban land uses for the community
(Figure 2).
The General Plan consists of eight elements, including the Land Use Element. These elements have the following key
implications for the Land Use Element.
          The Circulation Element recognizes implications of land use policy on all modes of movement and establishes
           policies, standards, and implementation measures that work with the Land Use Element update and address both
           existing and potential circulation opportunities and deficiencies.
          The Housing Element goals, policies, and programs reflect the land use policies as they relate to residential
           development.
          Noise Element policies provide the appropriate protections needed to allow development and mixture of
           compatible uses while protecting residents and land uses from noise impacts.
          The Safety Element identifies hazards that influence the locations and types of land uses proposed. The Land Use
           and Safety Elements share several safety topics. The Land Use Element update adds to the Safety Element
           through the inclusion of safety through environmental design concepts and to airport safety policies and
           programs.
          The Conservation and Open Space Element addresses protection of open space amenities and resources in
           detail. The Land Use Element works with this element and incorporates concepts such as clustering and buffering
           open space areas in order to enhance their protection.

Chapter 1
         The Parks and Recreation Element provides active recreation areas and facilities that are essential to
          neighborhoods. The Land Use Element works to incorporate parks and recreation into the larger land use
          alternative sites and enhance integration of these resources into neighborhoods.
         The Water and Wastewater Element provides policies and programs to support adequate services to the
          community. The Land Use Element includes alternatives that are in keeping with the services available and
          ensures that infrastructure is sized appropriately to serve future service needs and planning.
Policies in the Land Use Element and the General Plan Land Use Diagram are designed to be consistent and
complementary with all other General Plan elements.
History
The City's first General Plan, including land use and other elements, was adopted in 1961. A revised plan was adopted in
1966, following the County's first adoption of a plan for the San Luis Obispo area in 1965. The City adopted major
revisions of its Land Use Element in 1972 and in 1977 and 1994. The current element is a revision of the 1994 version.
Public Participation
Before adopting or revising any General Plan element, the Planning Commission and the City Council hold public hearings.
The City publishes notices in the local newspaper to let citizens know about the hearings at least ten days before they are
held. Also, the City prepares environmental documents to help citizens understand the expected consequences of its
planning policies before the hearings are held.
The City intends to re-evaluate this element about every ten years. Parts of it may be updated more often. There will be
annual reports on how the plan has been implemented and changed. Anyone may suggest or apply for an amendment to
the General Plan at any time, though state law limits how often it can be amended in any one year.
Background to the 1994 Land Use Element
The following represents a historical perspective of the update to the Land Use Element conducted in 1994 and is
taken from that Element:
          The City started work on updating this element with a series of public workshops in 1988. Also, the City
          took a public opinion survey and established committees to give advice on the element. The introduction
          to the 1977 Land Use Element contained a philosophical discussion of existing conditions and issues
          facing the City. The discussion is still valid today. Its premise is that the City and County, while still
          relatively rural and apparently capable of providing room for new residents, face some known and several
          undefined finite resources which may constrain growth. Furthermore, the introduction said, public
          attitudes towards the desirability of growth had changed since the City’s first General Plan; experience
          with growth had caused citizens and public officials to question whether growth, even well planned,
          produces benefits worth the social, economic and environmental costs and consequences. Despite such
          consistent and strong expression of community values, there has been continued, incremental
          degradation of the natural environment expressly valued by residents of San Luis Obispo.
          On the environmental side, the element stated that key resources known to have finite limits were water
          supply and air quality. All the basic resources – land, water and air – can accommodate some additional
          growth without severe impacts, but eventually and inevitably growth must stabilize and stop, or else
          exceed resource limitations with destructive social, economic and environmental ramifications. The
          purpose of the 1977 element, the Introduction said, was to apply planning methodologies to manage the
          rate and extent of growth so that irreversible environmental problems would not get out of hand before
          they were recognized.

                                                                                        Land Use Element
                                                                                                                 
         Concerns about environmental quality continue today, and are the basis for much of the General Plan.
         Votes of residents and the public opinion survey of residents done as part of the General Plan update have
         strongly reaffirmed the commitment of residents to preserve and enhance the environmental quality of
         our community. In the years since 1977 additional issues have become better defined. One, for example,
         is the maintenance of the remaining prime farmland in and around the City. The 1977 Element cited this
         as one of the primary issues facing planners, but failed to propose a concrete solution. As a result,
         irreplaceable agricultural land has been lost. The General Plan now proposes solutions to the continued
         irretrievable loss of this world-class natural asset. Another issue that was less well understood in 1977 is
         the preservation of important wildlife and native plant habitats. The General Plan now proposes
         preservation of such habitats, including planning based on the identification, mapping and monitoring of
         the community's existing natural assets. This element is an update of the 1977 element; it represents fine
         tuning rather than a new beginning.”
Background to the 2014 Land Use Element
Since adopting the Land Use and Circulation Elements in 1994, the City has updated and amended its General Plan
elements multiple times. The City updated its Noise Element in 1996, its Safety Element in 2000 and 2012, its Parks and
Recreation Element in 2001, its Conservation and Open Space Element in 2006, and its Housing Element in 2004, 2010 and
2015, and its Water and Wastewater Element in 2010. While the City made minor amendments to its Land Use and
Circulation Elements in 2010 and 2005, respectively, the 2014 LUCE update is the most comprehensive update of these
elements since 1994.
The City initiated the LUCE Update in early 2012 with the support of a Sustainable Communities Planning Grant from the
California Strategic Growth Council. The primary objectives of the Update were to respond to any changed conditions in
San Luis Obispo, incorporate sustainable practices and policies, respond to new State planning requirements, including
climate change, and engage the community in a reaffirmation of the community’s vision and goals for the city’s future.
The LUCE Update featured a community engagement program, which included a resident LUCE Task Force from diverse
geographic areas of the City; a city-wide community survey; a series of six community workshops; open houses; on-line
forums; and numerous other outreach efforts.
Community Values
Public attitudes and values are an essential part of what shapes planning documents. The residents of San Luis Obispo
have expressed strong community values. Residents have consistently voiced their desire to preserve environmental
assets and control excessive growth. There have been public votes on such issues, and all have expressed a preferred set
of community values:
        In 1972, 70% of city voters rejected by referendum an environmentally-controversial annexation in the Edna
         Valley, the Danley Annexation.
        In June 1978, 62% of city voters amended the city Charter by initiative to allow voters to vote yes or no on
         annexations.
        In November 1978, when the first Charter-mandated votes on annexations were held, 58% of voters rejected the
         Foothills annexation, and 56% the Ferrini annexation.
        In 1983, 73% of city voters said the city should protect sensitive hillsides and consider purchasing open space in
         order to preserve it.
        Also in 1983, 69% of city voters said Port San Luis should not be used for offshore oil activities.
        In 1985, 71% of voters chose to amend the San Luis Obispo Charter to require that land annexed to the city can
         only be developed in consistency with the General Plan.
        In 1989, 68% of city voters said growth management regulations should apply to all development in the city.

Chapter 1
        In 1991, 69% of city voters repealed by referendum Council-approved zoning for the Islay Hill/Arbors Tract.
        Also in 1991, in the midst of the worst drought in history, 56% of city voters said the city should not participate in
         the State Water Project
        In a 1992 referendum, a similar percentage of city voters rescinded Council approval for joining the State Water
         Project.
        Measure P was approved by city voters in 1996 to amend the City Charter to add a water reliability reserve to
         protect the City from future water shortages.
        Also in 1996, 51.2% of city voters opposed Measure O, a City-wide assessment district for open space protection
         and park acquisition.
        In a special election in 2005, City voters voted on three separate measures to reverse City approvals for the
         MarketPlace Project, a mixed-use development proposed on prime farmland within the City’s Urban Reserve.
         These votes 1) opposed the General Plan land use changes (51.4%), 2) opposed changes to the zoning regulations
         map and approval of the development plan (51.5%), and 3) opposed the Development Agreement and Special Tax
         Reimbursement Agreement (52.8%), thereby rescinding previous City development approvals.
        In 2006, City voters supported (64.8%) a sales tax increase of one-half cent for eight years to protect and maintain
         essential services such as neighborhood street paving and pothole repair; traffic congestion relief; public safety
         including restoring eliminated traffic patrol; Fire Marshall and fire/paramedic training positions; flood protection;
         senior citizen services/facilities; neighborhood code enforcement; open space preservation and other vital
         general purpose services.
        In 2010, 80% of the voters opposed an initiative to amend the Margarita Area Specific Plan to change the
         approved alignment of Prado Road, thus retaining the circulation infrastructure identified in the Specific Plan.
As voters, the people of San Luis Obispo have spoken clearly on environmental protection and quality of life issues.
Citizens spoke equally clearly when polled by the City in 1988 as part of the Land Use Element update. The 585 poll
respondents placed quality of life and environmental issues at the top of their concerns. Ninety percent of respondents
listed the natural environment as their top quality of life concern. Asked, in an open-ended question, the City's greatest
problem, the top response (42%) was excessive growth. (The next largest response, at 15%, was traffic.) Asked, also in an
open-ended question, the City's greatest strength, 53% of responses concerned environmental quality and sense of
community.
Asked what reductions in quality of life they were willing to accept in return for greater economic growth, in the following
areas a majority said “none”:
        air pollution, 83%;
        increased traffic and traffic noise, 67%;
        development on peaks and hillsides, 66%;
        development on farmland and ranch land, 51%;
        development harmful to creeks, 67%;
        overall pace of life, 51%.
Asked to pick a growth rate from listed categories, 85% of respondents picked categories ranging from none (15%) to
slower than the state and county (51%) to no faster than the county (19%).

In conjunction with 2014 Land Use and Circulation Element Update, the City conducted a Quality of Life and Future
Development Survey in the Spring of 2012. The survey was designed to compare current community attitudes with the
results of the 1988 survey but did not duplicate some of the questions asked in 1988. The survey was distributed to
25,000 residents and businesses via utility bill inserts and direct mail. It was also made available online. The survey was
completed by 2,029 people via return mail and 169 online, for a total of 2,198 respondents.
The results of the 2012 survey largely reaffirmed many community values expressed in the 1988 survey, with some
differences. Respondents to the 2012 survey rated the natural environment (71.1%) and crime (62.9%) as having the
greatest impact on quality of life – echoing the sentiments expressed by respondents in 1988. Topics offered as San Luis
Obispo’s greatest problem in 2012 are shown below:

When asked about the city’s greatest strength, the City’s natural setting took most of the top spots, as it had in the 1988
survey.
When asked which of several listed approaches to determining allowable growth in the city they supported, respondents
continued to support preservation of the natural environment. Sixty-six percent want to keep growth in existing areas and
60% support avoiding harm to the natural environment.
In 2012, when asked to pick a growth rate from listed categories, 54.6% of respondents picked no change (maintain a 1%
average growth rate); 23.7% supported some increase but less than or equal to the state or county; 10.6% indicated the
residential growth rate should be tied to commercial development; and 11% indicated support for no growth limits at all.
Other input from the 2012 survey indicated the strongest support was for open space and bicycle infrastructure:

The Land Use Element must be understood as emerging from the context of the community’s past experiences and
present attitudes. It is a document that charts a future course of concern with environment, society, economy and quality
of life, and responds to the desires of the City’s residents.

Chapter 1
                               PREAMBLE TO THE LAND USE ELEMENT
We, the people of San Luis Obispo, hold that we have the right to determine our community's destiny based on our
community's values; that the future livability of our community will be driven by historical choices made from day to day,
and not by inevitable forces beyond our control; that in an age when the livability of large, urban communities to our
north, south, and east is being destroyed by incrementally accelerating environmental degradation and the breakdown of
civility, we assert our desire to seek a different sort of future for our community; that, therefore, we direct our elected
representatives and civic employees to preserve our community's natural environment and control excessive growth
detrimental to the long-term sustainability of the community.
                                          SAN LUIS OBISPO’S VISION
Our vision is of a sustainable community, within a diverse natural and agrarian setting, which is part of a larger ecosystem
upon which its existence depends. San Luis Obispo will maintain its healthy and attractive natural environment valued by
residents, its prosperity, and its sense of safety and community, within a compact urban form. Our community will have a
comprehensible scale, where people know each other and where their participation in government is welcome and
effective. The general plan outlines basic features of the city needed to sustain our livelihoods, our natural and historical
heritage, and our needs for interaction and expression. The general plan is a benchmark in the continuing planning
process, reflecting the desires of citizens with different backgrounds to sustain the community's qualities for themselves
and for future generations.
The City should provide a setting for comfortable living, including work and recreation. The City should live within its
resources, preserve the relatively high levels of service, environmental quality and clean air valued by its residents, and
strive to provide additional resources as needed.

                                             COMMUNITY’S GOALS
Introduction
Goals describe desirable conditions. In this context, they are meant to express the community's preferences for basic
future directions. In the goal statements, "San Luis Obispo" means the community as a whole, not just the City as a
municipal corporation. The statements also indicate what the City should do and what it should influence others to do.
The goals state San Luis Obispo's basic positions on the extent, rate, composition, and financing of growth. The following
Growth Management section includes policies and programs which offer more specific guidance on these topics. Later
sections, dealing with parts of the City and with land-use categories, give more detailed direction on preserving
neighborhoods and designing new development.
Approach to Planning
San Luis Obispo should:
           1. Choose its future, rather than let it happen. San Luis Obispo should be proactive in implementing its vision
                of the future, and should work with other agencies and institutions to create our desired mutual future.
           2. These policies and programs shall serve as a blueprint, guiding the City and its various entities in priority
                setting and resource allocation. It is understood that the availability of financial resources can and will
                affect the timing of implementation but shall not change the goals and intent.
Environment
San Luis Obispo should:
           3. Protect and enhance the natural environment, including the quality of air, water, soil, and open space.
           4. Protect, sustain, and where it has been degraded, enhance wildlife habitat on land surrounding the city, at
                Laguna Lake, along creeks and other wetlands, and on open hills and ridges within the city, so that diverse,
                native plants, fish, and animals can continue to live within the area.
           5. Protect public views of the surrounding hills and mountains.
           6. Recognize the importance of farming to the economy of the planning area and the county, protect
                agriculture from development and from incompatible uses, and protect remaining undeveloped prime
                agricultural soils.
           7. Protect and restore natural landforms and features in and near the city, such as the volcanic morros,
                hillsides, marshes, and creeks.
           8. Foster appreciation among citizens of the complex abundance of the planning area's environment, and of
                the need to respect natural systems.
           9. Identify, map and monitor our community's natural assets to preserve and protect them.
           10. Support statewide and regional efforts to create more sustainable communities, reduce greenhouse gas
                emissions, and develop transportation systems that support all modes of circulation.
           11. Encourage energy efficiency principles and practices in the City’s built environment.

Chapter 1
Society and Economy
San Luis Obispo should be a well balanced community. Environmental, social, and economic factors must be taken into
account in important decisions about San Luis Obispo's future. A healthy economy depends on a healthy environment.
The social fabric of the community for both residents and visitors must also be a part of that balance. Therefore,
complementary to the goals and objectives of this element, the City shall maintain and bi-annually review goals and
objectives that promote the economic well being of the community.
San Luis Obispo should:
           12. Provide employment opportunities appropriate for area residents' desires and skills.
           13. Provide goods and services which substantial numbers of area residents leave the area regularly to obtain,
                provided doing so is consistent with other goals.
           14. Retain existing businesses and agencies, and accommodate expansion of existing businesses, consistent
                with other goals.
           15. Emphasize more productive use of existing commercial buildings and land areas already committed to
                urban development.
           16. Provide an adequate revenue base for local government and public schools.
           17. Provide high quality public services, ensuring that demands do not exceed resources and that adequate
                facilities and services can be provided in pace with development.
           18. Cooperate with other agencies in the county to assure that increases in the numbers of workers and
                college and university students in the San Luis Obispo area do not outpace housing availability.
           19. Accommodate residents within all income groups.
           20. Preserve existing housing which is affordable to residents with very low, low, and moderate incomes.
           21. Actively seek ways to provide housing which is affordable to residents with very low, low, and moderate
                incomes, within existing neighborhoods and within expansion areas.
           22. Encourage opportunities for elder care and child care within the city.
           23. Enrich community cultural and social life by accommodating people with various backgrounds, talents,
                occupations, and interests.
           24. Provide a resilient economic base, able to tolerate changes in its parts without causing overall harm to the
                community.
           25. Have developments bear the costs of resources and services needed to serve them, except where the
                community deliberately chooses to help pay in order to achieve other community goals.
           26. Provide for high quality education and access to related services such as museums, art galleries, public art,
                and libraries.
           27. Serve as the county's hub for: county and state government; education; transportation; visitor information;
                entertainment; cultural, professional, medical, and social services; community organizations; retail trade.
           28. Provide a wide range of parks and sports and recreational facilities for the enjoyment of our citizens.
           29. Retain accessible, responsive, and capable local government.

          30. Ensure that residents' opportunities for direct participation in City government and their sense of
              community can continue.
          31. Increase the overall health and wellbeing of residents in the City of San Luis Obispo by expanding access to
               healthy food and nutrition choices and through community design that fosters walking and biking.
City Form
San Luis Obispo should:
          32. Maintain the town's character as a small, safe, comfortable place to live, and maintain its rural setting, with
              extensive open land separating it from other urban development.
          33. Maintain existing neighborhoods and assure that new development occurs as part of a neighborhood
               pattern.
          34. Where appropriate, create compact, mixed-use neighborhoods that locate housing, jobs, recreation, and
               other daily needs in close proximity to one another, while protecting the quality of life in established
               neighborhoods.
          35. Keep a clear boundary between San Luis Obispo's urban development and surrounding open land.
          36. Grow gradually outward from its historic center until its ultimate boundaries are reached, maintaining a
               compact urban form.
          37. Foster an awareness of past residents and ways of life, and preserve our heritage of historic buildings and
               places.
          38. Develop buildings and facilities which will contribute to our sense of place and architectural heritage.
          39. Develop buildings and places which complement the natural landscape and the fabric of neighborhoods.
          40. Focus its government and cultural facilities and provide a variety of business services and housing in the
               Downtown.
          41. Provide a safe and pleasant place to walk and ride a bicycle, for recreation and other daily activities.
          42. Be a safe place to live.

                                   LAND USE DIAGRAM AND STANDARDS
The most familiar part of any general plan is the Land Use Diagram – the illustration that shows the types and locations of
existing and future development that the general plan envisions. The following describes how the designations for each
land use are expressed and outlines the associated development standards for each of the designations shown on the City
of San Luis Obispo’s General Plan Land Use Diagram (Figure 3).
Land Use Diagram
The Land Use Diagram designates land uses for the entire Planning Area. State planning law requires that the general plan
cover all territory within the boundaries of the adopting city or county as well as “any land outside its boundary which in
the planning agency’s judgment bears relation to its planning” (Government Code Section 65300). To carry out this
directive, most cities formally delineate a “planning area” boundary in their general plans. The current update does not
change the designated planning area but has an emphasis on infill and therefore a smaller Planning Sub-area has been
identified to describe the area of focus for policies and land use changes.
A copy of the Land Use Diagram is available from the City’s Community Development Department or by download from
the City’s website.
                It is typical for the Land Use and Circulation Diagrams to be updated over time. Please check with the
                Community Development Department to ensure you have the current version.
The Land Use Diagram also depicts the Airport Safety zone overlay for the San Luis Obispo County Regional Airport. This
diagram, together with the Airport policies and programs contained in Section 7.0, demonstrate how the City’s General
Plan complies with the State Aeronautics Act (California Public Utilities Code, Section 21670 et seq.).
For areas outside the LUCE Planning Sub-area and not otherwise designated on the City’s Land Use Diagram, these areas
are designated as either AG/Open Space (for lands identified as part of the City’s greenbelt) or reflect Residential
Suburban or Residential Rural land use designations (refer to section titled “Land Use Designations Outside the LUCE
Planning Sub-area” and Table 2).
Development Standards
State planning law requires general plans to establish “standards of population density and building intensity” for the
various land use designations in the general plan (Government Code Section 65302(a)). To satisfy this requirement, the
General Plan Land Use Element includes such standards for each land use designation appearing on the Land Use
Diagram. Following are explanations of how these standards operate.
Residential Designations
Standards of building density for residential uses are stated as the allowable maximum dwelling units per net acre. In
determining net area, the following types of areas are excluded: sensitive features such as creeks, habitats of rare or
endangered plants and animals, and significant trees; land dedicated in fee to the public for streets or neighborhood
parks.
Non-residential Designations and Mixed Uses
Standards of building intensity for non-residential uses, such commercial and industrial uses, are stated as a range of
floor-area ratios (FARs) that describe allowed development intensity. Dwellings may be provided in non-residential
districts as part of mixed use projects. So long as the floor area ratio for the applicable designation is not exceeded, the
maximum residential density (listed in Table 1 starting on page 24) may be developed in addition to non-residential
development on a site. (See Policy 2.4, Residential Density for policies on density bonuses for affordable housing.)

A FAR is the gross floor area of a building or buildings on a site
divided by the site area. Floor area ratio does not include below
grade or subterranean parking garages and basements or similar
non-conditioned floor space. For example, on a lot with 25,000
square feet of land area, a FAR of 1.00 would allow 25,000
square feet of floor area which, depending on site constraints
and development standards could be distributed on one floor or
several floors. A FAR of 2.00 would allow 50,000 square feet of
floor area and a FAR of 3.0 would allow 75,000 square feet of
building area in this example. The diagram above illustrates
conceptually how buildings of one, two, and four stories could
be developed on a given lot with a FAR of 1.00.
While FAR provides for the overall development size and intensity, it does not specify the form or character of the
building. The guidelines for each designation describe key physical form characteristics envisioned for the designation.
Other City regulations such as Zoning Codes and Community Design Guidelines will guide the form of buildings within a
given FAR range.
Land Use Designations within LUCE Planning Sub-area
The General Plan Land Use Diagram includes residential, commercial, industrial, and other land use designations that
depict the types of land uses that will be allowed within the LUCE Planning Sub-area. Table 1 describes all of the
designations along with their corresponding development intensity standards, as follows:
        Designation. This column provides the name of each designation and the acronym used when referring to this
         designation. To the right of each name is the color that is assigned to this designation on the City’s Land Use
         Diagram.
        Description. In this column is a description of the purpose and application of each designation, followed by a
         general list of types of uses that could be allowed in that designation. The City’s Zoning Regulations provide
         further refinement and expansion of the list of uses allowed on any given property. For any given site, not all
         uses listed may be appropriate for a given property due to location, adjacent uses, other applicable General Plan
         policies, or other site specific issues.
        Density / Intensity. For residential designations, a maximum density is provided, expressed as dwelling units per
         acre (du/ac). For non-residential uses and mixed uses, a maximum FAR is provided.

                               This designation provides for low density residential development having        7 du/ac
                               locations and forms that provide a sense of both individual identity and
 LDR                           neighborhood cohesion for the households occupying them. These dwellings
                               are generally detached, one and two story buildings with private outdoor space
                               separating them from neighboring dwellings.
                               Uses
                                   Single family detached dwellings
                                   Accessory Secondary dwelling units
                                   Public and quasi-public uses (e.g., parks, schools, churches)
                                   Low density development within and adjacent to neighborhoods
                                    committed to this type of development.

                               provide a sense of both individual identity and neighborhood cohesion for the
                               households occupying them, but in a more compact arrangement than Low-
 MDR                           Density Residential. Such dwellings are generally one or two story detached
                               buildings on small lots or attached dwellings with some private outdoor space
                               for each dwelling. This type of development is appropriate as a transition from
                               low density development to higher densities.

Chapter 1
Land Use Designations Outside the LUCE Planning Sub-area
Most of the land within the City’s Greenbelt (see Figure 5 in the Conservation and Open Space Element), but outside the
City limits (unincorporated lands), is designated by the County for Agriculture or Open Space. The City supports these
land use designations and discourages any further subdivision of existing parcels unless such subdivision is expressly part
of strategy to permanently preserve agriculture and/or open space. However, if any new lots are permitted apart from
such a strategy, they should be a minimum of 20 acres in size or greater.
Other portions of the Planning Area located outside of the LUCE Planning Sub-area (unincorporated lands) but within the
City’s Greenbelt include areas that were subdivided under County jurisdiction for low intensity development and are
beyond City services. Residential designations (RR, RS) shall be limited to those areas already largely subdivided and
developed in the County as shown on the City’s Land Use Diagram. Table 2 identifies the City’s land use designations,
along with their corresponding development intensity standards, for these areas. These designations are only used in
unincorporated portions of the Planning Area. The City does not support further subdivision of land within these areas,
generally; however, if any new lots are permitted they should be a minimum 20 acres in size or greater (also see
policies under 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, and 1.10).

                                       1.       GROWTH MANAGEMENT
               As part of the General Plan Update, integrating the concept of sustainability was an important aspect of
               the State grant. In reviewing the General Plan, a number of sustainability practices were already included
               in the General Plan. For existing and new policies and programs that support sustainability, this icon is
               shown at the end of the policy / programs title. See Policy 1.1.1, below, as an example.
                                                        POLICIES
1.1.     Overall Intent
     1.1.1.   Growth Management Objectives
              The City shall manage its growth so that:
              A. The natural environment and air quality will be protected.
              B. The relatively high level of services enjoyed by City residents is maintained or enhanced.
              C. The demand for municipal services does not outpace their availability.
              D. New residents can be assimilated without disrupting the community's social fabric, safety, or established
                   neighborhoods.
              E. Residents' opportunities for direct participation in City government and their sense of community can
                   continue.
     1.1.2.   Development Capacity and Services
              The City shall not designate more land for urban uses than its resources can be expected to support.
1.2.     Urban Separation
         Broad, undeveloped open spaces should separate the City from nearby urban areas. This element establishes a
         final edge for urban development.
1.3.     Build-out Capacity
         There should not be major expansion of the urban reserve line because the urban reserve provides adequate
         capacity for new housing and employment up to the City’s desired maximum. This element seeks to establish an
         ultimate population capacity.
1.4.     Urban Edges Character
         The City shall maintain a clear boundary between San Luis Obispo's urban development and surrounding open
         land. Development just inside the boundary shall provide measures to avoid a stark-appearing edge between
         buildings in the city and adjacent open land. Such measures may include: using new or existing groves or
         windrows of trees, or hills or other landforms, to set the edge of development; increasing the required side-yard
         and rear-yard setbacks; and providing open space or agricultural transition buffers.
1.5.     Jobs/Housing Relationship
         The gap between housing demand (due to more jobs and college enrollment) and supply should not increase.
                                                           Page 1-34

                                                                                      Land Use Element
                                                                                                                 
1.6.     Regional Planning
         The City shall encourage regional planning and growth management throughout the county, and in cooperation
         with neighboring counties and the State.
1.7.     City Size and Expansion
     1.7.1.  Urban Reserve
             The City shall maintain an urban reserve line containing the area around the city where urban development
             might occur (Figure 3, Land Use Diagram).
             Urban uses within this line should only be developed if consistent with City-approved plans. Non-urban
             agricultural, open space, and wildlife corridor uses are also encouraged within the urban reserve, as interim
             or permanent uses shown on City-approved plans.
     1.7.2.  Expansion Areas
             The City shall designate expansion areas adequate for growth consistent with these policies within the urban
             reserve line (Figure 3, Land Use Diagram).
     1.7.3.  Interim Uses
             Expansion areas should be kept in agriculture, compatible with agricultural support services, or open-space
             uses until urban development occurs, unless a City-approved specific plan provides for other interim uses.
1.8.     Greenbelt
         (See also Section 6, Resource Protection)
     1.8.1.  Open Space Protection
             Within the City's planning area and outside the urban reserve line, undeveloped land should be kept open.
             Prime agricultural land, productive agricultural land, and potentially productive agricultural land shall be
             protected for farming. Scenic lands, sensitive wildlife habitat, and undeveloped prime agricultural land shall
             be permanently protected as open space.
     1.8.2.  Greenbelt Uses
             Appropriate greenbelt uses include: watershed; wildlife habitat; grazing; cultivated crops; parks and outdoor
             recreation (with minimal land or landscape alteration, building, lighting, paving, or use of vehicles, so rural
             character is maintained); and home sites surrounded by land of sufficient size and appropriately located with
             respect to topography and vegetation to maintain the open character.
     1.8.3.  Commercial Uses in Greenbelt
             The City shall not allow commercial development within the greenbelt area unless it is clearly incidental to
             and supportive of agriculture or other open space uses.
     1.8.4.  Parcel Sizes and Density
             The City shall discourage the County from creating new parcels within the greenbelt, with the exception of
             those permitted under Policy 1.10. Outside of clusters, allowed parcel sizes within the greenbelt should be no
             less than 10 acres and preferably 20 acres or larger.
     1.8.5.  Building Design and Siting
             All new buildings and structures should be subordinate to and in harmony with the surrounding landscape.
             The City should encourage County adoption of regulations prohibiting new structures on ridge lines or in
             other visually prominent or environmentally sensitive locations, and allowing transfer of development rights
             from one parcel to another in order to facilitate this policy.
                                                          Page 1-35

Chapter 1
     1.8.6.  Wildlife Habitat
             The City shall ensure that continuous wildlife habitat – including corridors free of human disruption - are
             preserved, and, where necessary, created.
     1.8.7.  Trees Outside City Limits
             The City shall preserve significant trees, particularly native species, outside its limits and in the greenbelt on
             lands owned or leased by the City or for which the City has an easement. For other areas in the greenbelt,
             the City will work with the County, Cal Poly, and other public agencies to protect these trees.
1.9.     Prime Agricultural Land
     1.9.1.  Agricultural Protection
             The City shall support preservation of economically viable agricultural operations and land within the urban
             reserve and city limits. The City should provide for the continuation of farming through steps such as
             provision of appropriate general plan designations and zoning.
     1.9.2.  Prime Agricultural Land
             The City may allow development on prime agricultural land if the development contributes to the protection
             of agricultural land in the urban reserve or greenbelt by one or more of the following methods, or an equally
             effective method: acting as a receiver site for transfer of development credit from prime agricultural land of
             equal quantity; securing for the City or for a suitable land conservation organization open space or
             agricultural easements or fee ownership with deed restrictions; helping to directly fund the acquisition of fee
             ownership or open space easements by the City or a suitable land conservation organization. Development of
             small parcels which are essentially surrounded by urbanization need not contribute to agricultural land
             protection.
1.10.    Residential Clustering for Open Space Protection
     1.10.1. Parcel Sizes
             In the greenbelt, the City may allow, and the City shall encourage the County to allow, smaller parcel sizes
             only when:
             A. All new dwellings will be clustered contiguously;
             B. At least 90% of the site area is permanently protected as open space;
             C. Agricultural easements are placed on prime agricultural lands outside the cluster.
     1.10.2. Means of Protection
             The City shall require that open space be preserved either by dedication of permanent easements or transfer
             of fee ownership to the City, the County, or a responsible, nonprofit conservation organization.
     1.10.3. Public Access
             Areas preserved for open space should include public trail access, controlled to protect the natural resources,
             to assure reasonable security and privacy of dwellings, and to allow continuing agricultural operations. Public
             access through production agricultural land will not be considered, unless the owner agrees.
     1.10.4. Design Standards
             The City shall require cluster development to:
             A. Be screened from public views by land forms or vegetation, but not at the expense of habitat. If the
                  visually screened locations contain sensitive habitats or unique resources as defined in the Conservation
                  and Open Space Element, development should be avoided in those areas and instead designed to cluster
                                                           Page 1-36

                                                                                            Land Use Element
                                                                                                                   
                   in the form of vernacular farm building complexes, to blend into the traditional agricultural working
                   landscape.
             B. Be located on other than prime agricultural land and be situated to allow continued agricultural use;
             C. Prohibit building sites and roads within stream corridors and other wetlands, on ridge lines, rock
                   outcrops, or visually prominent or steep hillsides, or other sensitive habitats or unique resources as
                   defined in the Conservation and Open Space Element.
             D. Preserve historic or archaeological resources.
1.11.    Growth Rates & Phasing
     1.11.1. Overall Intent
             The City shall manage the city’s growth rate to provide for the balanced evolution of the community and the
             gradual assimilation of new residents. Growth must be consistent with the City's ability to provide resources
             and services and with State and City requirements for protecting the environment, the economy, and open
             space.
     1.11.2. Residential Growth Rate
             The City shall manage the growth of the city's housing supply so that it does not exceed one percent per year,
             on average, based on thresholds established by Land Use Element Table 3, excluding dwellings affordable to
             residents with extremely low, very low or low incomes as defined by the Housing Element. This rate of
             growth may continue so long as the City's basic service capacity is assured. Table 3 shows the approximate
             number of dwellings and residents which would result from the one percent maximum average annual
             growth rate over the planning period. Approved specific plan areas may develop in accordance with the
             phasing schedule adopted by each specific plan provided thresholds established by Table 3 are not exceeded.
             The City Council shall review the rate of growth on an annual basis in conjunction with the General Plan
             annual report to ensure consistency with the City’s gradual assimilation policy.

     1.11.3. Phasing Residential Expansions
             Before a residential expansion area is developed, the City must have adopted a specific plan or a
             development plan for it. Such plans for residential expansion projects will provide for phased development,
             consistent with the population growth outlined in Table 3, and taking into account expected infill residential
             development.

Chapter 1
    1.11.4. Nonresidential Growth Rate
            Each year, the City Council shall evaluate the actual increase in nonresidential floor area over the preceding
            five years. The Council shall consider establishing limits for the rate of nonresidential development if the
            increase in nonresidential floor area for any five-year period exceeds five percent. Any limits so established
            shall not apply to:
            A. Changed operations or employment levels, or relocation or ownership change, of any business existing
                 within the City at the time the limit is set;
            B. Additional nonresidential floor area within the Downtown core (Figure 4);
            C. Public agencies; and
            D. Manufacturing, light industrial, research businesses, or companies providing a significant number of head
                 of household jobs.
1.12.   Educational and Governmental Facilities Near the City
    1.12.1. Overall Policy
            The City shall continue to communicate with nearby government and educational institutions to address
            proposed changes in numbers of workers, students, or inmates that have the potential to result in significant
            adverse land use or circulation impacts on the City or may negatively influence the City’s ability to manage
            growth.
    1.12.2. Cal Poly
            The City shall encourage Cal Poly not to change its 2001 Master Plan enrollment targets in a way that would
            exceed campus and community resources. The City shall encourage Cal Poly to provide additional on-campus
            housing, enhanced transit service, and other measures to minimize impacts of campus commuting and
            enrollment. Cal Poly should actively engage the community during updates or amendments to the Campus
            Master Plan and fully mitigate impacts to the City, including environmental and quality of life impacts to
            nearby neighborhoods.
    1.12.3. California Men’s Colony
            The City shall continue to communicate and cooperate with the California Men's Colony (CMC) to identify
            resource constraints and to avoid adverse impacts of increased inmate population.
    1.12.4. Cuesta Community College
            The City supports Cuesta College’s efforts to offer courses at satellite campuses, on-line courses, and
            enhanced transit service to avoid housing and commuting impacts of increasing enrollment at Cuesta College.
1.13.   Annexation and Services
    1.13.1. Water and Sewer Service
            The City shall not provide nor permit delivery of City potable water or sewer services to the following areas.
            However, the City will serve those parties having valid previous connections or contracts with the City.
            A. Outside the City limits;
            B. Outside the urban reserve line;
            C. Above elevations reliably served by gravity-flow in the City water system;
            D. Below elevations reliably served by gravity-flow or pumps in the City sewer system.

Chapter 1
  1.13.2. Recycled Water
          Provision of recycled water outside of City limits may only be considered in compliance with Water and
          Wastewater Element Policy A 7.3.4 and the following findings:
          A. Non-potable/recycled water is necessary to support continued agricultural operations.
          B. Provision of non-potable/recycled water will not be used to increase development potential of property
               being served.
          C. Non-potable/recycled water will not be further treated to make it potable.
          D. Prior to provision of non-potable/recycled water, the property to be served will record a conservation,
               open space, Williamson Act, or other easement instrument to maintain the area being served in
               agriculture and open space while recycled water is being provided.
  1.13.3. Annexation Purpose and Timing
          The City may use annexation as a growth management tool, both to enable appropriate urban development
          and to protect open space. Areas within the urban reserve line which are to be developed with urban uses
          should be annexed before urban development occurs. The City may annex an area long before such
          development is to occur, and the City may annex areas which are to remain permanently as open space. An
          area may be annexed in phases, consistent with the city-approved specific plan or development plan for the
          area. Phasing of annexation and development will reflect topography, needed capital facilities and funding,
          open space objectives, and existing and proposed land uses and roads.
  1.13.4. Annexation of Cal Poly
          The City should analyze the cost/benefits of annexing Cal Poly.
  1.13.5. Annexation in Airport Area
          Properties in the Airport Area Specific Plan may only be annexed if they meet the following criteria:
          A. The property is contiguous to the existing city limits; and
          B. The property is within the existing urban reserve line; and
          C. The property is located near to existing infrastructure; and
          D. Existing infrastructure capacity is available to serve the proposed development; and
          E. A development plan for the property belonging to the applicant(s) accompanies the application for
               annexation; and
          F.   The applicant(s) agree to contribute to the cost of preparing the specific plan and constructing area-wide
               infrastructure improvements according to a cost -sharing plan maintained by the City.
  1.13.6. Required Plans
          The City shall not allow development of any newly annexed private land until the City has adopted a specific
          or development plan for land uses, open space protection, roads, utilities, the overall pattern of subdivision,
          and financing of public facilities for the area.
  1.13.7. Development and Services
          The City shall approve development in newly annexed areas only when adequate City services can be
          provided for that development, without reducing the level of public services or increasing the cost of services
          for existing development and for build-out within the City limits.

                                                                                     Land Use Element
                                                                                                               
1.13.8. Open Space
        The City shall require that each annexation help secure permanent protection for areas designated Open
        Space, and for the habitat types and wildlife corridors within the annexation area that are identified in the
        Conservation and Open Space Element. Properties, which are both along the urban reserve line and on
        hillsides, shall dedicate land or easements for about four times the area to be developed (developed area
        includes building lots, roads, parking and other paved areas, and setbacks required by zoning). (See also
        Policy 6.4 and Policies 6.4.1 – 6.4.7). The following standards shall apply to the indicated areas:
        A. Airport Area Specific Plan properties shall secure protection for any on-site resources as identified in the
             Conservation and Open Space Element. These properties, to help maintain the greenbelt, shall also
             secure open space protection for any contiguous, commonly owned land outside the urban reserve. If it
             is not feasible to directly obtain protection for such land, fees in lieu of dedication shall be paid when the
             property is developed, to help secure the greenbelt in the area south of the City's southerly urban
             reserve line.
        B. San Luis Ranch property (outside the city limit and generally bounded by Highway 101 and Madonna
             Road) shall dedicate land or easements for approximately one-half of the ownership that is to be
             preserved as open space.
        C. Foothill Annexation: The northern portion of the Foothill property, and the creek area shall be annexed
             as open space. Development on this site should be clustered or located near Foothill Boulevard, with the
             northern portion of the site and creek area preserved as open space.
1.13.9. Costs of Growth
        The City shall require the costs of public facilities and services needed for new development be borne by the
        new development, unless the community chooses to help pay the costs for a certain development to obtain
        community-wide benefits. The City shall consider a range of options for financing measures so that new
        development pays its fair share of costs of new services and facilities which are required to serve the project
        and which are reasonably related to the new growth attributable to the development.
1.13.10.     Solid Waste Capacity
        In addition to other requirements for adequate resources and services prior to development, the City shall
        require that adequate solid waste disposal capacity exists before granting any discretionary land use approval
        which would increase solid waste generation.
1.13.11.     Plans Summary
        The City will shall provide information to SLOCOG so that it can maintain a current summary of the land use
        plans of all agencies in the county, showing areas designated for urban, rural, and open-space uses, and
        tabulating the capacities for various kinds of uses.
1.13.12.     Regional Growth Management
        The City shall advocate a regional growth-management program, which should include:
        A. Population growth no faster than the statewide average growth rate for the preceding year, and no
             faster than can be sustained by available resources and services, whichever is less.
        B. No significant deterioration in air quality, due to development activities for which local government has
             approval.
        C. Plans for large residential developments to include a range of housing types to provide opportunities for
             residents with very low, low, or moderate incomes.
        D. Voter approval for any significant change from Open Space, Agriculture, or Residential Rural designations
             to another designation.

1.14.   Countywide Planning
    1.14.1. County “RMS”
            The City will monitor reports from the County “resource management system” and advocate adherence to
            that system’s principle of assuring that there will be adequate resources and environmental protection
            before development is approved.
    1.14.2. Regular Coordination Meetings
            The City shall advocate and help arrange quarterly coordination meetings among planning directors of local
            jurisdictions in San Luis Obispo County, SLOCOG, LAFCO, Cal Poly, and APCD to discuss regional issues.
    1.14.3. Project Review
            The City will continue to participate with the County in reviewing and providing input on County projects and
            general plan amendments that have the potential to impact the City or be inconsistent with City policies.
            Significant issues will be referred to the Planning Commission and/or City Council.
    1.14.4. Consistent Plans
            The City shall seek County Board of Supervisors approval amending the County Land Use Element to make it
            consistent with this element within San Luis Obispo's planning area. The City will work with the County during
            updates of the County's plan for the San Luis Obispo planning area.
    1.14.5. City-County Agreement
            The City shall maintain a memorandum of understanding with the County, pledging that neither agency will
            approve a substantial amendment to its plan for San Luis Obispo's planning area without carefully
            considering the comment and recommendation of the other agency. The key feature of the memorandum
            would be the City's acceptance of the planned amount of growth and the County's agreement to not allow
            urban development within the planning area but outside the City.
    1.14.6. Refined Planning Area Map
            The City shall prepare and maintain a Planning Area Map in the General Plan. The City will seek to establish
            and maintain County concurrence for the map, which applies to the City’s Planning Area outside the urban
            reserve, including the City’s sphere of influence. The map will show:
            A. Areas to be kept in permanent open space, including scenic lands, sensitive wildlife habitat, and
                 undeveloped prime agricultural land.
            B. Existing uses other than open space, relatively far from the City's urban reserve line, which may be
                 maintained but which should not be expanded or made more intense, including institutional uses such as
                 California Men's Colony, Camp San Luis Obispo, and Cuesta College, and scattered residential and
                 commercial developments.
            C. Existing uses other than open space which may be considered for inclusion within the urban reserve line
                 during the ten-year updates of this element, such as nearby groups of rural homesites.
            D. Any existing uses other than open space which should be changed, relocated, or removed to allow
                 restoration of the natural landscape or agricultural uses.
    1.14.7. Maintain Development Fee Program
            The City shall maintain a development fee program that covers the costs associated with serving projects
            with City services and facilities. This maintenance will include periodic review of the fees collected to ensure
            they are adequate to cover City costs.

                                           RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS
                                                         POLICIES
2.1.     Neighborhood Focus
         The City shall preserve, protect and enhance the City’s neighborhoods and strive to preserve and enhance their
         identity and promote a higher quality of life within each neighborhood.
2.2.     Neighborhood Protection and Enhancement
     2.2.1.   Neighborhood Identity
              The City shall work with residents to address neighborhood specific issues including enhancing a sense of
              place within neighborhoods.
     2.2.2.   Neighborhood Groups
              The City shall encourage and support the formation and continuation of neighborhood planning groups
              composed of neighborhood residents.
     2.2.3.   Neighborhood Traffic
              Neighborhoods should be protected from intrusive traffic. All neighborhood street and circulation
              improvements should favor pedestrians, bicyclists, and local traffic. Vehicle traffic on residential streets
              should be slow. To foster suitable traffic speed, street design should include measures such as narrow lanes,
              landscaped parkways, traffic circles, textured crosswalks, and, if necessary, stop signs, speed humps, bollards,
              and on-street parking and sidewalks.
     2.2.4.   Neighborhood Connections
              The City shall provide all areas with a pattern of streets, pedestrian network, and bicycle facilities that
              promote neighborhood and community cohesiveness. There should be continuous sidewalks or paths of
              adequate width, connecting neighborhoods with each other and with public and commercial services and
              public open space to provide continuous pedestrian paths throughout the city. Connectivity to nearby
              community facilities (such as parks and schools), open space, and supporting commercial areas shall also be
              enhanced, but shall not be done in a method that would increase cut-through traffic. (See also the Circulation
              Element.)
     2.2.5.   Neighborhood Open Links
              The City shall treat streets, sidewalks, and front setbacks as a continuous open link among all areas of the city
              and with all land uses. These features should be designed as amenities for light, air, social contact, and
              community identity.
     2.2.6.   Neighborhood Characteristics
              The City shall promote livability, quiet enjoyment, and safety for all residents. Characteristics of quality
              neighborhoods vary from neighborhood to neighborhood, but often include one or more of the following
              characteristics:
               A mix of housing type styles, density, and affordability.
               Design and circulation features that create and maintain a pedestrian scale.

Chapter 1
                Nearby services and facilities including schools, parks, retail (e.g., grocery store, drug store), restaurants
                 and cafes, and community centers or other public facilities.
                A tree canopy and well-maintained landscaping.
                A sense of personal safety (e.g., low crime rate, short police and emergency response times).
                Convenient access to public transportation.
                Well-maintained housing and public facilities.
     2.2.7.   Neighborhood Enhancement
              The City shall promote infill development, redevelopment, rehabilitation, and adaptive reuse efforts that
              contribute positively to existing neighborhoods and surrounding areas.
2.3.     Residential Location, Uses, and Design
     2.3.1.   Mixed Uses and Convenience
              The City shall promote a mix of compatible uses in neighborhoods to serve the daily needs of nearby
              residents, including schools, parks, churches, and convenience retail stores. Neighborhood shopping and
              services should be available within about one mile of all dwellings. When nonresidential, neighborhood-
              serving uses are developed, existing housing shall be preserved and new housing added where possible. If
              existing dwellings are removed for such uses, the development shall include replacement dwellings (no net
              loss of residential units).
     2.3.2.   Separation and Buffering
              The City shall seek to protect Residential areas from incompatible and detrimental non-residential activities
              and facilities.
     2.3.3.   Residential Next to Non-residential
              In designing development at the boundary between residential and non-residential uses, the City shall make
              protection of a residential atmosphere the first priority.
     2.3.4.   Street Access
              The City shall ensure new residential development and redevelopment involving large sites are designed to
              orient low-density housing to local access streets, and medium- or high-density housing to driveways
              accessible from collector streets. Major arterials through residential areas shall provide only limited private
              access or controlled street intersections.
     2.3.5.   Neighborhood Pattern
              The City shall require that all new residential development be integrated with existing neighborhoods. Where
              physical features make this impossible, the new development should create new neighborhoods.
     2.3.6.   Housing and Businesses
              The City shall encourage mixed use projects, where appropriate and compatible with existing and planned
              development on the site and with adjacent and nearby properties. The City shall support the location of
              mixed use projects and community and neighborhood commercial centers near major activity nodes and
              transportation corridors / transit opportunities where appropriate.
     2.3.7.   Natural Features
              The City shall require residential developments to preserve and incorporate as amenities natural site
              features, such as land forms, views, creeks, wetlands, wildlife habitats, wildlife corridors, and plants.
                                                            Page 1-44

                                                                               Land Use Element
                                                                                                         
2.3.8. Parking
       The City shall discourage the development of large parking lots and require parking lots be screened from
       street views. In general, parking should not be located between buildings and public streets.
2.3.9. Compatible Development
       The City shall require that new housing built within an existing neighborhood be sited and designed to be
       compatible with the character of the neighborhood. Compatibility for all development shall be evaluated
       using the following criteria:
       A. Front Setback Patterns
           New development shall match the typical range of setbacks used in areas adjacent to the project.
       B. Landscaping
           New development shall repeat or enhance the landscaping provided in parkway areas (if any exist) along
           street frontages.
       C. Rhythm of Development
           New development shall reflect the rhythm of existing development in the area including features such as
           setbacks and façade widths along the front setback. Larger structures, such as multi-family (as allowed
           by the General Plan land use designation for the site) should replicate the spacing of structural
           components along the street frontage.
       D. Street Orientation
           New development shall match the general orientation of existing residential structures in the adjacent
           area and shall provide an inviting façade facing public streets.
       E. Architecture
           Architectural compatibility will be assessed based on a combination of factors, including height, scale,
           mass, form and architectural style. Desired outcome is a smooth transition between existing and
           proposed development, supporting a quality neighborhood.
       F.  Privacy and Solar Access
           New buildings will respect the privacy and solar access of neighboring buildings and outdoor areas,
           particularly where multistory buildings or additions may overlook backyards of adjacent dwellings. (See
           also the City’s Conservation and Open Space Element.)
       G. Preservation of Natural, Historic and Cultural Features
           New development shall:
           (a) Respect historic context
           (b) Maintain mature trees on-site to the maximum extent feasible
           (c) Protect stream corridors and natural drainages
       H. Housing Diversity
           A mix of housing types, and a range of density within an area is generally desirable (see also Policy 2.2.6).
       I.  Parking
           New development:
           (a) Outside of the Downtown In-lieu Parking Fee Area, new development will be required to provide
                 adequate off-street parking to match the intended use.
           (b) For multi-family, parking shall be sited and designed to minimize the visual impact from the public
                 street.

Chapter 1
     2.3.10. Site Constraints
             The City shall require new residential developments to respect site constraints such as property size and
             shape, ground slope, access, creeks and wetlands, wildlife habitats, wildlife corridors, native vegetation, and
             significant trees.
     2.3.11. Residential Project Objectives
             Residential projects should provide:
             A. Privacy, for occupants and neighbors of the project;
             B. Adequate usable outdoor area, sheltered from noise and prevailing winds, and oriented to receive light
                  and sunshine
             C. Use of natural ventilation, sunlight, and shade to make indoor and outdoor spaces comfortable with
                  minimum mechanical support.
             D. Pleasant views from and toward the project;
             E. Security and safety.
             F.   Bicycle facilities consistent with the City’s Bicycle Plan;
             G. Adequate parking and storage space;
             H. Noise and visual separation from adjacent roads and commercial uses. (Barrier walls, isolating a project,
                  are not desirable. Noise mitigation walls may be used only when there is no practicable alternative.
                  Where walls are used, they should help create an attractive pedestrian, residential setting through
                  features such as setbacks, changes in alignment, detail and texture, places for people to walk through
                  them at regular intervals, and planting.)
             I.   Design elements that facilitate neighborhood interaction, such as front porches, front yards along
                  streets, and entryways facing public walkways.
             J.   Buffers from hazardous materials transport routes, as recommended by the City Fire Department.
     2.3.12. Non-Residential Activities
             Residential areas may accommodate limited non-residential activities which generally have been compatible,
             such as child day care, elementary schools, churches, and home businesses meeting established criteria.
2.4.     Residential Density
     2.4.1.  Density Categories
             The following residential density categories are established in Table 1 within LUCE Planning Sub-area, and
             Table 2 for areas outside the LUCE Planning Sub-area but within the City’s Planning Area. For planning
             studies conducted, Table 4 provides a typical population density for each residential land use designation.
             Residential density is expressed as the number of dwellings per acre of net site area within the designation.
             In determining net area, the following types of areas are excluded: sensitive features such as creeks, habitats
             of rare or endangered plants and animals, and significant trees; land dedicated in fee to the public for streets
             or neighborhood parks.
             For the categories other than Agriculture/Open Space, Residential Rural, Residential Suburban, and Low-
             Density Residential, densities are expressed in terms of a standard two-bedroom dwelling. This approach is
             intended to achieve population densities approximately like those indicated. More or fewer dwellings having
             different bedroom counts may be built depending on the number of people expected to live in a project, as
             indicated by the number of bedrooms. The population-density assumptions also apply to group residential
             facilities. (For allowed residential development in non-residential designations, see Table 1.)

1    This table is intended to reflect average population estimates to be expected with each designation and does not reflect densities the City
     is striving to achieve.
     2.4.2.      Density Bonuses
                 The City shall approve a density bonus for projects that:
                 A. Provide a receiving site, within expansion areas or the downtown commercial core only, for development
                      credit transferred to protect open space;
                 B. Include affordable housing for seniors or lower income households consistent with the requirements of
                      State Law.
     2.4.3.      Density and Site Constraints
                 The allowed density of residential development shall decrease as slope increases. The City may require a
                 residential project to have fewer units than generally allowed for its density category (Table 4), upon finding
                 that the maximum density would have adverse environmental impacts or cause significant adverse impacts
                 on the health, safety, or welfare of future residents of the site, neighbors, or the public generally.
2.5.       Residential Land Protection
     2.5.1.      Boundary Adjustments
                 The City may adjust land-use boundaries in a way that would reduce land designated as residential, only if:
                 A. A significant, long-term neighborhood or citywide need, which outweighs the preference to retain
                      residential capacity, will be met, and;
                 B. The need is best met at the proposed location and no comparable alternative exists.
                                                                   Page 1-47
Chapter 1
     2.5.2. Density Changes
            The City shall approve re-zonings that increase density in existing residential areas only if it finds that the
            following are not adversely impacted: neighborhood character and identity; compatibility of land use; impact
            on level of services and facilities (including schools). In addition, the City shall find that proposed density
            changes meet policies related to neighborhood amenities (Policy 2.2.6); compatible development
            (Policy 2.3.9) and residential project objectives (Policy 2.3.11).
     2.5.3. Residential Conversion
            The City shall approve proposals to convert residential properties along major streets to office or commercial
            uses only when there already is a substantial non-residential character to the corridor, the proposal is
            compatible with the surrounding land use, and adequate off-street parking can be provided. Where
            appropriate, replacement dwellings shall be provided as part of the project.
2.6.     Student and Campus Housing
     2.6.1. Cal Poly
            The City shall encourage Cal Poly to build housing on campus for all of its students, to the extent feasible.
            On-campus housing should be expanded at least as fast as enrollment increases. Consideration shall be given
            for housing for faculty and staff as student enrollment increases.
     2.6.2. Cuesta College
            The City shall encourage Cuesta College to facilitate student housing off-campus and close to transit and
            bicycle connections. The City shall discourage on-campus residential development due to environmental
            sensitivity of the Chorro watershed and the lack of other services near the Cuesta campus.
     2.6.3. Amenities
            The City shall encourage development of attractive multifamily housing likely to be occupied by students to
            provide the amenities that students may otherwise seek in single-family areas.
     2.6.4. Location
            The City shall encourage the development of housing likely to attract faculty, staff, and students to locate
            close to Cal Poly. The City shall work with Cal Poly to facilitate faculty and staff owning or renting housing in
            adjacent neighborhoods.
     2.6.5. Fraternities & Sororities
            The City shall work with Cal Poly to develop a proposal to locate fraternities and sororities on campus for
            consideration by the CSU Board. If locations on campus cannot be provided, fraternities and sororities should
            be limited to medium-high and high-density residential areas near the campus.
2.7.     Group Housing
     2.7.1. Large Group Housing
            The City shall not approve large group housing in areas designated low density residential. They may be
            located, but not concentrated, in medium-density residential areas. They may be concentrated in medium-
            high or high-density residential areas, or in suitable commercial or light-industrial areas, where services are
            convenient. Each large group housing proposal shall be evaluated through use-permit review.
     2.7.2. Small Residential Care Facilities
            The City shall continue to treat small residential care facilities the same as individual houses.
                                                            Page 1-48

2.8. Downtown
        In Downtown residential areas (Figure 4), the City should encourage the rehabilitation and maintenance of
        existing housing. Additional dwellings may be permitted, in keeping with density limits, provided that the
        existing character of the area is not significantly changed. Demolition of structurally sound dwellings shall be
        strongly discouraged.
2.9. Reduced Automobile Dependence in Downtown
        The City shall encourage the development of Downtown housing that minimizes the need for automobile use
        and minimizes the storage of vehicles in surrounding neighborhoods.

2.10.   Updating & Enforcing Standards
    2.10.1. Enforcing Standards
            The City shall review, revise if deemed necessary, and actively enforce noise, parking, and property-
            development and property-maintenance standards.
    2.10.2. Property Maintenance Standards
            The City shall implement, and regularly review and update property-maintenance regulations focused on
            proper enclosure of trash, appearance of yards and buildings from the street, and storage of vehicles.
2.11.   Multifamily Preferences and Standards
    2.11.1. Preferences
            The City shall evaluate student housing preferences and consider revising development standards to better
            meet them in multifamily housing near campus.
    2.11.2. Multifamily Open Space and Storage Standards
            The City shall review, and revise, if deemed desirable, its standards for multifamily housing so that
            apartments will provide usable open space and storage similar to the requirements for condominiums.
2.12.   Downtown Residential Development
            The City shall adopt special development standards to guide addition of dwellings within Downtown
            residential areas (Figure 4), to implement Policy 2.8. The following should be included when evaluating new
            standards for this area:
            A. Requirements that new dwellings on lots with existing houses be above or behind the existing houses,
                 and that the added building area be modestly sized and of similar architecture in comparison with the
                 principal residences on the site and in the surrounding area;
            B. Requiring new buildings to reflect the mass and spacing of existing, nearby buildings;
            C. Requiring special parking and coverage standards;
            D. Requiring minimum amounts of usable open space.
2.13.   Neighborhood Compatibility
            The City will consider new regulations, for Low-Density and Medium-Density Residential areas, to require
            special review for (1) incompatibly large houses, (2) replacement or infill homes in existing neighborhoods,
            and (3) accessory buildings with plumbing facilities allowing easy conversion to illegal second dwellings. The
            City will periodically update Community Design Guidelines for larger homes, infill housing and accessory
            single-story buildings.
2.14.   Neighborhood Wellness Action Plans
            To help residents preserve and enhance their neighborhoods, the City shall:
            A. Work with residents that request assistance to prepare neighborhood plans that empower them to
                 shape their neighborhoods;
            B. Help devise strategies to help stabilize the rental/owner ratio, to maintain neighborhood character,
                 safety, and stability;
                                                           Page 1-50

          C. Help identify neighborhood problems, and undertake a wide range of focused development-review,
              capital-improvement, and code-enforcement efforts;
          D. Encourage the formation of voluntary neighborhood groups, so residents can become involved early in
              the development review process;
          E. Involve residents early in reviewing proposed public and private projects that could have neighborhood
              impacts, by notifying residents and property owners and holding meetings at convenient times and
              places within the neighborhoods.
          F.  Provide appropriate staff support, and train all staff to be sensitive to issues of neighborhood protection
              and enhancement.
2.15. Residential Densities
          The City will evaluate alternatives to the current maximum number of dwelling units per acre (based on
          bedroom count) and height, parking, and setback standards, to regulate residential building intensity, and
          bulk and mass. Floor area limits will be considered.
2.16. Use of Downtown Parking by Residents
          The City shall evaluate the potential to use portions of City-owned parking lots and structures for residents’
          parking.
2.17. Off-Setting Vehicle Needs for Downtown Residents
          The City shall require new housing projects in the Downtown area to provide residents with information and
          services to off-set vehicle needs, such as providing transit passes, providing space for hourly car rental
          services, and providing on-site bicycle storage facilities.
2.18. Fees for Parking Expansion Downtown
          The City shall evaluate the potential for development fees to fund new parking spaces in an additional
          parking structure for residents of new housing projects in the Downtown core.

                                                        POLICIES
3.1.     Commercial Siting
     3.1.1. Slope
            Commercial and industrial uses should be developed in appropriate areas where the natural slope of the land
            is less than ten percent.
     3.1.2. Access
            The City shall require that commercial and industrial uses have access from arterial and collector streets, and
            be designed and located to avoid increasing traffic on residential streets.
     3.1.3. Residential Area
            Except for neighborhood-oriented services and commercial uses, the City shall prohibit the expansion of
            commercial centers and industrial uses into adjacent residential areas.
3.2.     General Retail
     3.2.1. Locations for Regional Attractions
            The City should focus its retailing with regional draw in the locations of downtown, the area around the
            intersection of Madonna Road and Highway 101, and the area around Highway 101 and Los Osos Valley
            Road.
     3.2.2. Specialty Store Locations
            The City shall direct most specialty retail stores to locate in the Downtown Core, in the Madonna Road area,
            or the Los Osos Valley Road area, and in other community shopping areas identified by the Community
            Commercial district (see the Community Commercial section) where they will not detract from the role of the
            Downtown Core as the City's primary concentration of specialty stores; some may also be in neighborhood
            shopping centers so long as they are a minor part of the centers and serve neighborhood rather than citywide
            or regional markets.
3.3.     Neighborhood Commercial
     3.3.1. New or Expanded Areas of Neighborhood Commercial Use
            The City shall provide for new or expanded areas of neighborhood commercial uses that:
            A. Are created within, or extended into, nonresidential areas adjacent to residential neighborhoods;
            B. Provide uses to serve nearby residents, not the whole city;
            C. Have access from arterial streets, and not increase traffic on residential streets;
            D. Have safe and pleasant pedestrian access from the surrounding service area, as well as good internal
                 circulation;
                                                           Page 1-52
                                                                                         Land Use Element
             E. Are designed to be pedestrian-oriented, and architecturally compatible with the adjacent neighborhoods
                  being served. Pedestrian-oriented features of project design should include:
                         i. Off-street parking areas located to the side or rear of buildings rather than between buildings
                            and the street;
                        ii. Landscaped areas with public seating; and
                      iii. Indoor or outdoor space for public use, designed to provide a focus for some neighborhood
                            activities.
     3.3.2.  Expanding Existing Neighborhood Commercial Areas
             The City shall evaluate the need for and desirability of additions to existing areas of neighborhood
             commercial use only when specific development proposals are made, and not in response to rezoning
             requests which do not incorporate a development plan.
     3.3.3.  Stores in Residential Areas
             The City shall allow for the continuation of small, individual stores within established residential areas if they
             are compatible with surrounding uses. Other isolated commercial uses that are not compatible with
             residential surroundings eventually should be replaced with compatible uses.
     3.3.4.  Neighborhood Uses
             The City shall rezone to Neighborhood Commercial existing Service Commercial sites which have become
             neighborhood convenience centers, if: (1) they primarily serve a neighborhood rather than citywide market;
             and (2) they are appropriately located considering access and compatibility with other nearby uses.
3.4.     Community Commercial
     3.4.1.  Office Uses
             The City may allow certain office uses with limited need for access to Downtown government services to be
             located away from the Downtown in areas designated Community Commercial. Appropriate types of offices
             include those that provide direct "over-the-counter" services to customers and clients. Professional offices,
             and those identified by the Zoning Regulations as "production and administrative" offices may also be
             appropriate, particularly above the ground floor.
3.5.     Offices
     3.5.1.  Office Locations
             A. All types of offices are appropriate in the Downtown General Retail district, but are discouraged at street
                  level in storefronts of the commercial core.
             B. All types of office activities are appropriate in the Office district which surrounds the Downtown
                  commercial area, though offices needing very large buildings or generating substantial traffic may not be
                  appropriate in the area which provides a transition to residential neighborhoods.
             C. Medical services should be near the hospitals, and may also be located in other commercial areas of the
                  City.
             D. Government social services and the regional offices of state and federal agencies should be near the
                  intersections of South Higuera Street, Prado Road, and Highway 101 (Figure 5);
             E. Offices having no substantial public visitation or need for access to Downtown government services may
                  be in Services and Manufacturing districts.

                                                                                       Land Use Element
            F.   Certain business and professional services having no substantial public visitation or limited need for
                 access to Downtown government services may be in Services and Manufacturing districts. Examples of
                 such uses are computer services, utilities engineering and administration, architects and engineers,
                 industrial design, advertising, building contractors, labor and fraternal organizations, and insurance and
                 financial services that do not directly serve retail customers.
            G. Certain business and professional services with limited need for access to Downtown government
                 services may be located in areas that are away from the Downtown, and designated Community
                 Commercial. Appropriate types of offices include those that provide direct "over-the-counter" services to
                 customers and clients. Professional offices may also be appropriate, particularly above the ground floor.
     3.5.2. Offices Outside Designated Areas
            The City may allow continuation and minor expansion of existing office buildings outside the areas described
            in Policy 3.5.1 if they:
            A. Have access directly from collector or arterial streets, not local residential streets;
            B. Will not significantly increase traffic in residential areas;
            C. Will not have significant adverse impacts on nearby uses.
3.6.     Tourist Commercial Uses
            (For information on Tourist Commercial land use designation, see Table 1.)
     3.6.1. Basis for Tourism
            The City shall promote San Luis Obispo as an attractive place for short-term stays, as well as an attractive
            destination for long-term visitors featuring its community character, natural qualities, historic resources, and
            its educational and cultural facilities. The City should emphasize conference and visitor-serving facilities
            which have a low impact upon the environment and upon existing land forms and landscapes, and which
            provide low-impact visitor activities and low-impact means of transportation.
     3.6.2. Locations
            The City shall encourage integration of visitor-serving uses with other types of uses, including overnight
            accommodations Downtown, near the airport, and near the train station; small-scale facilities (such as
            hostels or bed-and-breakfast places) may be located in Medium-High Density Residential and High-Density
            Residential Districts, where compatible. Visitor-serving uses are especially appropriate where such uses have
            already concentrated: along upper Monterey Street; at the Madonna Road area; at certain freeway
            interchanges; and in the Downtown.
3.7.     Services
     3.7.1. General Retail and Neighborhood Commercial Uses
            The City shall not allow new specialty stores, department stores, or neighborhood commercial centers to be
            developed in Service and Manufacturing-designated areas. However, existing uses such as supermarkets and
            drugstores may be expanded if:
            A. They are compatible with nearby uses;
            B. The expanded use will not divert trade from other general-retail or neighborhood-commercial areas
                 which are better located to serve the expected market area.
     3.7.2. Access
            The City shall require access to Service and Manufacturing areas be provided by commercial collector streets,
            to avoid customer traffic on residential streets or delivery routes which pass through residential areas.
            Driveway access onto arterial streets should be minimized.

Chapter 1
     3.7.3. Air & Water Quality
            Industries locating or expanding in San Luis Obispo shall comply with all applicable air-quality and water-
            quality regulations.
     3.7.4. Utility Service
            The City shall require Services and Manufacturing uses to connect to the City water and sewer systems,
            unless other means of providing service are identified in a City-adopted plan.
     3.7.5. Vehicle Sales
            A. Auto Park Way / Calle Joaquin
                 The City shall encourage an easily accessible and attractive auto sales and service center around Auto
                 Park Way and adjacent areas along Calle Joaquin (Figure 6).
            B. Other Areas
                 Auto sales in areas of the city other than Auto Park Way / Calle Joaquin should be minimized in order to
                 reinforce the auto sales center and to maximize space for other uses in other locations.
     3.7.6. Auto Sales Relocation
            The City shall provide incentives to encourage relocation of vehicle sales to compatible areas.
3.8.     Overall
     3.8.1. Dependent Care
            The City shall offer incentives to new development for provision of child care and elder care for employees.
     3.8.2. Convenience Facilities
            The City shall allow convenience facilities serving daily needs, such as small food stores, branch banks, and
            child and elder care, and amenities such as picnic areas, in centers of employment. Space for such amenities
            may be required within large commercial and industrial developments.
     3.8.3. Neighborhood Centers
            The City shall identify suitable sites for new or expanded neighborhood centers as it prepares specific plans
            and development plans.
     3.8.4. Commercial Revitalization
            The City shall encourage the revitalization, upgrading, and beautification of commercial retail centers and
            conversion of strip commercial area to coordinated, complementary retail and service uses, and where
            appropriate, provision of housing on upper floors.
     3.8.5. Mixed Uses
            The City encourages compatible mixed uses in commercial districts.
     3.8.6. Tourism
            The City shall:
            A. Encourage development of additional conference and meeting space;
            B. Work with the City’s art community in promoting arts oriented tourism;
            C. Develop concepts such as rail tours, historical tours, and bicycle tours; and
            D. Encourage development of appropriate recreational facilities for bicycles, golf, tennis, equestrian
                 activities, soccer, swimming, fishing, and eco-tourism.

                                                  4.       DOWNTOWN
“Downtown” is the area generally bounded by Highway 101, the railroad, and High Street (Figure 4). It embraces
residential neighborhoods and touches five historic districts, as well as the “Downtown Commercial Core” and civic area,
and less intensely developed commercial and office areas. The City has approved "A Conceptual Physical Plan for the City's
Center," as an advisory document, which covers an area nearly the same as the core identified in this element. This
separately published plan guides City review of development in the Downtown.
                                                         POLICIES
4.1.     Downtown’s Role
             Downtown is the community’s urban center serving as the cultural, social, entertainment, and political center
             of the City for its residents, as well as home for those who live in its historic neighborhoods. The City wants
             its urban core to be economically healthy, and realizes that private and public investments in the Downtown
             support each other. Downtown should also provide a wide variety of professional and government services,
             serving the region as well as the city. The commercial core is a preferred location for retail uses that are
             suitable for pedestrian access, off-site parking, and compact building spaces. Civic, cultural and commercial
             portions of Downtown should be a major tourist destination. Downtown's visitor appeal should be based on
             natural, historical, and cultural features, retail services, entertainment and numerous and varied visitor
             accommodations.
4.2.     Downtown Residential
             Downtown is not only a commercial district, but also a neighborhood. Its residential uses contribute to the
             character of the area, allow a 24-hour presence which enhances security and help the balance between jobs
             and housing in the community.
     4.2.1.  Existing and New Dwellings
             The City shall use the following when evaluating development in the Downtown area:
             A. Existing residential uses within and around the commercial core should be protected, and new ones
                  should be developed.
             B. Dwellings should be provided for a variety of households.
             C. Dwellings should be interspersed with commercial uses.
             D. All new, large commercial projects should include residential uses.
             E. Commercial core properties may serve as receiver sites for transfer of development credits, thereby
                  having higher residential densities than otherwise allowed (see Policies 6.4.5 and 6.4.6).
     4.2.2.  Dwellings and Offices
             The City shall continue to ensure that there is no net loss of residential units in Downtown.
4.3.     Entertainment and Cultural Facilities
             Cultural facilities, such as museums and galleries should be Downtown. Entertainment facilities, such as
             nightclubs and theaters shall be in the Downtown.
                                                            Page 1-59

Chapter 1
4.4.  Public Gatherings
          Downtown should have spaces to accommodate public meetings, seminars, classes, socialization and similar
          activities in conjunction with other uses. Downtown should provide a setting which is festive and
          comfortable for public gatherings.
4.5.  Walking Environment
          The City shall plan and manage Downtown to include safe, interesting places for walking and pleasant places
          for sitting. To this end:
          A. Mid-block walkways, courtyards, and interior malls should be well lit and integrated with new and
               remodeled buildings, while preserving continuous building faces on most blocks.
          B. Downtown streets should provide adequate space for pedestrians.
          C. There should be a nearly continuous tree canopy along sidewalks, and planters should provide additional
               foliage and flowers near public gathering areas.
          D. Public Art should be placed along pedestrian paths.
          E. Traffic calming and pedestrian safety should be enhanced, where appropriate, through such features as
               road tables, pavement changes, bulb outs and scramble intersection signals.
          F.   Landscaping should mitigate harsh micro-climates.
4.6.  Commercial Activity in Civic Buildings
          Civic buildings shall incorporate commercial activity at the street level where appropriate.
4.7.  Street-Level Diversity
          City shall promote a healthy mix of downtown street-level businesses that emphasizes retail stores, specialty
          shops and food service rather than bars or taverns.
4.8.  Downtown as Focal Point
          The Downtown should remain the focus for nighttime entertainment, cultural events and related activities. It
          should be a pleasant and safe place at all times.
4.9.  Public Safety
          The City shall ensure that indoor and outdoor public spaces are designed to be observable from frequently
          occupied or traveled places, to enhance public safety.
4.10. Open Places and Views
          The City shall enhance the Downtown to include carefully located open places where people can rest and
          enjoy views of the surrounding hills; and outdoor spaces where people are completely separated from
          vehicle traffic, in addition to Mission Plaza. Opportunities include extensions of Mission Plaza, a few new
          plazas, and selected street closures.
4.11. Downtown Green Space
          The City shall increase Downtown green space and public parks, including pocket parks and parklets, as the
          number of people living Downtown increases.
4.12. Traffic in Residential Areas
          The City shall strive to protect Downtown residential areas from cut-through traffic.

                                                                                        Land Use Element
4.13.   Street Changes
            Street widening and realignment should be avoided.
4.14.   Parking
            The City shall ensure there is a diversity of parking opportunities in the Downtown. Any major increments in
            parking supply should take the form of structures, located at the edges of the commercial core, so people can
            walk rather than drive between points within the core. Retail uses outside the core, and professional office
            developments, may have on-site parking for customers and clients.
4.15.   San Luis Obispo Creek
            The City shall protect San Luis Obispo Creek and restore it, provided this can be done in a manner that
            minimizes human impact on creek life. Walking paths along the creek in the Downtown core should be
            provided and extended as links in an urban trail system, provided this will not further degrade wildlife habitat
            value of the riparian ecosystem. As properties that have encroaching buildings are redeveloped, the City
            should enforce a reasonable building setback from the riparian zone. (See also Natural Communities Section
            in the Conservation and Open Space Element and Flooding Section in the Safety Element) Opportunities to
            open covered sections of the creek should be pursued.
4.16.   Building Conservation and Compatibility
            The City shall ensure that architecturally and historically significant buildings are preserved and restored and
            that new buildings are compatible with architecturally and historically significant buildings, but not
            necessarily the same style.
4.17.   New Buildings and Views
            Downtown development nearby publicly-owned gathering places shall respect views of the hills.. In other
            locations Downtown, views will be provided parallel to the street right-of-way, at intersections where
            building separation naturally makes more views available, and at upper-level viewing decks.
4.18.   Noise
            Obtrusive sounds, including traffic noises and loud music, should be minimized. Desired activities which are
            noisy should be timed to avoid conflict with other desired activities which need a quiet setting.
4.19.   Sense of Place
            To keep the commercial core's sense of place and appeal for walking, it should remain compact and be the
            City's most intensely developed area.
4.20.   Design Principles
            The following principles should guide construction and changes of use within the commercial core.
    4.20.1. Street Level Activities
            The street level should be occupied by stores, restaurants, and other uses benefiting from and contributing to
            pedestrian traffic, such as offices with frequent client visits. Stores and restaurants may occupy upper levels.
            Offices not having frequent client visits should be located above street level.
    4.20.2. Upper Floor Dwellings
            Existing residential uses shall be preserved and new ones encouraged above the street level. This new
            housing will include a range of options and affordability levels.
    4.20.3. Continuous Storefront
            There should be a continuous storefront along sidewalks, at the back of the sidewalk, except for the
            Courthouse and City Hall blocks, plazas, recessed building entries, and sidewalk cafes.
                                                           Page 1-61
Chapter 1
    4.20.4. Building Height
            New buildings shall fit within the context and scale of existing development, shall respect views from, or
            sunlight to, publicly-owned gathering places such as Mission Plaza, and should be stepped back above the
            second or third level to maintain a street façade that is consistent with the historic pattern of development.
            Generally, new buildings should not exceed 50 feet in height. Tall buildings (50-75 feet) shall be designed to
            achieve multiple policy objectives, including design amenities, housing and retail land uses, such as:
            A. Publicly accessible, open viewing spaces at the upper levels
            B. Housing affordability in excess of the Inclusionary Housing Requirement
            C. Energy efficiency beyond State mandated requirements
            D. Adaptive reuse of a historical resource in a manner consistent with the Secretary of the Interior’s
                 Standards for Rehabilitation
            E. High residential density (e.g. above 24 units per acre) achieved by a concentration of smaller dwelling
                 units
            F.   Street level features such as a public plaza, public seating and/or public art
            G. Provide midblock or other significant pedestrian connections
            H. Increased retail floor area, including multi-story retail
            I.   Directly implements specific and identifiable City objectives, as set forth in the General Plan, the
                 Conceptual Plan for the City’s Center, the Downtown Strategic Plan and other key policy documents
            J.   Receiving Transfer of Development Credits for open space protection or historic preservation
            K. Proximity of housing to convenient transit connections
    4.20.5. Building Width
            New buildings should maintain the historic pattern of storefront widths.
    4.20.6. Sidewalk Appeal
            Street facades, particularly at the street level, should include windows, signs, and architectural details which
            can be appreciated by people on the sidewalks.
4.21.   Government Offices
            City Hall and the County Government Center should remain at their present locations. Additional local
            government administrative office space which cannot be accommodated within the existing city and county
            properties should be developed nearby within the Downtown. (See also Section 5, Public and Cultural
            Facilities policies).
4.22.   Commercial Buildings Outside the Core
            In General Retail areas adjacent to the commercial core, the pattern of buildings in relation to the street
            should become more like the core, with shared driveways and parking lots, and no street or side-yard
            setbacks (except for recessed entries and courtyards). Buildings should not exceed 45 feet in height.
4.23.   Safety and Crime Prevention through Environmental Design
            The City shall ensure that new development is designed and constructed to address public safety and
            welfare.

4.24. Updating Downtown Concept Plan
          The City shall update the Downtown Concept Plan by 2016 and shall regularly update the plan as required to
          address significant changes in or affecting the Downtown area including the opportunity for meaningful
          public input.
4.25. Implementing the Downtown Concept Plan
          The City shall consider features of "A Conceptual Physical Plan for the City’s Center" (Downtown Concept
          Plan) in the approval of projects in the Downtown, recognizing that the plan is a concept and is intended to
          be flexible.
4.26. Visual Resource Study
          The City shall undertake a study of visual resources within the Downtown core area to identify potential
          locations for new public-owned open places with access to views of important scenic resources. The City will
          consider acquisition of one or more of these open places as resources permit. A range of options for
          property acquisition, including development agreements, will be considered, consistent with the City’s fiscal
          policies and objectives.
4.27. Expansion of Downtown Plaza
          The City shall explore the full or partial closure and re-design of the following street segments to effectively
          extend, either permanently or for special events, Mission Plaza on:
          A. Broad Street between Palm and Monterey Streets, and
          B. Monterey Street between the two connections with Broad Street.
4.28. Allowing Efficiency Units and Variable Density in Downtown
          The City shall modify zoning regulations to allow efficiency units and variable density in the Downtown Core.
4.29. Coordination on Late Night Environment
          The City shall work with the Downtown businesses and residents, the BID, and Chamber of Commerce to
          manage impacts from downtown drinking establishments, and if necessary, enact additional regulations to
          ensure that the late night environment in and near Downtown is safe and pleasant.
4.30. Master Plan for San Luis Obispo Creek
          The City shall develop a master plan for San Luis Obispo Creek in the Downtown area.
4.31. Inventory of Downtown Uses
          The City shall prepare an inventory of uses in the Downtown Core. Particular attention shall be given to
          identifying uses at the street level as these uses directly impact the pedestrian experience and vibrancy of the
          Downtown. This information shall be used to target business support and attraction to achieve a desirable
          mix of uses in the Downtown.
4.32. Use Permit Requirements
          The City shall incorporate into its zoning regulations specific criteria for evaluating use permits for
          bars/taverns, night clubs and late night drinking establishments.

Chapter 1
4.33. Modify Community Design Guidelines to Address Safety and Crime Prevention
         The City will modify its Community Design Guidelines to enhance Safety and Crime Prevention through
         Environmental Design. Changes shall include, but are not limited to, inclusion of design statements on:
         A. Enhanced lighting of building alcoves in Downtown area
         B. Wayfinding signs to better direct pedestrians and motorists in non-residential areas
         C. Visibility into entry and access points on non-residential buildings
         D. Design solutions that minimize the potential for graffiti

         The City, working with the Downtown Association, businesses, landlords, and residents will consider
         emergency callboxes at strategic locations in the Downtown.
4.35. Enhanced Lighting in Downtown
         The City working with the Downtown Association, Downtown businesses and residents shall develop a
         program to encourage lighted storefronts and street frontages throughout the night.
4.36. Specific Plans to Address Public Safety Through Design
         All specific plans shall identify design features utilized to enhance public safety.
4.37. Nighttime Safety Audit
         The City shall conduct a nighttime safety audit of key areas of the City to see where deficiencies in
         environmental design may exist and should be improved. Key Areas should be defined as areas experiencing
         higher crime than City average by SLOPD.

                                                          Page 1-65

Chapter 1
     5.1.6.  Other Government Functions
             Some government functions which have been provided at certain locations in the City should be located close
             to related activities, though they should not be bound to any one of the identified centers. Such functions
             include:
             A. Probation - suitable for the civic center (courts), the County operational center on Highway 1 (sheriff), or
                  the social services area;

             The City shall continue to encourage inclusion of public art in all projects as appropriate.
     5.2.5.  Land Acquisition
             The City will work with community organizations to secure land for cultural facilities in the Downtown area.
                                                          Page 1-66
                                                                                     Land Use Element

                                        (See also Section 12, Implementation)
5.3. City and County Offices Downtown
         The City shall continue to work to develop a plan for meeting additional space needs in the Downtown. The
         City shall work with the County to coordinate site selection, building design, circulation and utility services,
         parking, trip reduction, and funding.
5.4. Performing Arts Center
         The City, Cal Poly, and the Foundation for the Performing Arts will jointly manage the performing arts center
         on the Cal Poly campus.
5.5. Facility Reuse

                                                       Page 1-67
Chapter 1
                                      6.      RESOURCE PROTECTION
6.1.     Overall Resource Protection Policies
     6.1.1. Resource Planning
            The City shall protect its unique natural resources and systems by including their considerations and needs
            within its planning program, and giving those considerations and needs a planning priority co-equal with that
            accorded other community needs. Under this policy, the City will make provisions for the continued existence
            of its natural resources within the community. The term “community” thus includes not only the urbanized
            human community, dominated by urban land development and technological systems, but also a natural
            community rich in biological and geological diversity, as well as a pre-urban human community with a strong
            agricultural base.
6.2.     Overall Resource Protection Programs
     6.2.1. Resource Mapping
            The City shall prepare and maintain geographic information systems-based maps of the city, the urban
            reserve, and the planning area to guide in land use designations and decision-making. Maps for the city and
            urban reserve shall be in sufficient detail to highlight all significant natural resources and systems. Maps for
            the planning area may be at a lesser degree of detail.
            The maps shall show at least the following resources: native plant communities, wildlife habitats and
            corridors, aquatic ecosystems, productive or potentially productive soils (prime or other unique agricultural
            soil types), viewsheds, terrain, hillsides, greenbelt areas. The overlay maps shall also show development
            constraints such as flood hazard areas, geological hazard areas, soil hazard areas (subsidence, liquefaction),
            noise impact areas, airport hazard and noise areas, radiation hazard areas.
            The maps shall provide the basis of determining where urban development is most appropriate, and where
            other needs of the community outweigh the desire or need for urban development. As a result of the findings
            of these maps, the City shall re-evaluate its land use designations and future plans for undeveloped areas,
            and revise the LUE land use map accordingly.
     6.2.2. Resource Protection
            The City shall seek to protect resource areas deemed worthy of permanent protection by fee acquisition,
            easement, or other means.
6.3.     Open Space Policies
            (See also the Growth Management section)
     6.3.1. Open Space and Greenbelt Designations
            The City shall designate the following types of land as open space:
            A. Upland and valley sensitive habitats or unique resources, as defined in the Conservation and Open Space
                 Element, including corridors which connect habitats.
            B. Undeveloped prime agricultural soils which are to remain in agricultural use as provided in Policy 1.9.2.
                                                           Page 1-68

                                                                                          Land Use Element
                                                                                                                   
             C. Those areas which are best suited to non-urban uses due to: infeasibility of providing proper access or
                  utilities; excessive slope or slope instability; wildland fire hazard; noise exposure; flood hazard; scenic
                  value; wildlife habitat value, including sensitive habitats or unique resources as defined in the
                  Conservation and Open Space Element; agricultural value; and value for passive recreation.
             D. A greenbelt, outside the urban reserve, that surrounds the ultimate boundaries of the urban area, and
                  which should connect with wildlife corridors that cross the urbanized area.
             E. Sufficient area of each habitat type to ensure the ecological integrity of that habitat type within the
                  urban reserve and the greenbelt, including connections between habitats for wildlife movement and
                  dispersal; these habitat types will be as identified in the natural resource inventory, as discussed in the
                  "Background to this Land Use Element Update" and in Community Goal #8.
             Public lands suited for active recreation will be designated Park on the General Plan Land Use Element Map.
             The City may establish an agricultural designation. (See the Conservation and Open Space Element for
             refinements of these policies.)
     6.3.2.  Open Space Uses
             Lands designated Open Space should be used for purposes which do not need urban services, major
             structures, or extensive landform changes. Such uses include: watershed protection; wildlife and native plant
             habitat; grazing; cultivated crops; and passive recreation. The City shall require that buildings, lighting,
             paving, use of vehicles, and alterations to the landforms and native or cultural landscapes on open space
             lands are minimized, so rural character and resources are maintained. Buildings and paved surfaces, such as
             parking or roads, shall not exceed the following: where a parcel smaller than ten acres already exists, five
             percent of the site area; on a parcel of ten acres or more, three percent. (As explained in the Conservation
             and Open Space Element, the characteristics of an open space area may result in it being suitable for some
             open space uses, but not the full range.) Parcels within Open Space areas should not be further subdivided.
6.4.     Hillside Policies
             As noted in the open space section of this element and in the Conservation and Open Space Element, San
             Luis Obispo wants to keep open its steeper, higher, and most visible hillsides. Some of the lower and less
             steep hillside areas, however, are seen as suitable for development, particularly where development is
             coupled with permanent open space protection of the more sensitive areas. This section focuses on where
             and how some hillsides may be developed.
     6.4.1.  The City shall maintain comprehensive standards and policies for hillside development for the
             following reasons:
             A. To protect and preserve scenic hillside areas and natural features such as the volcanic Morros, ridge
                  lines, plant communities, rock outcroppings and steep slope areas that function as landscape backdrops
                  for the community.
             B. To set the limits of commercial and residential development in hillside areas by establishing a permanent
                  open space green belt at the edge of the community.
             C. To protect the health, safety and welfare of community residents by directing development away from
                  areas with hazards such as landslides, wildland fires, flooding and erosion.
                                                            Page 1-69

Chapter 1
  6.4.2. Development Limits
         The City shall establish and maintain clear development limit lines for hillside planning areas, and special
         design standards for the hillside areas. The location of the development limit and the standards should cause
         development to avoid encroachment into sensitive habitats or unique resources as defined in the
         Conservation and Open Space Element, and public health and safety problems related to utility service,
         access, wildland fire hazard, erosion, flooding, and landslides and other geologic hazards. Also, the
         development limit line and the standards should help protect the city’s scenic setting. (Locations of hillside
         planning areas are shown in Figure 7.
  6.4.3. Development Standards
         The City shall require development – including buildings, driveways, fences and graded yard areas – on
         hillside parcels to:
         A. Be entirely within the urban reserve line or development limit line, whichever is more restrictive (though
              parcel boundaries may extend beyond these lines when necessary to meet minimum parcel-size
              standards), unless one of the following three exceptions applies:
              (a) A location outside the urban reserve line or development limit line is necessary to protect public
                    health and safety.
              (b) New wireless telecommunication facilities may be appropriate on South Street Hills inside the three-
                    acre leasehold already developed with commercial and municipal radio facilities, subject to use
                    permit approval and architectural review and approval. Applicants shall comply with all other
                    provisions of this section, and demonstrate that (a) new facilities will not individually or additively
                    interfere with City radio equipment necessary for emergency response coordination, and (b) will not
                    cause on-site radio frequency radiation levels to exceed exposure standards established for the
                    general public by the American National Standards Institute.
              (c) Where a legally built dwelling exists on a parcel which is entirely outside the urban reserve line or
                    development limit line, a replacement dwelling may be constructed subject to standards B through
                    H below.
         B. Keep a low profile and conform to the natural slopes;
         C. Avoid large, continuous walls or roof surfaces, or prominent foundation walls, poles, or columns;
         D. Minimize grading of roads;
         E. Minimize grading on individual lots; generally, locate houses close to the street; minimize the grading of
              visible driveways;
         F.   Include planting which is compatible with native hillside vegetation and which provides a visual transition
              from developed to open areas;
         G. Use materials, colors, and textures which blend with the natural landscape and avoid high contrasts;
         H. Minimize exterior lighting.
  6.4.4. Parcels Crossing the Limit Lines
         The City shall require that before development occurs on any parcel that crosses the urban reserve or
         development limit lines, the part outside the lines be protected as permanent open space.

Chapter 1
  6.4.5. Development Credit Transfer
         Any residential development credit obtained from Open Space designations outside the urban reserve line or
         development limit line should be transferred to land in the Downtown Core or Specific Plan area.
  6.4.6. Homesites Outside the Limit Lines
         Where homesites are to be developed outside the urban reserve or development limit lines, and beyond the
         City’s jurisdiction within the City’s greenbelt, the City shall encourage the County to promote the transfer of
         development credits into the Downtown Core or Specific Plan area. If development is to proceed in these
         areas, the City shall encourage the County to only allow creation of home sites consistent with the following
         guidelines:
         A. Be on land sloping less than 15 percent;
         B. Have effective emergency-vehicle access from a City street or County road;
         C. Be on a geologically stable site;
         D. Have adequate water supply for domestic service and fire suppression;
         E. Avoid areas with high wildland fire hazard;
         F.   Be next to existing development;
         G. Avoid significant visual impacts; and
         H. Be clustered to minimize impacts and retain open space.
  6.4.7. Hillside Planning Areas
         The City shall urge the County to implement the following hillside policies. Specific policies to address
         particular concerns for the areas as shown on Figure 7 are listed below. For each of these areas, land above
         the development limit line should be secured as permanent open space.
         A. The Cal Poly – Cuesta Park area includes the hill east of Cal Poly and north of Highway 101 near Cuesta
              Park. Development should be separated or protected from highway traffic noise and should have
              adequate fire protection. The City shall urge the County to conduct architectural review of development
              on lots fronting Loomis Street to address visual impacts of development.
         B. The Woodland Drive area Development of vacant land near Woodland Drive (Figure 7) shall address the
              following:
              (a) The location and design of new public streets and private drives serving several owners, and any
                    necessary changes to existing streets in the area;
              (b) Water and sewer systems, including new storage tanks, pumps, main pipes, and access roads, and
                    changes to existing facilities necessary for adequate service to the area;
              (c) New parcels and existing parcels to be changed or combined;
              (d) Location of building sites on parcels next to or crossing the urban reserve line;
              (e) Areas to be kept open through easements or dedication of fee ownership;
              (f)   A program for transferring development potential, consistent with these hillside planning policies;
              (g) Location of creek easements to provide flood protection and to protect existing creekside
                    vegetation;
              (h) Phasing of development and public improvements.

                                                                         Land Use Element
                                                                                                   
C. The Goldtree area extends up the hill from the Alrita Street neighborhood. This is a minor expansion
   area which can accommodate single-family houses. In addition to meeting the usual criteria for
   approving minor annexations, this area should:
   (a) Provide a gravity-flow water system giving standard levels of service to all developed parts of the
          expansion area and correcting water-service deficiencies in the Alrita Street neighborhood;
   (b) Correct downslope drainage problems to which development within the expansion area would
          contribute.
   (c) A development plan or specific plan for the whole expansion area should be adopted before any
          part of it is annexed, subdivided, or developed. (Existing houses inside the urban reserve line need
          not be annexed along with any new subdivision)
   (d) All new houses and major additions to houses should be subject to architectural review.
D. The Orcutt area includes land on the western flanks of the Santa Lucia foothills east of the Southwood
   Drive neighborhood and Orcutt Road. No building sites should be located above the development limit
   line.
E. The Margarita area includes the southern slopes of the South Street Hills. No building sites should be
   located above the development limit line.
F. The Stoneridge area includes land on the northern slopes of South Street Hills. Development west of the
   end of Lawrence Drive should be subject to architectural review and to measures assuring that building
   sites will be stable.
G. The Calle Joaquin area should allow the continuation of a commercial use for the existing building on the
   hill, but no further development.
H. The Irish Hills area should secure permanent open space with no building sites above the 150-foot
   elevation, in conjunction with any subdivision or development of the lower areas. (See also Section 8,
   Special Focus Areas.)
I. The Billygoat acres area extends into the Irish Hills above Prefumo Creek. No further development
   should occur beyond the urban reserve line.
J. The Prefumo Creek area extends into the Irish Hills west of Prefumo Canyon Road. Development should
   be limited to areas within the urban reserve line with permanent protection of the creeks and upper
   hillsides.
K. The Madonna Inn area includes land west of Highway 101 on the lower slopes of San Luis Mountain and
   the northeast slopes of the foothill bordering Laguna Lake Park.
   (a) A development plan for the whole area should be adopted before any part of it is annexed,
          subdivided, or further developed. (See also Section 8, Special Focus Areas.)
   (b) The City shall require that development locations and building forms respect the area's
          extraordinary visual quality and natural slopes, and maintain views of the mountain from the
          highway and nearby neighborhoods.
   (c) The area immediately west of Highway 101 should be retained as an open space buffer.
L. The Luneta Drive area includes parcels which may be used for housing, so long as new construction and
   major additions are approved by the Architectural Review Commission.

6.5.     Hillside Programs
             (See also Section 12, Implementation)
     6.5.1.  Designating Sensitive Sites
             Subdivision approval in hillside planning areas shall include designation of "sensitive sites," which shall be
             subject to architectural review.
     6.5.2.  Delineation of Development Limit Lines
             The City shall create and maintain a GIS layer to accurately document development limit lines as they are
             applied in the General Plan.
     6.5.3.  Community Design Guidelines
             Consistent with the Community Design guidelines, all hillside areas are considered sensitive sites, and
             architectural review is required for new development. The Community Development Director will screen all
             proposals to identify any which do not need architectural review. The City will mitigate the visual impacts of
             hillside structures, including revising the way maximum building height is determined.
6.6.     Creeks Wetlands, and Flooding Policies
             San Luis Obispo's aquatic ecosystems consist of creeks, Laguna Lake, floodplains, marshes, wetlands,
             serpentine seeps, and springs. These aquatic ecosystems provide habitat, recreation, water purification,
             groundwater recharge, and soil production as well as natural flood protection by reducing the force of
             floodwaters as they spread and decelerate over floodplains. Creeks, which are the most obvious of these
             systems because they flow under and through the City, provide wildlife habitat, backyard retreats, and
             viewing and hiking pleasures, in addition to carrying storm water runoff. When some creeks overflow during
             major storms, they flood wide areas beyond their channels (Figure 8). San Luis Obispo wants to avoid injury
             or substantial property losses from flooding, while keeping or improving the creeks' natural character, scenic
             appearance, recreational value, and fish and wildlife habitat.
     6.6.1.  Creek and Wetlands Management Objectives
             The City shall manage its lake, creeks, wetlands, floodplains, and associated wetlands to achieve the multiple
             objectives of:
             A. Maintaining and restoring natural conditions and fish and wildlife habitat;
             B. Preventing loss of life and minimizing property damage from flooding;
             C. Providing recreational opportunities which are compatible with fish and wildlife habitat, flood protection,
                  and use of adjacent private properties.
             D. Recognizing and distinguishing between those sections of creeks and Laguna Lake which are in urbanized
                  areas, such as the Downtown core, and sections which are in largely natural areas. Those sections
                  already heavily impacted by urban development and activity may be appropriate for multiple use
                  whereas creeks and lakeshore in a more natural state shall be managed for maximized ecological value.
     6.6.2.  Citywide Network
             The City shall include the lake, creeks, and wetlands as part of a citywide and regional network of open space,
             parks, and – where appropriate – trails, all fostering understanding, enjoyment, and protection of the natural
             landscape and wildlife.

Chapter 1
     6.6.3. Amenities and Access
            The City shall require new public or private developments adjacent to the lake, creeks, and wetlands to
            respect the natural environment and incorporate the natural features as project amenities, provided doing so
            does not diminish natural values. Developments along creeks should include public access across the
            development site to the creek and along the creek, provided that wildlife habitat, public safety, and
            reasonable privacy and security of the development can be maintained, consistent with the Conservation and
            Open Space Element.
     6.6.4. Open Channels
            The City shall require all open channels be kept open and clear of structures in or over their banks. When
            necessary, the City may approve structures within creek channels under the limited situations described in
            the Conservation and Open Space Element.
     6.6.5. Runoff Reduction and Groundwater Recharge
            The City shall require the use of methods to facilitate rainwater percolation for roof areas and outdoor
            hardscaped areas where practical to reduce surface water runoff and aid in groundwater recharge.
     6.6.6. Development Requirements
            The City shall require project designs that minimize drainage concentrations and impervious coverage.
            Floodplain areas should be avoided and, where feasible, any channelization shall be designed to provide the
            appearance of a natural water course.
     6.6.7. Discharge of Urban Pollutants
            The City shall require appropriate runoff control measures as part of future development proposals to
            minimize discharge of urban pollutants (such as oil and grease) into area drainages.
     6.6.8. Erosion Control Measures
            The City shall require adequate provision of erosion control measures as part of new development to
            minimize sedimentation of streams and drainage channels.
6.7.     Creeks and Flooding Programs
     6.7.1. Previously Developed Areas
            To limit the potential for increased flood damage in urbanized areas, the City shall ensure new development
            complies with the City’s flood plain ordinance, setbacks, specific plans, and design standards to minimize
            flood damage and flood plain encroachment.
     6.7.2. National Flood Program
            The City shall administer the National Flood Insurance Program standards.
     6.7.3. Creekside Care and Notification
            In maintaining creek channels to accommodate flood waters, the City shall notify owners of creeks and
            adjacent properties in advance of work, and use care in any needed removal of vegetation.
     6.7.4. Evaluate Use of Financing Districts
            The City shall evaluate the feasibility of establishing a financing district or districts to address flood concerns
            in affected areas. Cost and benefits will be weighed in relation to the cost of flood insurance for affected
            property owners.

                                                     POLICIES
7.1. Airport Area
         Policies in this section apply to the area within the City limits covered by the San Luis Obispo County Regional
         Airport Land Use Plan Area, as shown on Figure 9 subject to airport safety, noise, height, and overflight
         standards.
7.2. Regional Service
         The City shall support the airport’s continued service to the region, consistent with the approved Airport
         Master Plan and FAA-approved Airport Layout Plan.
7.3. Airport Land Use Plan
         Land use density and intensity shall carefully balance noise impacts and the progression in the degree of
         reduced safety risk further away from the runways, using guidance from the San Luis Obispo County Regional
         Airport Land Use Plan, State Aeronautics Act, and California Airport Land Use Planning Handbook guidelines.
         The City shall use the Airport Master Plan forecasts of aviation activity as a reasonably foreseeable projection
         of ultimate aviation activity sufficient for long-term land use planning purposes. Prospective buyers of
         property subject to airport influence should be so informed.
7.4. Airport Safety Zones
         Density and allowed uses within the Airport Safety Zones shall be consistent with the San Luis Obispo County
         Regional Airport Land Use Plan unless the City overrides a determination of inconsistency in accordance with
         Section 21676 and 21676.5 et. seq. of the Public Utilities Code. If the City overrides a determination, all land
         uses shall be consistent with the State Aeronautics Act and guidance provided in the California Airport Land
         Use Planning Handbook guidelines, City policies, and noise standards as substantiated by the San Luis Obispo
         County Airport Master Plan activity forecasts as used for noise planning purposes.
7.5. Airport Noise Compatibility
         The City shall use the aircraft noise analysis prepared for the Airport Master Plan Environmental Impact
         Report as an accurate mapping of the long term noise impact of the airport’s aviation activity that is tied to
         the ultimate facilities development depicted in the FAA-approved Airport Layout Plan. The City shall use the
         60 dB CNEL aircraft noise contour (FAA and State aircraft noise planning standard) as the threshold for new
         urban residential areas. Interiors of new residential structures shall be constructed to meet a maximum 45 dB
         CNEL.
7.6. Airspace Protection
         The City shall use the Airport Master Plan Update and FAA airport design standards and Part 77 surfaces to
         keep the airspace surrounding the airport free of objects where required by the FAA or shall limit the height
         of objects as required by the FAA.
         The City shall also ensure obstruction clearance is provided for all en route and terminal (airport) instrument
         procedures as per the United States Standard for Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS) to avert
         modifications to any planned or published instrument approach or instrument departure procedures at SBP.

7.7.  City Annexation and Services
          The City shall actively pursue annexation of the airport area as noted in the Airport Area Specific Plan.
          Airport Area land inside the urban reserve shall be considered for annexation if it meets the criteria stated in
          Policy 1.13.5 and provisions in the Airport Area Specific Plan.
7.8.  Greenbelt Protection
          The City shall ensure annexation of the Airport Area Specific Plan is consistent with the growth management
          objectives of maintaining areas outside the urban reserve line in rural, predominantly open space uses.
          Annexation shall not take effect unless the annexed area helps protect an appropriate part of the greenbelt
          near the Airport Area, through one or more of the following methods:
          A. Dedicating an open-space easement or fee ownership to the City or to a responsible land-conservation
               organization.
          B. Paying fees to the City in-lieu of dedication that shall be used within a reasonable time to secure
               greenbelt open space near the Airport Area.
7.9.  Internal Open Space
          The City shall ensure areas designated for urban uses in the Airport Area Specific Plan, but not necessarily
          each parcel, include open areas as site amenities and to protect resources, consistent with the Conservation
          and Open Space Element. In addition, the City shall ensure wildlife corridors across the Airport Area shall be
          identified and preserved.
7.10. Development Before Annexation
          A. Areas which are designated for eventual urban development in the Airport Area Specific Plan may be
               developed during the interim with rural residential or rural commercial uses. In such areas, County
               development standards and discretionary review should assure that projects will not preclude options for
               future urban development consistent with the City’s planning policies and standards. Before any
               discretionary County land-use or land-division approval for such areas, a development plan for the site
               should be prepared, showing that circulation, water and other utility, and drainage proposals will be
               compatible with future annexation and urban development; and conditions of approval should include
               payment of City fees required to mitigate traffic, housing, and open space impacts.
          B. Any development within the urban reserve approved by the County prior to annexation should comply
               with City standards for roadway cross-sections, bus stops, walking and bicycle paths, landscaping, view
               protection, setbacks, preferred site layouts, and architectural character.
7.11. Transit Service
          The City shall work with SLOCOG, the County, RTA, the Airport, and area businesses to extend transit service
          to the airport and County areas south of the City.
7.12. County Airport Land Use Plan
          The City shall continue to work with the County Airport Land Use Commission to strive to achieve consistency
          between the San Luis Obispo County Regional Airport Land Use Plan and the City’s General Plan. If
          consistency cannot be achieved, the City shall preserve and maintain as a plausible alternative its
          constitutional land use authority to overrule the Airport Land Use Commission with regard to adopting
          General Plan policies that are consistent with the purposes of the California Airport Land Use Planning
          Handbook, State Aeronautics Act and State Law. Applicable sections of the Zoning Regulations and Specific
          Plans shall be amended accordingly.

                                          (See also Section 12, Implementation)
7.13. Airline Service
          The City shall continue to work with the County and regional airlines to assure that regional airline services
          are continued and expanded to adequately serve the needs of the population in the service area of the
          airport.
7.14. Growth Management
          The City will annex the Airport area denoted in the Airport Area Specific Plan and accommodate incremental
          development consistent with the growth management policies, including those concerning adequacy of
          resources and services and development paying its own way.
7.15. Open Space Dedication and In-lieu Fees
          In approving development proposals, the City will assure that Airport Area properties noted in the Airport
          Area Specific Plan secure protection for any on-site resources as identified in the Conservation and Open
          Space Element. These properties, to help maintain the greenbelt, shall also secure open space protection for
          any contiguous, commonly owned land outside the urban reserve. If it is not feasible to directly obtain
          protection for such land, fees in lieu of dedication shall be paid when the property is developed, to help
          secure the greenbelt in the area south of the City’s southerly urban reserve line. The City shall set fee levels
          that would be appropriate in-lieu of open space dedication.
7.16. Airport Overlay Zone
          The City shall create an Airport Overlay Zone to reflect the boundaries of the San Luis Obispo County Regional
          Airport Land Use Plan within the City limits. The purpose of the Airport Overlay Zone is to codify airport
          compatibility criteria in areas for which the City may override the Airport Land Use Commission
          determination to ensure compliance with the requirements of the California State Aeronautics Act (Cal. Pub.
          Utilities Code, Section 21670, et. seq.) which establishes statewide requirements for airport land use
          compatibility planning, guidance from the California Airport Land Use Planning Handbook, which is published
          by the California Department of Transportation Division of Aeronautics to support and amplify the State
          Aeronautics Act requirements, and other related federal and state requirements relating to airport land use
          compatibility planning. Implementation of the compatibility policies will be accomplished through the Zoning
          Code.
7.17. Airport Land Use and Zoning Code
          The City shall update its Zoning Regulations to address allowable uses and development standards for areas
          in which the City may override a determination of inconsistency. Zoning regulations shall be consistent with
          the requirements of the State Aeronautics Act, use guidance from the Caltrans Airport Land Use Planning
          Handbook and comply with related state and federal requirements relating to airport land use
          compatibility. These development standards will include, but not limited to, intensity and density limitations,
          identification of prohibited uses, infill development, height limitations, obstructions, and other hazards to
          flight, noise insulation requirements, buyer awareness measures, nonconforming uses and reconstruction
          and the process for airport compatibility criteria reviews by the City consistent these development standards.

7.18. Review of Local General Plan and implementing Development Standards
         Unless previously referred and acted upon by the City, review of General and Specific Plans and
         Amendments, Zoning ordinance or amendments, or Building code changes within the San Luis Obispo County
         Regional Airport Land Use Plan boundary (Figure 9) shall include referral to the Airport Land Use Commission
         as specified in Section 21676(b) of the Public Utilities Code for a determination of consistency with the San
         Luis Obispo County Airport Land Use Plan.

Introduction
Within the Planning Area are several areas where it is appropriate to consider a range or mix of uses which do not
correspond with any one open-space, residential, commercial, or public designation used by this element. However, a
particular use or mix of uses may not be desirable unless it is chosen in combination with a specific physical design which
solves problems of relationships between activities within the site, and between the site and its neighbors. In addition,
there are areas where special design concepts can help revitalization efforts. In Special Focus Areas, the City intends to do
one or more of the following:
              A. Require a specific plan for areas with complex development parameters (e.g. land use mix, significant
                   infrastructure needs environmental site constraints), prior to development.
              B. Make a choice about appropriate land uses based on information which will become available. In some
                   cases, the choice will be connected with approval of a development plan, possibly with customized limits
                   on specific activities and requirements for improvements or dedications.
              C. Work with properties in areas where an innovative design approach is needed to help revitalize and
                   beautify the area.
Special Focus Areas are designated by number on Figure 10. These areas and the guidelines for their development are
listed below. (The number following the decimal point corresponds to the map number.). The following areas require a
specific plan prior to development: SP-1 (Margarita), SP-2 (San Luis Ranch/Dalidio), SP-3 (Madonna), and SP-4 (Avila
Ranch).
The Special Focus Areas are those that present opportunities to develop customized land use approaches or special design
implementation to enhance their appearance and achieve their respective development potential: Foothill Blvd/Santa
Rosa, Bishop Knoll, Alrita area, Upper Monterey, Mid-Higuera, Caltrans site, General Hospital site, Broad Street Area,
Madonna Inn area, Sunset Drive-in/ Prado, Pacific Beach, Calle Joaquin auto sales area, LOVR Creek area, CalFire / Cal Poly
property, and Broad Street at Tank Farm area.
                                                        POLICIES
Introduction
              To help guide the development of large land areas (previously referred to as “expansion areas”) and to
              provide guidance on the redevelopment of sites identified, the City shall use the following policy statements
              to guide their review and actions relative to these properties.
8.1.     Specific Plan Areas
     8.1.1.   Specific Plan / General Plan Amendment
              The City shall require the completion and approval of a specific plan and associated General Plan Amendment
              prior to annexation (if applicable) and development of land within an area designated as a Specific Plan Area
              on Figure 10. The required General Plan Amendment will modify the General Plan Land Use Diagram to
              reflect the land use diagram from the approved specific plan, based on the land uses listed under
              “Performance Standards” for each site.

       For each specific plan site identified in this section, the location, purpose and performance standards for that
       site are defined. The performance standards section defines the following standards that must be met as
       part of the specific plan submitted for each site.
       A. Type. This defines the basic type of use being described.
       B. Designations Allowed: This defines the standard General Plan designations that can be used to describe
            the development proposed. See Table 1 for ranges allowed.
       C. % of Site: This defines the percent of each site dedicated to open space (using the gross project site).
       D. Minimum: This provides a minimum development assumed for each site. For residential and
            commercial types, these are not considered requirements, and a number lower than that shown can be
            proposed.
       E. Maximum: In order to exceed the minimum development for a given site, transfer of development
            credits or other permanent protection of open space would be provided. Development credits would be
            transferred from areas in the city, the urban reserve, or the greenbelt where development would be less
            appropriate, generally those designated conservation/open space or, on the County's map, agriculture or
            rural lands.
       The performance standards listed are to supplement other City requirements, standards, and Zoning Code
       requirements. If a conflict occurs, the most stringent standard shall apply.
8.1.2. Specific Plan Content
       All specific plans prepared for a Specific Plan Area must meet the requirements of State law and be
       comprised of four planning frameworks. Within each framework, the specific plan will provide the goals and
       policies that will guide future decisions on projects within the specific plan area. The plan will also include a
       detailed implementation plan that will identify responsibilities, financing requirements, and phasing / timing.
       The Land Use Framework will include the proposed land use pattern, actual development densities in each
       subarea on the project site, and development phasing. The framework will also include specifics on
       development standards.
       The Specific Plan prepared will provide complete guidance on the land use provisions that will guide future
       development within the Planning Area. At a minimum, these provisions will address the following topics. In
       consultation with City staff, other topics may be required depending on site specific needs.
       A. Land Use Classification. A land use classification system that clearly identifies the uses that may be
            allowed in each subarea. Based on the land use designations listed under “Performance Standards”
            section for each site, the specific plan will provide further details on development standards for each
            subarea. This classification system would use clear terminology to define and further describe allowable
            uses. Both the land use classification system and the uses allowed within the various subareas will
            provide for an overall mix of uses.
       B. General Site Planning and Development Standards. These standards will specify the requirements that
            would be applied to all development and land uses regardless of the applicable land use designation.
            These would address, as appropriate, sensitive resources; site access requirements; energy efficiency;
            fences, walls, hedges, buffers, and other screening; noise regulations; outdoor lighting standards;
            performance standards (e.g., air quality, glare, vibration, etc.), undergrounding of utilities; and other
            similar topics. Planning should also address how the development will be designed to enhance
            compatibility with adjacent properties.

Chapter 1
           C. Development Standards. Development standards for each land use designation (e.g., building forms,
                design objectives, land use objectives, height limitations, setback requirements, site coverage
                requirements, etc.) will be organized in tables and graphically illustrated wherever possible.
           D. Housing Mix. The specific plan will discuss the proposed mix of housing types within the area. In keeping
                with the City’s Housing Element, affordable housing requirements and density bonus provisions and
                related incentives will be incorporated as appropriate. A key to the housing component will be to
                incorporate a mix of housing types, and to provide phasing mechanisms that ensure to the City the
                development of this housing mix as a part of each phase of the project.
           The Design Framework will provide detailed design guidelines that will be used as the specific plan is
           implemented / developed. The purpose of these guidelines will be to establish the expected level of design
           within the area while still maintaining project flexibility and innovation. The objective of this framework is not
           to dictate a specific design, but to establish design expectations.
           The design guidelines will be illustrated to help explain the intent and expectations. This part of the Specific
           Plan will also incorporate detailed landscaping standards.
           The Design Framework will also provide guidance on the integration of the streetscape into the overall
           project design. The framework will define public improvements and the public rights-of-way to define the
           overall character of the streetscape.
           The Circulation Framework will include the proposed circulation network system elements, design standards,
           and system phasing. This framework will address all modes of circulation as well as parking and loading
           standards if different from the standard City requirements.
           The Infrastructure / Public Facilities Framework will cover infrastructure requirements (water, sewer, storm
           drainage, electricity, natural gas, and communications) as well as parkland, schools, and other public
           facilities. For infrastructure, the framework will address the proposed trunk infrastructure system
           improvements and system phasing necessary to support implementation of the land use plan and financing
           mechanisms to implement planned facilities.
  8.1.3.   SP-1, Margarita Area Specific Plan Update
         Location:       The Margarita Area covers about 420 acres bounded by South Higuera Street, Broad Street, Tank
                         Farm Road, and the ridge of the South Street Hills in the southern portion of San Luis Obispo.
         Purpose:        Adopted in October 2004, the Margarita Area Specific Plan contains five key principles: open
                         space and sensitive resource production, cohesive neighborhood creation, transit supporting
                         land uses and densities, pedestrian environment, and minimizing infrastructure costs.
                         The approved specific plan includes 868 residential dwelling units, as well as a business park, a
                         neighborhood park, sports fields, and open space areas. Over 40 percent of the land area is
                         designated as open space and 56 acres are designated as parks.
                         The City shall consider this area as potentially appropriate to accommodate additional housing.
                         Revisions to the Margarita Area Specific Plan will be required if residential development in

8.1.4.   SP-2, San Luis Ranch (Dalidio) Specific Plan Area
       Location:    This specific plan area is located in the southwest quarter of the city at the corner of Madonna
                    Road and Dalidio Drive. The site is approximately 132 acres and is currently used for agricultural
                    purposes. The site is primarily flat topographically. The entire site is within the City’s Planning
                    Area, but is outside the current city limits.
       Purpose:     This project site should be developed as a mixed use project that maintains the agricultural
                    heritage of the site, provides a commercial / office transition to the existing commercial center
                    to the north, and provides a diverse housing experience. Protection of the adjacent creek and a
                    well-planned integration into the existing circulation system will be required.
                    The specific plan for this area should consider and address the following land use and design
                    issues.
                    a. Provide land and appropriate financial support for development of a Prado Road connection.

                         or interchange) at this location shall be dedicated as part of any proposal and any area in
                         excess of the project’s fair share of this facility shall not be included as part of the project
                         site area used to calculate the required 50% open space.
                    b. Circulation connections to integrate property with surrounding circulation network for all
                         modes of travel.
                    c.   Connection to Froom Ranch and Calle Joaquin, if proposed, shall not bifurcate on- site or
                         neighboring agricultural lands. Any connection to Calle Joaquin shall be principally a
                         secondary / emergency access by design.
                    d. Development shall include a transit hub. Developer shall work with transit officials to
                         provide express connections to Downtown area.
                    e. Maintain agricultural views along Highway 101 by maintaining active agricultural uses on the
                         site, and maintain viewshed of Bishop Peak and Cerro San Luis.
                    f.   Maintain significant agricultural and open space resources on site (see Policy 1.13.8.B). Land
                         dedicated to Agriculture shall be of size, location and configuration appropriate to maintain
                         a viable, working agricultural operation.
                    g. Where buffering or transitions to agricultural uses are needed to support viability of the
                         agricultural use, these shall be provided on lands not counted towards the minimum size for
                         the agriculture / open space component. Provide appropriate transition to agricultural uses
                         on-site.
                    h. Integrate agricultural open space with adjacent SLO City Farm and development on
                         property.
                    i.   Site should include walkable retail and pedestrian and bicycle connections to surrounding
                         commercial and residential areas.
                    j.   Commercial and office uses shall have parking placed behind and to side of buildings so as to
                         not be a prominent feature.

               extended to include one or more of the existing commercial properties west of Chorro Street. The City shall
               work with property owners / developers to redevelop the area as mixed use (either horizontal or vertical
               mixed use) to include a mix of uses as described under the Neighborhood Commercial, Community
               Commercial and Medium High to High Density Residential designations.
               The non-residential component of the project should include elements that serve the nearby neighborhoods.
               Examples include:
                   specialty stores and services
                   food service
                   entertainment, and
                   recreational facilities (except that movie theaters, nightclubs, bars/taverns and restaurants serving
                    alcohol after 11 pm shall be prohibited)

         As part of this project, the City will evaluate adjustments to parking requirements to account for
         predominant pedestrian and bike access. Building height adjustments in this area can also be considered
         with mixed use development. Redevelopment plans shall include consideration of improving the existing
         complex intersections of Foothill/Chorro/Broad, the desirability of modifying Boysen at and through the
         property on the northeast corner of the area, and enhancement of pedestrian, bicycle and transit
         connections across Foothill and Santa Rosa/Highway 1 and to the campus. Among other possible incentives,
         building height adjustments on the North side of Foothill may be considered with mixed use development.
         The Fire Station will be maintained or relocated within the area.
  8.2.2. Upper Monterey
         In the Upper Monterey area, the emphasis will be on revitalization and enhancement. The area above
         Johnson shall have an emphasis on land use compatibility and neighborhood preservation. The following
         actions will be pursued in this area.
         A. The City shall investigate adding the Upper Monterey area to the Downtown Parking District, thereby
              allowing in-lieu payment towards common parking facilities.
         B. The City shall integrate a new Downtown Transit Center in the Upper Monterey area and provide
              enhanced connectivity to the center from the Upper Monterey area.
         C. The City will work with hotels in the Upper Monterey area to provide shuttle service to the Downtown
              and Downtown Transit Center.
         D. The City will promote restaurant development in the Upper Monterey area, and include outdoor dining
              opportunities and other public activities oriented toward Monterey Street. North of California, these
              types of activities shall be prohibited on the creek side of buildings.
         E. The City will evaluate reconfiguring Monterey Street in this area to enhance bicycle and pedestrian
              connectivity to Downtown and to Cal Poly.
         F.   The City will work with local hotels and Cal Poly to develop enhanced meeting rooms and conference
              facilities. These types of facilities would not be located on the east side of Monterey north of California
              Street, nor is a stand-alone conference center appropriate for this area.
         G. The City will work with developers to assemble adjacent properties into lots of suitable size for
              redevelopment limited to areas southwest of California Street.
         H. The City will develop an Upper Monterey area master plan and design guide that will provide guidance
              on street enhancements, façade improvement programs, and pedestrian enhancement along Monterey
              Street. As part of this effort, the City will investigate the ability to apply form-based codes to guide
              future development and will involve residents in adjoining areas as well as business and property owners
              along Monterey Street as part of the public review process in development of the master plan/design
              guide. Particular attention will be given to creek protection, noise, safety, light and glare, and privacy
              impacts to adjoining neighborhoods

8.3. Ordinance 1130
         The City will review and update Ordinance 1130 and involve residents to ensure that neighborhood concerns
         are addressed.
8.4. Mid-Higuera Area
         The City will update the plan for this multi-block commercial area to reflect current needs and changes that
         have occurred since the 2001 plan was adopted.
8.5. Caltrans Site
         While this area is within the Mid-Higuera Area, the unique qualities and opportunities provided by the site
         warranted special consideration in the General Plan. This area is planned for redevelopment from a Caltrans
         office and yard complex to a mixed use development. Commercial uses will be as described under the
         Tourist Commercial designation with some residential incorporated using a Medium High to High Density
         Residential component. Redevelopment plans shall consider the suitability of realignment of the
         Madonna/South Higuera intersection. The site should be developed to serve as a gateway into the
         community, with consideration of additional open space uses, retention and rehabilitation of the Master List
         historic structure, and retention of Heritage Trees on the site. Conference center-type uses are encouraged
         along with other appropriate tourist-serving uses as appropriate for the site. Building height adjustments in
         this area can also be considered with mixed use development.
         The site shall also include a park site north of Madonna Road.
8.6. General Hospital Site
         The General Hospital site includes County-owned property including the old hospital building (which is
         planned to remain as an office / treatment facility) and lands behind the facility. Lands behind the hospital
         building that are inside the City’s Urban Reserve line will be designated as Public (for existing public facility)
         and a range of residential uses (Low Density and Medium Density Residential) and will include the ability to
         support residential care, transitional care use, and other residential uses consistent with the adjacent areas.
         The remaining site outside the City’s Urban Reserve line will remain as Open Space. The City shall seek to
         secure permanent protection of the open space outside of the urban reserve line as part of any development
         proposal.
         The undeveloped portion of this site on the southwest side of Johnson Avenue will remain designated for
         Public uses.
8.7. Broad Street Area
         The City shall implement the South Broad Street Area Plan to create a safe, attractive and economically vital
         neighborhood with a mix of complementary land uses. The Area Plan shall:
         A. Encourage innovative design concepts that help revitalize and beautify the area.
         B. Facilitate housing development to meet the full range of community housing needs.
         C. Improve circulation safety and connectivity within the area and across Broad Street.

8.8.  Madonna Inn Area
          The Madonna Inn Area includes land west of Highway 101 on the lower slopes of San Luis Mountain and the
          northeast slopes of the foothill bordering Laguna Lake Park.
          This area may be developed further only if surrounding hillsides including area outside the Urban Reserve
          Line are permanently protected as open space. (See also hillside policies under 6.4 and programs under 6.5.)
          A. A development plan for the whole area should be adopted before any part of it is annexed, subdivided,
               or further developed.
          B. Upon amendment to an urban designation, the area may accommodate a generously landscaped, low
               intensity extension of the existing tourist facilities. This area may also be suitable for assisted and/or
               senior living facilities. Development locations should be clustered and building forms should respect the
               area's extraordinary visual quality and natural slopes, and should maintain views of the mountain from
               the highway and nearby neighborhoods.
          C. The area immediately west of Highway 101 should be retained as an open space buffer.
          D. Any plan for further development in this area must address reconfiguration of the Marsh Street
               interchange and larger circulation issues throughout the area.
          E. Walking and biking paths shall be provided as appropriate to connect to the City’s network and to the
               Downtown, amenities along Madonna Road, and open space areas.
8.9.  Sunset Drive-in Theater / Prado Road Area
          This 38-acre area should be further developed only if flooding can be mitigated without significant harm to
          San Luis Obispo Creek. Until flood hazards are mitigated, continued agricultural use and low-intensity
          recreational use are appropriate. Any use drawing substantial regional traffic also depends on providing
          needed infrastructure at Prado Road, extending Prado Road to connect with Madonna Road, and realignment
          of Elks Lane.
          Once flooding, access, and agricultural preservation issues are resolved, the area would be suitable for
          development as a mixed use (horizontal or vertical) development with a mix of Commercial uses. Permanent
          open space shall be required in order to protect the adjacent San Luis Obispo Creek. As part of future
          development, a full assessment of the Drive-in Theater site’s potential as a historic resource will need to be
          evaluated and addressed. Bicycle connectivity as referenced in the Bicycle Transportation Plan is an
          important component of future development of the area.
          Property within the area may need to be designed to accommodate the Homeless Services center and/or
          transportation agency use.
8.10. Pacific Beach Site
          This area is planned for redevelopment from current use as a continuation school, school office and park uses
          to commercial retail uses along Los Osos Valley Road and Froom Ranch Road and the remaining site
          maintained under a Park designation.
8.11. Calle Joaquin Auto Sales Area
          These four vacant lots are suitable for commercial mixed use and other uses described under the Tourist
          Commercial designations. Portions of the site may be appropriate for use as auto sales, depending on market
          demand. Development of this area must address preservation of and transition to the agricultural
          parcels/uses to the northwest; connectivity to the Dalidio Ranch area; viewshed preservation; and treatment
          as a gateway to the City visible from Highway 101.

8.12. LOVR Creekside Area
          This area is heavily constrained by flood potential along the western boundary as well as limited circulation
          access to the site given its proximity to the proposed LOVR / Highway 101 interchange and its limited
          frontage on LOVR. Flooding and access issues must be resolved prior to developing Medium High Density
          Residential (in areas adjacent to existing residential uses). Agricultural Designations must be maintained
          along the west side of site. As part of future development, compatibility with adjacent residential areas to
          the east will be required.
          Permanent protection of the adjacent San Luis Obispo Creek will need to be addressed as part of proposed
          development. The south side of the site will also need to accommodate relocation of LOVR right-of-way and
          changes related to the planned Highway 101 interchange.
8.13. Broad Street at Tank Farm Road Site
          Located at the northwest corner of Broad Street and Tank Farm Road, this approximate 10 acre site will be
          used as a mixed use site, providing for a mix of uses as described under the Community Commercial and
          Office designations. The site will provide a strong commercial presence at the intersection. Areas along the
          creek on the western edge of the site will be appropriately buffered to provide creek protections. Attention
          to connectivity, safety and comfort of bicycle and pedestrian circulation will be especially important in the
          development of this corner.
8.14. CalFire /Cal Poly-owned property on Highway 1
          The Cal Poly Master Plan currently designates this area for Faculty and Staff housing. The City shall
          collaborate with Cal Poly in updating the Master Plan for development of campus property. Master Plan
          direction for this property shall address sensitive visual and habitat resources, circulation issues, impacts to
          City services, transition and potential impacts to surrounding neighborhoods.
8.15. North Side of Foothill (Bishop Knoll)
          Future development of this area shall address open space requirements under Policy 1.13.8 and open space
          buffers in accordance with Conservation and Open Space Element Policy 8.3.2. This area shall be subject to
          Architectural Review to ensure consideration of hillside and resource protection; circulation and access, and
          transition to existing neighborhoods. The steep hillside should be dedicated as Open Space and residential
          lots grouped at the bottom of the hill closer to Foothill. Development shall provide a parking lot and trail
          access to Bishops Peak. Circulation connectivity shall be provided to Los Cerros Drive as feasible. Density
          shall be limited to 7 units / acre as modified for slope under the Zoning Ordinance.
8.16. Alrita Properties
          Future development of this area shall address hillside planning requirements under Policy 6.4.7C. This area
          shall be subject to Architectural Review to ensure consideration of hillside and resource protection;
          circulation and access; visual impacts, and transition to existing neighborhoods. Additional analysis will need
          to occur in the LUCE EIR to evaluate potential water service issues. While there is a pump station nearby,
          more analysis is needed to determine if the City’s water distribution system can adequately serve
          development in this area. Density shall be limited to 7 units/acre as modified for slope under the Zoning
          Ordinance.

                                                         POLICIES
Introduction
"Implementation" refers to all the City’s actions to carry out the general plan. Besides the programs described in previous
sections, the City uses the following means of implementing the Land Use Element. The City’s actions taken pursuant to
the following shall be consistent with the General Plan.
12.1.    Zoning Regulations
             Zoning Regulations consist of the zoning map, lists of uses allowed in certain zones, property-development
             standards such as maximum building height and minimum parking, and procedures intended to give the
             interests of development applicants and other citizens fair consideration.
12.2.    Subdivision Regulations
             Subdivision Regulations cover the division of land into parcels which can be sold, and set basic standards for
             streets and utilities.
12.3.    Community Design Guidelines
             Community Design Guidelines are used by the staff, City Council, Planning Commission, Architectural Review
             Commission and other advisory bodies in the review of proposed development projects to help ensure that
             such projects meet the City's expectation for the quality and character of new development.
12.4.    Historic Preservation Ordinance, Guidelines, and Context Statement
             Historic Preservation Ordinance and Guidelines are used by the staff, City Council, Planning Commission,
             Cultural Heritage Committee, and other advisory bodies in the review of projects within a historic district or
             on property with a listed historic resource to ensure protection of historic resources. The City’s Historic
             Context Statement provides information to support the review and identification of resources.
12.5.    Grading Regulations
             Grading Regulations limit the amount and methods of reshaping the ground to accommodate development.
12.6.    Budgets
             Budgets spell out how City funds will be obtained and spent, particularly the capital improvement program, a
             multiyear list of major facilities and equipment which the City will buy or build. The capital improvement
             program includes water sources and sewage treatment equipment, water and sewer lines, and streets and
             bridges. The Planning Commission reviews this program for conformity with the general plan.
12.7.    Property Management
             Property management covers buying land for new City facilities and for public open space, and selling or
             leasing land no longer needed for a City government function.
    12.7.1. Development Plans, Area Plans, and Specific Plans
             Development plans, area plans, and specific plans bridge between general policies and actual construction
             plans.

                                                                                       Land Use Element
                                                                                                                 
12.8.  Public Planning
           Public Planning is a way for the City and its Citizens to help shape the community’s future. Before making a
           determination on proposals for a major development, such as a specific plan, special-design area, Downtown
           Concept Plan, or a large subdivision or planned development not within a specific plan, the City shall provide
           early and meaningful public notice in order to stimulate and encourage community engagement and provide
           ample opportunity for community input to decision-makers. Advisory bodies and City Council shall consider
           such input prior to taking action on a project.
12.9.  Environmental Review
           The purpose of the City’s environmental review process is to develop and maintain a high quality
           environment now and in the future. Some projects may be exempted from environmental review by state
           law or city procedures. For those projects subject to environmental review, features to be examined would
           include but not be limited to, toxic contamination, air quality, open space preservation, sustainability
           impacts, scenic values and impacts, airport operations, ground slopes, seismic hazards, soil and groundwater
           characteristics, wildlife habitats, road and rail traffic noise, water and sewer service limits, access and
           circulation, and historic and archaeological resources. When considering proposals for a major development,
           such as a specific plan or special-design area, the City must conduct an evaluation of environmental
           opportunities and constraints, to which a proposal can respond. The City is committed to early and
           meaningful participation by the community in the environmental review process to help inform the public
           and decision-makers of the potential environmental consequences of their actions.
12.10. Interagency Communication
           City positions communicated to other agencies shall be consistent with the goals and policies in the general
           plan.

                                      APPENDIX B. NEIGHBORHOODS
Neighborhoods are a key component of the City’s character as stated in policies and programs under Section 2,
Conservation and Development of Residential Neighborhoods, entitled “Neighborhood Wellness Action Plans”, directs the
City to identify neighborhoods and work with residents to develop plans for each. Through the LUCE update process, the
City GIS staff developed on on-line interactive tool for residents to identify their address, drag a line around the area they
identified as their neighborhood and then answer a series of questions regarding what they liked about their
neighborhood and what they wished to improve. The tool was advertised through newspaper ads, emails, posters placed
around the community, handouts, an activity for High School student participation, paper copies of the survey at Farmers’
Markets and grocery stores, local radio ads, non-profit contacts, and a Good Morning SLO “shout out” to encourage
participation. In total, 388 residents participated in the survey and GIS staff worked with the input from the on-line tool
to develop a draft map of neighborhood boundaries.
This information formed a starting point from which to start discussions for the first LUCE workshop. The exercises at the
workshop and at a subsequent TF-LUCE meeting further explored these draft boundaries for each neighborhood and
included a discussion regarding desirable neighborhood features. The survey and workshop results indicated that there
are common features that most residents value. Features such as a sense of personal safety, safe streets for pedestrians
and cyclists, and strong neighborhood relationships were ranked highly by most participants. However, participants were
unable to come to agreement on specific boundaries of neighborhoods. The boundaries of Historic Districts, parking
districts, paving areas, school district, voting precincts, census blocks and several formal and informal neighborhood
associations were considered in addition to direct input from residents to try to define neighborhood edges. There wasn’t
an exact match of boundaries from any of the sources. Even some residents within more formalized neighborhood groups
had differing opinions regarding where boundary locations should be defined. Location of neighborhood boundaries
appears to change depending on the perceptions of residents living in an area at any one time. Some residents favored
bounding larger areas to show connectivity between daily destinations where others identified only with their individual
subdivision as a neighborhood.
The boundaries from the neighborhood identification effort resulted in 36 areas (see Figure B-1). The LUCE Task Force
and the Planning Commission concluded that this initial effort may be helpful for purposes of identifying common
neighborhood features, but expressed that neighborhood boundaries are very personal and shift based on resident
perceptions as well as changes in physical barriers/connectivity. In addition, while some neighborhoods have formed
groups, others have not. The Council ultimately expressed that the neighborhoods themselves should self-define and
that boundaries may change dependent on the issue at hand or the desires of the neighborhood residents.

                                   1.       CIRCULATION ELEMENT
INTRODUCTION
1.1. Purpose
     The City's general plan guides the use and protection of various resources to meet community purposes. The
     general plan is published in separately adopted sections, called elements, which address various topics. This
     Circulation Element describes how the city plans to provide for the transportation of people and materials within
     San Luis Obispo with connections to county areas and beyond.
     While the Land Use Element describes the city's desired character and size, the Circulation Element describes
     how transportation will be provided in the community envisioned by the Land Use Element. The vision of San
     Luis Obispo described by the Land Use Element is influenced by the layout and capacity of streets and the
     location of other transportation facilities described in the Circulation Element. Transportation facilities and
     programs influence the character of neighborhoods, the location of specific land uses, and the overall form of the
     city.
1.2. History
     The City adopted a master plan for streets and highways in 1953 and in 1962. In 1973, it adopted its first
     Circulation Element which was completely revised in 1982 and again in 1994. This Circulation Element is a
     revision of the 1994 Element. This Element's preparation was coordinated with the preparation of a revised Land
     Use Element.
1.3. Public Participation
     Before adopting or revising any general plan element, the Planning Commission and the City Council hold public
     hearings. The City publishes notices in the local newspaper to let citizens know about the hearings at least ten
     days before they are held. Also, the City prepares environmental documents to help citizens understand the
     expected consequences of its planning policies before a general plan element is adopted. The Planning
     Commission and City Council reviewed an administrative draft of this Circulation element at public meetings
     between 2012 and 2014. A public hearing draft of the Element was published for public review in January 2014.
     An Environmental Impact Report (EIR), which evaluates the effects of both this Circulation Element and a revised
     Land Use Element, was published for public review in June 2014. In September and October 2014 the Planning
     Commission held public hearings to review the Circulation Element and EIR and forwarded recommendations to
     the City Council. In September 2014, the City Council certified the Final EIR for the Circulation and Land Use
     Elements as accurate and complete. In September through December 2014, the City Council held public hearings
     to consider the adoption of the Circulation Element. The City Council adopted this Circulation Element on
     December 9, 2014.

1.6.     Goals and Objectives
         Goals and objectives describe desirable conditions. In this context, they are meant to express the community's
         preferences for current and future conditions and directions. In the following statements, San Luis Obispo
         means the community as a whole, not just the city as a municipal corporation.
     1.6.1.  Transportation Goals
             1. Maintain accessibility and protect the environment throughout San Luis Obispo while reducing
                  dependence on single-occupant use of motor vehicles, with the goal of achieving State and Federal
                  health standards for air quality.
             2. Reduce people's use of their cars by supporting and promoting alternatives such as walking, riding buses
                  and bicycles, and using car pools.
             3. Provide a system of streets that are well-maintained and safe for all forms of transportation.
             4. Widen and extend streets only when there is a demonstrated need and when the projects will cause no
                  significant, long-term environmental problems.
             5. Make the downtown more functional and enjoyable for pedestrians.
             6. Promote the safe operation of all modes of transportation.
             7. Coordinate the planning of transportation with other affected agencies such as San Luis Obispo County,
                  Cal Trans, and Cal Poly.
             8. Reduce the need for travel by private vehicle through land use strategies, telecommuting, creative
                  transportation demand management, and compact work weeks.
             9. Support the development and maintenance of a circulation system that balances the needs of all
                  circulation modes.
     1.6.2.  Overall Transportation Strategy
            Meet the transportation needs of current and planned-for population by:
             1. Managing city and regional growth consistent with the Land Use Element;
             2. Funding alternative forms of transportation;
             3. Sponsoring traffic reduction activities;
             4. Providing the infrastructure needed to accommodate the desired shift in transportation modes;
             5. Focusing traffic on Arterial Streets and Regional Routes and Highways;
             6. Accepting some additional traffic on Arterial Streets and Regional Routes and Highways;
             7. Providing facilities that improve transportation safety.
1.7.     Transportation Objectives
     1.7.1. Encourage Better Transportation Habits
         San Luis Obispo should:
             1. Increase the use of alternative forms of transportation (as shown on Table 1) and depend less on the
                  single-occupant use of vehicles.
             2. Ask the San Luis Obispo Regional Transportation Agency to establish an objective similar to #1 and
                  support programs that reduce the interregional use of single-occupant vehicles and increase the use of
                  alternative forms of transportation.

            1. Complete a network of bicycle lanes and paths, sidewalks and pedestrian paths within existing developed
                parts of the city by 2035, and extend the system to serve new growth areas.
            2. Complete improvements to the city's transit system serving existing developed areas by 2035, and
                provide service to new growth areas.
            3. Support the efforts of the County Air Pollution Control District to implement traffic reduction programs.
            4. Support and develop education programs directed at promoting types of transportation other than the
                single-occupant vehicle.
    1.7.3.  Manage Traffic
            San Luis Obispo should:
            1. Limit traffic increases by managing population growth and economic development to the rates and levels
                stipulated by the Land Use Element and implementing regulations. Limit increases in ADT and VMT to
                the increase in employment within the City's Urban Reserve.
            2. Support county-wide programs that manage population growth to minimize county-wide travel demand.
            3. Support county-wide programs that support modal shift while utilizing our existing road system and
                reducing air pollution and traffic congestion.
            4. Provide a system of streets that allow safe travel and alternate modes of transportation throughout the

               accordance with the established modal priorities designated in Table 3, such that construction, expansion, or
               alteration for one mode should not degrade the service level of a higher priority mode. 1

     6.1.4. Defining Significant Circulation Impact
            Any degradation of the level of service shall be minimized to the extent feasible in accordance with the modal
            priorities established in Policy 6.1.2 and Table 2. If the level of service degrades below thresholds established
            in Policy 6.1.2 and Table 2, it shall be determined a significant impact for purposes of environmental review
            under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). For roadways already operating below the
            established MMLOS standards, any further degradation to the MMLOS score will be considered a significant
            impact under CEQA.
            Where a potential impact is identified, the City in accordance with the modal priorities established in
            Policy 6.1.2 and Table 2, can determine if the modal impact in question is adequately served through other
            means e.g., another parallel facility or like service. Based on this determination, a finding of no significant
            impact may be determined by the City.
     6.1.5. Mitigation
            For significant impacts, developments shall be responsible for their fair share of any improvements required.
            Potential improvements for alternative mode may include, but are not limited to:
            A. Pedestrian: Provision of sidewalk, providing or increasing a buffer from vehicular travel lanes, increased
                sidewalk clear width, providing a continuous barrier between pedestrians and vehicle traffic, improved
                crossings, reduced signal delay, traffic calming, no right turn on red, reducing intersection crossing
                distance.
            B. Bicycle: Addition of a bicycle lane, traffic calming, provision of a buffer between bicycle and vehicle
                traffic, pavement resurfacing, reduced number of access points, or provision of an exclusive bicycle path,
                reducing intersection crossing distance.
            C. Transit: For transit-related impacts, developments shall be responsible for their fair share of any
                infrastructural improvements required. This may involve provision of street furniture at transit stops,
                transit shelters, and/or transit shelter amenities, pullouts for transit vehicles, transit signal prioritization,
                provision of additional transit vehicles, or exclusive transit lanes.
     6.1.6. City Review
            When new projects impact the existing circulation system, the City shall review the effectiveness and
            desirability of “direct fix” mitigation improvements to address MMLOS impacts. Where a significant impact is
            found, alternative system-wide project mitigations may be submitted for consideration to the City in
            accordance with the modal priorities established in Policy 6.1.2 and Table 2. Exceptions shall be based on the
            physical conditions of the right-of-way to support additional improvements. If the right-of-way in question
            cannot address on-site mitigation, appropriate off-site improvements that have direct nexus to and
            effectively address the specific impacts created by the project may be considered.
6.2.     Programs
     6.2.1. Traffic Count Program
            As funding permits the City shall biennially complete a traffic count program for pedestrians, bikes, vehicles
            and transit to maintain and update its database of transportation conditions and to evaluate the state of the
            transportation system in accordance with the established modal priorities and standards.

                                        7.       TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT
City, County and State governments maintain a network of public streets that provide access throughout the community.
How these streets are designed, constructed and managed can affect levels of traffic congestion, noise and air pollution,
the economic viability of commercial areas, and the quality of living throughout the city. The following policies and
programs spell out how the City intends to manage the community's street system.
Overall Purpose
The primary purpose of street corridors is to enable the movement of people and goods across all modes of
transportation. The design and use of streets should relate to and respect the character and type of surrounding land
uses. If residential areas are to maintain their character, they cannot be treated in the same manner as commercial or
industrial areas.
7.1.      Policies
     7.1.1.   Peak Hour and Daily Traffic
              The City shall cooperate with County and State government to institute programs that reduce the levels of
              peak-hour and daily vehicle traffic.
     7.1.2.   Street Network
              The City shall manage to the extent feasible the street network so that the standards presented in Table 2 are
              not exceeded. This will require new development to mitigate the traffic impacts it causes or the City to limit
              development that affects streets where congestion levels may be exceeded. The standards may be met by
              strengthening alternative modes over the single occupant motor vehicle. Where feasible, roundabouts shall
              be the City’s preferred intersection control alternative due to the vehicle speed reduction, safety, and
              operational benefits of roundabouts.
     7.1.3.   Growth Management & Roadway Expansion
              The City shall manage the expansion of roadways to keep pace with only the level of increased vehicular
              traffic associated with development planned for in the Land Use Element and under the City’s growth
              management policies and regional transportation plans.
     7.1.4.   Transportation Funding
              In order to increase support for non-automobile travel, the City shall strive to allocate transportation funding
              across various modes approximately proportional to the modal split objectives for 2035 as shown in Table 1.
     7.1.5.   Vehicle Speeds
              To the extent permitted under the CVC, the City shall endeavor to maintain and reduce speeds where
              possible in residential neighborhoods.
7.2.      Programs
     7.2.1.   Traffic Reduction Priority
              Those traffic programs identified in the Circulation Element that have the greatest potential to reduce traffic
              increases shall have priority for implementation.

                                                                               Circulation Element
                                                                                                           
7.2.2. Transportation Monitoring
       As funding permits the City shall implement an ongoing and comprehensive transportation monitoring
       program that, at a minimum, will keep track of (on a bi-annual basis):
       A. Changes in traffic volumes throughout the city.
       B. Changes to the Level of Service (LOS) on arterial streets, regional routes and highways.
       C. Traffic speeds.
       D. Changes in the use of bicycle and pedestrian facilities.
       E. Changes in streetscape features.
       F.   The location, type and frequency of accidents.
7.2.3. Transportation Survey
       The City shall regularly, as funding permits, conduct a travel behavior survey of residents to estimate their
       use of different types of transportation.
7.2.4. Transportation Model
       The City will maintain a travel demand model of the City's circulation system and coordinate with SLOCOG in
       support of the county-wide travel demand model for San Luis Obispo County.
7.2.5. Cooperative Street Design
       The City shall work with the County to jointly develop and adopt design and construction standards for
       streets within the City's Urban Reserve.
7.2.6. Subdivision Regulations
       The City shall revise its Subdivision Regulations to include right-of-way and design standards for each type of
       street shown in Figure 1 and Table 4.
7.2.7. Traffic Access Management
       The City shall adopt an access management policy to control location, spacing, design and operation of
       driveways, median openings, crosswalks, interchanges and street connections to a particular roadway
       including navigation routes to direct traffic in a manner that preserves the safety and efficiency of the
       transportation system. Navigation routing and other smart access technologies should be considered as part
       of the update to the Access and Parking Management plan.
7.2.8. State Highway HOV Lanes
       The City shall cooperate with State and regional agencies in evaluating the effectiveness of high occupancy
       vehicle (HOV) lanes on State highways. If State Route 101 is widened to add travel lanes, the additional
       capacity should be reserved for HOV and transit use.
7.2.9. Transportation Funding
       The City shall develop and adopt guidelines that implement Policy 7.0.4 concurrent with the 2015-17
       Financial Plan. In meeting the “approximately proportional” goal of the policy, the guidelines may take into
       consideration such factors as the need for multi-year planning and budgeting, the recognition that projects
       may benefit multiple modes, that non-city funding sources may be used to meet or exceed the objectives for
       particular modes, that some extraordinary capital projects (e.g. major interchange improvements) may be
       identified as special cases, that emergencies or threat to public health or safety may require special
       treatment, and that certain enterprise and special funds may be restricted to use for specific modes.

Types of Streets
7.3.      Design Standards
              The City’s roadway system is shown in Figure 1. The City shall require that improvements to the City’s
              roadway system are made consistent with the following descriptions and standards:
     7.3.1.   Average Daily Traffic (ADT)
              The total number of vehicles that use a particular street throughout the day (24 hours).
     7.3.2.   Vehicle Level of Service (LOS)
              Level of service is a letter grade representation of the quality of traffic flow based on congestion.
              A. Level of Service (LOS) "A" is free-flowing traffic while LOS "F" is extreme congestion.
              B. At LOS "D," the recommended standard, drivers can expect delays of 35 to 55 seconds and sometimes
                    have to wait through more than one cycle of a traffic signal. Vehicle may stack up at intersections but
                    dissipate rapidly.
              C. At LOS "E," delays increase to 55 to 80 seconds and drivers frequently have to wait through more than
                    one cycle of a traffic signal. Stacked lines of cars at intersections become longer.

 Local Commercial Streets directly serve non-residential development that
 front them and channel traffic to commercial collector streets (reference             5,000             25 mph
 black line streets on Figure 1).
 Local Residential Streets directly serve residential development that front
 them and channel traffic to residential collector streets (reference black            1,500             25 mph
 line streets on Figure 1).
 Commercial Collector Streets collect traffic from commercial areas and
                                                                                       10,000            25 mph
 channel it to arterials.
 Residential Collector Streets collect traffic from residential areas and
                                                                                       3,000 3           25 mph
 channel it to arterials.
 Residential Arterials are bordered by residential property where
 preservation of neighborhood character is as important as providing for               LOS D             CVC*
 traffic flow and where speeds should be controlled.
 Arterial Streets provide circulation between major activity centers and               LOS E

 Parkway Arterials are arterial streets with landscaped medians and
 roadside areas, where the number of cross streets is limited and direct               LOS D             CVC*
 access from fronting properties is discouraged
 Highway/Regional Routes connect the city with other parts of the county
 and are used by people traveling throughout the county and state and are
 designated as primary traffic carriers. Segments of these routes leading              LOS D             CVC*
 into San Luis Obispo should include landscaped medians and roadside
 areas to better define them as community entryways
 Freeway is a regional route of significance where access is controlled.               LOS D             CVC*
*Speed Limits are dictated by prevailing speeds per the California Vehicle Code (CVC).

Notes:
(1) To determine the classification of a particular street segment, refer to Figure 1: Streets Classification Map and Appendix E. Appendix E
    includes the most recent traffic counts and estimates of level of service (LOS). Traffic counts will be different for various segments of a
    particular street. In some cases, a range of LOS ratings are shown on Appendix E for "Arterial" streets because of the variability of traffic
    flow conditions along a particular corridor; and some street segments approaching intersections may have poorer LOS than shown in this
    table. Note that all ADT should reflect volumes typically experienced when all schools are in session. To account for seasonal shifts ADT
    shall be calculated using an annual average daily traffic (AADT) for individual volumes and the threshold shall be adjusted up to 15%.
(2) Desired maximum speed means that 85% of motorists using the street will drive at or slower than this speed. To account for seasonal
    shifts speeds shall be calculated using an annual average or for individual speed surveys the threshold shall be adjusted up by 2.7 mph.
(3) For Chorro and Broad Streets (north of Lincoln Street), and Margarita Avenue the maximum desired ADT goal is 5,000 ADT.

                         8.        NEIGHBORHOOD TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT
8.1.     Policies
     8.1.1.  Through Traffic
             The City shall design its circulation network to encourage through traffic to use Regional Routes, Highways,
             Arterials, Parkway Arterials, and Residential Arterial streets and to discourage through traffic use of
             Collectors and Local streets.
     8.1.2.  Residential Streets
             The City should not approve commercial development that encourages customers, employees or deliveries to
             use Residential Local or Residential Collector streets.
     8.1.3.  Neighborhood Traffic Speeds
             To the extent permitted under the California Vehicle Code, the City shall endeavor to reduce and maintain
             vehicular speeds in residential neighborhoods.
     8.1.4.  Neighborhood Traffic Management
             The City shall ensure that neighborhood traffic management projects:
             A. Provide for the mitigation of adverse impacts on all residential neighborhoods.
             B. Provide for adequate response conditions for emergency vehicles.
             C. Provide for convenient and safe through bicycle and pedestrian traffic.
     8.1.5.  Neighborhood Traffic Management Guidelines
             The City shall update its Neighborhood Traffic Management Guidelines to address voting, funding, and
             implementation procedures and develop an outreach program on the availability of the program.
     8.1.6.  Non-Infill Development
             In new, non-infill developments, dwellings shall be set back from Regional Routes and Highways, Parkway
             Arterials, Arterials, Residential Arterials, and Collector streets so that interior and exterior noise standards
             can be met without the use of noise walls.
     8.1.7.  New Project Evaluation
             The City shall not approve development that impacts the quality of life and livability of residential
             neighborhoods by generating traffic conditions that significantly exceed the thresholds established in Table 4
             except as provided under CEQA. The City shall also not approve development which significantly worsens
             already deficient residential neighborhood traffic conditions as established in Table 4 except as provided
             under CEQA. New development shall incorporate traffic calming features to minimize speeding and cut-
             through traffic.

Chapter 2
8.2.     Programs
     8.2.1. Traffic Management Plans
            As funding permits the City shall provide neighborhood traffic management services for residential areas that
            have traffic volumes or speeds which exceed the thresholds established in Table 4.
     8.2.2. Traffic Control Measures
            The City will undertake measures to control traffic in residential areas where traffic speeds or volumes
            exceed standards set by Table 4, Street Classification Descriptions and Standards.
     8.2.3. Quality of Life
            The City shall analyze residential streets for their livability with regards to multi-modal traffic noise, volumes,
            speed, and safety as well as the amount of pedestrian and bicycle traffic and potential excess right-of-way
            pavement. Traffic calming or other intervening measures may be necessary to maintain the resident's quality
            of life. The City should give priority to existing streets that exceed thresholds.

                                   9.       STREET NETWORK CHANGES
9.1.     Policies
     9.1.1.  New Development
             The City shall require that new development assumes its fair share of responsibility for constructing new
             streets, bike lanes, sidewalks, pedestrian paths and bus turn-outs or reconstructing existing facilities.
     9.1.2.  Public Participation
             The City shall provide for broad public participation in the planning and design of major changes to the street
             network.
     9.1.3.  Arterial Street Corridors
             The City shall seek to improve the livability of existing arterial streets through redesign of street corridors.
     9.1.4.  Project Implementation
             Street projects should be implemented in the appropriate sequence to ensure that development does not
             precede needed infrastructure improvements.
     9.1.5.  Right-of-Way Reservation
             The City shall require rights-of-way to be reserved through the building setback line process or through other
             mechanisms so that options for making transportation improvements are preserved.
9.2.     Programs
     9.2.1.  Building Setback Lines
             The City will establish building setback lines for routes listed on Table 5.
     9.2.2.  Prado Road Improvements
             The City shall ensure that changes to Prado Road (Projects 1, 2, and 19 on Table 5) and other related system
             improvements are implemented in a sequence that satisfies circulation demands caused by area
             development.
             The sponsors of development projects that contribute to the need for the Prado Road interchange or
             overpass (Project 19 on Table 5) will be required to prepare or fund the preparation of a Project Study Report
             for the interchange project. The Project Study Report shall meet the requirements of the California
             Department of Transportation.
     9.2.3.  Street Amenities Plan
             The City shall adopt and regularly update a plan and standards for the installation and maintenance of
             landscaped medians, parkways, signs, utilities, street furniture, sidewalks and bicycle lanes. Within the
             Downtown the street amenities shall be consistent with the Downtown Pedestrian Plan design guidelines.
     9.2.4.  Conceptual Plan for the City’s Center
             The City will evaluate complete street designs that maximize the shared right of way for all users as a method
             for achieving the overall objective of the Conceptual Physical Plan for the City's Center to improve the
             pedestrian environment in the downtown.
     9.2.5.  San Luis Ranch/Dalidio Development
             As part of any proposal to further develop the Dalidio-Madonna Area, the alignment and design of extensions
             of Froom Ranch Way connecting with Prado Road (west of Route 101) shall be evaluated and established if
             consistent with the Agricultural Master Plan for Calle Joaquin Reserve.

   9.2.6.  Streetscapes and major roadways
           In the acquisition, design, construction or significant modification of major roadways (highways / regional
           routes and arterial streets), the City shall promote the creation of “streetscapes” and linear scenic parkways
           or corridors that promote the city’s visual quality and character, enhance adjacent uses, and integrate
           roadways with surrounding districts. To accomplish this, the City shall:
           A. Establish streetscape design standards for major roadways;
           B. Establish that where feasible roundabouts shall be the City’s preferred intersection alternative due to
                improved aesthetics, reduction in impervious surface areas, and additional landscaping area;
           C. Encourage the creation and maintenance median planters and widened parkway plantings;
           D. Retain mature trees in the public right-of-way;
           E. Emphasize the planting and maintaining of California Native tree species of sufficient height, spread,
                form and horticultural characteristics to create the desired streetscape canopy, shade, buffering from
                adjacent uses, and other desired streetscape characteristics, consistent with the Tree Ordinance or as
                recommended by the Tree Committee or as approved by the Architectural Review Commission.
           F.   Encourage the use of water-conserving landscaping, street furniture, decorative lighting and paving,
                arcaded walkways, public art, and other pedestrian-oriented features to enhance the streetscape
                appearance, comfort and safety.
           G. Identify gateways into the City including improvements such as landscaped medians, wayfinding and
                welcoming signage, arches, lighting enhancements, pavement features, sidewalks, and different
                crosswalk paving types.
           H. Encourage and where possible, require undergrounding of overhead utility lines and structures.
           I.   When possible, signs in the public right-of-way should be consolidated on a single, low-profile standard.
           J.   In the Downtown, streetscape improvements shall be consistent with the Downtown Pedestrian Plan.

Chapter 2
                                      10.     TRUCK TRANSPORTATION
The delivery of most goods and materials to businesses in San Luis Obispo is done by trucks. Delivery services are
essential to the functioning of the City. However, commercial trucks can cause traffic congestion in the downtown, and
create noise and safety problems in residential areas.
The following policies and programs spell out how the City intends to manage delivery services so that problems
associated with truck transportation are minimized.
10.1.    Policies
    10.1.1. Truck Routes
              The City shall require STA-sized and CA legal trucks to use the City's truck routes as designated in Figure 2.
10.2.    Programs
    10.2.1. Idling Trucks
              Trucks should turn off motors when parked. The City shall work with the Air Pollution Control District (APCD)
              for guidance in establishing standards that address air and noise pollution from idling trucks.
    10.2.2. Home Occupations
              The City's Home Occupation Permit Regulations should be amended to ensure that commercial trucks are not
              used to make regular deliveries to home occupations in residential areas.
    10.2.3. Commercial Loading Zones
              The City shall continue to provide reserved commercial truck loading zones in appropriate downtown areas.
    10.2.4. Truck Circulation
              The City shall adopt an ordinance regulating the movement of heavy vehicles.

              APPENDIX B. MULTIMODAL LEVEL OF SERVICE DEFINITIONS
Multimodal LOS Evaluation Methodology
The phrase, “Complete Streets” in present-day planning and policy lexicons introduces confusion about the meaning of
the phrase. Streets considered complete are those which meet the transportation needs for all users, such as pedestrians,
bicyclists, transit riders, children, older adults, differently abled people, freight vehicle drivers, and taxis. However, many
roadways do not serve all of these user types, nor are all roadways intended for use by everyone. For example, most
freeways prohibit access by pedestrians and bicyclists. Most trails prohibit access by motorized vehicles. However, if a
roadway provides access to some type of land use, such as a retail store, civic building, school, residence, or employment,
it can be expected that a variety of people will use that roadway. The degree to which a street is considered complete
depends on several factors, including who are the likely and the desired users.
Urban Streets Methodology from the 2010 HCM
The HCM 2010 Urban Streets is an integrated methodology that evaluates multimodal levels of service (LOS). LOS is
analyzed for each of the four primary roadway users: pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists, and transit passengers. The
multimodal LOS methodology utilizes a number of factors, most of which are infrastructure-related, to assess a qualitative
LOS score based on user perception. Roadways are analyzed for each mode in one-hour increments for each direction of
travel.
There is no single LOS score in the Urban Streets methodology that combines results for all travel modes. Combining the
scores into an overall roadway score has the potential to mask important deficiencies for a certain mode because of
weighting. To illustrate, a roadway with large volumes of vehicles and a favorable LOS for motorists may subsume LOS
deficiencies for other roadway users if a singular multimodal LOS score were analyzed for the corridor.
The LOS for each mode is analyzed individually, although input factors can affect the analysis for more than one travel
mode. For example, the percent of occupied on-street parking is a factor for both the bicyclist and pedestrian LOS.
Generating LOS scores for each roadway user type allows the comparison of the quality of service amongst the different
modes. Furthermore, the individual scores facilitate quantification and examination of tradeoffs between modes for a
given streetscape design feature or strategy, which assist with the analysis of project alternatives and prioritization of
pedestrian, bicyclist, motorist, and transit passenger facility improvements.
This methodology can also enable local jurisdictions to adopt a street classification system that is multimodal and
identifies priority users for which LOS thresholds can be established. Traditional street classification systems (Freeway,
Arterial, Collector, Local) tend to be derived from a motorist’s perspective. As such, thresholds are established for
motorist LOS, but have not been established for other modes. A multimodal classification system may expand or redefine
the streets to include transit, pedestrian, or bicyclist priority. Thus, LOS thresholds could be established for the priority
mode by the street classification. As an example, central business district roadways could have LOS thresholds for
pedestrian and transit access but no thresholds for motorist or bicyclist access.
As illustrated in Figure B-1, the methodology analyzes and provides the directional LOS results for a facility, which is a
combination of two or more segments (roadway link with a downstream intersection that is typically signalized).
Additionally, pedestrian and bicyclist LOS analysis and results further divide each segment into the links and downstream
intersections. When reviewing LOS results, it’s suggested that attention is paid to the component results, as the facility
scores have the potential to mask deficiencies.
                                                               Page B-1

Chapter 2
Figure B-1        Multimodal LOS Analysis Components
Factors included in the evaluation of LOS for each mode are based on the roadway user’s perspective, as described below,
for pedestrians, bicyclists, and transit passengers.
Pedestrian LOS Factors
The following factors lead to a superior level of service for pedestrians on an urban street:
        Providing a walkway on both sides of the roadway with ample width that allows side-by-side walking
        Distancing the walkway away from vehicular traffic using bike lanes, shoulders, on-street parking, buffers, trees,
         and landscaping
        Reducing vehicle volumes and speeds, particularly those closest to the walkway
        Limiting delay for pedestrians at signalized intersections
        Providing raised medians that can serve as pedestrian refuges at both signalized and unsignalized locations
        Removing permitted left turn movements by vehicles at signalized intersections
        Prohibiting right turn movements on red by vehicles
        Narrowing the crossing distances at intersections
A pedestrian density LOS can override the pedestrian quality of service calculations if sidewalk crowding is an issue. This
may be the case in dense urban areas or near stadiums or concert halls before or after major events.
Bicyclist LOS Factors
The following factors lead to a superior level of service for bicyclists on an urban street:
        Providing bikes lanes on both sides of the roadway with ample width
        Excellent pavement condition that is free of potholes, damage, and debris
        Distancing the bike lane away from vehicular traffic as much as possible
        Reducing vehicle volumes and speeds, particularly those closest to the bike lane
        Reducing the number of trucks, particularly those closest to the bike lane
        Removing or reducing on-street parking
        Narrowing the crossing distances at intersections
        Providing bike lanes through intersections
        Limiting the number of commercial driveways or driveways serving high-density residential buildings along the
         street
        Limiting or reducing the number of unsignalized intersections along the street
                                                            Page B-2

                                                                                     Circulation Element
                                                                                                                 
Transit Passenger LOS Factors
Transit passenger level of service can be derived for buses, streetcars, and light rail operating on surface streets. The
following factors lead to a superior level of service for transit passengers on an urban street:
        Reliable transit service with frequencies of 15 minutes or less
        Higher transit travel speeds
        High quality walkways leading to the transit stops (derived from the pedestrian LOS score)
        Numerous transit stop locations with benches and shelters
        On-board crowding less than 80%, meaning passengers can have a choice of seats
                                                     Safety Factors
The methodology does not include collisions as a factor. However, perceived safety is incorporated into the methodology
by way of vehicle volumes and speeds along the corridor links as well as the number of conflicting vehicle movements at
intersections.
                                                    Study Facilities
As part of the General Plan Update, staff from the City of San Luis Obispo and the consultant team identified thirteen
roadways for multimodal level of service evaluation. Those roadways are:
        Broad Street between Higuera Street and Orcutt Road
        Higuera Street between Johnson Avenue and High Street
        Marsh Street between Johnson Avenue and Higuera Street
        Monterey Street between Grand Avenue and Chorro Street
        Chorro Street between Foothill Boulevard and Marsh Street
        Santa Rosa Street between Highland Drive and Pismo Street
        High Street between Higuera Street and Broad Street
        South Higuera Street between High Street and Los Osos Valley Road
        Madonna Road between Higuera Street and Los Osos Valley Road
        Foothill Boulevard between California Boulevard and Patricia Drive
        Johnson Avenue between Monterey Street and Laurel Lane
        California Boulevard between Foothill Boulevard and San Luis Drive
        Osos Street between Palm Street and Upham Street
These roadways were analyzed for both the AM and PM peak hours for each direction of travel. Multimodal analysis of
these roadways establishes baseline conditions and sets the stage for future examination and evaluation of these and
other roadways. The purpose for selecting these roadways was to establish a cross-section of facility and area types,
providing opportunities to compare and contrast performance on various facilities and in assorted areas. Future analysis
of these and additional roadways will contribute to development of a multimodal network within the city.
Note: Multimodal Level of Service is based on the user’s perspective of a given mode’s quality of service. Quality of
Service is based on multiple factors including the physical features within the shared right-of-way environment as well as
traffic operations and service provisions.

                                            LOS A represents free-flow travel with an excellent level of comfort and convenience
      A                    < 10
                                            and the freedom to maneuver.
                                            LOS B has stable operating conditions, but the presence of other road users causes a
      B               > 10 and < 20         noticeable, though slight, reduction in comfort, convenience, and maneuvering
                                            freedom.
                                            LOS C has stable operating conditions, but the operation of individual users is
      C               > 20 and < 35
                                            substantially affected by the interaction with others in the traffic stream.
                                            LOS D represents high-density, but stable flow. Users experience severe restriction in
      D               > 35 and < 55
                                            speed and freedom to maneuver, with poor levels of comfort and convenience.
                                            LOS E represents operating conditions at or near capacity. Speeds are reduced to a
                                            low but relatively uniform value. Freedom to maneuver is difficult with users
      E               > 55 and < 80
                                            experiencing frustration and poor comfort and convenience. Unstable operation is
                                            frequent, and minor disturbances in traffic flow can cause breakdown conditions.
                                            LOS F is used to define forced or breakdown conditions. This condition exists
                                            wherever the volume of traffic exceeds the capacity of the roadway. Long queues
      F                    > 80
                                            can form behind these bottleneck points with queued traffic traveling in a stop-and-
                                            go fashion.

                                                    FOREWORD
This Housing Element updates the 2010 Housing Element and addresses important changes to State housing law. Like the
previous element, it has been prepared to help San Luis Obispo City residents’ secure safe housing that will meet their
personal needs and financial circumstances, and to meet State law. In January 2014, the City, State and Nation are
grappling with reduced resources for housing programs at all government levels. This is the difficult fiscal environment
we face with this Housing Element update.
The Housing Element is part of the General Plan and is one of eight “elements” or chapters of that plan. It sets out the
City’s goals, policies and programs for housing over the next five years. It works in concert with the other plan elements to
help achieve the broad community goals as expressed in the General Plan Land Use Element. The other elements are
Circulation, Noise, Safety, Conservation and Open Space, Parks and Recreation, and Water and Wastewater. Housing
elements must be updated periodically, according to a State adopted schedule. This Element is due to be updated in
2019.
The Housing Element is available on the City’s website at www.slocity.org, and copies of the General Plan are available
from the Community Development Department, City of San Luis Obispo, 919 Palm Street, San Luis Obispo, California
93401-3218. Phone: (805) 781-7170. Fax: (805) 781-7173.

                                   CHAPTER 1.                INTRODUCTION
1.10 Purpose
     The City has prepared this document to help its citizen’s secure adequate and affordable housing, and to meet
     State law. In addition, this Housing Element update has the following basic objectives:
            To evaluate and quantify community housing needs, constraints and available resources to effectively
             satisfy those needs;
            To increase public awareness and understanding of the City's housing situation and its goals to encourage
             public participation in addressing those housing needs;
            To provide a comprehensive document that includes goals, policies and programs to help guide community
             efforts to meet housing needs through informed decision-making on land use and housing choices;
            To help develop more affordable housing, and a wider variety of housing, to meet the City's housing needs
             for the current planning period which runs from January 1, 2014 to June 30, 2019;
            To track and document the effectiveness of City programs in meeting housing needs, and to evaluate
             opportunities for improving those programs;
            To enable the City to secure financial assistance for the construction of affordable housing for extremely
             low, very low-, low- and moderate income persons; and
            To fully integrate environmental sustainability, “smart growth” and conservation strategies into the City’s
             housing policy.
     Under State law, cities are responsible for planning for the well-being of their citizens. This Housing Element sets
     forth the City’s policies and detailed programs for meeting existing and future housing needs, for preserving and
     enhancing neighborhoods, and for increasing affordable housing opportunities for extremely low, very-low, low
     and moderate income persons and households. It is the primary policy guide for local decision-making on all
     housing matters. The Housing Element also describes the City´s demographic, economic and housing factors, as
     required by State law.
1.20 Citizen Participation
     The Housing Element expresses the community’s housing priorities, goals, values and hopes for the future.
     Preparing the Element is a sizable task that involves extensive community input and the work of many individuals.
     Under State law, local governments must be diligent in soliciting participation by all segments of the community
     in this effort. During preparation of this Element Update, citizen participation was actively encouraged through
     the following forums:
            Two public workshops focusing on housing needs, issues and opportunities in the community.
            Three public hearings before the Planning Commission and one public hearing before the City Council;
            Posting the Draft Housing Element on the City’s website;
            Public notices in local newspapers and flyers/posters distributed to a variety of public locations.
            Posted workshop information on community calendars for KSBY News and KCBX local radio station.
            Regular e-mail updates to a list of interested parties with links to staff reports, draft housing element and
             housing resources.
                                                        Page 3-15

Chapter 3
            Presentations and discussions with a variety of stakeholder groups including Residents for Quality
             Neighborhoods, San Luis Obispo Association of Realtors, Economic Vitality Corporation, Executive Director
             of the Housing Trust Fund, Home Builders Association, Community Action Partnership, Chamber of
             Commerce, and Workforce Housing Coalition., Participation in the workshops and meetings from a variety
             of residents and stakeholders has resulted in an improved understanding of existing housing programs and
             housing issues in the community, and increased public participation in the update process. Input from
             residents and stakeholder groups has been instrumental in providing information for program
             modifications and in providing a better sense of housing issues for the decision-makers when considering
             new policies or programs.
            A 15 member task force was appointed to complete work on the City’s 2013 Land Use and Circulation
             Elements update. Input received from this task force related to housing issues was considered during the
             update of this Housing Element. Appendix I provides additional details regarding community outreach
             efforts.
1.30 Consistency with State Planning Law
     California cities and counties must prepare housing elements as required by State law set forth in Sections 65580
     to 65589.8 of the California Government Code. The law mandates that housing elements include “identification
     and analysis of existing and projected housing needs and a statement of goals, policies, quantified objectives and
     scheduled programs for the preservation, improvement and development of housing.” This Element fulfills that
     requirement and provides a detailed strategy for implementing the City’s housing goals through 2019.
     State housing goals rely on the effective implementation of housing policies at the local level. To ensure local
     housing policies are consistent with State law, the State Department of Housing and Community Development
     (HCD) reviews local housing elements and reports its written findings to the local government. Housing elements
     must also be consistent with the jurisdiction’s other general plan elements and must address several specific
     requirements regarding the element’s scope and content.
1.40 General Plan Consistency
     The Housing Element is one part of the City of San Luis Obispo General Plan. State law requires that general plans
     contain an integrated and internally consistent set of goals or policies. Although the Housing Element is the
     primary source of information on housing policies, programs and resources, other General Plan documents also
     address or affect housing. By law, new development projects must be consistent with all elements of the General
     Plan.
     For example, the Land Use Element and Circulation Element set the City's policies for land use and transportation,
     which in turn, affect how, when and where the City's housing needs can best be met. While housing is important,
     it is but one of many community goals the General Plan addresses. The other elements contain policies that seek
     to preserve and enhance the quality of life San Luis Obispo citizens enjoy. Clean air and water, open space, parks
     and recreation, preservation of natural, historic and cultural resources, public services and safety are also
     essential community attributes. These policies are of equal importance with those of the Housing Element.
     This Element has been reviewed and determined to be consistent with the City’s other General Plan elements,
     and the policies and programs in the Housing Element reflect policies and programs contained in other parts of
     the General Plan. Appendix G includes that evaluation. As other elements are updated or amended, the Housing
     Element will be reviewed to ensure general plan consistency is maintained.

                              CHAPTER 2.                COMMUNITY FACTORS
2.10 Community Overview
     San Luis Obispo is a compact urban community blessed with rich ethnic, cultural and historical traditions. Its
     namesake, Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa, founded in 1772, stands as the community’s physical, cultural and
     spiritual center. With an estimated 2013 population of 45,541 people, San Luis Obispo is the largest city in terms
     of population in San Luis Obispo County and serves as the County seat. Situated in a valley and framed by rolling
     hills, the City’s setting and visual character are distinctive. The “morros”, a series of weathered peaks that are the
     remnants of ancient volcanoes, transect the City and create the City’s unique skyline. San Luis Obispo is home to
     California Polytechnic State University, Cuesta College and Camp San Luis Obispo (California Army National
     Guard), and is the retail, business, governmental, and transportation hub of the County.
     In assessing the City’s housing issues and needs, many factors were considered. These factors became the
     foundation for the Element’s preliminary goals, policies and programs. Preliminary housing goals and policies
     were then refined through the public review process. An overview of these factors is described below, including
     snapshots of the City’s key demographic, economic and housing characteristics. An analysis of community factors
     is provided in Appendix A.
2.20 Demographic Snapshots
         San Luis Obispo’s population has grown at a slow, steady pace since 1980. Looking back over the last 33
             years, the City has grown at an average rate of about one percent per year, with periods of faster or slower
             growth reflecting national and statewide economic cycles. For example, in the late 1980s, the City grew at
             an annual average rate of two percent. This was followed by a much slower annual average growth rate of
             0.3 percent between 1990 and 2013, well below the General Plan’s one percent growth maximum over the
             Housing Element cycle.
            When compared with California, the most ethnically diverse state in the nation, the City and County of San
             Luis Obispo are less ethnically diverse. The 2010 Census found that over 75 percent of the City is white,
             about five percent is Asian, with much smaller percentages of Native Americans, Pacific Islanders, other
             single races or persons self-identifying with two or more races. Persons of Hispanic or Latino origin are
             classified separately under the 2010 Census and can be of any race. About 15 percent of the City’s
             population is Hispanic, compared with 21 and 38 percent in the County and State, respectively.
            Many segments of the City’s population have difficulty finding affordable housing due to their economic,
             physical or sociological circumstances. These special needs groups may include the elderly, families, single
             parent households, people with disabilities, very low and low-income residents, and the homeless.
            In 2010, City households earned less, on the average, than their County and State counterparts. The
             median household income was $42,461, compared with $56,967 for the County and $57,708 Statewide.
             This reflects the high percentage of student households in San Luis Obispo. Many students attending
             California State Polytechnic University (Cal Poly) and Cuesta College are nominally classified as lower
             income, although they often have significant financial resources through parental support.
            While median City household incomes were less than many other areas of coastal California, median City
             housing costs were higher than both the County and State. Housing costs in San Luis Obispo have risen
             sharply in recent years while average household incomes have risen slowly or remained steady. Despite
             the housing market’s downturn in 2008 and 2009, there is a continuing disparity between household
             income and housing costs which forces many to seek housing outside the City.

Chapter 3
         San Luis Obispo contains the largest concentration of jobs in the County. During workdays, the City’s
          population increases to an estimated 70,000 persons.
2.30 Housing Snapshots
        While the City median housing cost saw a slow decrease since the previous housing element in 2009, the
          City saw its first increase in 2013. Since 2009, the median housing cost was lowest in 2012, $502,000, and
          was highest in 2013, $569,000. By comparison, median housing costs in the County saw their lowest
          median housing costs in 2011, $360,000, and the highest median housing cost in 2013, $390,000. This
          pattern in both the City and County was also seen in the State, which saw its lowest median housing cost in
          2012, $266,000, and the highest median housing cost in 2013, $326,000. A promising sign of a recovering
          economy.
         Compared to 2009, the number of City building permits for new housing units issued in 2013 was up 40
          percent. Sales of new and pre-owned housing units in the six-county Southern California region in 2012
          also increased.
         The City’s housing tenure is approximately 39% owner-occupied and 61% renter-occupied. Over the past
          decade the City has seen a 2% decrease in owner-occupied housing units. This shift is consistent with
          ownership trends during the period for the County and State.
         In the past 13 years, the rate of housing production in San Luis Obispo exceeded the rate of population
          growth. Between 2000 and 2013, the City added about 1,362 residents – an increase of about three
          percent. During the same period, the City’s housing stock grew by 1,389 units – an increase of about seven
          percent.
         San Luis Obispo’s housing market is strongly influenced by Cal Poly University and Cuesta College
          enrollment. Owner occupied housing units saw a 2 percent decrease since 2000 even with the large
          increase of on-campus student housing at Cal Poly. Cuesta College does not offer on-campus housing.
          Most of the area’s students live off campus in single family or multi-family rental units in the City of San
          Luis Obispo. Under City zoning regulations, up to five adult students can live together in a house and share
          rental costs. Consequently, college students can often out-compete non-student households for rental
          housing in areas that were historically single-family residential neighborhoods.
         Approximately sixty percent of the City’s housing stock was built before 1980. Despite its age, the City’s
          housing stock is generally in fair to good condition, with little outward evidence of substandard or blighted
          conditions. Illegal garage conversions and “bootleg” second units in low- and medium-density residential
          neighborhoods, lack of property maintenance, noise and parking have been the focus of citizen complaints
          and city code enforcement actions.
         While San Luis Obispo City appears mostly “built out”, significant areas of developable land remain that
          could help meet existing and future housing needs. A residential capacity inventory conducted by the City
          in 2013, seen in Appendix K, indicates that the City has approximately 725 acres of vacant, underutilized or
          blighted property that can accommodate approximately 3,477 dwelling units. Much of this capacity is
          located within the City’s Margarita and Orcutt Specific Plan areas.
2.40 Neighborhood Snapshots
        San Luis Obispo became a town in 1856. It has evolved from a small rural village of just over 2,200 people
          in 1880 to a vibrant “metropolitan” area of over 45,541 residents in 2013. Its diverse neighborhoods
          reflect that evolution in terms of land use, population density, street width and appearance, applicable
          development codes and architectural style. The oldest neighborhoods are close to the downtown area,
          roughly bordered by State Highway 101, the railroad tracks and High Street. The newest neighborhoods
          are in the south and southwest areas of the City.

                                                                           Housing Element
                                                                                                    
 San Luis Obispo has a strong “sense of place.” It began with the founding of Mission San Luis Obispo De
  Tolosa in 1772, and before that, was home to a large Chumash settlement, attracted to the area due to its
  mild climate and abundant resources. San Luis Obispo has been shaped by persons of many backgrounds,
  including: Native Americans, Spanish, Mexican, Chinese, English, French, German, Irish, Portuguese, Swiss-
  Italian, Japanese, Filipino, and many others. The community takes pride in its rich, multi-ethnic and multi-
  cultural heritage, and its many historic homes and commercial buildings. Architectural and historic
  preservation are important considerations in many neighborhoods.
 San Luis Obispo’s neighborhoods traditionally have been made up mostly of single-family housing. Low-
  density, detached single-family housing is still the City’s predominant residential land use by land area. Of
  the roughly 13 square miles of zoned land, about 20 percent is zoned for low-density residential
  development. By contrast, about 11 percent is zoned for multi-family residential use (Medium, Medium-
  High, and High density residential uses).
 Code enforcement, neighborhood compatibility and property maintenance complaints in low- and
  medium-density residential neighborhoods have increased dramatically in recent years. Between 1994 and
  2013, Community Development Department staff responded to a steadily increasing number of building
  and zoning code violations, garage conversions, substandard housing, high-occupancy residential uses,
  fence height, trailers, noise disturbances, parking and land use violations. During this period, the number
  of enforcement requests grew from 386 in 1994 to 772 complaints in 2013, an increase of 50 percent.
  Neighborhood preservation is addressed by several City departments. In 2000, the Office of Neighborhood
  Services was established as part of the Police Department to address parking, property maintenance and
  noise violations.

                  CHAPTER 3.                 GOALS, POLICIES AND PROGRAMS
3.10 Overview
     This chapter includes the Housing Implementation Plan for the period January 2014 to June 2019. The following
     goals, policies and programs are based on an assessment of the City’s needs, opportunities and constraints; and
     an evaluation of its existing policies and programs.
3.20 Goals, Policies and Programs.
     This chapter describes the City's housing goals, policies and programs, which together form the blueprint for
     housing actions during the Housing Element’s planning period. Goals, policies and programs are listed in top-to-
     bottom order, with goals at the top and being the most general statements, working down to programs, the most
     specific statements of intent. Here is how the three policy levels differ:
           Goals are the desired results that the City will attempt to reach over the long term. They are general
            expressions of community values or preferred end states, and therefore, are abstract in nature and are
            rarely fully attained. While it may not be possible to attain all goals during this Element's planning period,
            they will, nonetheless, be the basis for City policies and actions during this period.
           Policies are specific statements that will guide decision-making. Policies serve as the directives to
            developers, builders, design professionals, decision makers and others who will initiate or review new
            development projects. Some policies stand alone as directives, but others require that additional actions
            be taken. These additional actions are listed under "programs" below. Most policies have a time frame
            that fits within this Element's planning period. In this context, “shall” means the policy is mandatory;
            “should” or “will” indicate the policy should be followed unless there are compelling or contradictory
            reasons to do otherwise.
           Programs are the core of the City’s housing strategy. These include on-going programs, procedural
            changes, general plan changes, rezonings or other actions that help achieve housing goals. Programs
            translate goals and policies into actions.

                                                                                       Housing Element
                                                                                                             
                                              GOAL 1.          SAFETY
Provide safe, decent shelter for all residents.
Policies
1.1.     Assist those citizens unable to obtain safe shelter on their own.
1.2.     Support and inform the public about fair housing laws and programs that allow equal housing access for all city
         residents.
1.3.     Maintain a level of housing code enforcement sufficient to correct unsafe, unsanitary or illegal conditions and
         to preserve the inventory of safe housing.
Programs
1.4.     Rehabilitate using Federal, State and local housing funds, such as Community Development Block Grant Funds,
         with the objectives of 30 single-family, 75 multi-family, 10 historic, and 20 mobile homes for extremely low,
         very low, low and moderate income homeowners and renters during the planning period.
1.5.     Continue code enforcement to expedite the removal of illegal or unsafe dwellings, to eliminate hazardous site
         or property conditions, and resolve chronic building safety problems.
1.6.     Consider a Rental Inspection Program to improve the condition of the City’s Housing Stock.
1.7.     Continue to support local and regional solutions to homelessness by funding programs such as the Maxine
         Lewis Memorial Shelter and The Prado Day Center.
1.8.     Create an educational campaign for owners of older residences informing them of ways to reduce the seismic
         hazards commonly found in such structures, and encouraging them to undertake seismic upgrades.

Chapter 3
                                       GOAL 2.           AFFORDABILITY
Accommodate affordable housing production that helps meet the City’s quantified objectives.
Policies
2.1.     Income Levels For Affordable Housing households. For purposes of this Housing Element, affordable housing is
         that which is obtainable by a household with a particular income level, as further described in the City’s
         Affordable Housing Standards. Housing affordable to Extremely Low, Very Low, Low, and Moderate income
         persons or households shall be considered “affordable housing.” Income levels are defined as follows:
            Extremely low                30% or less of County median household income
              Very low:                  31 to 50% of County median household income.
              Low:                       51% to 80% of County median household income.
              Moderate:                  81% to 120% of County median household income.
              Above moderate:            121% or more of County median household income.
2.2.     Index of Affordability. The Index of Affordability shall be whether the monthly cost of housing fits within the
         following limits:
            For extremely low income households, not more than 25% of monthly income.
              For very low- and low-income households, not more than 25% of monthly income.
              For moderate income households, not more than 30% of monthly income.
              For above-moderate income households, no index.
         These indices may be modified or expanded if the State of California modifies or expands its definition of
         affordability for these income groups.
2.3.     For housing to qualify as "affordable" under the provisions of this Element, guarantees must be presented that
         ownership or rental housing units will remain affordable for the longest period allowed by State law, or for a
         shorter period under an equity-sharing or housing rehabilitation agreement with the City.
2.4.     Encourage housing production for all financial strata of the City's population, in the proportions shown in the
         Regional Housing Needs Allocation, for the 2014 - 2019 planning period. These proportions are: extremely low
         income, 12 percent, very low income, 12 percent; low income, 16 percent; moderate income, 18 percent; and
         above moderate income, 42 percent.
Programs
2.5.     Continue to manage the Affordable Housing Fund so that the fund serves as a sustainable resource for
         supporting affordable housing development. The fund shall serve as a source of both grant funding and below-
         market financing for affordable housing projects; and funds shall be used to support a wide variety of housing
         types at the following income levels: extremely low, very low, low, and moderate, but with a focus on
         production efficiency to maximize housing benefits for the City’s financial investment, and to support high-
         quality housing projects that would not be feasible without Affordable Housing Fund support.
                                                        Page 3-22

                                                                                  Housing Element
                                                                                                            
2.6.  Continue to review existing and proposed building, planning, engineering and fire policies and standards as
      housing developments are reviewed to determine whether changes are possible that could assist the
      production of affordable housing, or that would encourage preservation of housing rather than conversion to
      non-residential uses, provided such changes would not conflict with other General Plan policies. Such periodic
      reviews will seek to remove regulations that have been superseded, are redundant or are no longer needed.
2.7.  Continue to implement existing procedures that speed up the processing of applications, construction permits,
      and water and sewer service priorities for affordable housing projects. City staff and commissions shall give
      such projects priority in allocating work assignments, scheduling, conferences and hearings, and in preparing
      and issuing reports and water and sewer service allocations.
2.8.  Continue to pursue outside funding sources for the payment of City impact fees so that new dwellings that
      meet the City’s affordable housing standards can mitigate their facility and service impacts without adversely
      affecting housing affordability.
2.9.  To the extent outside funding sources can be identified to offset impacts on City funds, exempt dwellings that
      meet the moderate income, Affordable Housing Standards from planning, building and engineering
      development review and permit fees, including water meter installation fee. Maintain exemptions for
      extremely-low, very-low and low-income households.
2.10. Continue to coordinate public and private sector actions to encourage the development of housing that meets
      the City’s housing needs.
2.11. Continue to assist with the issuance of bonds, tax credit financing, loan underwriting or other financial tools to
      help develop or preserve affordable units through various programs, including, but not limited to: (1) below-
      market financing through the SLO County Housing Trust Fund and (2) subsidized mortgages for extremely low,
      very-low, low- and moderate income persons and first-time home buyers, and (3) self-help or “sweat equity”
      homeowner housing.
2.12. Consider incorporating HOA fees and a standard allowance for utilities in the calculation for affordable rents
      and home sales prices.
2.13. In conjunction with the Housing Authority and other local housing agencies, continue to provide on-going
      technical assistance and education to tenants, property owners and the community at large on the need to
      preserve at-risk units as well as the available tools to help them do so.
2.14. In conjunction with local housing providers and the local residential design community, continue to provide
      technical assistance as requested by the public, builders, design professionals and developers regarding design
      strategies to achieve affordable housing.
2.15. Evaluate the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance requirements and the effect of Table 2A on the City’s ability to
      provide affordable housing in the proportions shown in the Regional Housing Needs Allocation, per Policy 2.4.
2.16. The City will evaluate and consider including a workforce level of affordability in its Affordable Housing
      Standards to increase housing options in the City for those making between 121 percent and 160 percent of the
      San Luis Obispo County median income. This affordability category cannot be used to meet inclusionary
      housing ordinance requirements and is not eligible for City Affordable Housing Funds.
                                                       Page 3-23

Chapter 3
2.17.    Continue to consider increasing residential densities above state density bonus allowances for projects that
         provide housing for low, very low and extremely low income households.
                                GOAL 3.          HOUSING CONSERVATION
Conserve existing housing and prevent the loss of safe housing and the displacement of current
occupants.
Policies
3.1.     Continue to encourage the rehabilitation, remodeling or relocation of sound or rehabitable housing rather than
         demolition. Demolition of non-historic housing may be permitted where conservation of existing housing
         would preclude the achievement of other housing objectives or adopted City goals.
3.2.     Discourage the removal or replacement of housing affordable to extremely low, very-low, low- and moderate
         income households, and avoid permit approvals, private development, municipal actions or public projects that
         remove or adversely impact such housing unless such actions are necessary to achieve General Plan objectives
         and: (1) it can be demonstrated that rehabilitation of lower-cost units at risk of replacement is financially or
         physically infeasible, or (2) an equivalent number of new units comparable or better in affordability and
         amenities to those being replaced is provided, or (3) the project will correct substandard, blighted or unsafe
         housing; and (4) removal or replacement will not adversely affect housing which is already designated, or is
         determined to qualify for designation as a historic resource.
3.3.     Encourage seismic upgrades of older dwellings to reduce the risk of bodily harm and the loss of housing in an
         earthquake.
3.4.     Encourage the construction, preservation, rehabilitation or expansion of residential hotels, group homes,
         integrated community apartments, and single-room occupancy dwellings.
3.5.     Preserve historic homes and other types of historic residential buildings, historic districts and unique or
         landmark neighborhood features.
3.6.     Preserve the fabric, amenities, yards (i.e. setbacks), and overall character and quality of life of established
         neighborhoods.
3.7.     Encourage and support creative strategies for the rehabilitation and adaptation and reuse of residential,
         commercial, and industrial structures for housing.
                                                         Page 3-24
                                                                                         Housing Element
                                                                                                                   
Programs
3.8.     Adopt an ordinance that implements policy 3.2 to discourage removal or replacement of affordable housing.
3.9.     Correct unsafe, unsanitary or illegal housing conditions, improve accessibility and energy efficiency and
         improve neighborhoods by collaborating with agencies offering rehabilitation programs. City will use State or
         Federal grants or other housing funds to implement the program and provide services such as home
         weatherization, repair and universal access improvements.
3.10.    Continue to encourage the creation of dwellings in the Downtown Core (C-D Zone) and the Downtown Planning
         Area by continuing the "no net housing loss" program, consistent with Chapter 17.86 (Downtown Housing
         Conversion Regulations) of the Zoning Regulations.
3.11.    Continue to identify residential properties and districts eligible for local, State or Federal historic listing in
         accordance with guidelines and standards to help property owners repair, rehabilitate and improve properties
         in a historically and architecturally sensitive manner.
3.12.    Continue to monitor and track affordable housing units at-risk of being converted to market rate housing
         annually. Provide resources to support the Housing Authority, and local housing agencies, purchase and
         manage at-risk units.
3.13.    Working with non-profit organizations, faith-based organizations, or the Housing Authority of the City of San
         Luis Obispo, the City will encourage rehabilitation of residential, commercial or industrial buildings to expand
         extremely low, very-low, low or moderate income rental housing opportunities.
                                 GOAL 4.          MIXED-INCOME HOUSING
Preserve and accommodate existing and new mixed-income neighborhoods and seek to prevent
neighborhoods or housing types that are segregated by economic status.
Policies
4.1.     Within newly developed neighborhoods, housing that is affordable to various economic strata should be
         intermixed rather than segregated into separate enclaves. The mix should be comparable to the relative
         percentages of extremely low, very-low, low, moderate and above-moderate income households in the City’s
         quantified objectives.
4.2.     Include both market-rate and affordable units in apartment and residential condominium projects and intermix
         the types of units. Affordable units should be comparable in size, appearance and basic quality to market-rate
         units.
4.3.     Extremely-low and very low-income housing, such as that developed by the Housing Authority of the City of
         San Luis Obispo or other housing providers, may be located in any zone that allows housing, and should be
         dispersed throughout the City rather than concentrated in one neighborhood or zone.
                                                          Page 3-25

Chapter 3
4.4.     In its discretionary actions, housing programs and activities, the City shall affirmatively further fair housing and
         promote equal housing opportunities for persons of all economic segments of the community.
Programs
4.5.     Review new development proposals for compliance with City regulations and revise projects or establish
         conditions of approval as needed to implement the mixed-income policies.
4.6.     Consider amending the City’s Inclusionary Housing Ordinance and Affordable Housing Incentives to require that
         affordable units in a development be of similar number of bedrooms, character and basic quality as the non-
         restricted units in locations that avoid segregation of such units.
                          GOAL 5.           HOUSING VARIETY AND TENURE
Provide variety in the location, type, size, tenure, and style of dwellings.
Policies
5.1.     Encourage the integration of appropriately scaled, special needs housing into developments or neighborhoods
         of conventional housing.
5.2.     Encourage mixed-use residential/commercial projects to include live-work and work-live units where housing
         and offices or other commercial uses are compatible.
5.3.     Encourage the development of housing above ground-level retail stores and offices to provide housing
         opportunities close to activity centers and to use land efficiently.
5.4.     In general, housing developments of twenty (20) or more units should provide a variety of dwelling types, sizes
         or forms of tenure.
Program
5.5.     Review new developments for compliance with City regulations and revise projects or establish conditions of
         approval as needed to implement the housing variety and tenure policies.

                                  GOAL 6.         HOUSING PRODUCTION
Plan for new housing to meet the full range of community housing needs.
Policies
6.1.     Consistent with the growth management portion of its Land Use Element and the availability of adequate
         resources, the City will plan to accommodate up to 1,144 dwelling units between January 2014 and June 2019
         in accordance with the assigned Regional Housing Needs Allocation.
6.2.     New commercial developments in the Downtown Core (C-D Zone) shall include housing, unless the City makes
         one of the following findings:
            A) Housing is likely to jeopardize the health, safety or welfare of residents or employees; or
            B) The property’s shape, size, topography or other physical factor makes construction of new dwellings
                 infeasible.
6.3.     If City services must be rationed to development projects, residential projects will be given priority over non-
         residential projects. As required by SB 1087, housing affordable to lower income households will be given first
         priority.
6.4.     City costs of providing services to housing development will be minimized. Other than for existing housing
         programs encouraging housing affordable to extremely low, very-low and low income persons, the City will not
         make new housing more affordable by shifting costs to existing residents.
6.5.     When sold, purchased or redeveloped for public or private uses, City-owned properties within the urban
         reserve shall include housing as either a freestanding project or part of a mixed-use development where land is
         suitable and appropriate for housing.
6.6.     Property located behind the former County General Hospital shall be designated a “Special Considerations”
         zone and may be considered suitable for residential development after further analysis and environmental
         review, provided that development be limited to site areas with average slopes of less than 20 percent, that
         approximately one-half of the total site area be dedicated for open space and/or public use, and that an
         additional water tank be provided if determined necessary to serve new development.
6.7.     Support the redevelopment of excess public and private utility properties for housing where appropriately
         located and consistent with the General Plan.
6.8.     Consistent with the City’s goal to stimulate higher density infill where appropriate in the Downtown Core (C-D
         Zone), the City shall consider changes to the Zoning Regulations that would allow for the development of
         smaller apartments and efficiency units.
6.9.     Encourage and support employer/employee financing programs and partnerships to increase housing
         opportunities specifically targeted towards the local workforce.
6.10.    To help meet the Quantified Objectives, the City will support residential infill development and promote higher
         residential density where appropriate.

Programs
6.11.  Maintain the General Plan and Residential Growth Management Regulations (SLOMC 17.88) exemption for new
       housing in the Downtown Core (C-D zone), and new housing in other zones that is enforceably restricted for
       extremely-low, very low, low- and moderate income households, pursuant to the Affordable Housing
       Standards.
6.12.  Continue to allow flexible parking regulations for housing development, especially in the Downtown Core (C-D
       Zone), including the possibilities of flexible use of city parking facilities by Downtown residents, where
       appropriate, and reduced or no parking requirements where appropriate guarantees limit occupancies to
       persons without motor vehicles or who provide proof of reserved, off-site parking. Such developments may be
       subject to requirements for parking use fees, use limitations and enforcement provisions.
6.13.  Continue to develop incentives to encourage additional housing in the Downtown Core (C-D Zone), particularly
       in mixed-use developments. Density based on average unit size in a project should be explored to encourage
       the development of smaller efficiency units.
6.14.  Specific plans for any new expansion area identified shall include R-3 and R-4 zoned land to ensure sufficient
       land is designated at appropriate densities to accommodate the development of extremely low, very-low and
       low income dwellings. These plans shall include sites suitable for subsidized rental housing and affordable
       rental and owner-occupied dwellings, and programs to support the construction of dwellings rather than
       payment of in-lieu housing fees. Such sites shall be integrated within neighborhoods of market-rate housing
       and shall be architecturally compatible with the neighborhood.
6.15.  Consider General Plan amendments to rezone commercial, manufacturing or public facility zoned areas for
       higher-density, infill or mixed use housing where land development patterns are suitable and where impact to
       Low-Density Residential areas is minimal. For example, areas to be considered for possible rezoning include,
       but are not limited to the following sites (shown in Figure 1 and further described in Appendix D, Table D-2):
         A) Portions of South Broad Street Corridor and Little Italy area
         B) 1499 San Luis Drive (rezone vacant and underutilized School District property)
         C) 1642 Johnson Avenue (vacant School District property)
         D) 4325 South Higuera Street (former P.G.&E. yard)
         E) 4355 Vachell Lane (vehicle storage)
         F) 173 Buckley Road (Avila Ranch)
         G) 2143 Johnson Avenue (adjacent to County Health Department)
         H) 3710 Broad Street (Plumbers and Steamfitters Union)
         I)   11950 Los Osos Valley Road (Pacific Beach High School)
         J)   2500 Block of Boulevard Del Campo (adjacent to Sinsheimer Park)
         K) 12165 Los Osos Valley Road (adjacent to Home Depot)

Chapter 3
6.16.  Continue to provide resources that support the SLO County Housing Trust fund’s efforts to provide below-
       market financing and technical assistance to affordable housing developers as a way to increase affordable
       housing production in the City of San Luis Obispo.
6.17.  Encourage residential development through infill development and densification within City Limits and in
       designated expansion areas over new annexation of land.
6.18.  Seek opportunities with other public agencies and public utilities to identify, assemble, develop, redevelop and
       recycle surplus land for housing, and to convert vacant or underutilized public, utility or institutional buildings
       to housing.
6.19.  Continue to incentivize affordable housing development with density bonuses, parking reductions and other
       development incentives, including City financial assistance.
6.20.  Continue to financially assist in the development of housing affordable to extremely low, very-low, low- or
       moderate income households during the planning period using State, Federal and local funding sources, with
       funding priority given to projects that result in the maximum housing benefits for the lowest household income
       levels.
6.21.  Actively seek new revenue sources, including State, Federal and private/non-profit sources, and financing
       mechanisms to assist affordable housing development for extremely low, very low and low or moderate
       income households and first- time homebuyers.
6.22.  Continue to exempt the rehabilitation or remodeling of up to 4 dwellings of up to 1200 square feet each from
       Architectural Review Commission review. New multi-unit housing may be allowed with “Minor or Incidental”
       or staff level architectural review, unless the dwellings are located on a sensitive or historically sensitive site.
6.23.  Assist in the production of affordable housing by identifying vacant or underutilized City-owned property
       suitable for housing, and dedicate public property, where feasible and appropriate for such purposes, as
       development projects are proposed.
6.24.  Community Development staff will proactively provide information for properties suitable for housing as
       identified in the Land Use and Housing Elements.
6.25.  Evaluate and consider amending the General Plan to designate the 46 acres associated with the former County
       General Hospital as a “Special Considerations” zone, suitable for housing development on areas of the site of
       less than 20 percent average slope, provided that open space dedication and public improvements are part of
       the project.
6.26.  Continue to update the Affordable Housing Incentives (Chapter 17.90, SLOMC) and Zoning Regulations to
       ensure density bonus incentives are consistent with State Law.
6.27.  Evaluate and consider increasing the residential density allowed in the Neighborhood-Commercial (CN), Office
       (O) and Downtown Commercial (CD) zoning districts. The City will evaluate allowing up to 24 units per acre in
       the CN and O zones, and up to 72 units per acre in the CD zone, twice the current density allowed in these
       areas.
                                                        Page 3-30

6.28.    Evaluate how lot patterns (i.e. size, shape, slope) in the City’s multi-family zones affect the City’s ability to meet
         housing production policies. If warranted, consider setting a minimum number of dwellings on each legal lot in
         the R-2, R-3 and R-4 zones, regardless of lot size, when other property development standards, such as parking,
         height limits and setbacks can be met.
6.29.    Continue to pursue incentives to encourage development of Secondary Dwelling Units (SDUs). Possible
         incentives include SDU design templates, flexible development standards, fee reductions or deferrals, or other
         measures to encourage the construction of SDUs where allowed by zoning.
6.30.    Evaluate and consider adopting Subdivision and Zoning Regulations changes to support small lot subdivisions,
         ownership bungalow court development. Eliminate the one acre minimum lot area for PD overlay zoning, and
         other alternatives to conventional subdivision design.
6.31.    Consider scaling development impact fees for residential development based on size, number of bedrooms,
         and room counts.
6.32.    Continue to submit annual Housing Element progress reports to the State Department of Housing and
         Community Development per Government Code Section 65400.
                              GOAL 7.            NEIGHBORHOOD QUALITY
Maintain, preserve and enhance the quality of neighborhoods, encourage neighborhood stability
and owner occupancy, and improve neighborhood appearance, function and sense of community.
Policies
7.1.     Within established neighborhoods, new residential development shall be of a character, size, density and
         quality that respects the neighborhood character and maintains the quality of life for existing and future
         residents.
7.2.     Higher density housing should maintain high quality standards for unit design, privacy, security, on-site
         amenities, and public and private open space. Such standards should be flexible enough to allow innovative
         design solutions in special circumstances, e.g. in developing mixed-use developments or in housing in the
         Downtown Core.
7.3.     Within established neighborhoods, housing should not be located on sites designated in the General Plan for
         parks or open space.
7.4.     Within expansion areas, new residential development should be an integral part of an existing neighborhood or
         should establish a new neighborhood, with pedestrian and bicycle linkages that provide direct, convenient and
         safe access to adjacent neighborhoods, schools and shopping areas.
7.5.     The creation of walled-off residential enclaves, or of separate, unconnected tracts, is discouraged because
         physical separations prevent the formation of safe, walkable, and enjoyable neighborhoods.
                                                         Page 3-31

Chapter 3
7.6.     Housing shall be sited to enhance safety along neighborhood streets and in other public and semi-public areas.
7.7.     The physical design of neighborhoods and dwellings should promote walking and bicycling and preserve open
         spaces and views.
7.8.     Encourage strategies and programs that increase long-term residency and stabilization in neighborhoods.
Programs
7.9.     Continue to implement varied strategies, such as early notification through electronic media, website
         improvements, neighborhood outreach meetings, etc., to ensure residents are aware of and able to participate
         in planning decisions affecting their neighborhoods early in the planning process.
7.10.    Continue to work directly with neighborhood groups and individuals to address concerns. Identify specific
         neighborhood needs, problems, trends and opportunities for improvements.
7.11.    Continue to fund neighborhood improvements, including sidewalks, traffic calming devices, crosswalks,
         parkways, street trees and street lighting to improve aesthetics, safety and accessibility.
7.12.    Continue to develop and implement neighborhood parking strategies, including parking districts, to address the
         lack of on- and off-street parking in residential areas.
7.13.    Continue the City’s Neighborhood Services and proactive enforcement programs to support neighborhood
         wellness.
                               GOAL 8.           SPECIAL HOUSING NEEDS
Encourage the creation and maintenance of housing for those with special housing needs.
Policies
8.1.     Encourage housing development that meets a variety of special needs, including large families, single parents,
         disabled persons, the elderly, students, veterans, the homeless, or those seeking congregate care, group
         housing, single-room occupancy or co-housing accommodations, utilizing universal design.
8.2.     Preserve manufactured housing or mobile home parks and support changes in these forms of tenure only if
         such changes provide residents with greater long-term security or comparable housing in terms of quality, cost,
         and livability.
8.3.     Encourage manufactured homes in Specific Plan Areas by:
           A) When the City considers adopting new specific plans, including policies that support owner-occupied
                manufactured home parks with amenities such as greenbelts, recreation facilities, and shopping services
                within a master planned community setting. Such parks could be specifically designed to help address
                the needs of those with mobility and transportation limitations.

         B) Establishing lot sizes, setback, and parking guidelines that allow for relatively dense placement of
              manufactured homes within the master planned neighborhood.
         C) Locating manufactured home parks near public transit facilities or provide public transportation services
              to the manufactured home parks to minimize the need for residents to own automobiles.
8.4.   Encourage Cal Poly University to continue to develop on-campus student housing to meet existing and future
       needs and to lessen pressure on City housing supply and transportation systems.
8.5.   Strengthen the role of on-campus housing by encouraging Cal Poly University to require freshmen and
       sophomore students to live on campus.
8.6.   Locate fraternities and sororities on the Cal Poly University campus. Until that is possible, they should be
       located in Medium-High and High Density residential zones near the campus.
8.7.   Encourage Cal Poly University to develop and maintain faculty and staff housing, consistent with the General
       Plan.
8.8.   Disperse special needs living facilities throughout the City where public transit and commercial services are
       available, rather than concentrating them in one district.
8.9.   Support continued efforts to implement the document “The Path Home: San Luis Obispo County’s 10 Year Plan
       to End Chronic Homelessness”.
8.10.  Encourage a variety of housing types that accommodate persons with disabilities and promote aging in place,
       including a goal of “visitability” in new residential units, with an emphasis on first-floor accessibility to the
       maximum extent feasible.
8.11.  Encourage changes to City regulations that would support the special housing needs of disabled persons,
       including persons with developmental disabilities.
8.12.  Assist the homeless and those at risk of becoming homeless by supporting shelters, temporary housing,
       transitional housing, and by facilitating general housing assistance.
Programs
8.13.  Continue to provide resources that support local and regional solutions to meeting the needs of the homeless
       and continue to support, jointly with other agencies, shelters and programs, such as Housing First and Rapid
       Rehousing, for the homeless and for displaced women and children.
8.14.  Continue the mobile home rent stabilization program to minimize increases in the cost of mobile home park
       rents.
8.15.  Continue to look for opportunities in specific plan areas suitable for tenant-owned mobile-home parks,
       cooperative or limited equity housing, manufactured housing, self-help housing, or other types of housing that
       meet special needs.
8.16.  Advocate developing more housing and refurbishing campus housing at Cal Poly University.
                                                        Page 3-33

Chapter 3
8.17.    Work with Cal Poly University Administration to secure designation of on-campus fraternity/sorority living
         groups.
8.18.    Jointly develop and implement a student housing plan and continue to support "good neighbor programs" with
         Cal Poly State University, Cuesta College and City residents. The programs should continue to improve
         communication and cooperation between the City and the schools, set on- campus student housing objectives
         and establish clear, effective standards for student housing in residential neighborhoods.
8.19.    Provide public educational information at the Community Development Department public counter on
         universal design concepts (i.e. aging in place) for new and existing residential dwellings.
8.20.    Transitional Housing and Supportive Housing: Continue to allow the establishment of transitional and
         supportive housing in all zoning districts where residential uses are allowed.
8.21.    Continue to look for opportunities (land, retail or commercial space, motels, apartments, housing units, mobile
         home parks) that can be acquired and converted to affordable permanent housing and permanent supportive
         housing for homeless persons and families.
8.22.    Consider addition of an overlay zone to existing and future mobile home and trailer park sites to provide
         constructive notice that additional requirements, such as rent stabilization and a mobile home park conversion
         ordinance may apply.
8.23.    Encourage the creation of housing for persons with developmental disabilities. The City will seek grant
         opportunities for housing construction and rehabilitation specifically targeted for persons with developmental
         disabilities.
8.24.    Continue to coordinate with the County, social services providers and non-profit organizations for delivery of
         existing, improved and expanded services, including case management, drug, alcohol, detoxification, and
         mental health services.
8.25.    Continue to engage the Homeless Services Oversight Council (HSOC) and Friends of Prado Day Center (FPDC) to
         identify, evaluate, and implement strategies to reduce the impacts of homelessness on the City.
   GOAL 9.          SUSTAINABLE HOUSING, SITE, AND NEIGHBORHOOD DESIGN
Encourage housing that is resource-conserving, healthful, economical to live in, environmentally
benign, and recyclable when demolished.
Policies
9.1.     Residential developments should promote sustainability in their design, placement, and use. Sustainability can
         be promoted through a variety of housing strategies, including the following:
           A) Maximize use of renewable, recycled-content, and recycled materials, and minimize use of building
                materials that require high levels of energy to produce or that cause significant, adverse environmental
                impacts.
                                                         Page 3-34
                                                                                   Housing Element
                                                                                                           
       B) Incorporate renewable energy features into new homes, including passive solar design, solar hot water,
           solar power, and natural ventilation and cooling.
       C) Minimize thermal island effects through reduction of heat-absorbing pavement and increased tree
           shading.
       D) Avoid building materials that may contribute to health problems through the release of gasses or glass
           fibers into indoor air.
       E) Design dwellings for quiet, indoors and out, for both the mental and physical health of residents.
       F) Design dwellings economical to live in because of reduced utility bills, low cost maintenance and
           operation, and improved occupant health.
       G) Use construction materials and methods that maximize the recyclability of a building’s parts.
       H) Educate public, staff, and builders to the advantages and approaches to sustainable design, and thereby
           develop consumer demand for sustainable housing.
       I)  City will continue to refer to a sustainable development rating system, such as the LEED or GreenPoint
           programs when evaluating new development proposals.
9.2. Residential site, subdivision, and neighborhood designs should be coordinated to make residential
     sustainability work. Some ways to do this include:
       A) Design subdivisions to maximize solar access for each dwelling and site.
       B) Design sites so residents have usable outdoor space with access to both sun and shade.
       C) Streets and access ways should minimize pavement devoted to vehicular use.
       D) Use neighborhood retention basins to purify street runoff prior to its entering creeks. Retention basins
           should be designed to be visually attractive as well as functional. Fenced-off retention basins should be
           avoided.
       E) Encourage cluster development with dwellings grouped around significantly-sized, shared open space in
           return for City approval of smaller individual lots.
       F) Treat public streets as landscaped parkways, using continuous plantings at least six feet wide and where
           feasible, median planters to enhance, define, and to buffer residential neighborhoods of all densities
           from the effects of vehicle traffic.
9.3. Preserve the physical neighborhood qualities in the Downtown Planning Area that contribute to sustainability.
     Some ways to do this include:
       A) Maintain the overall scale, density and architectural character of older neighborhoods surrounding the
           Downtown Core.
       B) Encourage the maintenance and rehabilitation of historically designated housing stock.
9.4. To promote energy conservation and a cleaner environment, encourage the development of dwellings with
     energy-efficient designs, utilizing passive and active solar features, and the use of energy-saving techniques
     that exceed minimums prescribed by State law.
9.5. Actively promote water conservation through housing and site design to help moderate the cost of housing.
                                                     Page 3-35

Chapter 3
9.6.     Support programs that provide financing for sustainable home upgrade projects such as installation of solar
         panels, heating and cooling systems, water conservation and windows to improve the energy efficiency of the
         City’s existing housing stock.
Programs
9.7.     Continue to educate planning and building staff and citizen review bodies on energy conservation issues,
         including the City’s energy conservation policies and Climate Action Plan. Staff shall work with applicants to
         achieve the City’s energy conservation goals.
9.8.     Continue to provide assurance of long-term solar access for new or remodeled housing and for adjacent
         properties, consistent with historic preservation guidelines, and revise regulations found to be inadequate.
9.9.     Continue to implement the Water Quality Control Board’s “Post-Construction Stormwater Management
         Requirements for Development Projects in the Central Coast Region”, to reduce the amount of impermeable
         surface.
9.10.    Implement Climate Action Plan programs that increase the production of “green” housing units and projects
         and require use of sustainable and/or renewable materials, water and energy technologies (such as, but not
         limited to solar, wind, or thermal).
9.11.    Continue to promote building materials reuse and recycling in site development and residential construction,
         including flexible standards for use of salvaged, recycled, and “green” building materials. Continue the City’s
         construction and demolition debris recycling program as described in Chapter 8.05 of the Municipal Code.
9.12.    Consider incentivizing dwelling units to a minimum size of 150 square feet, consistent with the California
         Building Code, by reduced impact fees and property development standards.
9.13.    Consider participating in financing programs for sustainable home improvements such as solar panels, heating
         and cooling systems, water conservation and energy efficient windows.
                                   GOAL 10. LOCAL PREFERENCE
Maximize affordable housing opportunities for those who live or work in San Luis Obispo while
seeking to balance job growth and housing supply.
Policies
10.1.    Administer City housing programs and benefits, such as First Time Homebuyer Assistance or affordable housing
         lotteries, to give preference to: 1) persons living or working in the City or within the City’s Urban Reserve, and
         2) persons living in San Luis Obispo County.

            B) Promoting homeownership for academic faculty and staff in Low-Density Residential neighborhoods in
                the northern part of the City; and
            C) Encouraging and participating in the revitalization of degraded neighborhoods.
Programs
10.3.    Continue to work with the County of San Luis Obispo for any land use decisions that create significant
         expansion of employment in the unincorporated areas adjacent to the City to mitigate housing impacts on the
         City.
10.4.    Encourage residential developers to sell or rent their projects to those residing or employed in the City first
         before outside markets.
10.5.    Work with Cal Poly to address the link between enrollment and the expansion of campus housing programs at
         Cal Poly University to reduce pressure on the City's housing supply.
10.6.    Work with other jurisdictions to advocate for State legislation that would: 1) provide funding to help Cal Poly
         University provide adequate on-campus student housing, and 2) allow greater flexibility for State universities
         and community colleges to enter into public-private partnerships to construct student housing.
                                           GOAL 11. SUITABILITY
Develop and retain housing on sites that are suitable for that purpose.
Policies
11.1.    Where property is equally suited for commercial or residential uses, give preference to residential use.
         Changes in land use designation from residential to non-residential should be discouraged.
11.2.    Prevent new housing development on sites that should be preserved as dedicated open space or parks, on sites
         subject to natural hazards such as unmitigatable geological or flood risks, or wild fire dangers, and on sites
         subject to unacceptable levels of man-made hazards or nuisances, including severe soil contamination, airport
         noise or hazards, traffic noise or hazards, odors or incompatible neighboring uses.
Program
11.3.    The City will continue to ensure the ability of legal, non-conforming uses to continue where new development
         is proposed.

3.30      Implementation Tools
Resources/Incentives Available For Housing Activities
A variety of federal, state and local programs and resources are available to help implement the City’s housing goals and
activities. These include both financial resources, as well as in-kind incentives that help address housing needs. Table 1
lists the financial resources, incentives, and other tools that have been available to help address housing needs.
Availability of the resources is contingent on continued funding and is subject to change. Furthermore, on-going economic
uncertainties and budgetary constraints at all government levels have curtailed many housing grant and loan programs.
While funding has been frozen for several programs listed below, the resources continue to be listed in anticipation that
funding will be renewed for some programs.

                               CHAPTER 4.                QUANTIFIED OBJECTIVES
4.10     Overview
         State housing law requires that each jurisdiction identify the number of housing units that will be built,
         rehabilitated and preserved during the Housing Element’s planning period. These projections are termed
         “quantified objectives.” Quantified housing objectives allow the community to evaluate its progress toward
         meeting key housing needs and help prioritize planning and funding efforts. They are based on the City’s housing
         needs assessment and regional housing needs allocation, and are adopted policy. However, San Luis Obispo
         cannot guarantee these objectives will be met, given limited financial resources, costs to provide public facilities
         to serve new development, and the growing, statewide gap between housing costs and incomes. Meeting the
         City’s quantified housing objectives will depend, in part, upon real estate market forces, developers' and lenders'
         financial decisions and the availability of local, State and Federal funding.
         According to state housing law, a jurisdiction may take credit toward meeting RHNA requirements between the
         base year of the RHNA period (January 1, 2014) and the beginning of the new planning period (June 30, 2014) for
         dwellings that are approved, permitted and/or built during this time period. These units are then subtracted
         from the City’s RHNA allocation to determine the balance of site capacity that must be identified for housing.
         To credit units affordable to lower- and moderate-income households toward the RHNA requirement, a
         jurisdiction must demonstrate the units are affordable based on at least one of the following:
               Subsidies, financing, deed restrictions or other mechanisms that ensure affordability (e.g., MHP, HOME, or
                Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) financed projects or inclusionary units);
               Actual rents; and
               Actual sales prices.
4.20     Housing Construction Completed
         Table 2 shows the number of new housing units approved, permitted, under construction or completed between
         January 1, 2014 and June 30, 2014. These units are credited toward meeting the City’s quantified objectives
         during the five-year planning period from January 1, 2014 to June 30, 2019.

  Given the deep subsidies needed to construct extremely low and very-low income single-family units, most housing for these income groups is
      expected to be multi-family units.
           The new housing objectives are based on an assumed construction ratio of single family to multi-family housing
           of 40:60. For extremely low and very low income categories, no single-family housing production is anticipated,
           given the high cost and deep public subsidies needed for this type of housing. To meet housing needs for these
           income categories, it is likely that virtually all of the units will be higher density, multi-family rental housing.
4.40       Identification and Preservation of At-Risk Units
a.         Inventory of At-Risk Units
Dwellings built with some form of government assistance or subsidy typically must remain affordable to extremely low,
very low, low or moderate income households for a specific period. As part of the housing element update, State law
requires an analysis of assisted housing developments that may lose their affordability provisions during the next 10 years
due to termination of subsidy contracts, mortgage prepayment, or expiration of restrictions on use. These units are said
to be at-risk of conversion to market-rate housing. In addition, jurisdictions also must describe measures to prevent at-
risk from converting to market rate. There are several reasons why government-assisted housing might convert to
market-rate housing, including expiring subsidies, mortgage prepayments, or most commonly, expiration of affordability
and resale restrictions. A 40-year affordability requirement is common; however, the term varies depending upon the
source and terms of funding.
The analysis applies to “assisted housing developments”, or multi-family rental housing that was developed with or that
receives governmental assistance under a number of federal, state or local housing programs. Such developments may
include units receiving funding under a variety of government programs, such as HUD Section 8, HUD Section 202, IRS
Section 42 (Tax Credit projects), federal Community Development Block Grants and local programs using inclusionary
housing requirements, in-lieu fees and density bonuses.
                                                                 Page 3-48

                                                                                         Housing Element
                                                                                                                 
Appendix J includes an inventory of subsidized or assisted housing developments in San Luis Obispo. Nevertheless,
Housing Element programs 3.8 and 3.12, and quantified objectives have been incorporated into the Housing Element to
discourage affordable housing removals and to help track and preserve these affordable units. Program 3.13 calls for the
City to work with the Housing Authority of the City of San Luis Obispo, non-profit housing agencies and community
housing development organizations to help preserve at-risk units and rehabilitate residential and compatible commercial
buildings to expand affordable housing opportunities and prevent the loss of affordable housing.
The City has had several success stories over the past Housing Element planning period preserving affordable housing
units at risk of losing their affordability. Below are two examples where the City was able to preserve affordable housing:
              1. 1500 Madonna Road – This property is approximately 7 acres in size and includes 120 residential
                   apartment units. The project was constructed in 1971 and was deed restricted as affordable housing
                   under a HUD Section 236 loan since occupancy. This loan came to maturity on March 2, 2012, and the
                   property owners decided to sell the property. City staff worked with the new property owner to preserve
                   all of the units as affordable housing through tax credits and tax exempt bonds to help finance the
                   acquisition and rehabilitation of the property and units.
              2. 542 Hathway Avenue – Sojourn Services, Inc. acquired the property in 2001 and made it available to
                   extremely-low income individuals with developmental disabilities. The property includes a three-unit
                   apartment building consisting of two one (1) bedroom units and one (1) studio unit. In 2012, the
                   property went into foreclosure and the affordable housing units were at-risk of being lost and the
                   tenants evicted. In order to preserve the units for affordable housing, the City provided a $95,000 grant
                   to assist Tri-Counties Community Housing Corporation (TCCHC) acquire the property.
Based on information provided by the City’s Housing Authority, local non-profit housing providers, and the State Housing
and Community Development Department, there are two affordable housing developments at risk of losing its
affordability restrictions and converting to market rate between January 2014 and January 2024, the Anderson Hotel and
Judson Terrace Homes. The properties are discussed below.

1.        Anderson Hotel (Monterey Arms)
Anderson Hotel, located at the east corner of Morro and Monterey Streets
Source: Community Development Department, 2014
The Anderson Hotel was remodeled in the 1970’s to convert the original hotel rooms to small efficiency apartments, each
with a bathroom and kitchenette, designed for one or two persons. The units were made affordable utilizing an ongoing
HUD grant program. The Housing Authority master leased the Anderson Hotel from its current owner, 995 Partnership, in
2001 to provide affordable rental housing for very-low income persons, primarily elderly and disabled persons.
Rents at the Anderson Hotel are made affordable to very-low income elderly and disabled residents through a HUD
Section 8 Rental Assistance grant. This grant, along with tenant rent payments (30 percent of their income) and
downstairs commercial rent help pay for on-going operating costs, and the master lease payments to the property owner,
995 Partnership. Several items place this affordable housing at risk: 1) the property is privately owned and there is no
regulatory agreement on the property or long-term commitment assuring its ongoing use as affordable housing, 2) the
HUD operating grant funding is awarded annually, and could be discontinued or the owner could opt out, 3) under the
master lease terms, HASLO’s required payments to the owner, 995 Partnership, are increasing at a rate that exceeds
increases in grant and tenant rental revenue, jeopardizing financial sustainability, 4) the property is a 1926 building in
need of substantial long-term capital improvements which are not covered under the HUD grant, and not paid by the
property owner under the terms of the master lease.

Judson Terrace Homes is an affordable community operated by American Baptist Homes of the West (ABHOW). The
development is comprised of studio and one bedroom apartments for seniors. Judson Terrace Homes offer a variety of
resources for seniors including meals, health services and educational classes. The project currently has a 40 year
affordability agreement through HUD, which began in 1981. In 2011, the City of San Luis Obispo awarded Affordable
Housing Fund money to assist with repairs of housing units.
b.        Cost of Preservation versus Replacement
Construction of Replacement Units
The estimated cost to build 113 comparable units, based on recent land and construction estimates in San Luis Obispo,
highlighted in Appendix C, is approximately $64,000 in land cost per unit, and $130,000 construction cost per unit, for a
total cost of approximately $200,000 per unit including fees. The cost to replace 113 units would be approximately $23
million dollars.
Preservation
Preserving the units can be accomplished through specified long-term rent subsidies and a recorded regulatory
agreement or through property acquisition by the Housing Authority. Rent subsidies will cost approximately $850,000
annually, without adjusting for inflation. Sources of rental subsidies could include Project Based Section 8 if the Housing
Authority were to acquire the property. HUD might also extend the term of its existing rental subsidy contract to a longer
term if a long-term regulatory agreement were recorded on the property.

Chapter 3
c.       Funding for Preservation and Renovation
Funding sources that could be used for property purchase and renovation include:
              A) City Affordable Housing Funds (totaling approximately $2.2 million in June 2014)
              B) Countywide Housing Trust Fund (over $4 million in loan funds available in October 2013)
              C) Urban County CDBG Funds (City and County of San Luis Obispo funds)
              D) Urban County HOME Investment Partnership funds (HOME Program)
              E) Low-Income Housing Tax Credits
              F) State Multi-Family Housing Program (low-interest loans and grants)
              G) Federal Home Loan Bank Affordable Housing Program grants
Some of the methods for addressing this challenge will be further addressed through Policies and Programs 2.11, 2.11,
2.13, 3.2, 3.4, 3.8, 3.10 and 3.12 that focus on preserving affordable dwellings.
d.       Conclusion
Overall, costs of preserving the current 113 at-risk affordable units in the City would be much less than letting these units
convert to market-rate housing and having to construct new units. The Housing Authority has indicated its strong interest
in and ability to purchase the Anderson Hotel, improve it, and preserve it as permanent affordable housing; while ABHOW
has expressed full interest in renewing their agreement to keep their 43 senior units affordable after 2021.
4.50 Rehabilitation and Preservation Objectives
The City’s affordable housing stock is a valuable resource that should be preserved and, where necessary and feasible,
rehabilitated rather than demolished. By enforcing City building and zoning codes, the safety, quality and durability of
existing homes and neighborhoods is enhanced, thus maintaining the housing stock’s diversity in type, tenure and cost.
Often, the primary beneficiaries of preservation and rehabilitation programs are renters and low-income homeowners.
Table 5 lists the number of units to be rehabilitated, preserved or financially assisted, and the number of
conservation/code enforcement cases during the planning period.

           During the Housing Element's planning period from January 2014 to June 2019, the City will accommodate a net
           increase of 1,144 dwellings. The quantified objectives promote the development of housing that meets
           affordability standards for the income groups in the same proportion as the RHNA allocation, and emphasize
           production of multi-family, higher density housing, where appropriate. Although not counted toward meeting
           the City’s RHNA allocation because it is located just outside city limits, housing developed by Cal Poly University
           on and adjacent to the campus on State land has been and will continue to play a key role in meeting City housing
           needs.
           As described in Table 6, and as allowed by State Law, the City’s RHNA is reduced based on the number of dwelling
           units approved, under construction or built between January 1, 2014 and June 30, 2014. These units are
           deducted from the RHNA number for each income category to establish the City’s housing construction objectives
           for the Housing Element’s planning period, January 1, 2014 to June 30, 2019. The City’s adjusted RHNA is 525
           dwelling units, and of these, 386 are low, very-low or extremely low income.

         Table 7 summarizes the City’s quantified housing objectives for the five-year planning period. An evaluation of
         the residential development capacity and dwellings approved, built or under construction results in a remaining
         housing need of 525 new dwelling units during the housing element’s planning period. Although the quantified
         objectives are theoretically achievable, they are not specific development quotas. The City intends to use the
         financial, planning and administrative resources at its disposal to accomplish these objectives, but cannot
         guarantee they will be achieved given limited financial resources, economic uncertainty, independent financial
         decisions regarding housing development, and the large gap between housing cost and median County residents’
         incomes. Achieving the quantified objectives will hinge largely upon private development decisions and the City’s
         ability to leverage additional Federal, State or local funding to meet extremely low, very-low, low- and moderate
         income housing needs.

Appendix A
Community Profile
To understand San Luis Obispo’s housing needs, a demographic profile of the community is
essential. Statistical information provided in this appendix forms the basis for the goals, policies
and programs in Chapter 3, and for establishing quantified housing objectives in Chapter 4, as
required by State law. Social, economic and housing characteristics are analyzed to determine
how these factors affect housing needs, costs and availability. Main sources of statistical data in
this community profile include the 2000 and 2010 U.S. Decennial Census, California
Department of Finance (DOF), and the 2012 Central Coast Economic Forecast prepared by
Beacon Economics.
1.      Population Trends and Characteristics
San Luis Obispo is one of seven cities located within San Luis Obispo County, and is the largest
in terms of population. As shown in Table A-1, the City's estimated population in 2013 was
45,541 (California Department of Finance, January 1, 2013). The population of the County is
estimated to be 272,177. Thus, approximately 17 percent of County residents lived in the City of
San Luis Obispo in 2013.

The City’s long-term population growth rate has reflected slow, steady growth of one percent or
less per year. From 2005-2013, the City’s population, decreased slightly for the next two years
starting from 2005, and increase slightly for the next six years. During this period, annual
population change never exceeded one percent, and only three times did it change more than half
a percent. Comparatively over the same period, the population of the County grew at rates of -
0.29 to 0.94 percent, and the State’s population grew annually at rates ranging from -0.06 to 3.34
percent.

Table A-2 shows the average annual growth rate in population for the City, County, and State
between 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2013. The relatively recent slow growth is apparent between
2010 and 2013, when the City population increased only 0.2 percent. The average annual growth
rate for the County was the same at 0.2 percent per year and the State’s growth rate was 2.5
times higher for the same period. Between 2010 and 2013, City, County and State saw their
average annual growth rates drop slightly compared to 2000 to 2010.

The California Department of Finance predicts that between 2005 and 2030, the State’s
population will grow by almost 11.5 million to slightly greater than 48 million residents. This is
a projected annual growth rate of 1.09 percent. As part of its regional planning functions, the San
Luis Obispo Council of Governments (SLOCOG) develops and publishes regional population,
employment, and housing forecasts for the County and its communities. Table A-3 shows
SLOCOG growth projections for the City and County prepared by Economics Research
Associates, and Department of Finance projections for the State.

SLOCOG projections for the County show an annual growth rate of 0.72 percent. This annual
growth rate is their middle-range projection. SLOCOG low and high-range projections forecast
County annual growth rates of 0.64 percent and 0.79 percent respectively. For the City,
SLOCOG projects a continuation of the relatively slow growth rates experienced between 2000
and 2010, with a 0.40 percent annual growth rate to 2030.

The General Plan Land Use Element (LUE) includes policies to accommodate an eventual City
population of 57,200. At a 0.5 percent growth rate, the City's anticipated residential capacity
would be reached by the year 2057.
a) Age Composition
San Luis Obispo’s age profile is shown in Table A-4 and graphically in the form of a population
pyramid in Figure A-1. When compared with the County and State, San Luis Obispo has
significantly lower percentages of children, teens and adults in the primary childbearing years of
25-44. The City however has a relatively high proportion of senior citizens. While smaller than
the County, there are 0.6 percent more seniors age 65 years or older in the City than in the State.
Due to the concentration of students attending Cuesta College and California Polytechnic State
University, San Luis Obispo, young adults age 18-24 are by far the largest age group in the City.
The City’s component of residents age 18-24 is orders of magnitude greater than the County and
State. With 35 percent of residents being age 18-24, the City has nearly a 2.5 times greater share
of these young adults than the County, and nearly 3.4 times greater share than the State. As
discussed in Appendix B, this demographic trend has important implications for the San Luis
Obispo area housing market in terms of housing type, tenure and demand.

b) Race and Ethnicity
As shown in Table A-5, San Luis Obispo City and County are less diverse racially and ethnically
than the State as a whole. In 2010, more than three quarters of the residents in the City and
County were of white and non-Hispanic origin (note: By census definitions, Hispanic or non-
Hispanic origin is an ethnic characteristic independent of race).
However, the racial and ethnic compositions of both the City and the County are changing.
Between 2000 and 2010, the White and non-Hispanic population components in the City
dropped 3 percent and 4 percent in the County during this period. By 2010, the Hispanic
population of any race was the second largest in the City and County. Asian and Pacific/Islanders
were the third largest population, followed by residents of two or more races.

Table A-6 shows that growth in the Hispanic population is expected to continue. By 2025, the
California Department of Finance projects that over one quarter of the County’s population will
be Hispanic. The Asian/Pacific Islander category is projected to be the second fastest growing
population behind Hispanic, with the White population projected to be the most rapidly declining
population.

Chapter 3
City of San Luis Obispo Housing Element, January 2015
In 2010 the share of the Hispanic population in San Luis Obispo County increased 4.5 percent
from 2000, for a share of approximately 21% of the total population. The county’s non-Hispanic
White population has decreased by 5 percent, to 71%.
2. Employment Trends
Due to its centralized location, early settlement history and transportation links via the Southern
Pacific Railroad and State Highways 101, 1 and 227, San Luis Obispo historically has served as
the County’s governmental, retail and cultural hub. City and County economies historically
were based largely on agricultural activities.
Shown in Table A-7, in 2011 the industrial sector comprising educational services, health care,
and social assistance were the largest employers of City and County residents with 22.6 and 22.4
percent respectively. Arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation, and food services, and
retail trade were also important sectors, accounting for double digit shares of employment. All of
these high share sectors can be categorized as service industries.

The City’s total work force (civilian employed persons 16 years or older) was estimated at
22,984 in the 2012 American Community Survey. In 2000, the total workforce was 22,057,
reflecting an increase of 927 persons, or 4.2 percent, during the decade. San Luis Obispo’s
economy is relatively stable, mainly due to the large number of public sector employees, and
private sector employers that receive government funds in the City and nearby unincorporated
County, including the County of San Luis Obispo, California Polytechnic State University,
Cuesta College, California State Department of Forestry, California Department of
Transportation, California Army National Guard, San Luis Coastal Unified School District and
the City of San Luis Obispo. Large private sector employers include P.G.&E., Cal Poly
Foundation, Sierra Vista Regional Medical Center, French Hospital, Economic Opportunity
Commission and Madonna Inn.

Note: Unemployment rate is unemployed labor force divided by total size of labor force. Those who choose not to
work or have given up searching for work typically are not calculated as members of the labor force.

  2014 data is preliminary for June 2014
Nevertheless, the area’s economy is not immune from State and national economic forces. Due
to the recent national economic recession, the unemployment rate in the City reached up to 10.9
percent in 2010. The City has seen a steady decrease in annual unemployment rates since the
height of the recession, with unemployment falling to 6.2 percent in 2013.
3. Household Characteristics
Household formation and characteristics are key factors shaping housing need. Following is an
analysis of household size, growth, income, tenure and household trends. By definition, a
“household” consists of all the people occupying a dwelling unit, whether or not they are related.

Chapter 3
City of San Luis Obispo Housing Element, January 2015
For example, a single person living in an apartment, four students living in an apartment, a
couple with two children, and an unrelated tenant living in the same dwelling are all considered
households.
a) Household Formation and Type
As shown in Table A-9, the 2000 Census identified 18,653 occupied housing units in the City of
San Luis Obispo. In 2010, there are 19,193 occupied housing units with an increase of 2.9
percent. It is interesting to note that while the number of households increased during this
period, average household size declined by 1.3 percent, as shown in Table A-10, similarly trends
of decreasing household size are seen in the county. In the State, trends slightly decreased in
density. In part, this may be due to the fact that very few apartments were built during the 1990s
and 2000s, and apartments in San Luis Obispo typically have a higher average number of
persons per household than does detached or attached single family housing.
The U.S. Census differentiates between a “household” and a “family.” As used here, the term
"family" means two or more related persons living together as a unit. This may include single
parents, children and extended family members (e.g., grandparents). A “household” includes
unrelated persons (e.g., single persons, roommates, and unmarried persons who live together), as
well as households falling under the “family” definition.

 The declining household size reflects the aging of the City’s residents and the relatively high cost
 of housing. As homeowners age and become “empty nesters”, they often cannot afford to “shift
 down” and buy smaller housing that better meets their needs and budget. In San Luis Obispo, it
 is not uncommon for a three- and four-bedroom house to be occupied by one or two persons. As
 average households grow smaller, the existing housing stock accommodates fewer people,
 exacerbating housing needs, particularly for families and large households.

 Table A-11 and Table A-12 both show household patterns in 2010. When compared with the
 County, there is a higher percentage of non-family households in the City, 60 percent. Non-
 family households and one person households are more common in the City of San Luis Obispo
 than family and larger households due to the student population in the City.

 b) Household Income
 Both Tables A-13 and A-14 compare data from the U.S. Census, for median household and
 family incomes in the City, San Luis Obispo County, State and other selected California counties
 nearby. There has been significant growth in household income in the last decade in both the
 San Luis Obispo City and County. Household income growth in the County is comparable to
 Santa Barbara County, Monterey County and the State. In contrast, San Luis Obispo City
 households tend to have lower incomes and pay a larger portion of their income for mortgages or
 rent than San Luis Obispo County residents as a whole. In 2000, the City's median household
 income was $31,926, or about 75 percent of the countywide median. In 2010, the City's median

household income increased to $42,461, still approximately 75 percent of the County’s 2010
median household income of $56,967.

The State of California defines five income categories for the purposes of determining housing
affordability and need in communities. These categories are as shown in Table A-16. This
method is consistent with definitions of extremely low-, very low-, and low-, moderate and
above moderate income households as used in some Federal and most State housing programs;
however, HUD (U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development) applies different
standards for Community Development Block Grant, Section 202 and other Federal grant
programs.

Table A-17 shows the estimated number of households by income categories in the City of San
Luis Obispo within varying income categories. The table indicates that in 2010, 33 percent of
the City’s households fell into the less than $24,999 income category, while 67 percent of the
households were in higher income categories, with annual income of $50,000 or higher. While
the large number of households with incomes below $24,999 may be in part due to the large
student population in San Luis Obispo, it is evident that housing affordability may be an issue for
several of these income categories in the City.

4.        Housing Inventory and Market Factors
a) Housing Stock Profile and Population Growth
In the 1980’s and 1990’s, the City’s housing stock grew slower than the population. The 1990
U.S. Census identified 17,877 housing units in the City, with a vacancy rate of 5.5 percent. By
2000, the City’s housing stock grew to 19,340 units, with a vacancy rate of 3.6 percent, an
increase of 1,463 units. In 2010, the City housing stock grew to 20,553 housing units, an increase
of 1,213 units, with a vacancy rate of 1.6 percent for home owner and 5.7 percent for rental
Between 2000 and 2010, the City’s population grew from 44,179 to 45,119, an average annual
increase of 94 persons, or 0.21 percent. In the 1990’s, the City added about 2,221 persons, an
average annual increase of 222 persons, or 0.53 percent.

Table A-18 shows the net change in the number of dwellings due to completed construction
between 2003 and 2012. Between 2003 and 2013, an average of 95 dwellings was built each
year. During the same period, 710 multi-family dwellings were constructed, compared to 322
new single family dwellings. Multi-family housing typically provides a wider variety of housing
costs and types than detached, single family housing.

b) Unit Type
San Luis Obispo's housing stock includes a wide range of dwellings, including "Victorian-style,"
single-family houses near downtown, mobile home parks, duplexes, detached single-family
housing, condominiums and large, high-density apartment complexes close to the Cal Poly
University campus. Many of the City's older neighborhoods contain a mix of single houses,
houses with attached and detached secondary units, and small duplexes or triplexes. Table A-19
summarizes the composition of the City’s housing stock in 2000 and 2013.

As shown in the Table A-19, in 1990 about 52 percent of San Luis Obispo’s housing stock was
categorized as single-family, with 39 percent multi-family dwellings and nine percent mobile
homes. In 2000, about 53 percent of the City’s housing stock was categorized as single-family,
with 38 percent multi-family dwellings and 9 percent still consisting of mobile homes. In 2013,
about 53 percent of San Luis Obispo’s housing stock is categorized as single-family, with 40
percent consisting of multi-family dwellings and only seven percent consisting of mobile homes.
The Unit type with the largest increase over the years was the multi-family dwellings consisting
of 5 or more units, with an increase of 16 percent. Mobile homes, on the other hand, saw the
largest decrease, -3 percent, from 2000 to 2013. The significant increase in large, multi-family
housing dwellings can be mainly correlated to the need and development of student housing.
c) Unit Size
Unit size is commonly described in terms of the number of bedrooms in a residence. Table A-20
summarizes the City’s housing stock by number of bedrooms in 2010. One-third of the City’s
housing stock consists of two-bedroom units, with studio/one-bedroom units and three- bedroom
units each accounting for about one quarter of the total housing units. Four-bedroom and larger
dwellings comprise about 16 percent of the housing stock. Under the City’s Affordable Housing
Standards, estimated occupancy is based on the number of bedrooms in a unit, as follows:
        Studio unit:         one-person household
        One-bedroom unit: two-person household
        Two-bedroom unit: three-person household
        Three-bedroom unit: four- and five-person household
        Four-bedroom unit: six-person household
Unit size often shifts from owner-occupied to renter-occupied housing. For example, 44 percent
of the City’s housing stock consists of housing units with three or more bedrooms to
accommodate larger households. As shown in Table A-20, however, most of these larger units

                                                                      Housing Element
                                                                                            
are owner-occupied. About one-third of these larger units are available for renters. Due to the
high demand for student housing, it is very difficult for families with four or more persons to
secure larger rental units. According to the 2010 Census, the City has 571 dwelling units with
five or more bedrooms, or about 3 percent of the housing stock.

d) Tenure
Tenure refers to whether householders rent or own their dwelling. In 2010, 11,646 occupied
housing units, or 61 percent, of City units were renter-occupied, a significantly higher proportion
than in the County and State. Between 2000 and 2010 the City saw a 2% increase in renter-
occupied housing units. This shift is consistent with housing tenure trends during the period for
the County and State. Programs have been created to evaluate strategies that can increase owner-
occupied housing units in the City.

e) Vacancy Rates
The housing vacancy rate is one measure of general housing availability. A low vacancy rate,
less than five percent, suggests that households will have difficulty finding housing within their
price range. Conversely, a high vacancy rate may indicate a high number of housing units that
are undesirable for occupancy, a high number of seasonal units, or an oversupply of housing.
By maintaining a “healthy” vacancy rate of between five and eight percent, housing consumers
have a wider choice of housing types and prices to choose from. As vacancy rates drop,
shortages generally raise housing costs and limit choices.

City of San Luis Obispo Housing Element, January 2015
Since 1990, the City’s vacancy rate remained at just over five percent; however, in 2001-2003,
State Department of Finance figures show the rate dropped steeply to 3.5 percent. In 2010, the
vacancy rate rose to 7.3 percent. By comparison, in the 1990’s the County of San Luis Obispo
vacancy rate hovered at around 11 percent. In 2010, the County’ vacancy rate dropped to 7.6.
The City’s consistent low vacancy rate reflects the high demand for student rental housing near
college campuses (Cuesta College and Cal Poly University).
f) Age of Housing Stock
Housing age is one measure of identifying housing stock condition and the need for
rehabilitation. Older units often do not meet current building or zoning standards, and without
proper maintenance, are more likely to need major repairs (e.g., new roof, plumbing and
electrical repairs). Generally, dwellings over 30 years of age fall into this category, and for
purposes of the Housing Element, the number of older dwellings is an indicator of the need for
housing rehabilitation assistance. Table A-22 shows the age of the City’s housing stock up to the
year 2010.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 2008-2010 American Community Survey about 64
percent of the City’s housing stock was built before 1980, and about 90 percent was built before
2000. Despite its high proportion of pre-1970 housing, the City’s housing stock generally
appears to be in good condition. A 2014 City inventory of vacant, underutilized and blighted
properties identified 22 residential properties with exterior signs of serious disrepair, building
condition or safety problems. The inventory included all neighborhoods; however, it was limited
to a visual inspection of the exterior street elevations and a portion of the side elevations of
housing units. It is likely that the number of substandard or dilapidated housing units is larger,
based on the age of the housing stock.
g) Housing Conditions
Another measure of the City’s housing stock is housing condition. Housing is considered
substandard when conditions are below the minimum standards of living as defined by Section
                                                 Page A-16

                                                                   Housing Element
                                                                                       
1001 of the Uniform Housing Code. Households living in substandard housing may be exposed
to health or safety threats, which, in turn, could adversely affect the safety and quality of life of
neighborhoods. Such households are considered in need of housing assistance to correct any
serious health or building safety problems, such as structural, plumbing, mechanical or electrical
problems, and the presence of unhealthful conditions or materials, e.g. asbestos and lead-based
paint.
In addition to structural problems (sagging roofs, walls or porches, lack of or failing building
foundation, termite infestation, etc.), the lack of certain basic facilities may also indicate
substandard conditions. According to the 2010 Census, there were 41 units in the City that
lacked complete plumbing facilities. Of these, 34 were renter occupied. For Census purposes,
complete plumbing facilities included: (1) hot and cold piped water; (2) a flush toilet; and (3) a
bathtub or shower. All three must be located inside a housing unit to be recognized as having full
plumbing facilities. According to the Census, 329 units lacked complete kitchen facilities, and
of these, 320 units were renter-occupied. There were 530 units with no heating source, and 50
units that relied on heating oil, kerosene, coal or wood for heating.
h) Sales Costs and Rents
Existing and New Housing Sales Price Trends
Following a trend throughout much of California, and particularly the Central Coast of California
(from Ventura County to San Luis Obispo County), the City of San Luis Obispo experienced a
steep increase in existing and new home prices from the late 1990s to 2007. During the early to
mid-1990s, housing costs in San Luis Obispo stabilized or slightly decreased. A strong economy
in the late 1990s pushed housing costs up, with increased employment, higher Cal Poly
enrollment and greater housing demand. Since 2000, despite a nationwide economic slowdown
in the early part of the decade, local and regional housing demand has remained strong, buoyed
by record low mortgage interest rates and the San Luis Obispo area’s attractiveness to retirees
from both Southern and Northern California. Housing prices continued to increase until the
impacts of the most recent nationwide economic slowdown, and later credit crisis, hit the region
beginning in 2007 resulting in a decline in sales prices. Housing prices in 2013 are finally
beginning to catch up to pre-recession sales prices.
Table A-23 shows the median sales prices of residential real estate in the City, County, and State
from 2001-2012 according to the University of California, Santa Barbara Economic Forecast
Project’s Outlook as well as 2013 Data Quick for San Luis Obispo County. Over the 13 year
period, median sale prices have been consistently higher in the City than in the County and State.
In 2013, the median sales price in the City was $569,000. This was approximately 36 percent
higher than the County and 89 percent higher than the State. Eleven out of twelve years, median
prices were higher in the County than the State, with 2004 being the exception.

Rental Costs
A survey from the San Luis Obispo County Apartment Market reported that the average contract
rent for units in the City in 2011 was $1,156. Generally, rents are slightly higher in the City than
they are in the County. Table A-24 shows the range of contract rents by unit type for the City and
County in 2011.

A possible contributing factor to high rents in the City is low rental vacancy rates as shown in
Table A-25. In 1990, both the City and County had vacancy rates relatively much higher than the
State. In 2000, the City and County had vacancy rates relatively much lower than the State.
Vacancy rates remained stable in the State from 1990 to 2000. The decline in vacancy rates in
the City and County from 1990 to 2000 proved to be part of a long-term trend of declining
vacancy rates. The City showed almost complete occupancy in 2005 with a minuscule vacancy
rate of 0 .12 percent. The County showed a vacancy rate low of 1.25 percent in 2006.

In 2010, both the City and the County had a vacancy rate near 5.5 percent. Between 2008 and
2010, the City saw vacancy rates increase 90 percent. While the increase has been large, the
current 5.7 percent vacancy rate is generally considered low. A balanced vacancy rate for an area
is typically around five percent. Vacancy rates lower than five percent favor landlords and can
signal a dearth of choice for renters. Vacancy rates above five percent favor renters and can
signal that landlords are having trouble finding tenants.

Ownership Units
Table A-26 lists the values of owner-occupied, single family housing in San Luis Obispo City
and County in 2010 based on the 2010 Census. In 2010, only 16 percent of the City’s homes
were valued at below $250,000, compared with about 18 percent of homes in the County. While
the median housing price in 2012 is below the pre-recession peak in 2006, median prices are still
34 percent higher in 2012 than in 2001, which make it difficult to find housing for sale under
$250,000.

         *For owner-occupied units
Although the total price of a home is an important indicator of affordability, the primary
affordability determinant is the monthly payment. Lenders typically require homebuyers to
demonstrate that the total monthly loan payment, consisting of loan principal, interest, taxes and
insurance will not exceed 30 percent of gross monthly household income. Table A-27 compares
the monthly median income and median housing costs in San Luis Obispo City, County and the
State in 2010.

As shown, in 2010 a mortgaged median-priced house in the City is below the 30 percent
threshold. However, the County and State slightly exceed the 30% threshold. While median
family income has increased since 2000, it has not kept pace with the growth in prices. Table A-
28 and Figure A-3 compare the median sales costs and median family income in the County from
2001 to 2010. The most recent median income data for the County is the 2010 census. From
2001 to 2010, median family income in the County grew sharply, 33 percent. However, this is
not nearly as large an increase as the 51 percent increase in median sales price of a home.

     Income required to afford is annual income such that 30 percent of gross monthly income is the monthly mortgage
   payment for a median priced home. Mortgage payments are derived assuming 30-year fixed rate loan, at 6% interest,

Chapter 3
City of San Luis Obispo Housing Element, January 2015
Table A-28 also shows what income is required to theoretically afford to buy a median priced
home in the County. The income required figure is derived assuming that housing costs are at the
30 percent of gross income threshold, and that the mortgage being paid is a 30-year fixed interest
home loan, with a 6% interest rate, and a 20% down payment.
While the census showed that the median County homeowner was in good shape in 1999, under
the 30 percent affordability threshold, the situation has become more difficult for home buyers
since then. Even after accounting for the economic slowdown since 2006, approximately one
third more than the median income was required to afford a median priced home in 2013. Further
impacts on the housing market, should the economic slowdown persist, may lower prices and the
income thus required to afford homes. However, the slowdown may also impact the income that
potential homeowners can make and the interest rates they can acquire for home loans. If the
assumed mortgage parameters are altered to have a higher interest rate or smaller down payment,
monthly payments would increase, making units for sale even more unaffordable.
Earlier, Table A-23 showed that while housing sales costs are impacted by the current economic
slowdown, the rate of falling home values was lower in the City than for the County and State.
This may be due to, as local realtors report, a large number of homebuyers in San Luis Obispo
being from outside the area, primarily Southern California and the San Francisco Bay Area.
Retirees and “baby boomers” nearing retirement age are attracted to the Central Coast and
relocate, buying homes with equity accumulated from selling properties that they may have
bought decades ago. Additionally, some parents of California Polytechnic State University
students purchase property to provide housing for their children, with possible future use as
income property or for retirement. The attractiveness of San Luis Obispo to retirees and to the
stable population of university students may have contributed to relative high property values in
boom years, and may have softened devaluation in the recent economic downturn.
Rental Units
Table A-29 shows the median gross rent as a percentage of household income in 2010. While as
previously discussed, home owners are spending about 30 percent of income affordability
threshold for their housing costs in 2010, renters were spending considerably more. The median
renter was spending 48.0 percent of their income on rent in 2010, suggesting overpayment for
rental housing is common in San Luis Obispo.

The rent households of different incomes can afford, using a 30 percent affordability standard, is
shown below in Table A-30. Recalling Table A-24, the average rent of a studio apartment in the
City in 2011 was $764 per month. This is the only housing that extremely low and very low
income households could potentially afford, taking into account the standard. Low income
households could afford studio apartments or 1-bedroom units.

While some very-low and low-income household could accept studio or 1-bedroom units, Table
A-31 shows that their small size may make them unreasonable for larger households. The
average two-bedroom rental unit is affordable for low, and moderate-income 4 person
households, and the average three-bedroom rental unit is affordable for most moderate and
above-moderate income 4 person households. Extremely low and very low income household
are essentially priced out from the City’s rental market. A low income family of four would only
be able to afford a two bedroom unit.

5. Summary and Conclusions
Appendix A describes the demographic factors affecting San Luis Obispo’s housing market in
2014. They are:
       Population and household growth: Population growth has slowed significantly in the City
        from 2000 to 2013. Over this period, City population has remained relatively stagnant,
                                                      Page A-23

Chapter 3
City of San Luis Obispo Housing Element, January 2015
         growing by only 1,362 persons to 45,541, which is an average annual growth rate of 0.3
         percent. By 2020, the San Luis Obispo Council of Governments projects that the City
         population will grow slightly to 45,969. However, they project that in the longer term, the
         population of the City will grow slightly faster, at an average annual growth rate of 0.40
         percent to 2030.
        Age Distribution: Both the City and the County have significantly higher proportions of
         young adults compared to the State due to the presence of the California Polytechnic
         State University and Cuesta College. In the City, one third of the population is in the 18-
         24 year old age cohort that encompasses most college students. The City and County also
         have relatively high proportions of senior citizens aged 65 and over. The city has a
         significantly low share of school age children aged 5 to 17. Only 8.9 percent of the City’s
         population is in this age group, compared to 18.2 percent for the State.
        Ethnicity: The 2010 U.S. Census found that 24 percent of the City’s population was non-
         White, compared to 59.9 percent of the State. While not approaching the State
         distribution, the City is becoming more ethnically diverse. The California Department of
         Finance projects that by 2025 that 336.4 percent of the County’s population will be non-
         white with the most rapid growth coming in Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander
         populations.
        Employment: The City has seen a steady decrease in annual unemployment rates since
         the height of the recession.. Unemployment reached 7.3 percent in 2013, the lowest level
         seen since 2010 by three full percentage points. In 2012, the most recent data available on
         industries, showed that the three industries offering the most jobs in the City were health
         care and social assistance, retail trade, and accommodation and food services.
        Household size and type: The City’s average household size has been declining since the
         1990s. As the average household size grows smaller, the existing housing stock
         accommodates fewer people. In 2010, non-family households are 60 percent and family
         households about 40 percent.
        Household and family income: San Luis Obispo City and County median family
         incomes continue to exceed other Central Coast counties and large urban areas to the
         north and south. However, in 2010, 33.2 percent of household’s incomes are still less
         than $24,999, which is fall within the extremely low income category.
        Housing Unit Size: Just over one-third of the City’s housing stock consists of two-
         bedroom units, with studio/one-bedroom units and three-bedroom units each accounting
         for about one quarter of the total housing units. Multi-family dwellings have increased
         the most over the past 10 years while the number of mobile homes has decreased. It is
         interesting to note that unit size shifts markedly from owner-occupied to renter-occupied
         housing, with renter-occupied housing comprising most of the City’s larger housing
         stock.

 Housing Inventory and Market Factors: Housing units added increased faster than
  population rate. Between 2000 and 2010, there were 1,247 housing units added compared
  to 945 people added. Between 2003 and 2013, there were 710 multi-family dwelling units
  constructed compared to 322 of single-family dwellings constructed. In 2010, there are
  21.4% more renters than owners in the City.
 Housing Affordability: Many people who live in San Luis Obispo overpay for housing,
  and many who work here cannot afford to live here. While the City saw median housing
  costs decreasing during the previous housing element planning period, the housing
  affordability issue is still problematic. Recently as median housing costs have outpaced
  incomes, between 2000 and 2013, median residential cost has increased 96% while the
  median income has only increased by 50%.

Appendix B
Housing Needs
Appendix B describes housing needs relative to various segments of the population, including
groups with special housing needs. Several factors will shape the type and amount of housing
demand or “need” in San Luis Obispo. The main factors driving housing need during the
planning period are:
       Population and job growth, both in the City and in the County;
       Increased rate of household formation due to smaller households;
       Inability of extremely low, very low-, low and moderate income working adults to find
        suitable affordable housing near jobs;
       Growth of special needs groups such as the elderly, single-parent households, households
        with disabled persons, and homeless individuals and families.
Analysis of the City’s demographic factors suggests that while all but above-moderate income
households will continue to have difficulty finding suitable affordable housing, the largest gap
between housing supply and need will be for extremely low, low- and moderate income working
people. First-time homebuyers' assistance and incentives for multi-family housing are in effect
will continue to be critical tools in addressing these needs.
1.      Regional Housing Needs Assessment
Under State law, each city and county is to develop programs designed to meet its share of the
region's housing needs for all income groups, as determined by the region’s council of
governments. The State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) identifies
housing needs for all regions of the State. Councils of governments then apportion the regional
housing need among their member jurisdictions. The Regional Housing Needs Allocation
(RHNA) process seeks to ensure that each jurisdiction accepts responsibility, within its physical
and financial capability to do so, for the housing needs of its residents and for those people who
might reasonably be expected to move there. State housing law recognizes that housing need
allocations are goals that jurisdictions seek to achieve; however, they are not intended as
production quotas. The allocations are included in each jurisdiction’s Housing Element so that
plans, policies and standards may be created to help meet housing needs within this element's
planning term.
a) Existing Housing Needs
That part of the RHNA process concerned with existing housing needs includes two
subcategories: overpayment and overcrowding.

Chapter 3
City of San Luis Obispo Housing Element, January 2015
Households Overpaying for Housing
Overpayment refers to households paying more than 30 percent of their gross income to secure
adequate shelter. It is most common among extremely low, very low- and low-income
households, although in high-cost housing markets such as San Luis Obispo, even moderate- and
above-moderate income households often pay more than 30 percent of their incomes to secure
adequate housing. However, high housing costs impact lower-income households most acutely
because lower- and fixed-income households must use a disproportionately higher percentage of
their incomes for housing and typically have the least financial flexibility to meet other basic
needs. For these individuals, the eventual result may be a series of financial problems leading to
housing deterioration, as limited funds must be used for more immediate needs, or the result may
be an entire loss of housing. For the community, it could mean overcrowding as households seek
to maximize income to meet housing costs, a visible decline in housing conditions and
appearance, neighborhood parking shortages and other related problems.
Overpayment for rental housing has been a continuing problem in San Luis Obispo. The Census
indicates that in 2000, 61 percent of the City’s 10,858 renter households, or about 6,600
households, overpaid for housing. The figures also show that of the City’s 4,243 homeowners
with home mortgages, 37 percent, or 1,570 households, overpaid for housing. This translates into
an estimated 8,170 of San Luis Obispo households paying more than 30 percent of their gross
income for housing. Countywide, very low- and low-income households also have a higher
incidence of overpaying for housing, with many paying more than one-half of their incomes for
housing, a level referred to by HUD as “severe cost burden.” For some, overpaying is a choice to
secure housing of a certain type, location or quality. For many others, it is a necessity to meet
basic housing needs.
The Census indicates that in 2010, 66 percent of the City’s 11,702 renter households are
overpaying for housing. Of the City’s 7,229 owner-occupied households, 32 percent are
overpaying for housing. In total, 9,977 households of San Luis Obispo pay more than 30 percent
of their gross income for housing, which is over 50 percent of the total households within the
City. This may be due to either low income levels or high housing costs. In 2010, households
overpaying is down from 2000, when 61 percent of households overpaid for housing.
However, in San Luis Obispo, overpayment figures may be misleading. On one hand, the
percentage of households overpaying may significantly understate the problem, since high
housing costs force many to seek affordable housing outside the City. Those unable to afford
any housing in San Luis Obispo are not reflected in the figures. Conversely, the numbers may
overstate the problem in that many San Luis Obispo renters are students. Most student
households, including families headed by students, are nominally in the lower income categories
but have significant financial resources due to parental support, loans or savings that is not
reflected in their current income levels. Nevertheless, rising housing costs and relatively slow
income growth are well documented, affirming that overpayment is a serious and ongoing
problem in San Luis Obispo.

                                                                  Housing Element
                                                                                        
Overcrowding
High housing prices often force lower-income households to accept smaller housing units,
resulting in overcrowding. Overcrowding can have serious housing and neighborhood
consequences. It places additional demands on housing facilities, neighborhood parking,
community infrastructure and services, and can eventually contribute to deterioration of the
housing stock and the neighborhood.
Table B-1 below compares overcrowding figures for the City and County of San Luis Obispo
and the State of California in 2010. Census data indicate that the percentages of overcrowded
rental units in the City and County have declined since 2000, from 7.5 and 10.1 percent to 5.4
and 6.5, respectively. City and County figures for overcrowding remain relatively low compared
to the State. In San Luis Obispo, among the 11,702 renter households in 2010, an estimated 733
households were overcrowded. For owner-occupied housing, San Luis Obispo has fewer people
per room than the State, with almost 99 percent of owner households averaging one person or
fewer per room. About 102 of the City’s 7,229 owner-occupied households were overcrowded.

Another measure of residential overcrowding is the number of persons per occupied housing
unit, or average household size. In 2000, the U.S. Census showed an average of 2.19 persons per
occupied rental housing unit in the City of San Luis Obispo, compared with 2.41 and 2.78 in the
County and State, respectively. According to Census in 2010, average household size in the City
increased slightly from 2000 levels. Table B-2 compares average household size between the
City, County and State in 2011.

Chapter 3
City of San Luis Obispo Housing Element, January 2015
Overcrowding has been a concern due to students or other groups of unrelated adults sharing
housing in low- and medium-density (R-1 and R-2) residential neighborhoods. Concerns
centered on the fact that most detached houses in R-1 and R-2 neighborhoods were not designed
to accommodate groups of adults, and that high occupancies can adversely affect persons living
under crowded conditions, reduce neighborhood parking, contribute to noise and privacy
conflicts, and can result in an overall reduction in the quality of life for neighborhood residents.
In response to these concerns, the City Council adopted an ordinance in February of 1990 that
requires households with six or more adult occupants in the R-1 and R-2 zones to secure
approval of an administrative use permit and meet standards related to parking, floor space per
individual, and number of bathrooms.
b) Housing Needs for 2014 – 2019
In San Luis Obispo County, the San Luis Obispo County Council of Governments (SLOCOG) is
charged with allocating the region’s assigned housing needs among seven cities and the
unincorporated County areas. The numbers supplied by the State's Department of Housing and
Community Development (HCD) are “goal numbers” and are not intended as production quotas.
State law recognizes that a jurisdiction’s ability to meet regional housing needs within the
planning period may be constrained by several factors. Government Code Section 65583 States:
     “It is recognized that the total housing needs identified pursuant to subdivision (a) (i.e., through the
     Regional Housing Needs Allocation, or RHNA process) may exceed available resources and the
     community’s ability to satisfy this need within the content of the general plan requirements outlined
     in Government Code Sections 65300-65307. Under these circumstances, the quantified objectives
     need not be identical to the total housing needs.”
Jurisdictions must accommodate the RHNA numbers in their Housing Elements or explain why
their quantified housing objectives differ and identify actions the jurisdiction will take to remove
constraints to achieving the RHNA number. These numbers apply to the planning term from
January 2014 through June 2019. Each jurisdiction’s total need is broken down by income
group. These needs are then included in each jurisdiction’s housing element as residential
growth objectives for which the jurisdiction tailors its plans, policies and standards to be
accomplished within the planning term.
In February, 2013, the San Luis Obispo Council of Governments approved San Luis Obispo
County’s Regional Housing Needs Plan incorporating the State’s Department of Housing and
Community Development (HCD) housing need determination of 4,090 in San Luis Obispo
County, down from the 2010 RHNA of 4,885 units. The approved Regional Housing Needs Plan
is shown in Table B-3.

  Percent of total housing need in each jurisdiction.
A jurisdiction’s housing need allocation is the number of additional dwellings necessary to
accommodate expected growth in the number of households, and to: 1) replace expected
demolitions and conversions to non-residential use, 2) achieve an ideal vacancy rate (five to
eight percent) that allows adequate housing choice, and 3) avoid concentrating lower-income
housing in areas that already have disproportionately high proportions of lower income
households. Total housing need is broken down by household income categories used in State
and Federal programs: extremely low, very-low, low, moderate, and above-moderate income.
As shown in Table B-3, San Luis Obispo’s allocation is 1,144 dwellings, 28 percent of the
County’s total housing need allocation.
c) Extremely Low-Income Households
Local governments have typically used four different income categories to describe and plan for
housing needs: very-low, low, moderate and above moderate Income levels. State law now
requires quantification and analysis of existing and projected housing needs of extremely low-
income (ELI) households. ELI is defined as 30 percent of area median income and below. Table
B-4 shows the relationship of the four household income categories, projected number of
households in each category and the percentage of households paying more than 30 percent of
their income for housing. This table identified extremely-low income renter occupied households
as the largest income category overpaying for housing, with 39 percent of households paying
more than 30 percent of their monthly income on housing.

In 2013, San Luis Obispo County’s median income for a four-person household is $75,400. For
extremely low income households, this results in an income of $22,620 or less for a four-person
household or $15,840 or less for a one-person household. Households with extremely low-
incomes have a variety of housing situations and needs. For example, most families and
individuals receiving public assistance, such as social security insurance (SSI) or disability
insurance, are considered extremely low-income households. At the same time, a minimum wage
worker could be considered an extremely low-income household. The following are examples of
occupations with wages that could qualify as extremely low income households.
Occupation Title Median Hourly Wage
        Hotel and Resort Clerk                                Agricultural Graders and Sorters
        Child Care Workers                                    Waiters and Waitresses, Hosts
        Housekeepers                                          Food Preparation and Serving Related
        Manicurists and Pedicurists                            Worker
        Education, Training & Library Workers
Existing Needs
In 2010, approximately 4,959 extremely low-income households resided in the City, representing
26 percent of the total households. Most (85 percent) extremely low-income households are
renters and experience a high incidence of housing problems. According to the Census 2010,
over 98 percent of extremely low-income households faced housing problems (defined as a
housing cost burden greater than 30 percent of income and/or overcrowding and/or without
complete kitchen or plumbing facilities) and 93 percent paid more than 30 percent for the income
for housing. A total of 47 percent of all households across all income categories paid more than
30 percent of their income for housing.

                                                                  Housing Element
                                                                                        
Projected Needs
To calculate the projected housing needs, the City assumed one-half of its assigned very low-
income regional housing need is comprised of extremely low-income households. As a result,
from the very low income need of 285 units, the City has a projected need of 142 units for
extremely low-income households. Many extremely low-income households will be seeking
rental housing and most likely facing an overpayment, overcrowded or substandard housing
condition. Some extremely low-income households face mental or other disabilities and special
needs. To address this need, the City will employ a diversified strategy including promoting
construction of a variety of housing types, such as single-room occupancy (SRO) units,
preservation of extremely-low and very-low housing, and residential rehabilitation assistance.
For example, with respect to single-room occupancy units, the City already allows SRO housing
in all zoning districts where residential uses are allowed, and has provided $1 million to assist
development of SRO housing in the Downtown core. In addition, the City is working with the
Housing Authority on a 20 unit SRO development project specifically targeted to extremely-low
income veterans located near services.
Extremely low-income households often need supportive housing and are particularly vulnerable
to becoming homeless due to the local high housing costs and limited incomes. Supportive
housing is generally defined as permanent, affordable housing with on-site services that help
residents transition into safer and more stable living conditions. Needed services may include
childcare, after-school tutoring, career counseling, etc. Most transitional housing includes a
supportive services component. City regulations allow supportive housing by right as a
residential use, provided supportive services are subordinate to the residential use. To address
the housing needs of extremely low-income households, the City will identify opportunities to
work with for-profit developers to secure ELI units as a condition of approval for market rate
units, and with non-profit builders who specialize in building housing for extremely low-income
households and supportive housing. This effort is designed to:
       Build a long-term partnership with development groups;
       Gain access to specialized funding sources, including funding sources that support deeper
        subsidies for ELI housing;
       Identify the range of local resources and assistance needed to facilitate the development
        of housing for extremely low-income households, and
       Promote a variety of housing types, including higher density, multifamily supportive,
        single room occupancy and shared housing.
As described in Program 3.13, the City will work with its nonprofit partners to develop housing
for extremely low-income households. Possible activities include organization capacity building,
assisting with site identification and acquisition, providing local financial resources (Affordable
Housing funds, CDBG and HOME funds), City fee deferrals, assisting and streamlining
entitlements and through the use of flexible development standards and incentives.

2. Special Housing Needs
Certain segments of the population may have more difficulty finding decent, affordable housing
due to their specific circumstances. In San Luis Obispo, this may include elderly persons, large
families, female-headed households, the disabled, homeless and farm workers.
a) Elderly Persons
Elderly residents are classified as being 65 years of age or older. The 2000 Census shows that
elderly populations accounted for 12 percent, 5,432 residents, of the City’s total population. In
2010, elderly populations still made up 12 percent, 5,431 residents, of the City’s total population.
Overall elderly population in the City has remained the same since 2000. According to the 2010
Census, there are 2,608 owner-occupied households in the City headed by persons 65 years or
over and 1,114 renter-occupied households headed by persons 65 years or over. Households with
persons age 65 years or older comprise 20 percent of the total occupied households.

Elderly persons may need regular medical care, special residential access features, home medical
equipment or trained medical care, transportation and opportunities to socialize. Those with
moderate or above moderate incomes can usually afford to accommodate those needs. However,
many elderly citizens have fixed or low incomes and do not own a home. They must compete
for rentals with other small households that may have greater financial resources, or may have
the potential for greater income in the future. Those low-income, elderly people who do own
homes may have difficulty affording property maintenance costs, or meeting special accessibility
or mobility needs such as ramps, handrails, door widths, counters and cupboard height and
design. Due to limited mobility or health issues, elderly people may have a more difficult time
meeting their personal needs, such as shopping, health or other errands, making their housing
locations especially important. According to Census figures, 3,338 elderly San Luis Obispo
residents, 60 percent of city residents age 65 or older, have physical disabilities, self-care or
mobility limitations.

Elderly residents who own their homes are in relatively good positions financially. Given the
high cost of housing in the area, some could sell their homes for a profit and use it to purchase a
smaller apartment or condominium, or for a residential care facility if needed. However, seniors
on fixed incomes with few assets have a more difficult time securing housing. Based on requests
to the City's Housing Authority for housing affordable to the elderly, there is a clear need for
more subsidized elderly housing in the City. With the aging of the so-called "baby-boom"
generation born in the 1950’s, and with longer life expectancies, the need for suitable housing
and related services is expected to grow. According to Census 2010, 273 elderly San Luis
Obispo citizens had incomes below the poverty threshold.
Residential Care Facilities
San Luis Obispo has a limited number of residential care facilities and special housing geared
toward the elderly. Residential care homes may also serve youths, adults, the disabled and those
in drug and alcohol recovery programs. In 2013, the City had 598 facilities providing housing
for special needs groups. Table B-7 summarizes special needs housing and residential care
facilities in San Luis Obispo in 2013.

b) Large Households
According to the Census, 1,293 households, or six percent of San Luis Obispo's households,
consist of "large families.” Large families are defined as households with five or more persons,
at least two of which are related by blood, marriage or adoption. Large families are included as a
special needs group because they typically require larger dwellings with more bedrooms than
typically needed by most households. Large families require dwellings with six or more rooms,
and of these, three or more are probably bedrooms.
According to the 2010 Census, Table B-8 highlights the City's housing stock which contains
about 571 large dwellings with five or more rooms, or three percent of the housing stock. Large
families face the dual challenge of finding an adequately sized dwelling at a cost that they can
afford. These families often have the largest affordability gap in securing housing among the
special needs groups. This is especially true for renter households, since most of the City’s
larger dwellings are owner occupied. Of the City’s roughly 8,800 dwellings with three or more
bedrooms, 60 percent are owner occupied. The remainder, about 3,200 large, rental housing
units, is often priced for the student housing market.
On a per-person rental basis, a three-bedroom student rental house can often generate larger rents
than if it were rented to a single family. In 2011, average rent for a three bedroom unit was
$1,692 per month. For low-income residents in a four-person household, the maximum
affordable rent in 2013 was $1,508 and for moderate income residents it was $2,262, meaning
extremely-low, very low and low income families would have difficulty affording rental homes
in the City.
It is evident from the Census that there are a sufficient number of large dwellings to
accommodate the numbers of large families in the City. However, data also shows that lower-
income households are priced out of both the ownership and rental housing markets for that type
of housing. Moderate income families may be able to afford rental costs for large dwellings;
however, a tight student-housing market coupled with relatively low vacancy rates (averaging
just over six percent) make it more difficult for families to secure large dwellings. Large low-
and moderate income families will continue to be one of the most seriously affected housing

consumer groups in the City. Market-rate housing options for this segment of the population are
mostly overcrowded, multi-family units or poorly maintained single-family houses. The
production of more on-campus student apartments may help to make available more rental
housing suitable for large families.

c) Female-Headed Households
In 2010, females headed seven percent of the City’s households, or an estimated 1,336
households with no husband present. By comparison, about 6 percent of county households and
8 percent of State households are female-headed. Female-headed households are included as a
special needs group because of their low rate of homeownership, lower average incomes and
relatively high poverty rates. This group's housing needs are similar to those of the elderly in
that affordability, limited income and access to services are key concerns. Female-headed
households have space needs similar to two-parent households, but are at a distinct disadvantage
in competing for suitable housing with the financial resources of only one adult. Often, the
single parent must settle for a small dwelling that does not meet the household’s needs, or must
spend a disproportionately large share of the household's monthly income on housing and child
care.
Housing close to employment, schools and services tends to be more desirable and therefore
more expensive. In their search for affordable housing, families are often forced to trade the
convenience of proximity for affordability. As the distance between work, school, daycare and
the grocery store is increased, so is the time spent connecting the stops, leaving less time for the
family to spend together, a particularly difficult situation for single-parent families.
Table B-9 shows the number of female-headed households in 2010. Of the total female-headed
households, 294 were listed as having incomes below the poverty level.

Affordable housing needs of female-headed households can be addressed through rent assistance,
low- and moderate income housing production, shared equity/down payment assistance and
group housing. Housing opportunities also can be improved through city policies calling for the
provision of affordable childcare, and by locating family-oriented housing developments close to
major employment areas, transportation facilities and shopping.
d) Disabled Persons
As shown in Table B-10 and B-11, about 6 percent of City residents reported some type of
disability on the 2010 Census. Access and affordability are two major issues that may limit
housing choices for disabled people. This group is included as having special housing needs
because people living with disabilities often need facilities not typically provided in conventional
housing. Depending on the disability, special accommodations may include specially designed
interior features and accessibility provisions outside the unit. California Administrative Code
Title 24 sets access and adaptability requirements for persons living with disabilities, and these
apply to most new residential and commercial developments. The regulations require special
architectural features to meet the needs of disabled persons, including access ramps, accessible
restrooms and appropriately designed interior features. These requirements do not apply to
single-family residential construction.

Convalescent homes and assisted residential-care facilities provide limited medical care in an
institutional setting. They usually accommodate older residents and others who do not need
acute medical care but who cannot live independently. Since 1994 several new residential
care/assisted living facilities have been built, catering mainly to elderly and disabled persons.

These range in services from apartments for relatively independent living in a group setting to
residential care facilities with full, onsite support services, including personal and medical care.
As shown in Table B-6, San Luis Obispo has residential care facilities, apartments or group
homes that can accommodate about 1,695 elderly or disabled residents.
Other adults, who need less medical attention than is provided by a convalescent home, are
accommodated by an increasing number of small group homes (discussed below). Those with
multiple or severe disabilities, usually both physical and mental, require group living
arrangements where care and supervision can be provided. San Luis Obispo has one large
facility with about 90 occupants and one smaller facility for infants and young children. The
demand for such accommodations is expected to grow at about the same rate as the overall
population. Sites for large facilities of this type are limited in number, although moderate-sized
and smaller facilities could be accommodated in many residential areas throughout the City.

  Disability

Persons with mental or physical disabilities who do not need medical supervision but are not able
to live independently can usually be accommodated in large or small group homes. Small
residential care facilities typically accommodate between six and 12 people, and provide beds,
meals and 24-hour assistance by caregivers. According to AIDS Support Network of San Luis
Obispo, there are an estimated 75-100 persons in San Luis Obispo suffering from HIV/AIDS and
related illnesses. Those suffering from HIV/AIDS have specific supportive housing needs. The
main housing problem for this group is housing affordability, since in many cases, the
HIV/AIDS patient can no longer hold down a job.
Mobility also is an issue, as a large percentage of this group is dependent upon public transit.
There are 12 apartments in San Luis Obispo (two facilities) exclusively for this group, able to
accommodate up to 24 persons, plus another eight units available through the City of San Luis
Obispo Housing Authority (with a capacity for 16 people), as available. HIV/AIDS patients can
also live in public housing for very low- and low-income persons, through the Housing Authority
of the City of San Luis Obispo.

e) Developmental Disabilities
A recent change in State law (SB 812) requires that the Housing Element discuss the housing
needs of persons with developmental disabilities. As defined by federal law, “developmental
disability” means a severe, chronic disability of an individual that is attributable to a mental or
physical impairment or combination which manifested before the age of 22 and is likely to
continue indefinitely. The disability results in substantial functional limitations in three or more
of the following areas of major life activity: a) self-care; b) receptive and expressive language; c)
learning; d) mobility; e) self-direction; f) capacity for independent living; or g) economic self-
sufficiency. The disability would also reflect the individual’s need for a combination and
sequence of special, interdisciplinary, or generic services, individualized supports, or other forms
of assistance that are of lifelong or extended duration and are individually planned and
coordinated.
Many developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently within a conventional
housing environment. More severely disabled individuals require a group living environment
where supervision is provided. The most severely affected individuals may require an
institutional environment where medical attention and physical therapy are provided. Because
developmental disabilities exist before adulthood, the first issue in supportive housing for the
developmentally disabled is the transition from the person’s living situation as a child to an
appropriate level of independence as an adult.
The Census does not record developmental disabilities. According to the California Department
of Developmental Services, approximately 367 developmentally disabled residents live in the
two San Luis Obispo zip codes of 93401 and 93405. Table B-12 shows that 134 people, or 37
percent, of developmentally disabled residents are less than 17 years of age while 233, or 63
percent, of developmentally disabled residents are over the age of 18. Policy 8.11 and Program
8.23 have been added to the Housing Element to address the housing needs of persons with
developmental disabilities.

f) Homeless Persons, Transitional Housing and Supportive Services
Homeless Persons
The City has been a long standing supporter of service provision to those who are experiencing
homelessness. Implementing strategies and programs that help transition people out of
homelessness has been a regional effort. The City has partnered with the County, other cities,
and nonprofit entities to provide programs that advance goals outlined in the San Luis Obispo
Countywide 10-year Plan to End Homelessness (10-Year Plan).
The City adopted the following Major City Goal of Implementing Comprehensive Strategies to
Address Homeless as a top priority in the 2013-2015 Financial Plan. The listed objectives and
associated work plan for this goal include encouraging improved and expanded services in
conjunction with the City’s partner organizations; support for a new homeless services center;
and development of a Good Neighbor Policy (GNP) for those entities providing services to
homeless populations in the City.
The City’s role in addressing homelessness includes the following:
    1. Politically support and strategically supplement efforts lead by the County.
    2. Financially support housing and service agencies whose mission it is to develop programs
        for the City’s homeless population.
    3. Provide funding assistance from Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), Grants-
        In-Aid (GIA) and General Fund monies to social service programs, such as the Maxine
        Lewis Memorial Shelter and Prado Day Center.
    4. Politically support and implement the 10-Year Plan.
    5. Leverage grant and Affordable Housing Fund monies, consistent with the 10-Year Plan,
        to assist with the development and preservation of affordable housing.
Homelessness is inherently difficult to quantify because it is often a transitional situation,
dependent upon a household’s or individual’s changing economic condition or location. Lacking
permanent housing, homeless persons are often missed in census surveys and other community
inventories. Due to a Homeless Enumeration Study and Report sponsored by the Homeless
Services Oversight Council (HSOC), a much clearer picture of homelessness in San Luis Obispo
City and County has emerged. The enumeration’s main findings are summarized below.

Table B-14 below summarizes the 2013 San Luis Obispo County Homeless County Report
which includes a point in time count of homeless individuals and families on January 23, 2013.
According to the report, 2,186 point in time homeless persons were living in San Luis Obispo
County in 2013, of which 750 persons, or 34.3 percent, were based in the City of San Luis
Obispo. Approximately 262, or about 12 percent of the County’s total homeless persons
counted, were under the age of 18. In the County, 33 percent of homeless persons are female.
In terms of sleeping arrangements, of the County’s total number of homeless persons observed
and interviewed 50 percent regularly slept outside, 11 percent in a shelter or transitional housing,
24 percent slept in a car, camper or other vehicle, and 12 percent in encampment areas. Because
the survey was conducted during a small time frame, using a HUD provided formula, the County
estimates that 3,497 persons are estimated to be homeless in the County.

The two largest facilities providing homeless services in the County are located in San Luis
Obispo: 1) the Maxine Lewis Memorial Homeless Shelter, a 50-bed shelter that provides
showers, clothes, free morning and evening meals, client mail and phone services year-round,
and 2) the Prado Day Center, which supplies lunch and other services for 90 to 120 people each
day, with women and children comprising about 30 percent. The Day Center provides a
supportive environment for individuals and families needing life services and a home base
during the day. Clients have onsite access to showers, phones, mail, daytime meals, laundry and
a range of public and private service providers, including job counselors and access to
transitional housing.
In addition, the Women’s Shelter of San Luis Obispo County is located in the City, providing
facilities for homeless, displaced or abused women and children. While small, temporary
homeless facilities have been available in North and South County, San Luis Obispo remains the
center of homeless services and facilities for the County. Both the Maxine Lewis Homeless
Shelter and the Prado Road Day Center are located in San Luis Obispo City and supported, in
large part, through City and County funding.

The Community Action Partnership of San Luis Obispo County (CAPSLO) works in partnership
with the Interfaith Coalition for the Homeless to provide “overflow” sheltering all year around.
A different church hosts the “overflow” program each month, providing 25-35 beds nightly. In
2013, approximately 861 homeless persons received one or more nights of overflow emergency
shelter and assistance in San Luis Obispo City.
Seen in Table B-15 below, when comparing homeless services between 2008 and 2013, there
was a significant difference in persons served and meals provided, while shelter nights and use of
the Prado Day Center remained relatively stable. During 2008, the Homeless Shelter served 726
different people, totaling 30,492 shelter-nights where an average of 81 homeless persons
received meals daily. At the Prado Day Center, 1,437 homeless people were served, with a total
of 44,044 homeless services provided during 2008. In 2013, 861 different persons received a
total of 29,573 shelter nights. A total of 36,707 meals were served in 2013, including 7,134
meals to “dinner/dashers”, or persons who came to the shelter for dinner and a shower but not for
a shelter bed. At the Prado Day Center, 1,490 homeless people were served, with a total of
45,114 homeless services provided in 2013. Overall, the largest increase in services from 2008
to 2013 was the amount of meals provided to “dinner dashers”, increasing 24 percent, while the
largest decrease of services was shelter nights provided which decreased 3 percent.

The 2013 homeless enumeration data also shows that significant numbers of homeless persons
are living in cars, campers, city creeks and open space areas and do not avail themselves of the
homeless shelters. Homeless service providers require that to receive services at the shelters,
homeless persons must sign in and must not be under the influence of drugs or alcohol. For
these and other reasons, many homeless people in San Luis Obispo remain invisible in terms of
their numbers and the services provided to them.
Transitional Housing and Supportive Services
A primary goal is to help homeless individuals and families achieve a measure of stability and
enable them to transition to safe, secure housing. Transitional housing gives homeless people a
stable environment while they seek employment or learn life skills towards self-sufficiency. San

Luis Obispo non-profit agencies, (CAPSLO), Housing Authority of the City of San Luis Obispo,
and Transitions Mental Health Association (TMHA), and San Luis Obispo County Social
Services use a “continuum of care” approach” that places clients in supportive housing in San
Luis Obispo City. For example, TMHA manages 21 congregate living houses in the City of San
Luis Obispo providing 98 beds; and 2 single unit apartment buildings which provide 10 beds
serving a range of residents including homeless persons, disabled persons and persons with
substance abuse issues.
To help homeless persons transition from emergency to permanent or semi-permanent shelter,
the City and the Housing Authority help fund transitional housing throughout the City. City
zoning regulations allow transitional housing in all zoning districts where residential uses are
allowed, consistent with State law. Transitional housing, typically lasting from six months to two
years, is more than just group housing. It includes a broad range of housing types, from detached
houses with up to five adults, to boarding houses with more than five adult residents.
Transitional housing in San Luis Obispo typically includes a resident manager with visiting staff
providing counseling, health care, education and other services. Those recovering from alcohol
and other drug dependencies and those making the transition from institutional environments to
more independent living can benefit from sheltered and supervised accommodations, or
“transitional housing." Demand for such facilities is expected to grow at about the same rate as
the overall population. Table B-16 lists homeless and transitional facilities in San Luis Obispo

The Urban County’s 2010 Consolidated Plan describes the County’s and participating cities’
major objectives for use of Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds. It targets a
Continuum of Care approach for addressing homelessness on a regional basis. Each
participating community, including the City of San Luis Obispo, is encouraged to provide a
range of homeless services, including outreach and assessment, basic emergency shelter,
emergency services, counseling and case management and transitional and permanent housing.
In 2013, however, total funding available for public services (15 percent of total CDBG funding)
countywide is approximately $240,000 annually (down from $388,000 in 2004). This amount is

not adequate to meet the countywide need for homeless operating expenses or capital
improvements.
SB 2 Compliance – PF Zoning and Homeless Shelters
In keeping with SB 2 requirements, the City has amended its Zoning Regulations to allow
homeless shelters by right in at least one zone in the City and incorporated state-allowed
standards for homeless shelters into the Regulations. In 2009, the City identified the PF or
“Public Facility” zone as being the most appropriate zone to accommodate homeless facilities.
The PF zone is intended to provide for the wide range of public uses likely to be located on
public property, including public buildings, parks, and other facilities with public uses. Public
uses are those conducted by governmental or nonprofit agencies. However, this zone also
provides for complementary private and commercial uses which, within the overall guidance of
the general plan, provide a public benefit. Homeless shelters fit this land use classification well
because PF zones are typically publicly-owned, have excellent public access and public
transportation, and already provide various types of public services.
There are approximately 425 acres of PF-zoned land in the City of San Luis Obispo and of this,
approximately 200 acres is under City ownership. The balance is owned primarily by the County
of San Luis Obispo, the San Luis Obispo Coastal Unified School District, and the State of
California. Most of the properties are developed with public uses and buildings. Some of the
properties include sufficient vacant or unused land which could be used for a homeless shelter,
either as infill or as part of land use changes. Homeless Shelters are allowed by right in the PF
(Public Facility) zone, and allowed with use permit approval in the R-3 (Medium-High Density
Residential, R-4 (High Density Residential), O (Office), C-N (Neighborhood Commercial), C-C
(Community Commercial), C-D (Downtown Commercial), C-R (Retail Commercial), C-S
(Service Commercial), C-T (Tourist Commercial), and M (Manufacturing) zones.
City and County efforts have focused on identifying a site in San Luis Obispo which could serve
as a homeless services center to meet a range of homeless needs and services, including shelter,
food, education, case management, administration, and other supportive services. The new site
would combine services currently provided at the Maxine Lewis Memorial Shelter and the Prado
Day Center, consistent with the 10-Year Plan. CAPSLO recently acquired a three acre site
located at 40 Prado Road for the development of the new homeless services center. The site is
zoned Office and will require approval of a use permit and architectural review of the building
design. Project plans are being developed and construction is anticipated in summer 2015.
g) Farm workers
The City of San Luis Obispo is in the County's central coastal agricultural region. San Luis
Obispo City is, for the most part, urbanized with only a few small farms still engaged in
agricultural production. According to the 2010 Census, about 1.7 percent of the City’s labor
force over 16 years of age work in the agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting industries, or
approximately 390 persons. Since less than two percent of the City’s labor force works in
agriculture, it follows that few farm workers actually work or live in the City. The primary
factors with regard to farm worker housing are affordability, proximity to jobs and bilingual
                                              Page B-19

Chapter 3

services for predominantly Spanish-speaking residents. High housing costs make it extremely
difficult to meet farm worker housing needs in San Luis Obispo.
Agriculture is one of San Luis Obispo County’s primary industries; however it is difficult to
determine how many farm workers live in the County or City. Some are permanent residents and
others are seasonal migratory workers. The US Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Census
compiles farm and farm employment information. Table B-17 shows that in 2012, USDA
reported 10,669 workers in the farm industry, county wide, an increase of 16 percent from 2007,
when USDA reported 9,175 workers. Of the 10,669 workers reported, 4,704 were permanent
(more than 150 days), and 5,965 were seasonal (less than 150 days). The largest change between
2007 and 2012 was a 24 percent increase in seasonal farmworkers, or those working less than
150 days per year.

A 1993 study on farm worker housing in San Luis Obispo prepared by People's Self-Help
Housing Corporation indicated that while there was some need for farm worker housing in the
City, the strongest needs for farm worker housing were in other, more predominantly agricultural
areas such as Paso Robles, Shandon, Nipomo and Arroyo Grande. The most intensive
agricultural activity in the San Luis Obispo area is located in the Edna Valley, just south of the
City. In the last decade, this area has experienced a rapid increase in wine grape production and
has generated a need for additional farm worker housing.
While the majority of farm worker housing needs will continue to be met in North and South
County areas closer to large farms, vineyards and ranches, there is still a need for an estimated
300 to 400 housing units suitable for farm worker families in San Luis Obispo during the
planning period. Like most special needs housing, farm worker housing is largely dependent on
city policies and implementation measures to provide for varied housing options, including
inclusionary housing, can be utilized to assist farm employees as a subset of low income
employees. This can be important since farm employees often have the same needs as other low
income citizens (access to services, day care, schools, public transportation). Having policies
and implementation efforts which lead to the development of affordable housing can benefit
farm employees even when it is not targeted specifically to farm employees.
                                                 Page B-20

                                                                 Housing Element
                                                                                      
For example, a recent development project in the City of Atascadero by Habitat For Humanity
provided housing for two long-term farm employees in the county because they passed through
Habitat's screening, not because the housing was specifically targeted for farm employees.
Farm workers housing needs may be met through the development of additional extremely low
and very low income public housing, mixed-, low- and moderate income housing through the
Inclusionary Housing Program, and First-Time Homebuyer Assistance to provide gap loans
and/or grants for low-income families hoping to purchase housing. Farm worker housing is not
treated any differently than other types of single-family, multi-family, or group housing (e.g.
boarding/rooming houses or dormitories). Farm worker housing is allowed in up to nine zone
districts wherever other types of dwellings are allowed.
h) Students
It is estimated that Cal Poly State University and Cuesta College students comprise more than
one third of the City's population. As a result, students strongly influence the City’s housing
supply and demand. Although often grouped into low-income categories statistically, many
students can spend more on housing than income data suggests because of parental support or
larger household sizes. By pooling their housing funds, groups of students can often afford more
expensive housing than non-student households. This contributes to higher rents in San Luis
Obispo than in other parts of the County.
Cal Poly’s student population is approximately 19,800 (Cal Poly, Fall 2013). In fall 2013, Cal
Poly had on-campus housing available for 6,300 students, with approximately 32 percent of the
Cal Poly student population housed on campus. The other 68 percent, including married and
graduate students, either find housing elsewhere in the City of San Luis Obispo or in other
communities throughout the County. In fall 2013, the most recent year data was available, about
12,462 Cal Poly students, or two-thirds of the University’s total enrollment of 19,800, lived in
the City. According to Cuesta College, approximately 3,741 students, or 33 percent of total
enrollment, made San Luis Obispo home in fall 2013. Hence, an estimated 16,203 college
students live in San Luis Obispo and comprised about 36 percent of the City’s 2010 population.
Cuesta College has no on-campus housing.
Student housing preferences sometimes result in competition and conflicts with other segments
of the City's population. Student housing complexes close to Cal Poly State University have,
since the late 1990s, experienced high occupancy rates, prompting many students to seek
alternative housing arrangements outside the immediate campus area. Many students choose to
find apartments or condominiums elsewhere in the City, and increasingly, students choose to
share houses in single-family neighborhoods. The presence of students renting houses in
neighborhoods sometimes leads to complaints from surrounding property owners due to lifestyle
conflicts, parking congestion, noise and property maintenance concerns.
Student lifestyles - and thus, housing needs - often differ from those of non-student households.
Most Cal Poly students are young adults, have cars, many have part-time jobs, and most have
classes any time from early morning to late at night. To meet these needs, student-oriented
housing often includes: 1) a larger number of parking spaces in proportion to bedrooms than is
                                             Page B-21

Chapter 3

required for "traditional" family housing; 2) individual study areas; 3) proximity to Cal Poly or
transit; and 4) easy access to food services, Laundromats and recreational facilities.
Coming from family homes, many young students prefer the appearance, space, flexibility and
freedom offered by detached houses, often located in "single-family neighborhoods." To afford
rent, three or more students often live together and share costs. This means that homes designed
to meet the needs of families are increasingly occupied by several unrelated adults. Because the
homes were not designed to meet student needs or lifestyles, conflicts with the neighborhood
residents sometimes arise. Common complaints are: 1) that there are too many cars on the rental
property or parked on the public street; 2) that renters cause excessive noise and hold activities,
including parties, until late at night; and 3) that the homes and grounds are not well maintained.
A central theme of Cal Poly’s 2000 Master Plan was to create several on-campus student
residential communities and the provision of faculty and staff housing to accommodate 20,000
students and over 3,000 faculty members, a 17 percent increase for the planning period of 2000-
2020. Today Cal Poly has the largest on-campus housing program in the California State
University system with 6,300 students living on-campus. Recent student and faculty housing
facilities built to help meet expanding enrollment are highlighted below:
1) Cerro Vista – 200 apartments, each with 4 private apartments and shared kitchen, living room
     and two bathrooms, housing a total of 800 students. Cerro Vista opened in September 2004.
2) Bella Montana – 69 detached below-market single-family houses for Cal Poly faculty and
     employees, located on State-owned land adjacent to Cal Poly campus. Two- and three-
     bedroom models range in size from 1,029 to 1,614 square feet. The project was completed in
     summer 2007.
                                                         3) Poly Canyon Village – 618 apartments
                                                         housing 2,661 students, plus 11,255 square
                                                         feet of retail floor area. The final phase
                                                         opened in the fall of 2009.
                                                         In all, 887 recently built dwellings located on
                                                         or adjacent to Cal Poly campus has helped
                                                         reduce pressure on the City’s rental and
                                                         purchase housing market and helped
                                                         moderate rental cost increases by providing
                                                         additional on-campus alternatives to the
                                                         traditional “dormitories.” And while these
                                                         new dwellings will help to address housing
                                                         needs generated by Cal Poly enrollment
growth during the planning period, they will not fully address the existing shortage of student
housing. Student housing will continue to be a major housing need in the City.

                                                                 Housing Element
                                                                                       
Cal Poly is currently in the process of updating their 2000 Master Plan for 2030, which guides
future student enrollment and on campus student housing. The most recent proposed on-campus
student housing development, Student Housing South, has 1,475 proposed dormitory style beds
near the campus’ main entrance. Cal Poly hopes to start construction on the project in summer
2015.
i) Fraternities and Sororities
Another important concern is meeting the housing needs of student fraternities and sororities.
"Greek" houses are allowed in medium-high- and high-density residential zones, with a Planning
Commission use permit. As of 2014, there are nine sororities and 17 fraternities that hold
fraternal events and maintain a presence in San Luis Obispo. Of these, eight of the sororities and
nine fraternities occupy fraternal “houses” owned or rented by the organizations. Student
interest in joining fraternal organizations appears to be on the upswing. According to Cal Poly
officials, about 15-20 percent of Cal Poly students, or about 2,900 students, are members of a
fraternity or sorority. As part of Greek activities, many Cal Poly fraternities and sororities
actively participate in beneficial university and community programs and events. In addition,
they often host meetings, recruitment activities and social events that can have a negative impact
on their neighbors. For example, on-street parking is affected, and noise and traffic levels often
increase due to frequent visits by non-residents attending fraternal activities. When Greek
housing is located close to non-student housing, compatibility conflicts sometimes arise.
There are few large sites available that could accommodate a new fraternity or sorority house
and still satisfy parking and group meeting needs without posing neighborhood conflicts.
Conflicts between these sororities and fraternities and other citizens have occurred, in part,
because there has never been a shared community consensus on a plan to guide the University,
fraternities and sororities, neighbors and the City on how and where to meet the need for Greek
housing. The solution may be, at least in part, to identify appropriate locations for additional
Greek housing on or near the Cal Poly campus. For several years, various committees have
devoted themselves to creating a "Greek Row”, an area large enough to house a number of
sororities and fraternities in one place. The concept has wide support in the community, but the
possible locations all have drawbacks. A Community Housing Task Force that included
students, members of Cal Poly administration, the Mayor and other citizens and City staffers
identified several alternative locations for a Greek Row. Among those were Cal Poly land, the
Hathway Street neighborhood and conversion of existing student complexes such as Mustang
Village. The City intends to encourage "Greek housing" on the Cal Poly University campus, and
until that can be accomplished, in R-3 and R-4 zones.
j) "Shared" Households
San Luis Obispo encourages a variety of housing types to meet varied lifestyles and needs.
Many people are looking for alternative ways to limit the amount of income they spend on
housing. U.S. Census figures for 2010 show that more unrelated adults are sharing houses than
ever before. In San Luis Obispo, the percentage of non-family households (households with one
or more non-relatives) is 27 percent. In addition to saving money, sharing a house also provides
the benefits of companionship and security. There appears to be substantial community interest
in shared-housing opportunities such as cooperatives or co-housing. Co-housing allows residents
                                              Page B-23

Chapter 3
City of San Luis Obispo Housing Element, January 2015
to live in their own private spaces and share centralized dining, meeting and recreation facilities
and services. Some of the obstacles to providing co-housing in the City are the availability of
sites, public acceptance of and the possible need for exceptions to current standards to develop
such a project.
k) Single-Room Occupancy (SRO)
A single room occupancy dwelling (more commonly called an “SRO”) houses one or two people
in an individual room (sometimes one room plus separate bathroom or half bathroom) in a multi-
unit building – often a former hotel or boarding house. SRO tenants may share bathrooms and/or
kitchens, while some SRO tenants have individual kitchenettes, bathrooms, or half-baths. SROs
are typically rental dwellings with floor areas of 150 to 450 square feet. They provide a viable
housing option for lower income persons, including extremely low income, very low and low
income, and others who do not desire or require large dwellings or private domestic appliances.
Their small size and limited amenities generally makes SROs an affordable housing option,
especially in downtown areas with high land values. They also can serve as transitional housing
to provide an entry point into the housing market for formerly homeless people.
San Luis Obispo allows single-room occupancy dwellings in all zoning districts where
residential uses are allowed. The City has two SRO buildings downtown: the historic Anderson
Hotel (discussed under Chapter 4.40) and the Wineman Hotel. The Anderson Hotel is operated
by the Housing Authority of the City of San Luis Obispo and has 70 units serving very-low and
low income persons, many of whom are elderly or disabled. The Wineman Hotel is privately
owned and managed, and has 48 units serving moderate, low- and very-low income persons
under an affordability agreement with the City.
The Housing Element includes several policies and programs to encourage the preservation and
development of SROs, including:
3.4          Encourage the construction, preservation, rehabilitation or expansion of residential
             hotels, group homes, integrated community apartments, and single-room occupancy
             dwellings.
6.8          Consistent with the City’s goal to stimulate higher density infill where appropriate in
             the Downtown Core (C-D Zone), the City shall consider changes to the Zoning
             Regulations that would allow for the development of smaller apartments and
             efficiency units.
6.13         Continue to develop incentives to encourage additional housing in the Downtown
             Core (C-D Zone), particularly in mixed-use developments. Density based on average
             unit size in a project should be explored to encourage the development of smaller
             efficiency units.
6.29         Continue to pursue incentives to encourage development of Secondary Dwelling
             Units (SDUs). Possible incentives include SDU design templates, flexible
             development standards, fee reductions or deferrals, or other measures to encourage
             the construction of SDUs where allowed by zoning.

                                                                            Housing Element
                                                                                                     
6.31          Consider scaling development impact fees for residential development based on size,
              number of bedrooms, and room counts.
8.1            Encourage housing development that meets a variety of special needs, including
               large families, single parents, disabled persons, the elderly, students, veterans, the
               homeless, or those seeking congregate care, group housing, single-room occupancy
               or co-housing accommodations, utilizing universal design.
9.12           Consider incentivizing dwelling units to a minimum size of 150 square feet,
               consistent with the California Building Code, by reduced impact fees and property
               development standards.
3. Conclusion
Three general categories of housing needs are discussed in this section: existing needs, growth
needs and special needs. These are summarized below in Table B-17.

      Remaining new housing construction need after credit for dwellings approved, permitted, under construction or
     built between January 1, 2014 and June 30, 2014.
The main findings of the needs analysis are:
         Overpayment. In 2010, 50 percent of all City households overpaid for housing. Among
          low-income households (< $35,000/year), 48 percent of owner households overpaid and
          80 percent of renters overpaid for housing.
         Overcrowding. Overcrowding appears to have declined in San Luis Obispo since 2000.
          About six percent of rental units are overcrowded, and just over one percent of owner-
          occupied units are overcrowded.

        Large Families. In 2010, about six percent of City households, or 1,118 households,
         were “large families” with five or more members, at least two of which were related.
         Large dwellings, with six or more rooms, make up about one-third of the City’s housing
         stock, or 7,000 units. The majority of these units are owner-occupied.
        Female-headed Households. Female-headed households comprise seven percent of the
         City’s 18,485 households, or about 1,336 households. Of these, about one-half include
         children less than 18 years of age.
        Regional Housing Needs. San Luis Obispo’s assigned regional housing need for the
         planning period January 2014 – June 2019 is 1,144, broken down by household income
         group as follows:
                       Extremely Low – 142 units;
                       Very Low -- 143 units;
                       Low -- 179 units;
                       Moderate -- 202 units;
                       Above Moderate -- 478 units.
          Remaining new housing construction need after credit for dwellings approved, under
          construction or built between January 1, 2014 and June 30, 2013 are:
                       Extremely Low – 137 units;
                       Very Low – 110 units;
                       Low – 139 units;
                       Moderate – 139 units;
                       Above Moderate – 0 units.
                       Total remaining need of 525 dwelling units.

Appendix C
Housing Constraints and Resources
1. Governmental Constraints
Governmental constraints are the policies, standards, requirements, actions or fees imposed by
local, State or Federal governments to guide land use and development. Their purpose is to
ensure communities are well planned, and to protect the health, safety and wellbeing of all
residents. Within the City of San Luis Obispo, local building and zoning regulations are the
primary regulatory tools guiding development. Some regulations, such as the Uniform Building
Code and the California Environmental Quality Act, are State-mandated policies and standards
implemented at the local level. Although State and Federal agencies do play a role in the
imposition of government constraints, these agencies are generally beyond the influence of local
government and are not analyzed in this document.
As further described below, land use, development, economic stability and construction
standards can affect the type, location, number and cost of new dwellings. In general, these
standards are intended to protect public health, welfare and safety and are necessary to carry out
state, federal or local law. In achieving these public purposes, government rules may serve to
constrain the construction rate, amount or design of new housing. State law requires that
governmental constraints on housing be addressed in the Housing Element, with the goal of
removing or modifying such constraints where possible to encourage suitable housing. Program
2.6 calls for the City to evaluate code requirements and development standards to remove
unnecessary constraints to housing while still protecting public health, welfare and safety. Such
evaluation is on-going, as part of the preparation, review, or amendment of local development
regulations, or as needed to address specific issues raised by decision makers or the public.
a) Land Use Controls
General Plan
By State law, all California cities must have a general plan to guide land use, transportation,
housing and other important facets of the community. The general plan is the foundation of all
local land use controls, and embodies the community’s vision for an environmentally sound, life-
sustaining future. Seven mandated elements, or chapters, make up the general plan, plus optional
elements adopted by the jurisdiction to address special community concerns. Among these
elements, the land use element identifies the location, nature, distribution and character of land
uses in the City.
To implement the General Plan, the City uses a number of planning tools including Zoning
Regulations, Specific Plans, Subdivision Regulations, Community Design Guidelines, Historic
Preservation Program Guidelines and Parking and Driveway Standards.              Property owners,
developers, architects and others use these standards in designing new housing developments.

Chapter 3
City of San Luis Obispo Housing Element, January 2015
The standards help explain the City’s requirements and expectations, and are used by the City
when reviewing development proposals.
Policies outlined in the Land Use Element stipulate the amount, type and location of housing.
They also help establish the prevailing housing patterns and population density. Residential
zones account for over 41 percent of total zoned land area within City limits. The San Luis
Obispo General Plan provides four residential zones, plus nine zones where housing is allowed
with special approval. Table C-1 shows the land use zones that allow housing, their existing
acreage and the ranges of density allowed.

   density achieved.
General Plan policies encourage infill development to avoid sprawl, and also designate major
residential expansion areas outside city limits and within the Urban Reserve, the City’s
anticipated urban limits at build out. The policies seek to balance residential development with
open space preservation and availability of urban services. According to the 1994 General Plan
Land Use Element, a total of 24,674 dwellings are anticipated within the City by the year 2029,

accommodating approximately 56,750 persons. As of January 2013, the State Department of
Finance reported 20,697 dwellings in San Luis Obispo, housing a total of 45,541 persons. The
City is currently updating the Land Use Element.
b) Zoning Regulations and Development Standards
Zoning Regulations implement the City's General Plan land use policies. They establish specific
development standards, allowable land uses, performance standards and the permit process
necessary for the City’s orderly development. Zoning regulations control development by
regulating allowed uses, and by development standards that set density, building setbacks,
building height, lot area and parking requirements. The regulations apply equally to mobile
homes, manufactured and site-built housing. Table C-2 summarizes residential zoning
development standards for San Luis Obispo. The standards are comparable to other
communities’ requirements and ensure a quality living environment for all households,
regardless of tenure or income group.

  Additional building height up to 75 feet may be approved if specific performance standards are met (see Ch. 17.42
of Municipal Code)
4
  Mixed-use and Work/live projects only.
Exceptions to Development Standards
Several exceptions or variance procedures are possible in the Planned Development and Specific
Plan zones. They allow flexibility in site planning and building design to encourage the
development of housing for special needs groups, and to provide density bonuses for projects
which include affordable housing which meets or exceeds City standards.
The City has adopted a reasonable accommodation ordinance to implement state law and
Housing Element programs. The Ordinance provides a fair and reasonable procedure for disabled
persons to request flexibility in the application of land use and zoning regulations to ensure equal
access to housing. Examples of accommodations may include such things as yard area
modifications for ramps, handrails or other such accessibility improvements; hardscape
additions, such as widened driveways, parking areas or walkways; building additions for
accessibility; or reduced off-street parking where the disability clearly limits the number of
people operating vehicles. The Ordinance establishes a process where the Community
Development Director (or other review authority if the request is submitted for concurrent
review with another discretionary land use application) would determine that the individual
making the request for accommodation has a disability as defined in the fair housing laws or is
developing housing for individuals with such disabilities. As part of the application
requirements, the applicant would need to establish that, because of the disability, the requested
accommodation is necessary to overcome a barrier to housing. If the individual has established
the need for the accommodation based on the disability, the Director may grant the request,
subject to findings and applicable conditions, unless granting the request would be an undue
financial or administrative burden to the City or would result in a fundamental alteration in the
City’s land use and zoning programs.

Energy Conservation
Compliance with Title 24 of the California Administrative Code on the use of energy efficient
appliances and insulation has reduced energy demands resulting from new residential
development. The City’s Conservation and Open Space Element, Subdivision and Zoning
Regulations promote energy-conserving design and placement of buildings. Programs 9.10 and
9.11 call for creating incentives to promote “green” housing construction and the reuse and
                                                      Page C-5

recycling of materials. This will be accomplished through the architectural review process and
implementation of the City’s Climate Action Plan.
Mixed Residential and Commercial Uses
Mixing residential and commercial uses is encouraged to promote housing development close to
jobs and employment centers, to exploit affordable infill housing opportunities and to promote a
compact, pedestrian- and transit-friendly urban structure. Mixed-use projects are allowed by
right in all commercial zones except for Service-Commercial and Manufacturing zones, which
require Planning Commission approval. Rezoning is not required. Mixed Use development
refers to the vertical or horizontal mixing of commercial and residential uses on the same parcel.
There is no minimum commercial floor area or number of dwellings established. Typical mixed-
use development includes one to two residential floors above commercial uses on the ground
level, and mixed use development is allowed on parcels as small as 3,000 square feet in the
Downtown Core. Figure C-1 identifies mixed-use projects constructed in San Luis Obispo since
General Plan adoption. Program 6.11 calls for additional incentives to encourage mixed-use
developments in the Downtown Core, including flexible density, use, height or parking
incentives.
Parking Requirements
San Luis Obispo’s car parking requirements are shown in Table C-2. The type and number of
car parking spaces varies by zone. Flexible parking requirements and design standards allow
developers to reduce parking by up to 30 percent for mixed-use developments. Flexible
standards also allow variety in parking locations, layouts and design in order to promote more
efficient and attractive use of residential sites. Bicycle and motorcycle parking is also required
for multi-family housing at the rate of one motorcycle plus one bicycle space per 20 car spaces.
Parking requirements indirectly constrain housing, especially in the Downtown Core where
parking is very limited. Because the Zoning Regulations require that parking be provided on the
same site as the use, this reduces the amount of land available for residential development.
While excessive parking requirements can unduly constrain housing, insufficient parking can
adversely affect residents’ safety, quality of life and neighborhood compatibility. The City’s
standards seek to establish a balance by allowing flexible requirements that can be tailored to
specific site conditions where necessary. Program 6.12 calls for continued flexibility in parking
regulations for housing development, especially in the Downtown Core (C-D zone), which
allows a base residential density of 36 density units per acre (equivalent to 36 two-bedroom units
per acre). Allowing reduced or no parking requirements for development of housing for people
who either do not own or need on-site parking will be considered.
Much of the Downtown Core was developed in the late 19th and early 20th century when
automobile parking was not required. Many parcels in the C-D and C-R zones lack onsite
parking. The Downtown Core is the most intensively developed area of the City, and
development standards encourage 100 percent site utilization and a mix of commercial,
residential, cultural and governmental uses. In the C-D zone, parking is half of what is required
for residential use in other zones, and may be met by locating parking off site, within 500 feet of
the use, or by paying a fee in lieu of providing parking. The long-term strategy has been to build
                                                  Page C-6

                                                                  Housing Element
                                                                                      
public parking facilities on the edges of Downtown to encourage infill and intensification, use of
public transit and a more “pedestrian friendly” Downtown Core.
Although the C-D zone allow the highest base residential density housing in the City, housing is
difficult to build, in part, because of the difficulty in providing parking. Downtown hotels
(Anderson Hotel, Granada Hotel, Wineman Hotel, Blackstone Hotel) were developed with little
or no parking, while providing housing for tourists or residents without cars. 2010 Census
figures show that about eight percent of San Luis Obispo household did not own a car. For those
without cars, or those who use cars infrequently, Downtown provides an alternative housing
choice near schools, shopping, nightlife, jobs and services. For those who do need cars, the
possibility exists for shared use of private or public downtown parking facilities. For example,
some parking may be available for rent in Downtown public parking facilities during evenings,
when times of peak parking demand do not coincide. Additional flexibility to allow very low or
no parking requirements for residents without cars and with adequate guarantees tied to
occupancy, could help expand housing opportunities in this important and desirable location.
Subdivision and Grading Regulations
Subdivision regulations determine how land is subdivided and set requirements for facilities such
as public streets and utility lines that serve the new subdivisions. Specific requirements for
materials and construction are adopted as policy by the City, according to recommendations by
the City Engineer. Special limits and requirements are often set by the City Council when
approving individual subdivisions. The minimum lot size of most residential zones is 5,000
square feet, with minimum widths of 50 feet; however, exceptions to lot size and dimensions are
possible with City Council approval. As a special type of attached, ownership housing, the
Condominium Regulations set minimum standards for open-space, recreation, laundry facilities,
solar heating and storage that are higher than those applied to rental housing. The City's Grading
Regulations set limits and procedures for earth moving, generally to prevent mass re-contouring
and erosion and to assure stable building sites.
Lot Size. Lot sizes and established neighborhood patterns influence the types of housing within a
community. Historically, most residential lots in San Luis Obispo ranged in size from 5,000 to
7,500 square feet, with about 6,000 square feet being common in newer subdivisions. The
subdivision of land into parcels of 6,000-10,000 square feet, regardless of allowed density, has
encouraged the development of low-density, detached housing. Reducing the minimum lot size
is often recommended as a means of increasing housing density and thereby reducing land cost
per unit of housing. It does not necessarily follow, however, that small lots will result in more
affordable housing. There are many coastal resort communities in California with high-priced
cottages on small lots. In high-density residential areas, small lots may encourage the
construction of detached, rather than multi-family housing. Large parcels in medium-high and
high-density residential zones offer the best opportunities to encourage affordable housing.
Larger parcels in San Luis Obispo, even in low-density residential zones, are suitable for
apartments and condominiums.
San Luis Obispo allows relatively small lots of 6,000 square feet in the R-1 zone, and 5,000
square feet in all other residential zones. San Luis Obispo has the second highest residential
density of the County's cities (after Grover Beach) with about 4,500 persons per square mile. It

remains, however, one of the most expensive housing markets in the County. Clearly, market
demand strongly influences housing costs. And while the City's lot pattern has been established
in most areas, lot patterns in expansion areas encourage a mix of residential densities and lot
sizes. For example, the Orcutt Area Specific Plan contains a minimum lot size of 4,500 square
feet compared with the typical low density residential lot size of 6,000 square feet.
Land is a major component of housing costs in San Luis Obispo. In many of the City’s older
neighborhoods, lot sizes of less than 6,000 square feet are common. While many housing
consumers prefer single, detached houses on 6,000-square-foot or larger lots, there also appears
to be a market for smaller, detached homes on relatively small (e.g. 4,000 to 4,500 square feet)
lots. Reducing lot areas with a resultant reduction in house size is one strategy to reduce housing
costs for those desiring “starter housing,” such as working couples and small families just
entering the housing market. Program 6.30 implements this strategy by encouraging new
subdivision standards that promote small lot subdivisions, bungalow court developments and
other innovative development concepts. In 2013, such development requires approval of a
variance or a planned development (PD) rezoning.
c) Specific Plans and Area Plans
As the name implies, specific plans guide the development of a defined area to implement the
general plan and guide development in expansion areas. Such plans can vary widely in terms of
geographic area covered, degree of specificity, and land uses addressed. As shown in Table C-4,

        Minor Annexation Areas consist of dwelling units on properties located outside of City boundaries but inside the Urban
      Reserve Line (ex: Highland Dr/Hwy 1, Foothill Saddle, etc)
The City has four expansion areas that, when fully developed, could potentially add 1,699
dwellings. The Minor Annexation areas are located outside City limits but inside the Urban
Reserve Line; the other expansion areas are located within City Limits. City policies require the
preparation of specific plans for each of the major expansion areas, with provisions for phased
housing development. Each area's phasing will be determined, in part, by the affordability of the
dwellings, and by other public benefits such as open space. The specific plan areas committed to
producing the largest number of dwellings affordable to very low- or low-income residents are
the Margarita and Orcutt Area Specific Plan areas. Descriptions of the planned zoning and
permitted uses in these areas, including land available and suitable for higher density, multi-

Orcutt Area Specific Plan
The Orcutt Area Specific Plan (OASP) covers about 231 acres in the southeastern part of the
urban area. Almost half of the area will be open space or parks. The rest will accommodate up to
1,091 dwellings of various types, of which at least 15 percent, or 147 dwellings, will be deed
restricted to ensure affordability for moderate and lower income households. Affordability will
be required on a project-by-project basis, as a condition of development approval and
implemented by development agreements between the property owners and the City.
The General Plan Land Use Element requires that specific plans for major residential expansion
areas include sites suitable for affordable and low-income rental and owner-occupied housing.
Such sites must be integrated within neighborhoods of market rate housing and comparable in
overall quality and design. The OASP designates sufficient areas at appropriate densities to
accommodate a range of dwelling types, including detached and attached single-family
dwellings, “sweat-equity” housing, duplexes, apartments and condominiums, manufactured
housing parks, group housing, graduated care facilities, and creative housing cooperatives. To
meet this requirement, the City will solicit and support new housing developments that include
one or more of the following features:
    1. Subdivisions designed to integrate various housing types, densities, and costs.
    2. Affordable “Starter” housing consisting of small (approximately 1,150-1,450 square feet)
        homes on lots of 5,000 square feet or less.
    3. Duplexes and “garden homes” which provide the desirability and appearance of single-
        family housing while allowing higher density and lower housing costs.
    4. Self-help housing development of approximately 20-30 small, single-story detached
        homes.

     5. Medium Density and Medium-High Density apartments, condominiums or manufactured
         housing.
     6. Special needs housing designed for seniors, handicapped persons, farm workers, large
         families, graduated care facilities, or others with special physical needs and low incomes
         in high density and mixed-use zones.

Developers may choose to build one or more housing types, and to work with housing non-
profits such as Peoples’ Self-Help Housing Corporation, the San Luis Obispo Housing Authority,
Habitat for Humanity, or other agencies or individuals to cooperatively plan, develop, and
market affordable housing within their developments. OASP policies require that 10 percent
moderate income and 5 percent low-income dwelling units are built with each development.

  In the R-1 and C/OS zones, all dwellings count as one (1) density unit, allowing up to seven dwellings per acre. In all other
zones allowing residential uses, density is adjusted for unit size and expressed as density units (DU). Studio units assigned a
density unit value of 0.5 DU, 1 bedroom = 0.66 DU, 2 bedroom = 1 DU, bedroom =1.5 DU, and 4 or more bedrooms = 2.0 DU.

  By ordinance, 10% of new housing must be affordable to moderate income and 5% must be affordable to Low Income.
Assumes ½ of Low Income requirement will be dedicated to San Luis Obispo Housing Authority as Very-Low or Extremely Low
Income housing using City Affordable Housing Funds and other grants and incentives.
Remaining landowners in the OASP will be required to construct affordable housing or pay-in
lieu housing fees for their share of the low-income housing requirement. Housing Element
Policy 2.5 requires that if the in-lieu fee option is chosen, the property owner must pay a 15%
percent in-lieu fee to the City to be deposited in the Affordable Housing Fund.
Since the OASP was adopted in March 2010, the City has approved a 142 residential
development project and has received a development proposal with 275 dwelling units. Staff
anticipates construction to begin in 2015, with certificates of occupancy issued for at least one-
third of these units by 2016.
Mid-Higuera Enhancement Plan
The City has adopted an area plan for the mid-Higuera area, an area of approximately 100 acres
of mostly commercial-service and retail uses. The Plan promotes mixed residential and
commercial uses and addresses several development constraints in this older commercial
corridor (it was the original “El Camino Real,” the City’s main southern entrance until the
1950s): flooding, limited street access, traffic congestion, lack of pedestrian and bicycle
facilities, and dilapidated and substandard buildings. To encourage higher density infill housing,
the City rezoned an older auto-trailer court of 5.7 acres consisting of 28 small bungalows and 25
trailer spaces from M/O-PD to R-4 zone to allow high density, multi-family housing by right.
This level property’s net developable area is about 5.5 acres with a development potential of 24

units per net acre, for a base residential capacity of 132 two-bedroom dwellings. The site is well
suited for apartments or air-space condominiums in a townhouse configuration. Maximum building
height is 35 feet; maximum building lot coverage 60 percent. Parking requirement includes: 1 space
per studio, 2 spaces per 1 and 2-bedroom unit, plus guest parking at 1 space per 5 units. Affordable
low-income or senior units (62 or older) require one space per unit.
The property is well suited for high-density residential use. It is located near Meadow Park and
Hawthorne School, has easy access to local and regional bus routes, and is close to shopping and
jobs. Redevelopment would: 1) be consistent with the General Plan and past Planning and City
Council actions supporting "affordable" housing at this site; 2) implement mixed-use policies found
in both the Land Use and Housing Elements; 3) improve the site’s run down appearance near a City
gateway; and 4) provide rental or ownership housing for low- and moderate-income households on
a site which historically has provided affordable housing for those at the lower end of the income
range. Its location near commercial and industrial properties makes it less likely that a new, high-
density housing development here would generate major controversy or opposition from neighbors.
An added benefit of redevelopment would be the completion of street improvements on Beebee and
Bridge Streets bordering this property. Current low income tenants would have first right of refusal
to rent or lease new affordable, multi-family units.
The site's chief development issue is that it is partially located in a 100-year flood zone. Residential
development is possible with appropriate design to minimize flood hazard and meet building codes.
In addition, the County Flood Control Zone 9 agency in conjunction with the City of San Luis
Obispo plans to install a creek bypass channel nearby which is expected to reduce flood hazard in
the planning area. Currently the project is in preliminary design with an implementation date
estimated during the summer of 2017.
d) Residential Growth Management Regulations
The General Plan says that “the City’s housing supply shall grow no faster than one percent per
year.” This policy was modified in 2010 to an average of one percent per year over the five-year
Housing Element planning period. The policy change responded to slow residential growth
trends combined with the phasing and financing plans incorporated into the Margarita and Orcutt
Specific Plan Areas. The Residential Growth Management Regulations requires each specific
plan area to adopt a phasing schedule for residential growth to ensure that established thresholds
in the Land Use Element are not exceeded. As shown in Table A-18, annual increases in the
number of dwellings have averaged 0.45 percent over the past ten years. Units that are deed-
restricted as affordable to extremely low, very low, low and moderate income households are not
factored into the Growth Management Schedule because they are exempt from the Growth
Management Ordinance. Dwellings built in the downtown area are also exempt.
Quantified objectives anticipate the construction of 1,144 in-city dwellings during the planning
period. Of these, 58 percent, or 666 dwellings, will be affordable to extremely low, very-low,
low, and moderate income households, consistent with the percentages of housing affordability
in the City’s RHNA number.

The Residential Growth Management Regulations will not prevent the City from achieving its
quantified objectives because they do not set a numeric cap on all housing. For example, new
housing that is affordable to extremely low, very low-, low-, and moderate-income households
and new housing in the Downtown Core (C-D) are exempt from the Regulations.
Figure C-2 shows the housing and population growth anticipated in the General Plan. General
Plan policies promote a balance of land uses to create a healthy, sustainable and resilient
economic basis, protect the natural environment and promote housing that can accommodate all
income groups. The General Plan stated that population growth should not increase more than
one percent per year, until it reaches a build out population of 56,750 persons in 2029.
The Airport Land Use Plan
The San Luis Obispo County Airport has a major influence on the community, particularly the
southern part of San Luis Obispo’s urban area where most of the City’s residential growth is
planned. Under State law, a countywide, independent Airport Land Use Commission (ALUC)
adopts a plan identifying land uses that are compatible with present and future airport noise and
safety conditions. The area subject to this Airport Land Use Plan (ALUP) extends beyond the
City’s designated airport specific plan area, and includes land under City and County
jurisdictions. Proposed specific plans and amendments to the General Plan and Zoning Map or
Regulations are referred to the ALUC for a compatibility determination. The ALUC uses its plan
as a basis for those determinations. A four-fifths vote of the City Council and certain findings are
required for the City to override a finding of incompatibility. The City’s General Plan calls for
consistency with the Airport Land Use Plan.
                                                  Page C-13

Chapter 3
City of San Luis Obispo Housing Element, January 2015
In June 2002, the ALUC adopted major amendments to its 1970s-vintage plan. The amendments
significantly reduced the number of residential units that could be built in the areas subject to the
plan. In most areas, the plan limits overall residential density to six dwellings per acre, well
below densities targeted by City plans. For example, the number of units planned for the
Margarita Area had to be reduced from 1,100 dwellings to 868 dwellings. The City has since
amended the Airport, Margarita and Orcutt Expansion Area Specific Plans to reflect the amended
ALUP, and also amended the Zoning Regulations (as part of the proposed commercial zoning
update). The Airport Land Use Plan was most recently amended in May 2005.
Density Bonus
The City’s Affordable Housing Incentives were updated in July 2013 for consistency with State
density bonus law. The Affordable Housing Incentives allow a residential density bonus of at
least 20 percent for developers who build five or more dwellings with at least 5 percent of those
units sold or rented at prices affordable to very-low income households or 10 percent of those
units sold or rented at prices affordable to low income households. Housing developments with
at least 20 percent of the units targeted for persons 55 years or older also qualify for a 20 percent
density bonus. Additional incentives and concessions, including density bonuses greater than 35
percent, reduction in site development standards and waiver of application and development
review processing fees are available upon request by the developer.
Secondary Dwelling Units
Consistent with AB 1866 (Section 65852.2 of State Housing Element law), the City’s Zoning
Regulations allow the creation of second-units with ministerial approvals in the R-1, R-2, R-3,
R-4 and O zones when the primary use on the site is a single-family dwelling, subject to the
Community Development Director’s determination that the project meets general requirements
and performance standards. Under the law, cities may establish property development standards
for SDUs, including, but not limited to, parking, height, setback, lot coverage, and architectural
design.
San Luis Obispo’s secondary dwelling units (SDU) ordinance allows the approval of an SDU
without discretionary review. SDUs must conform to applicable zoning regulations such as
height, yards, building coverage, parking, and are limited to a maximum floor area of 450 square
feet. SDUs are treated as an additional unit but are not taken into consideration when calculating
total allowed density on a site.          Rental costs for SDUs are not listed separately in local
classified ads and rental listings, however SDUs are likely to rent at prices similar to or slightly
higher than studio apartments in multi-family developments.
State law (Section 65583.1 of State housing element law) allows local governments to identify
realistic capacity for second-units in addressing a locality’s share of the regional housing need.
The identification of realistic capacity should be based on the development trends of second-
units in the previous housing element planning period and other relevant factors. The City has
not identified SDUs as a housing component in meeting its Regional Housing Needs Allocation
(RHNA). SDU construction rates in San Luis Obispo have been low (averaging about one to
two units per year between 2000 and 2013, possibly due in part to developer and tenant
preferences for larger apartments given past impact fee rate structures which treated SDUs
                                                 Page C-14

                                                                    Housing Element
                                                                                       
similar to houses or larger apartments in terms of impacts. However, the City recently updated
its impact fee rate structure and reduced SDU impact fees by approximately 60%. As a result, the
City expects that SDU construction will substantially increase during the Housing Element
Planning Period. To more fully utilize this form of infill housing, the housing element includes
several programs to encourage the development of SDUs, including:
6.29    Continue to pursue incentives to encourage development of Secondary Dwelling Units
        (SDUs). Possible incentives include SDU design templates, flexible development
        standards, fee reductions or deferrals, or other measures to encourage the construction
        of SDUs where allowed by zoning.
6.31    Consider scaling development impact fees for residential development based on size,
        number of bedrooms, and room counts.
9.12    Consider incentivizing dwelling units to a minimum size of 150 square feet, consistent
        with the California Building Code, by reduced impact fees and property development
        standards.
Manufactured and Modular Housing, Mobile Homes and Mobile Home Parks
Manufactured, modular and mobile homes offer economical alternatives to conventional, “stick-
built” housing. Manufactured homes are those built entirely in a factory under Federal building
codes administered by the U.S. Department Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
Manufactured homes are then transported to the site as single- or multi-section homes and
installed on site. On-site additions, such as garages, decks and porches, add to the attractiveness
of the homes and must be built to local building codes. Modular housing describes factory- built
homes manufactured specifically to the State, local or region al construction code requirements
wherever the home will be located. As with manufactured housing, the modular homes are
transported to their sites and installed. Mobile home is the term used for factory-built housing
produced before June 15, 1976, when the HUD construction codes took effect. Other types of
manufactured housing include panelized and pre-cut homes, in which factory-built homes are
shipped to the site in panels or as pre-cut “kits” for site assembly.
Industry advances in quality and design, as well as affordability, dramatically increased the
popularity of these housing types in the late 1990s. According to the Manufactured Housing
Institute, 22 million Americans (about eight percent of the U.S. population) lived fulltime in 10
million manufactured homes. Manufactured housing represents nearly 11 percent of housing for
families living at 150 percent of less of the poverty level. A manufactured home can cost
anywhere from one-third to one-half the cost of a conventional house. Architecturally,
manufactured homes include details and features that make the homes compatible with most
residential neighborhoods and communities.
In 2013 California Department of Finance figures show that San Luis Obispo had 1,482 mobile
homes, or about 7.2 percent of the City’s housing stock. Mobile homes, placed on permanent
foundations and located outside mobile home parks, and manufactured (modular) housing are
treated the same as conventional site-built housing under the City's zoning, subdivision and
architectural review requirements. Therefore, all residentially zoned land is available for some
                                               Page C-15

Chapter 3

type of manufactured housing. Mobile-home parks are allowed with use-permit approval in all
residential zones. The City has few areas suitable for new, large mobile-home parks or for the
expansion of existing parks. However, expansion areas could accommodate mobile home parks
and the Orcutt Area Specific Plan (OASP) encourages expansion of an adjacent mobile home
park into the higher density area of the OASP.
To help conserve mobile home parks and provide constructive notice to park owners of
requirements to convert such parks to other uses, a proposed Housing Element program will
consider establishing a new mobile home or “MH” overlay zone:
8.22         Consider addition of an overlay zone to existing mobile home and trailer park sites to
             provide constructive notice that additional requirements, such as rent stabilization
             and a mobile home park conversion ordinance apply.
In combination with any other zone, the MH overlay zone would identify State and local
regulations regarding rent control, maintenance, density, conversion to other uses and
public/tenant notice requirements.
e) Architectural Review
Architectural review is required for all residential developments, except individual built, single-
family dwellings. The exception for single-family dwellings does not apply: (1) when
architectural review is required as a condition of a subdivision, use permit or other discretionary
entitlement; (2) when a developer proposes to construct three or more homes in the same area;
(3) when the City’s Community Development Director determines the site is sensitive as set
forth in the procedures document (“sensitive sites” shall include, but not be limited to, open
space zoning areas designated by resolution of the planning commission, architectural review
commission or council); (4) where the scale or character of a proposed dwelling contrasts
significantly with adjacent or neighboring structures; and (5) where any required parking spaces
that are covered are converted to another use and replacement parking is proposed.
San Luis Obispo adopted Community Design Guidelines that describe the community’s
expectations and preferences for the quality and character of new developments. The Guidelines
encourage design variety and innovation, and are intended to preserve San Luis Obispo’s
distinctive character and sense of history. Depending upon the type and scale of the project,
architectural review can add, on the average, from two to four months of review time, including
study, public hearings and revisions. The additional holding time, from a development
standpoint, adds to development costs (interest costs, design/architectural fees, construction
delays) that are then passed through to housing buyers. For large residential projects, this cost
impact on an individual dwelling is lessened; however, on small projects, the cost can be a
significant factor in the overall purchase price of a home.
Most of the City’s neighborhoods are an eclectic mix of architectural styles and character. In
many cases, small residential infill projects of four units or less can be integrated into
neighborhoods on lots already zoned for residential use, without posing significant architectural
design or compatibility issues. The housing would need to comply with all zoning standards,
including setbacks, building height and lot coverage. By exempting more small residential
                                                 Page C-16

                                                                   Housing Element
                                                                                       
projects from architectural review, the City could help reduce development costs and improve
the economic feasibility of constructing small detached or attached dwellings. On historic
properties, or where site constraints such as creeks, steep hillsides or lot shape require special
consideration, architectural review of the “sensitive site” may be appropriate. To help reduce
development costs, Program 6.22 calls for an amendment to the Municipal Code and Community
Design Guidelines to expand the exemption for small residential projects from two or fewer units
to four or less dwellings (not on a sensitive site). Most of these developments would be eligible
for less costly and time-consuming staff level architectural review.
f) Building, Zoning and Municipal Code Enforcement
Code enforcement focuses on addressing violations of zoning, building, housing, property
maintenance and related municipal code provisions that adversely affect public health, safety, or
aesthetics in order to promote the preservation of the City’s neighborhoods and business districts.
In addition to ensuring that new development is designed and constructed in conformance with
City standards for quality and safety, the Community Development Department also ensures that
property and land uses conform to those standards over time. The Department enforces
municipal and state codes through its Code Enforcement Program. This program includes
education, mitigation and prosecution aspects, and has two components: 1) reactive code
enforcement, and 2) proactive code enforcement (neighborhood services).
The reactive or complaint-based program primarily responds to complaints from citizens. Upon
receipt of a complaint, a Code Enforcement Officer (CEO) makes a preliminary site visit to
verify the existence of a violation. If a violation exists, a Notice of Violation (NOV) is issued to
the property owner and the necessary steps are taken to resolve the problem. If compliance is not
obtained as a result of the NOV, Administrative Citations and fines may be accessed. More
complicated cases are set for abatement proceedings or, in some cases, criminal prosecution. In
2013, the reactive program was staffed by two CEO’s.
Complaints about sign violations, unpermitted construction and substandard housing conditions
accounted for the majority of reactive code enforcement cases. The illegal conversion of
garages, sheds, attics and shops to rental housing contributes to substandard housing conditions,
parking violations, and property maintenance concerns. Table C-7 summarizes reactive code
enforcement violations by type for the cases opened in 2013.

The proactive code enforcement program is primarily focused on enforcement of the City’s
property maintenance standards in residential areas of the City. It is staffed by two
Neighborhood Services Specialists who patrol the City’s neighborhoods and address property
maintenance violations in visible yard areas. Typical violations addressed by this program
include debris or furniture in yards, overgrown weeds or unmaintained landscaping, inoperable
vehicles, unscreened trash receptacles, peeling paint, and vehicle parking in front yards. Table

Noise Violations. The Office of Neighborhood Services (ONS) within the San Luis Obispo
Police Department administers the City’s Noise Regulations and residential parking districts.
The Police Department handles more than 200 noise violations calls per year. Table C-9
provides a summary of noise complaints between September 2010 and December 2013.

Through public information, community and educational programs, ONS works to improve
communications between students and other neighborhood groups, and sponsors special
neighborhood events, such as Good Neighbor Day and Neighborhood Cooperation Week. The
SNAP (Student-Neighborhood Assistance Program) and WIN (Working to Improve
Neighborhoods) Programs engage community volunteers, neighborhood groups and city staffers
in a working partnership to preserve and enhance neighborhoods.
Construction Codes
San Luis Obispo's construction codes are, with few exceptions, uniform codes enacted by the
State legislature and used throughout the State. They set forth health and safety standards for
structures, plumbing, electrical and fire prevention. The cost of meeting State construction codes
-laws intended to make new housing safer, stronger, more energy efficient and resistant to fire
and earthquake hazards - is ultimately passed on to housing consumers. In the long term, many
building standards can reduce ongoing housing costs through lower utility bills and reduced
insurance premiums.
In some cases, San Luis Obispo has adopted more stringent construction codes than mandated by
the State. Local Building Code amendments that could affect housing cost include the
following:
1. Seismic Strengthening of Unreinforced Masonry (URM) Buildings. In 2002, there were 126
    unreinforced masonry buildings identified in San Luis Obispo, many of them historic. Of
    these, 10 include dwellings. All URM buildings have undergone structural analyses as
                                                Page C-19

Chapter 3
City of San Luis Obispo Housing Element, January 2015
     required by State law. City regulations require all URM buildings to be seismically
     strengthened by 2017. As of 2013, 112 buildings are in compliance, eight are currently under
     construction and six are expected to be retrofitted as part of pending projects.
     URM strengthening involves improvements to building foundations, walls and roofs to resist
     catastrophic damage and loss of life during an earthquake. Construction permit and planning
     fees for URM retrofits are reduced, and fees spent on seismic analysis are credited toward
     architectural review, plan review or building permit fees for URM strengthening projects.
    Seismic retrofits have also created opportunities to increase housing opportunities, especially
     in the Downtown Core. For example, the retrofit of the long-vacant Wineman Hotel
     produced 48 new SRO units in the Downtown.
2. Wood shake and shingle roofing materials are prohibited, unless the material is listed as a
    Class A Assembly. Adopted by ordinance in 1983, this law is intended to reduce fire hazards
    and the potential for loss of life and property from a major fire in the City. The ordinance
    differs from State and County regulations in that they allow wood-shake roofing that meets a
    minimum Class-C rating. Since wood shingles are not widely used, additional construction
    costs, if any, would depend on the builder's choice of this roofing material.
Site Improvement Requirements
The City may require on- or off-site improvements such as streets, utilities, traffic signals and
landscaping as a condition of use permit, variance, subdivision or other land-use approval.
Dedication of right-of-way, public transit facilities, easements or access rights also may be
required. These improvements add costs that are usually passed on to the housing consumer.
This Housing Element includes policies which require the City to consider and minimize the
costs of imposing additional requirements on housing projects beyond those required by State
law, or necessary for public health, safety or welfare, and to periodically evaluate these
requirements to determine if they are necessary to protect the public's health, safety or welfare.
Americans with Disabilities Act and Housing for Disabled Persons
The Fair Housing Act of 1998 and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) are Federal laws
intended to help provide safe and accessible housing. The City is responsible for enforcing State
accessibility regulations (California Building Standards Code, Part 2, Title 24) when evaluating
new construction. Accessibility requirements of the California Building Code are similar to
Federal regulations and mandate that new developments be designed to ensure full accessibility
and use by the physically disabled. Single-family houses are exempt from these regulations.
San Luis Obispo is committed to removing architectural barriers to persons with disabilities and
implements these laws through its building and planning programs. The City actively enforces
compliance with California Disabled Access Requirements which, in most respects, require a
higher level of adaptable or accessible building design than federal standards. Since 1994, the
City has used approximately $5.5 million in Community Development Block Grants to remove
architectural barriers in City streets and facilities, and provided an additional $3 million in
CDBG funds to support the private, non-profit development of housing that is both accessible
and affordable to very-low income elderly or disabled residents. Compliance with building code
                                                 Page C-20
                                                                 Housing Element
                                                                                        
requirements may increase the cost of multi-family housing production and rehabilitation.
However, these regulations set the minimum standards that the City and developers must comply
with to ensure safety and the appropriate levels of accessibility in new developments. As
previously discussed in this appendix, the City’s Reasonable Accommodation Ordinance
provides a fair and reasonable procedure for disabled persons to request flexibility in the
application of land use and zoning regulations to ensure equal access to housing.
Under State law, housing elements must analyze the potential and actual government constraints
on the development of housing for persons with disabilities. They must also demonstrate efforts
to remove governmental constraints on the development of housing for persons with disabilities,
such as accommodating procedures for the approval of group homes. The City has analyzed its
development standards and procedures to identify possible constraints, such as policies, local
building and planning requirements. City General Plan policies and building and planning
procedures strongly encourage accessibility in new and remodeled housing. In general, City
permitting procedures do not differentiate between housing specially designed for disabled
persons and other types of housing, and City procedures encourage retrofitting existing housing
for accessibility. For example, retrofitting most single-family dwellings with basic accessibility
improvements, such as access ramps, path-of-travel widening, kitchen, and bathroom
modifications can be done with approval of an expedited “over the counter” building permit.
This reduces the time and cost involved in retrofitting for accessibility, since plan check routing
and fees are waived. No planning approvals are required.
More extensive retrofits to bring multi-family dwellings into compliance with the Americans
with Disabilities Act typically would require only a building permit. Minor modifications may
be approved “over the counter” by the City’s permit coordinator. Significant exterior changes to
multi-family housing or to a historically designated property to provide accessibility, such as
new exterior ramps or building façade changes, typically require architectural review and can
add about four to six weeks to the approval process.
City zoning and development standards include provisions that add flexibility and incentives for
housing for persons with disabilities and seniors. For example, handicapped access ramps up to
30 inches in height may be located by right anywhere within required building setback areas, and
housing occupied by persons aged 62 or older may provide one-half parking space per dwelling
unit or one space per four occupants in group quarters. Both provisions can substantially reduce
the cost and difficulty of providing housing for persons living with disabilities.
Several group housing developments in San Luis Obispo provide accessible housing for very-
low and low income persons with disabilities. City zoning regulations allow residential care
facilities by right in all residential zones, and in four commercial zones with a conditional use
permit. These are single or multi-unit dwellings that are licensed or supervised by any Federal,
State, or local health/welfare agency that provides non-medical, life supportive services in a
family-like environment. Residential care facilities in San Luis Obispo are not subject to
residential density limits, and are treated like single-family homes in setting their parking
requirements. Initial construction requires a building permit and must comply with the usual
development standards such as building setbacks, height, lot coverage, and require architectural
review.
                                               Page C-21

Chapter 3
City of San Luis Obispo Housing Element, January 2015
Single dwellings occupied by up to five adults, and which are not specially licensed or
supervised, are also used as group homes for low-income or disabled person. These group
homes are allowed by right in any residential zone and treated as single-family housing for
purposes of residential density and parking. These uses must comply with all building and
planning codes, but are routine and typically do not require City approval other than approval of
a building permit.
Housing Element Policy 8.1 encourages housing development which meets special needs,
including disabled and elderly persons. Policy 8.11 encourages amendments to regulations that
support the special housing needs of the disabled. Policy 8.10 promotes universally accessible
housing and housing that allows “aging in place.” Program 8.23 has been added to seek grant
opportunities for housing construction and rehabilitation specifically targeted for persons with
developmental disabilities.
Non-conforming Uses and Structures
Some dwellings are subject to premature deterioration and demolition because of their legal,
non-conforming status. A legal, non-conforming use or structure is one that was established with
permits, but is no longer allowed and could not be replaced under the current zoning regulations.
Examples include housing as a principal use in the Manufacturing zone. Traditionally, lenders
and insurance carriers avoid lending or insuring project improvements for such non-conforming
dwellings.
An estimated 150 dwellings are considered non-conforming because of their location in the
Manufacturing or Service-Commercial zones. Housing Element programs address this issue by
encouraging the conservation of non-conforming housing, and through programs that enable
low-income homeowners to rehabilitate substandard housing through low-interest loans or
grants.
g) Processing and Permit Procedures
The development review process adds time and costs to a building project. The City's
development review procedures are designed to protect public health and safety, to simplify and
expedite the review process whenever possible, and to ensure that new development meets State
and local development standards within time limits set by State law. The Permit Streamlining
Act requires final City action within 60 days of adopting a negative declaration or categorical
exemption for a project, and within 180 days of the date a final Environmental Impact Report
(EIR) is certified for a project.
For most minor or relatively simple items which are exempt from environmental review, such as
administrative use permits, minor or incidental architectural review, minor subdivisions, and lot
line adjustments, the processing time from submittal to final action lasts approximately four to
six weeks. More complex planning items requiring initial environmental studies such as
architectural review of new commercial, industrial and residential projects, conditional use
permits and variances (Planning Commission), planned development/rezoning or standard
subdivisions typically require eight to 12 weeks.
The City's most complex planning items include general plan amendments, rezoning,
                                                 Page C-22

                                                                  Housing Element
                                                                                       
annexations and zoning regulations text amendments. Any development project that requires an
EIR can take six months or longer from the date an application is filed to final City action.
Development review procedures, such as public notices, hearings and environmental reviews, are
mandated by State law and also add to the time needed for the approval of new housing projects.
Since 1994 the City has revised its zoning and subdivision requirements to simplify and speed up
development approvals. For housing developers, time is money. Efforts to reduce the time
required to process development applications can result in lower costs to the housing consumer.
Examples of permit streamlining actions the City has taken include:
      Development exceptions typically follow an administrative use permit process taking two
       to three weeks, rather than the more time-consuming variance process.
      Clear development standards, guidelines and checklists available conveniently on-line.
      House relocation no longer requires a conditional use permit.
      Demolition or relocation of most buildings 50 years or older, but not historically listed, no
       longer requires Cultural Heritage Committee historic significance review.
      Minor housing additions, remodels and seismic retrofits may be approved by City staff as
       “minor or incidental” architectural review.
      Residential developments of up to four dwellings are exempted from architectural review.
      When architectural review is required, the Architectural Review Commission may grant
       exceptions to development standards along with architectural approvals.
      The City’s Housing Programs Manager assists housing developers with development
       review applications, processing and where possible, project funding.
Individually-built single family dwellings are allowed by right in all residential zones and in
Agriculture and Conservation/Open Space zones. These need only building permit approval
prior to construction – typically an eight to twelve week approval process for such projects.
They are also allowed in certain commercial zones with approval of a conditional use permit. To
encourage small residential projects and infill development, Program 6.22 exempts the
construction, relocation, rehabilitation or remodeling of up to four dwellings of 1,200 square feet
floor area from Architectural Review Commission review. Such housing may be allowed with
“minor or incidental” architectural review, a less costly and expedited review process taking
about four to six weeks for approval. Residential developments of five or more units typically
require more extensive planning review, including environmental review, architectural review,
and subdivision or land use review.
Single-family residential developments of more than four units are allowed by right in all
residential zones, subject to City development standards, state and local subdivision standards
and compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act. The R-1 zone allows multi-
family housing on larger sites at a maximum allowed density of seven density units per net acre
(net acre excludes dedicated right-of-way, areas within top of creek banks, endangered species
habitat, and areas within drip lines of “heritage trees.”). R-1 zones are typically developed with
market rate housing affordable to moderate- and above-moderate income households.
Small residential developments such as duplexes, triplexes or fourplexes are allowed by right in
the R-2, R-3 and R-4 zones. Larger residential development projects, such as standard
residential subdivisions and condominium developments typically require three levels of review:
design review by the Architectural Review Commission, tentative tract (or parcel) map review
                                              Page C-23

Chapter 3
City of San Luis Obispo Housing Element, January 2015
by the Planning Commission, and environmental study/tentative/Final map approval by the City
Council. Average permit processing time for a 100-lot residential subdivision is about six
months to one year for planning approvals, plus six months for building plan check and permit
issuance. Smaller residential developments can complete planning review and permit processing
in one year or less if an environmental impact study is not required.
Processing and permit procedures for multi-family residential projects are similar to those for
single-family developments of more than four units (such as standard residential subdivisions
and planned developments with detached, single-family houses or condominiums). Multi-family
residential developments are allowed by right in the R-2, R-3, and R-4 zones, and are
conditionally allowed in office, neighborhood-commercial and retail commercial zones.
Apartments and condominiums also allowed in Commercial-Service and Manufacturing zones as
part of live-work or work-live developments. In historic districts or on historically-designated
properties, Cultural Heritage Committee is also required. As with single-family residential
development, development review typically involves a single application combining all approval
requests, such as environmental review, architectural approval and (if required) subdivision and
use permit approvals. Average permit processing time for a multi-family residential
development project is about six to eight months for planning approvals, plus six months for
building plan check and permit issuance.
Live-work and work-live development projects allow dwellings to be combined with commercial
and industrial structures, primarily to accommodate employees or owners of such businesses.
Live/work units are allowed by right and intended to function predominantly as living space with
incidental accommodations for work-related activities. Work/live units require approval of a
conditional use permit and are intended to function predominantly as work space with incidental
residential facilities that meet basic habitability requirements. Zoning regulations establish
standards for live/work and work/live developments addressing: prohibited uses (e.g. adult
businesses, vehicle maintenance and repair, storage of hazardous materials or flammable
liquids), floor area requirements, access, parking and use operating requirements (i.e. occupancy
and non-resident employees). Residential density of up to 24 density units (equivalent to 24 two-
bedroom dwellings per acre) is allowed. This is based on total site area and not just on the
vacant portion of the site not utilized by commercial or industrial uses.
Such uses require environmental and architectural review (if exterior changes are involved).
Conditional use permit approval requires Community Development Director’s approval, a
simpler, less expensive and usually quicker review process than planning commission use permit
review. A conditional use permit may also be required for live/work unit if exceptions to City
development standards are necessary.
Mixed-Use developments are allowed by right in six commercial zones, and are conditionally
allowed in the Service-Commercial and Manufacturing zones. Their processing and permit
procedures are similar to multi-family housing developments.

                                                                 Housing Element
                                                                                       
Time Extensions
Securing planning approvals and construction permits involves significant time and expense by a
developer as well as the permitting agency. Expiration of approvals or permits can substantially
increase project costs by requiring repayment of fees, additional review time and uncertainty,
and in some cases, project redesign. Normally, planning approvals expire in one year after the
date of approval. Construction permit applications and permits also expire in one year after
submittal or approval, respectively. In light of the challenging economic environment for
development, the City allows multiple time extensions for economic hardship. Such extensions
are handled administratively, with no limit on the number of building permit extensions provided
that project site conditions have not changed and there are no public health or safety concerns
posed by a time extension.
h)    Development Fees
Application and permit fees
Local governments levy fees and assessments to cover the cost of processing development
applications and permits, and to cover the cost of services. These fees help ensure high-quality
housing development and the provision of adequate public facilities and services. Development
costs, including application and permit fees, are typically passed through to the consumer in the
form of higher rents or sales prices for new housing where possible within prevailing rent and
sales prices. Consequently, City fees can increase development costs and affect housing
affordability. One method of evaluating whether San Luis Obispo’s fees are excessive or pose
barriers to housing development is to compare its fees to those in other nearby jurisdictions.
In 2013 the City surveyed development fees for the County’s seven cities, and for San Luis
Obispo County. The City also compared fees that the various jurisdictions would charge for a
new 2,000-square-foot house with a 500- square-foot garage. The survey showed that for some
development fees, San Luis Obispo is generally higher than the other county jurisdictions.
Development fees are summarized in Table C-10, and comparative development fees for a
detached house are shown in Figure C-3. The City also evaluated development fee costs for
typical, multi-family housing development in San Luis Obispo and compared those costs to total
development costs.
Development fees include planning application fees, building plan check and permit fees, Fire
Department and Public Works Department plan check and inspection fees and impact fees. For a
typical 2,000-square foot single family home with a 500-square-foot garage and a construction
value of $245,960; development fees in San Luis Obispo in April 2014 totaled $36,220, or about
15 percent of construction value. By comparison, development fees for the same hypothetical
development in the County of San Luis Obispo were $12,470.
For a 43-unit multi-family residential project on a 1.53 acre site in San Luis Obispo,
development fees in San Luis Obispo in March 2014 totaled $23,162 per unit on a total value of
$107,596.36 per unit; or about 21.5 percent of construction value. By comparison, development
fees for a typical multi-family development in the County of San Luis Obispo in 2014 were
                                             Page C-25

 Chapter 3
 City of San Luis Obispo Housing Element, January 2015
 $29,219.29 per dwelling based on a per unit construction value of $97,980.91; or approximately
 30 percent of construction value (County of San Luis Obispo Planning Department, January
 2014).
 In most cases, City development fees assume full cost recovery for actual costs to deliver the
 planning, building and engineering services. Development review fees are updated annually,
 based on changes in the Consumer Price Index, or periodically through a detailed cost of services
 study. City policies exempt extremely low, very low- and low-income housing from most
 development review fees. Housing Element Programs 2.8 and 2.9 call for the City to seek
 additional funding sources to help offset development-related City fees for residential projects
 that include affordability guarantees for extremely-low, very-low, low- and moderate income
 households.
 Program 2.7 seeks to reduce or moderate the effect permit fees and processing times have on
 housing projects by: adopting permit streamlining procedures to give project review, public
 hearing and plan check priority to projects that include affordable dwellings.

Development Impact Fees
Like many California cities, San Luis Obispo charges impact fees to recover the cost of services
and facilities serving new development. San Luis Obispo policies state that existing residents
should not bear the costs of new development. Impact fees ensure that development projects pay
their fair share of the cost of constructing the water and sewer facilities, streets and other
improvements necessary to serve new residents. Impact fees are based solely on the capital costs
attributable to new development. In 2013 the residential water, wastewater, and transportation
impact fees for both single- and multi-family development are shown in Table C-11.

i)    Infrastructure
The City is committed to living within its resources, while planning to meet the resource needs
of its citizens. Residential development requires that adequate roads, drainage, water, sewer, fire
protection and other public services are available. Generally, the developer provides facilities
within or next to the development site, while the City is responsible for the facilities that serve a
larger area. For example, the City provides arterial streets, a wastewater reclamation facility and
sewer lift stations, and water supplies, a water treatment plant and major water distribution
facilities. When an area is subdivided, the subdivider installs local roads and utility lines.
Historically, the costs of extending municipal services to support new development were offset
by utility customers and taxpayers. Like many cities, San Luis Obispo requires developers to
pay for the increased capacity of citywide facilities needed to serve development.
                                                   Page C-28
                                                                   Housing Element
                                                                                       
Most sites within the City have streets and utility lines nearby, so they can be developed without
significant extensions. However, expansion areas at the edge of the City will need service
extensions. A specific plan is required for each major expansion area, and a development plan
for each minor expansion area. These plans will address phasing of development and services.
Water Available for Development
Per Water and Wastewater Management Element (WWME) Policy A 2.2.1, the City utilizes
multiple water resources to meet its water supply needs. Having several sources of water avoids
dependence on any one source that may not be available during a drought or other water supply
reduction or emergency. The City has five water sources, achieving the goal of diversifying its
water supply portfolio to meet current and future community needs.
Water Supply Sources
Salinas & Whale Rock Reservoirs
Salinas and Whale Rock Reservoirs have served as the City’s primary water supplies for over 50
years. The County of San Luis Obispo Flood Control and Water Conservation District (County)
provides the oversight, operations, and maintenance of the Salinas Dam and water delivery
facilities for the benefit of the City. The City pays the County for the associated costs for these
services.
The City provides the oversight, operations, and maintenance of the Whale Rock Reservoir for
the benefit of the Whale Rock Commission. The Whale Rock Commission is a joint powers
agency made up of Cal Poly State University, California Men’s Colony, and the City. The City
draws water from these two reservoirs in a coordinated manner to maximize the long-term water
supply available from these two sources. The safe annual yield of the two reservoirs is 6,940 acre
feet. In addition, the City has adopted policies in the WWME to account for reductions in storage
capacity at each lake resulting from siltation.
Nacimiento Reservoir
Water deliveries from the Nacimiento Reservoir began on January 5, 2011. The City has a
contractual right to 3,380 acre feet per year. The County operates and maintains the project that
delivers water from Nacimiento Reservoir to participating agencies. The Nacimiento Project
Commission, which is made up of representatives from each of the four agencies’ governing
boards and County Representative (i.e. County Board of Supervisors), provides oversight to
project operations, maintenance, and the project budget.
Recycled Water
Recycled water use for calendar year 2012 totaled approximately 165 acre feet, up four percent
from 158 acre feet in 2011.
Groundwater
The City used one domestic well in 2012 (Pacific Beach #1 located on Los Osos Valley Road
near Pacific Beach school) to supplement its other potable water supply sources. In addition, the
City maintains a non-potable well at the City’s Corporation Yard for construction activity use
and two non-potable wells at the City’s Laguna Lake Golf Course for a portion of the golf

course irrigation (additional golf course irrigation demand is met with recycled water). Per
WWME Policy A 3.2.3, the City will continue to use groundwater for domestic purposes when
available, but will not consider this source of supply as a part of its water resources availability
due to limitations for the use of groundwater resources.
Water Resource Availability
Table C-12 summarizes the Water Resource Availability (based on WWME Section 3), to serve
community water demand. Calendar Year 2013 water availability totaled 9,985 Acre-Feet.

After comparing Table C-13’s water supply with Table C-14’s water usage, it is evident that City
resident’s water usage has slowly decreased over the past 13 years even with a consistent
increase in population. Per capita water use in 2013 was at an all-time low of 105 acre feet per
year, down from 130 acre feet per person in 2007. Residents are currently using just over half of
the City’s water availability however recent drought conditions may begin to reduce availability
in the future. The City’s 2013 Water Resources Status Report states that the City has
approximately eight years of water supply until reservoir levels are drawn down to minimum
pool, assuming the onset of an extended drought. With its multi‐source water policy, the City
has implemented a long‐term strategy which will ensure a reliable supply of water to meet the
current and future needs of the community.
Wastewater Treatment (Sewer)
The City's current wastewater treatment facility has a design capacity of 5.1 million gallons per
day (mgd). According to the City’s Utility Department, this is adequate capacity to meet current
needs, plus residential growth anticipated during the planning period.
j) Public Services
Police and Fire
In 2013, the Police Department responded to identified community needs under several Major
City Goals including, Neighborhood Wellness, Assess and Renew the Downtown and
Homelessness. As a result the police department has reassigned personnel in innovative ways to
enhance connectivity with the community. The department has initiated a Park Officer Program
that has transitioned into a Neighborhood Officer Program. Selected officers proactively work
within their assigned neighborhood as community liaisons to address concerns and mutually
share in the problem solving process. Additionally, personnel have been directed to work as a
Community Action Team (CAT) and Daytime Downtown Officers whose specific function is to
address adverse behaviors through law enforcement and cooperative outreach with mental health,
social services and other involved stakeholders.
k) Schools
Grade school enrollment in San Luis Obispo has declined in recent years. San Luis Coastal
Unified School District's enrollment in San Luis Obispo schools in September 2009 was 4,271
students. In March 2014, enrollment dropped by 424 students to 3,847 students. According to
District studies, new residential development generates 0.65 school children per dwelling. The
District estimates that one or possibly two additional school sites will be needed to serve planned
residential growth in the southern part of the City. The Orcutt Area Specific Plan is expected to
include a potential elementary school site. Due to district budget constraints, new dwellings will
have serious adverse consequences for school staffing, facilities and programs unless new
development adequately mitigates the adverse impact on school facilities. Mitigation is
generally in the form of school fees associated with issuance of construction permits. School
district fees are collected by the City and used by the District to fund school infrastructure needs.

l) Inclusionary Housing Program
Adopted in 1999 and amended in 2004, the Inclusionary Housing Program implements two core
housing programs of the General Plan – that of providing affordable housing for extremely-low,
very-low, low and moderate income households, and establishing a housing trust fund. The
program requires that most new development projects help meet affordable housing needs by: 1)
building affordable dwellings as part of a development project, 2) dedicating real property,
improved or not, for development of affordable housing by the City’s Housing Authority or by a
non-profit housing provider, 3) paying an in-lieu fee which is used to fund affordable housing
throughout the City, or 4) Use a combination of the above methods, to the approval of the City
Council.
To qualify as affordable, dwellings must have guarantees that they remain affordable for at least 30
years. Since adoption, the Program has generated over 250 enforceably-restricted affordable
dwellings, and approximately $8 Million in affordable housing funds.
The Inclusionary Housing Program is one of several tools, including incentives (e.g. parking
reductions, density bonuses, flexible development standards and affordable housing fund) that
the City uses to achieve its affordable housing objectives. The program applies to most new
development, including residential and commercial development. Some types of development
are exempt from the requirement: 1) residential developments of four dwelling units or less; 2)
new commercial developments of less than 2,500 square feet gross floor area; 3) residential and
commercial additions, repairs or remodels, so long as such work does not increase the number of
dwellings by more than four units or increase gross floor area by 2,500 or more; 4) the conversion
of less than five dwelling units to condominiums within a five-year period; 5) commercial
condominium conversions which do not result in the creation of new dwellings; 6) affordable
housing projects; 7) emergency projects; or projects which the City Council determines are
necessary to protect public health and safety 8) projects which provide educational, social or related
community services and proposed by public or non-profit agencies, foundations or similar
organizations; 9) projects which replace or restore a structure damaged or destroyed by fire, flood,
earthquake or natural disaster; and 10) projects for which an approved, unexpired tentative map or
vesting tentative map exists.
There are two different approaches to maintaining affordability over time: 1) the property owner
agrees to maintain the designated dwelling unit(s) as affordable for at least 30 years; or for
purchased units only, 2) the property participates in the “shared equity purchase program.” Under
the equity sharing program, the buyer of an affordable unit enters into an agreement with the City
which upon resale of the property, eventually returns a share of the property’s built-up equity to the
City for use in other citywide affordable housing developments. The shared equity agreement is
secured by a second trust deed recorded on the property at time of sale.
The program was evaluated for its potential impact on the cost and supply of housing. The 2004
Mundie Report evaluated the impact of affordable housing requirements on land value, developer
profit, and the sales prices of market-priced housing units based on a series of cash flow simulations
for alternative development projects. The study found that: 1) generally, the City’s proposed
housing affordability requirements would not discourage new housing development. In some cases,
affordability requirements would result in reductions in land value, however land value would not
                                                 Page C-32

                                                                     Housing Element
                                                                                           
be the factor that determines development feasibility, 2) the indicator of impact most affected by the
affordable housing requirements – both within the existing City and in the expansion areas – is land
value (if it absorbs the entire impact of the requirements); rents and housing prices are affected least.
It is reasonable to expect that if a potential developer cannot negotiate land prices down to level that
would pass all of the impact of the requirements through to the pre-development landowner, he or
she would attempt to pass on part of the impact to project occupants in the form of higher rents/sales
prices, and 3) impacts on the feasibility of new development are most severe in mixed-use
retail/office project located downtown. It is possible that the effects of the applicable requirements
on land values would discourage a landowner from making the project site available for
development: it is likely that a developer would consider the profits to be expected from such a
project to be unreasonably low if none of the impact can be passed on to either the landowner or the
tenants (in the form of higher rents).
To assist housing development and partially offset the effects of the inclusionary housing
requirements and other development exactions, the City has used flexible development standards,
streamlined review and permit processing, and affordable housing funds to reduce development
costs and improve economic feasibility. For example, the City assisted the 49-unit Wineman Hotel
rehabilitation with $1.5 Million in affordable housing funds and provided streamlined review and
permit processing. The renovated, 3-story, former hotel now contains 48 single room occupancy
rental units (plus one manager’s unit), of which 27 units are permanently affordable to low-income
persons and three units are permanently affordable to very-low income persons.
2. Non-Governmental Constraints
a) Land Costs
Land is the largest component in the cost of new housing, accounting for over 60 percent of
development costs. Because land costs are so high, it is difficult to build affordable housing if
the project involves purchasing land at today's prices. Land costs directly affect the cost of
housing. In turn, land values are determined by a number of factors. In terms of residential
constraints, the most important of these is land availability and permitted residential density. As
land becomes scarcer, its price increases. Other factors being equal, the more residential units
allowed, the higher the land value.
In 2014 the cost of an undeveloped, average-size, single-family residential lot in San Luis
Obispo was estimated by members of the Board of Realtors’ multiple listing service to be
between $200,000 and $450,000, depending on its size and location. By contrast, in 2009 the
cost of a typical single-family residential lot in San Luis Obispo ranged from $250,000 to
$375,000. The average sales price per square foot for a vacant, single-family (R-1 zone) lot in
San Luis Obispo in 2014 is $32, and ranges between $19 and $54 per square foot. In 2009 the
cost for undeveloped land suitable for housing ranged from $15 to $52 per square foot.
Buoyed by record-low interest rates, the demand for residential real estate has continued to be
very strong since 2000, despite a slowdown in other city and county economic sectors. Land
suitable for residential development within City limits and in expansion areas adjacent to the
City is typically priced to reflect its “highest and best use.”

b) Construction Costs
Technological advances in home building have increased efficiency and reduced the proportional
costs of labor and materials. Nationally, labor and materials accounted for 69 percent of the cost
of a new home in 1949. By 1989, that percentage had dropped to 53 percent (National
Association of Home Builders).
According to the City's building official, the construction value of an average Type V - wood
frame residential construction in 2013 is $123 per square foot for living space and $34 per square
foot for garage. For a typical, 1,500 square foot detached house with a garage on a standard-
sized lot in San Luis Obispo, total development cost in 2013 would be approximately $210,000
for construction only. When incorporating the average price of land at $300,000, construction
costs, and city fees – the approximate cost for a new single family home is $550,000. Estimated
land cost accounts for 62 percent of the total cost, construction about 31 percent, and City fees
around seven percent of the total development cost.
c) Availability and Cost of Financing
Mortgage interest rates significantly affect housing affordability. As interest rates increase,
fewer buyers can afford to purchase a home. As rates decrease, the number of potential
homebuyers increases. According to Wells Fargo, seen in Table C-14, interest rates for a
conventional, 30-year fixed loan range are as low as 4.250 percent and 15-year and adjustable
rate mortgages are around 3.500 percent.
                                               Table C-14

   15-Year Fixed                                  3.500%                      3.647%
   5-Year Fixed                                   3.250%                      3,968%
 Source: Wells Fargo, July 2014
A wide variety of loan packages and terms are available, making financing accessible for most
home buyers with good credit and moderate- to above-moderate incomes. Although low interest
rates in 2014 have made housing more affordable than in recent years, the necessary down
payment still can pose an insurmountable obstacle, particularly to first-time homebuyers.
Lenders typically prefer a 20-percent down payment on a mortgage loan. Prospective buyers,
who might be able to support an 80-percent loan, often do not have the financial resources to
make the required down payment. A median-priced home in San Luis Obispo costs $540,000,
requiring a $108,000 down payment to get into a new house. Lenders will sometimes loan up to
90 percent of the asking price, but an applicant's credit is much more closely scrutinized, and
monthly payments and monthly income requirements are significantly higher. Consequently,
financing can pose a major obstacle for first-time or moderate income homebuyers, even for
those who might otherwise qualify for a conventional loan.
                                                 Page C-34

                                                                   Housing Element
                                                                                         
Interest rates are determined by national economic policies and conditions, and there is little that
local governments can do to affect interest rates. Cities may, however, offer interest-rate buy-
downs, gap financing or other programs to expand home ownership opportunities for low- and
moderate income and first-time homebuyers.
d) Insurance Costs
Insurance costs have become an important constraint to building affordable housing.
Construction liability insurance, needed by builders and required by lenders, has become difficult
to obtain in California and when available, is extremely expensive. According to the Home
Builders Association of the Central Coast, liability insurance costs can equal about two percent
of a unit’s selling price, or $6,000 for a $300,000 condominium. In part, insurance cost
increases resulted from unprecedented construction defect litigation, particularly in California, in
the 1990s. Most of that litigation focused on residential condominiums.               Condominium
construction, a major type of new housing in San Luis Obispo in the 1980s, is one of the most
effective approaches for providing higher-density, ownership housing for moderate income
buyers. Condominium construction fell dramatically in the 1990s. According to local builders,
this was due in part to construction defect litigation and to high insurance costs. In 2002 Senate
Bill 800 (Burton) was signed into law, clarifying the grounds for construction defect lawsuits and
limiting builder liability for such actions. In 2014 there appears to be renewed builder and
consumer interest in residential condos, and city housing policies promote this housing type.
f) Investment expectations
Investment expectations also can add to the cost of housing. Nationally, Americans place a high
value on home ownership because it provides a hedge against inflation and allows us to build
substantial equity in a relatively short period of time. Ironically, the favorable tax treatment
established to protect home ownership has helped push the cost of housing beyond its value as
shelter alone, and has created a competitive market for real estate as a commodity or financial
investment. Home ownership has become an elusive goal for many first-time buyers, as prices
increased in response to market expectations. Renters find themselves paying a larger and larger
share of their income for housing, as rental properties are resold to a succession of landlords.
Many home owners and owners of rental property benefit from significant tax advantages. In
2014 mortgage interest on loans for both a principal home and a second home is usually
deductible for taxpayers, and interest on home equity loans also is usually deductible. In
addition, homeowners can defer capital gains resulting from the sale of a house so long as
another home is purchased at the same or higher cost, and may avoid paying taxes on capital
gains from the sale of a home after the age of 55. Owners of rental property can deduct expenses
such as property taxes, mortgage interest payments and maintenance costs. Also, since rental
property theoretically depreciates in value over time, owners can deduct part of a property's
value each year from their taxable income. While depreciation allowances provide an investment
benefit for each successive property owner, they also offer a strong incentive to resell a property
once the largest share of depreciation has been taken. The new, higher sales price is then offset
by increased rents. Sales commissions, typically ranging from four to six percent of the sales
price, also affect housing costs.

City of San Luis Obispo Housing Element, January 2015
g) Environmental Constraints
Environmental constraints can reduce the number of dwellings that can be developed on a given
site. Slope, natural and manmade hazards, creeks and other natural features reduce the
developable area of a site and often require special site grading, building or landscape design to
mitigate impacts of development. Given its valley setting, ringed by hills and interspersed with
five ancient volcanic peaks (“morros”) and numerous perennial creeks, San Luis Obispo must
balance environmental preservation with orderly, well-designed development. Measures to
protect the environment are integrated with development standards. For example, a site’s
residential development capacity is based on: 1) the size of the property, 2) zoning, 3) average
slope, and 4) existence of natural features, such as creeks or significant native trees. The Creek
Setback Ordinance limits development near creeks to reduce potential impacts to riparian
habitats. The required setback in most areas is limited to 20 feet from the creek bank, and this
limitation reduces development capacity on sites bordering a creek.
In evaluating the City’s residential development capacity, staff analyzed the general
environmental constraints affecting development for each property. Properties with significant
environmental constraints, such as steeply sloping sites, or sites located on prime agricultural
soils were either excluded from the inventory or were assigned much lower development
capacities based on environmental constraints. Consequently, Appendix D reflects the “realistic”
or reasonably achievable development capacity of sites based on natural and manmade
environmental constraints, rather than on their maximum residential capacity under zoning laws.
Further discussion of this analysis can be found in the Housing Element Update’s Initial
Environmental Study (ER 15-14).
Besides natural environmental constraints, manmade constraints may also limit the development
capacity of residential land resources. For example, the number of dwellings that can be built
may be limited by San Luis Obispo County Airport compatibility, City general plan noise limits,
or for properties located within a 100-year flood hazard zone. The extent to which these factors
affect development varies by location and the City’s residential capacity estimates take these
factors into account. For example, the San Luis Obispo County Airport Land Use Plan (ALUP)
limits residential density within approach and take-off corridors and other areas subject to low-
flying aircraft. Portions of the Margarita and Orcutt Specific Plan areas, two of the City’s largest
residential growth areas, are within airport safety areas; however the County Airport Land Use
Commission has approved the layout and number of dwellings planned in each specific plan
area. These areas’ specific plans include provisions that address airport safety and compatibility
and ensure that future development is consistent with the Airport Land Use Plan.
Most of the land affected by airport safety areas zones consists of service and manufacturing
land uses and do not affect the City’s ability to meet its quantified housing objectives. Within the
Downtown core, the majority of the residential development is mixed-use in nature, therefore the
residential component is above existing commercial structures and therefore, not precluded by
the flood zone that affects Downtown’s location outside of the flood zone.
The Housing Element update’s potential environmental effects have been fully evaluated and
documented in the Initial Environmental Study (File #15-14). Based on that evaluation, the
updated Element’s policies, programs and anticipated housing growth are not anticipated to have

Population changes are shown in Table C-15. As with housing construction, population growth
rates tend to correspond to regional and national economic cycles, and show an average annual

h) Economic Constraints
Unlike in 2009, the outlook of the future economy for the City of San Luis Obispo is improving.
As the economy recovers throughout the nation, housing development, unemployment,
properties values and foreclosure rate are moving in the right direction. Countywide, since
hitting the bottom in the third quarter of 2011, existing single-family home prices have risen
approximately 43% in first quarter of 2014. Home sales and construction has also steadily
increased (as the number of new applications for residential building permits increased from 185
applications in 2009 to 259 applications in 2013) while unemployment and foreclosure rates
have fallen.
Despite home price increases, San Luis Obispo County’s rate is still behind compared to
neighboring Counties such as Santa Barbara and Monterey. Nonetheless, the rate of increase is
still greater than many other counties in the state. The City’s home foreclosure rate has been
decreasing compared with more urbanized areas of California. Countywide, notices of default
have declined from their peak in mid-2009. The reason for this is because the economy of the
County is improving, more residents are returning to work and loan modifications are helping
some homeowners keep up with their mortgage payment. As the economy continues to grow in
the coming year, it is expected that home prices and sales will also increase.

Appendix D
Residential Land Resources
To adequately meet housing needs, it is essential to understand and quantify the City’s
residential land resources. In 2013, the Community Development Department conducted a
parcel-by-parcel inventory of vacant and underutilized land in two geographic areas: 1) within
City limits, and 2) outside City limits but within the Urban Reserve. The inventory also
identified properties that contained “blighted” or dilapidated dwellings to the extent this was
apparent from public streets. Survey information was derived from aerial photography, City
permit records, and field visits. The residential capacity inventory is included as Appendix K.
The following summary is derived from that inventory.
This appendix, along with Appendix K, addresses the requirements of Government Code
Sections 65583 and 65583.2 requiring a parcel-specific inventory of appropriately zoned,
available, and suitable sites that can provide realistic opportunities for the provision of housing
to all income levels within the community. The City’s share of the regional housing need will be
met through the implementation of a variety of strategies (e.g., available and appropriately zoned
land, units built since the beginning of baseline Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA)
period, and mixed use infill development). Pursuant to AB 375, the City’s residential growth
strategy promotes a balanced approach of residential infill and expansion area development to
meet its housing needs and achieve a compact, sustainable community. The adequate sites
requirement is addressed through the identification of available vacant and non-vacant sites that
are suitable and appropriately zoned.
1. Residential Development Capacity Calculation
In estimating residential development capacity, the City evaluated each parcel based on land
area, average slope, zoning, existing conditions and potential for redevelopment. Parcels in all
zones were evaluated, including residential and non-residential zones. Parcels with residential
capacity are listed by assessor’s parcel number in Appendix K.
Estimated residential capacity does not represent the maximum capacity possible. Instead,
estimates have been adjusted to take into account "realistic capacity" due to development
standards, lot and building patterns, availability of urban services and access, and recent
development trends based on typical residential developments in San Luis Obispo.
Development capacity was determined by taking the maximum allowed density in units per
acre and multiplying by the developable lot area to find the maximum capacity based on
zoning regulations. A conservative estimate of 75 percent of the maximum residential
capacity was then applied to all properties within the survey, with the recognition that most
properties do not develop to their maximum build out potential due to parking and setback
requirements, access, and landscaping requirements.
                                              Page D-1

Chapter 3
City of San Luis Obispo Housing Element, January 2015
If a property was underutilized, but not blighted, the percentage of the property that was
developed was subtracted from the developable lot area and the remainder (anything not
developed) was multiplied by 75 percent to determine capacity. Blighted properties were
considered to have development potential and likely to be redeveloped to their existing
capacity only if the buildings had significant structural issues (damaged, sagging, or failed
roof, wall, foundation, or porches). In these cases, the properties were not assigned additional
development capacity, but were flagged as properties with the potential for redevelopment or
rehabilitation. Where site features, such as lot orientation, natural features or the presence of
historic buildings warranted a further reduction from the standard 75 percent capacity
reduction, an adjustment factor was applied on a case-by-case basis.
2. Availability of Adequate Sites for Housing
The City’s evaluation of adequate sites began with a listing of individual parcels by zone and
general plan designation. The sites suitability analysis identifies those sites that are currently
available and unconstrained so as to provide realistic housing development opportunities prior
to June 30, 2019 (the end of planning period). To demonstrate the realistic development
viability of the sites, the analysis also addressed conditions which may constrain
development, such as: (1) whether appropriate zoning is in place, (2) the effect of
development standards and their impact on projected development capacity and affordability,
(3) existing constraints including any known environmental issues, and (4) availability and/or
timing of utilities and public infrastructure and services.
The residential land inventory was developed with the use of a combination of resources
including the City’s GIS database, updated Assessor’s data, field surveys, and review of the
City’s Land Use Element and Zoning Ordinance. The compilation resulted in not only an
identification of sites, but also an estimate of potential residential development capacity for
these sites. The majority of the land available for residential development is located in: (1)
older residential neighborhood and certain commercial zones that allow higher residential
densities, including the Downtown area, and (2) expansion areas which have been approved
for development.
The inventory includes both small and large residentially and non-residentially zoned parcels
and parcels that are vacant or underutilized and could be developed with additional dwellings.
Parcels zoned to allow higher residential densities, namely R-3, R-4, C-D, C-R and C-S, can
be developed at densities of at least 20 dwellings per acre and therefore, suitable for the
development of housing affordable to lower income households.
Except for some parcels in the Margarita and Orcutt Specific Plan areas and minor annexation
areas, all parcels with residential capacity are already served by streets, all utilities and public
services including police, fire, emergency medical services and public schools.
Figure D-1 summarizes in-city development potential by zone, outside city development
potential, as well as properties which are not yet zoned, as of June 2014. According to the
estimates for vacant and underutilized properties, there is a total development capacity within
City limits of 3,477 density units (DUs), equivalent to 3,477 two-bedroom dwellings. The actual
number of dwellings possible depends on the number of bedrooms built per dwelling.

Opportunities for housing development include:
    a. Vacant land zoned for residential use;
    b. Underutilized parcels zoned for residential use where lot coverage and density are less
        than that allowed by the Zoning Regulations and where infrastructure needs for additional
        development can be met;
    c. Vacant or underutilized land suitable for mixed-use residential/commercial development;
    d. Vacant or underutilized land designated as Interim Open Space and suitable for eventual
        residential use once development constraints are resolved;
    e. Vacant or underutilized land outside city limits, within the City’s Urban Reserve,
        including designated residential expansion areas.
a) Vacant Residential Land
This category includes vacant, developable parcels in the R-1, R-2, R-3 and R-4 zones. There are
145 acres of vacant residentially zoned land, with a development potential of 1,552 density units,
equivalent to 1,552 attached or detached single-family dwellings, or two-bedroom
condominiums or apartments. Of the total, 27 vacant acres are zoned R-3 or R-4, and can be
developed at densities of at least 20 dwellings per acre. Therefore, these 27 acres are considered
suitable for the development of housing affordable to lower income households.

City of San Luis Obispo Housing Element, January 2015
The City’s primary residential expansion areas are the Margarita and Orcutt Specific Plan Areas.
The Margarita Area is within city limits, comprises a total of 74 acres which support residential
uses, and has a planned residential capacity of 868 dwellings. Three residential subdivisions
totaling 374 dwellings already have planning approvals. Of those, the Serra Meadows
subdivision with 179 homes is currently under construction; so far 23 homes in the first two
phases have been completed and 37 homes are currently under construction. Consequently, for
purposes of determining residential capacity, the Margarita Specific Plan Area is included
partially under approved development and partially under Vacant Land within the City.
The Orcutt Area has recently been annexed into the City of San Luis Obispo. The Orcutt Area
specific plan holds 152 total acres and a residential capacity of 1,091 dwelling units. 142
dwellings have been approved and an additional 300 units are in process awaiting planning
approvals.
b) Underutilized Residential Land
Underutilized residential land consists of parcels in the R-1, R-2, R-3 and R-4 zones that could
accommodate additional housing based on lot area, slope and zoning. The amount of
underutilized, single-family or multi-family residential-zoned land equals 68 acres, with an
estimated 341 potential dwelling units. Of the total, approximately 13 acres can be developed at
densities of at least 20 dwellings per acre and therefore, considered suitable for the development
of housing affordable to lower income households.
c) Vacant or Underutilized Land Suitable for Mixed-Use Development
There are 63 acres of vacant and underutilized land that could accommodate mixed commercial
and residential uses, with a development potential of 773 density units, about 23 percent of the
in-city development potential. Of the total, 31 acres can be developed at densities of at least 20
dwellings per acre and therefore, considered suitable for the development of housing affordable
to lower income households.
City policies encourage mixed residential and commercial uses. Mixed uses are allowed by right
in the C-C, C-D, C-R, C-N, C-T and O zones, and by use permit in the C-S and M zones. Mixed
uses are also allowed in the PF zone with rezoning to PF-MU. City policies encourage mixed
uses in commercially-zoned areas, particularly in the Downtown Core, an area that historically
had many apartments located above ground-floor commercial uses. General Plan polices
encourage housing rehabilitation and intensification in the Downtown Core (C-D zone). At 36
density units per acre, this zone allows the highest residential density in the City. Other
commercial zones allow 24 density units per acre for mixed-use development, including areas
zoned for Retail Commercial (C-R) and Service Commercial-service (C-S). City polices
encourage multi-family housing close to schools and jobs. In 2003 the City revised its zoning
regulations to expand mixed-use housing opportunities. The revisions introduced Live-Work
dwellings in the C-S and Work-Live dwellings in both the C-S and M zones, a new form of
housing for San Luis Obispo. The revisions also relaxed requirements for establishing mixed
residential/commercial uses, and renamed the C-C zone to C-D, or Commercial-Downtown. The
C-C zone was then applied to community shopping centers outside downtown.

d) Vacant or underutilized land designated as Interim Open Space
The General Plan Land Use Element shows desired future uses for most land within the urban
reserve line. However, for some properties, the City has not determined the eventual use. Such
properties are designated as Interim Open Space (C/OS), indicating that they will be suitable for
urban development when certain conditions are satisfied. Examples of such conditions include
the provision of access and utility service, reduction of flood hazards, or the need for and
appropriate timing of urban development. Development of Interim Open Space requires approval
of a development plan or specific plan showing how these conditions would be met.
Approximately 144 acres of vacant or underutilized Interim Open Space were identified, with a
potential development capacity of 6 density units, assuming eventual development with Low
Density Residential uses. Portions of these parcels are located within a 100-year flood zone and
are not suitable for residential development until the flood hazard is mitigated. Because this land
is not yet suitable for residential development and provides open space benefits, it is considered a
lower priority for development and is not included in total residential development capacity.
e) Possible Rezonings
Table D-1 highlights the location of parcels which may be appropriate for rezoning to
accommodate housing development within the planning period. All of these properties have
residential development capacity and are served by streets, utilities, and public services; however
their additional residential capacity with rezoning is not included in the City’s total residential
capacity at this time. They may be included in the future if determined necessary and
appropriate to achieve housing objectives. Under Program 6.15, the City intends to consider
General Plan amendments for these specific properties to rezone commercial, manufacturing or
public facility zoned areas for higher-density, infill or mixed use housing where land
development patterns are suitable, where environmentally appropriate, and where impact to
Low-Density Residential neighborhoods would be minimal. Most of these areas are suitable for
higher residential density development (R-3 and R-4) or mixed uses and could accommodate an
estimated 1,493 additional dwellings, shown in Table D-4.
Through zoning, the City sets the range of allowed uses, residential and commercial density,
building height, and other development standards. At the request of citizens, land owners or
developers, or the Planning Commission, the City Council may consider changing the general
plan and rezoning property up to four times each year. Such changes must be consistent with
general plan policies on land use, circulation, noise and other factors governing land use
suitability. Where sites are appropriate for multiple uses, including residential, the City’s General
Plan emphasizes housing development over development of non-residential uses.

f) Secondary Dwelling Units
Consistent with AB 1866 (Section 65852.2 of State Housing Element law), the City’s Zoning
Regulations allow the creation of second-units with ministerial approvals in the R-1, R-2, R-3,
R-4 and O zones when the primary use on the site is a single-family dwelling, subject to the
Community Development Director’s determination that the project meets general requirements
and performance standards. Under the law, cities may establish property development standards
for SDUs, including, but not limited to, parking, height, setback, lot coverage, and architectural
design.
San Luis Obispo’s secondary dwelling units (SDU) ordinance allows the approval of an SDU
without discretionary review. SDUs must conform to applicable zoning regulations such as
height, yards, building coverage, parking, and are limited to a maximum floor area of 450 square
feet. SDUs are treated as an additional unit but are not taken into consideration when calculating
total allowed density on a site. Rental costs for SDUs are not listed separately in local classified
ads and rental listings, however SDUs are likely to rent at prices similar to or slightly higher than
studio apartments in multi-family developments.

Chapter 3
City of San Luis Obispo Housing Element, January 2015
State law (Section 65583.1 of State housing element law) allows local governments to identify
realistic capacity for second-units in addressing a locality’s share of the regional housing need.
The identification of realistic capacity should be based on the development trends of second-
units in the previous housing element planning period and other relevant factors. The City has
not identified SDUs as a housing component in meeting its Regional Housing Needs Allocation
(RHNA). SDU construction rates in San Luis Obispo have been low (averaging about one to
two units per year between 2000 and 2013) possibly due in part to developer and tenant
preferences for larger apartments given past impact fee rate structures which treated SDUs
similar to houses or larger apartments in terms of utility impacts. However, the City recently
updated its impact fee rate structure and reduced SDU impact fees by approximately 60%. As a
result, the City expects that SDU construction will substantially increase during the Housing
Element Planning Period. To more fully utilize this form of infill housing, the housing element
includes several programs to encourage the development of SDUs, including:
6.29     Continue to pursue incentives to encourage development of Secondary Dwelling Units
         (SDUs). Possible incentives include SDU design templates, flexible development
         standards, fee reductions or deferrals, or other measures to encourage the construction
         of SDUs where allowed by zoning.
6.31     Consider scaling development impact fees for residential development based on size,
         number of bedrooms, and room counts.
9.12     Consider incentivizing dwelling units to a minimum size of 150 square feet, consistent
         with the California Building Code, by reduced impact fees and property development
         standards.
h) “Pipeline” Projects
The City has a number of residential projects in the early planning stages. These are termed
“pipeline projects” because they are going through the planning review process but have not yet
received entitlements. 1,431 dwellings are proposed under the pending development applications
and of these, 95 units are slated to be affordable to extremely low, very low, low or moderate
income households. Table D-2 summarizes pipeline residential development projects as of June
30, 2014.

3. Regional Housing Need Allocation and Quantified Objectives
The City’s Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) as determined by the San Luis Obispo
Council of Governments is shown below in Table D-3. During the planning period, the City’s
new housing construction objective is 1,144 dwellings. As allowed by State Law, the City’s
RHNA is adjusted based on the number of dwelling units approved, under construction or built
between January 1, 2014 and June 30, 2014. These units are deducted from the RHNA number
for each income category to establish the City’s housing construction objectives. The quantified
objectives promote the development of housing that meets affordability standards for the income
groups in the same proportion as the RHNA allocation, and emphasize production of multi-
family, higher density housing, where appropriate. Although not counted toward meeting the
City’s RHNA allocation in this planning period because it is located just outside city limits,
housing developed by Cal Poly University on and adjacent to the campus on State land has been
and will continue to play a key role in meeting City housing needs.

      Dwelling units affordable at moderate and below are a combination of Inclusionary, Tax Credit, Affordable Housing Fund
    and Density Bonus development projects.
a) Zoning Appropriate To Accommodate Housing for Lower and Moderate Income
Households
The Medium-High and High Density residential zones, and the Downtown Commercial, Retail
Commercial, Community Commercial, and Service Commercial (R-3, R-4, C-D, C-R and C-S)
zone districts provide the greatest potential for the development of housing affordable to lower
income households. This is due to the economies of scale inherent in developing housing on
sites zoned to allow densities of 20 dwellings or more per acre, and these zones allow residential
densities of 24 to 36 density units per acre. Consistent with Government Code Section
65583.2(c)(3)(B), those sites identified in the inventory as having the potential for residential
development at densities of at least 20 dwelling units (du)/acre are considered appropriate to
accommodate housing for lower-income households.
As shown in Table D-4, the City has 92 acres of development-ready, vacant or underutilized land
that can be developed within the planning period at densities of at least 20 dwellings per acre,
with a development capacity of 1,840 dwellings assuming 20 dwelling units are built on each
acre. As shown in Table D-4, the City’s remaining housing need for lower and moderate income
housing is 525 dwellings. Hence, the City has adequate land inventory to meet lower and
moderate income housing needs during the planning period.

  Assumes minimum density of 20, two-bedroom, dwellings per acre; however 24-36 dwellings per acre may be allowed.
b) Default Density
State law has established a “default densities” to use as a basis for determining land suitability
for developing housing for lower income households. In San Luis Obispo, the default density
has been established at 20 or more dwellings per acre. Eleven City zones allow base residential
densities (before density bonus) of 20 or more dwellings per net acre and therefore, are
theoretically suitable for meeting low-income housing needs. These are the R-2, R-3, R-4, O, C-
C, C-D, C-R, C-N, C-T, C-S and M zone districts.
City zoning regulations measure residential density in “density units.” Table D-5 above describes
the relationship between residential density units and the number of dwellings that can be built
on a site. In all land use zones except the R-1 zone, the number of dwellings that can be built is
determined by the number of bedrooms per dwelling unit, the lot size and slope, and zone. For
example, as shown in the Table, a one acre property, with average slope of 15 percent or less and
zoned R-2 (medium-density residential) can be developed to a maximum density of 12 density
units per net acre, equivalent to 12 two-bedroom dwellings. By constructing dwellings with
fewer bedrooms per unit, the number of dwellings that can be built is increased. For example,
using the same site in the above example, a development of up to four, one-bedroom dwellings
plus eighteen studio units for a total of 22 dwellings per acre would be possible.
An analysis of residential development trends shows, however, that the default density target for
lower income housing development is most likely to be achieved in six zone districts: R-3, R-4,
C-C, C-D, C-R and C-S zones. These zones allow base densities of 18 to 36 density units per
acre, with a range of dwelling counts from 36 up to 72 dwellings per acre.
Vacant and underutilized land in these zones is adequate to meet the City’s quantified needs for
extremely low, very low, low and moderate income housing. Given development and
redevelopment trends exemplified by residential projects in the development review process,
shown in Table D-3, two development trends are apparent: 1) residential development in
commercially-zoned properties is increasing, particularly in mixed-use developments and 2)
residential densities in new development are generally on the rise.

4. Evaluation of Residential Development Capacity: Identifying Adequate
Sites
State law requires that housing elements include an inventory of land “suitable for residential
development” and that the inventory “identify sites that can be developed for housing within the
planning period and that are sufficient to provide for the jurisdiction’s share of the regional
housing need for all income levels pursuant to Section 65584 (Government Code 65583.2(a).”
In this context, land suitable for residential development includes all of the following:
         Vacant sites zoned for residential use.
         Vacant sites zoned for non-residential use that allows residential development.
         Residentially zoned sites that are capable of being developed at higher density.
         Sites zoned for non-residential use that can be redeveloped for and as necessary, rezoned
          for residential use.
To accomplish this, jurisdictions must conduct an inventory of land suitable for residential
development, analyze sites’ availability and suitability for housing (e.g. development capacity),
and identify adequate sites to meet its regional housing need, in total and by income group,
within the planning period. Appendix K describes the methodology and results of the City’s land
inventory, addressing vacant, underutilized and blighted properties, both within city limits and
outside city limits but within urban growth boundaries, that have residential development
potential.

a) Small Sites Analysis
Development of parcels allowing at least 50-80 dwellings is desirable in terms of construction
economies and effective use of State or federal grants. However older, compact cities like San
Luis Obispo may not have the in-city supply of larger lots suitable for residential development.
Most of San Luis Obispo was subdivided into relatively small lots in the early 20th century, with
vacant parcels of 2 to 5 acres in size now rare. To evaluate the feasibility of the residential
development on “small sites” – that is, sites generally under 2 acres and allowing less than 50-80
dwellings, the City reviewed recent development projects on small sites, as shown on Table D-6
below.
That review revealed that residential development projects approved within the last three years
show a marked increase in residential densities in several zone districts. Of the 369 dwellings
approved, 229 dwellings (64 percent) were developed at 20 or more du/acre. Through Programs
6.16, 6.26 and 6.30, the City will consider setting a minimum number of dwellings on legal lots
in the R-2, R-3 and R-4 zones, and to pursue changes to residential development standards and
procedures to encourage denser residential development where appropriate.
In addition, the City reviewed actual built yields of small and large scale high density projects
approved and constructed in the last five years. The results of this review revealed that smaller
multi-family projects (1-10 units) were typically developed at 20-24 dwelling units per acre,
while medium and larger sized multifamily residential projects (11+ units) were typically built-
out in the 26-32 dwelling unit per acre range. Higher density development for the medium and
larger projects is likely the result of the City providing fiscal and regulatory incentives for
projects subject to inclusionary housing requirements and including affordable housing,
including density bonuses pursuant to Government Code Section 65915.

However, even smaller sites can easily support densities of 20 dwellings or more per acre. For
example, using a typical site plan design for a multi-story, medium sized multifamily project on
a 6,000 square foot lot, the imposition of the 15 foot front yard requirement, 35-foot building
height requirement, two parking space per unit, and a maximum allowed lot building/lot
coverage of 60 percent, three, one-bedroom dwellings plus one two-bedroom apartments are
possible. This is a density equivalent to 29 dwelling units per acre. A review of real estate prices
for smaller, multi-family zoned lots, particularly in older neighborhoods of the City, indicates
that they are often priced competitively with large lots on the City’s fringe, on a per acre basis,
when costs of installing streets and utilities are considered.
Residential development on sites of one acre or less have been, and continue to be, a key
component of the City’s housing production. San Luis Obispo is located in a valley, mostly
surrounded by and interspersed with hills or “morros” that limit the extent of outward urban
expansion. Since 1994, the City has emphasized in-fill development on suitable vacant or
underutilized sites already in the City, close to utilities, public transportation and services. When

                                                                  Housing Element
                                                                                       
properly designed, one acre sites in the R-2, R-3, R-4, C-D and C-S zones can meet State HCD’s
“default density” of at least 20 dwellings per acre, and importantly, be compatible with scale and
character of their surroundings.
Of the total number of potential units identified in the Residential Capacity Survey, 730 dwelling
units, or 20 percent of the total capacity, are located on properties under one acre in size. The
survey identifies a total of 236 properties under one acre, with an average development potential
of 3.08 units per site, and a median development capacity of one unit. Of these 236 properties,
119 are vacant, accounting for 228 of the 730 potential “small site” dwelling units. The
remaining 502 units would be located on 118 underutilized and/or blighted properties.
Capacity estimates were reduced by up to 75 percent for the most physically constrained
properties, to 25 percent for the least constrained properties. These adjustment factors were
developed based on observed residential development efficiency showing that residential
densities actually achieved are typically about 75 percent of the maximum density allowed by
zoning due to topography, site conditions (e.g. mature trees, creeks, historic buildings), and
property development standards such as parking, building setback and landscape requirements,
and height limits reduce the development capacity of a given site.
To help improve residential development efficiency and increase housing production, the City
has revised its development standards to provide more regulatory flexibility and additional
incentives, as described in Table C-3. In addition, allowed building heights in the Downtown C-
D zone were increased from 50 feet to 75 feet provided that the project includes housing at a
density of at least 36 units per acre, and meets other performance standards including enhanced
housing affordability, energy efficiency, pedestrian amenities, public access, and historic
preservation. Flexible parking standards, including in-lieu parking program and reductions in
required parking of up to 30 percent for mixed- and shared uses, provide incentives for denser
development Downtown and in residential and commercial zones outside the City core. To
promote smaller, higher density residential developments, the City modified its Inclusionary
Housing Program to encourage “affordability by design.” The changes allowed housing
developers to reduce the number of affordable dwellings or in-lieu fees required based on a
formula (Table “2A”) that takes into account average residential density and unit floor areas.
Developments that build housing at densities of 24 density units per acre or higher and with unit
floor areas of 1500 square feet or less need only provide one enforceably-restricted affordable
dwelling, regardless of the number of total units.
The City is considering several additional incentives to residential development, including
waiving parking requirements for some Downtown dwellings and allowing leased residential
parking in Downtown public parking facilities. Housing Element programs 6.13, 6.27, 6.28,
6.29, 6.30, and 6.31 target additional changes to increase housing production and residential
development efficiency, included possible density increases, establishing minimum residential
densities and more flexible development standards for secondary dwelling units (“granny flats”).

Small Site Development Examples
Below are examples of potential small site residential developments, typical of many small sites
in San Luis Obispo. These include underdeveloped or blighted properties that can accommodate
at least one additional dwelling unit, and underdeveloped or blighted properties that can
accommodate new or additional high density development of 20 or more dwelling units per acre.
1) Sites that can accommodate one additional dwelling unit are typical of 2062 Price Street, a
7,500 square foot site zoned R-2 and developed with a small two-bedroom home located at the
rear of the site.
2) Another example is located at 577 Branch St, an 8,280 square-foot, R-2-zoned property
developed with a small home located on the front side of the property.
Properties such as these that are identified in the capacity survey can accommodate one or more
additional dwelling units and are likely to do so during the first five years of the RHNA period.
Continuing high property values and high rents, due in part to the high housing demand from
Cuesta College and Cal Poly students, makes continued infill development likely. There are
many examples of similarly underdeveloped properties that were redeveloped with additional
                                                 Page D-16
                                                                Housing Element
                                                                                     
units during the past RHNA period, up until the recession and the housing market slowdown that
began in late 2007. When market conditions improve, these types of properties are expected to
be some of the first to redevelop because of low infrastructure costs and the ease of permitting
small housing developments within the City. With respect to financial feasibility and developing
affordable housing, the City expects that these properties will be developed with affordable
housing following the Quantified Objectives identified in this Housing Element because of
incentives and regulatory relief provided for new affordable housing units.
Underdeveloped or Blighted Site Opportunities Examples
Another category of key sites evaluated in the capacity survey is underdeveloped or blighted
properties that can accommodate new or additional high density development of over 20
dwelling units per acre. Representative sites are evaluated below, with one site highlighted to
show a recent development on a small site.
1) 3085 McMillan Avenue, pictured below, is a 40,000 square-foot site, zoned M
(Manufacturing) that is developed with surface parking. The site is adjacent to service-
commercial land uses and suitable for mixed use development with medium-high density
housing and the City strongly encourages mixed use development in this area, as evidenced by
planning entitlements and development projects in the vicinity. The site is part of the proposed
South Broad Street Corridor Plan which encourages higher-density, mixed-use infill
development and redevelopment.
 2) 3590 Sacramento Drive is a similarly sized property, zoned M, which was developed with a
mixed-use project including 12 small two-bedroom condominium units affordable to moderate
income households. The capacity survey estimates that 16 additional units could be developed
on the project site as part of a mixed-use development (current zoning would allow for 22
additional units to be developed). A creek crosses the site, providing an opportunity for an
outdoor amenity for future residents.

City of San Luis Obispo Housing Element, January 2015
3) Another example of an underdeveloped or blighted property that can accommodate new or
additional high density development of 24 to 36 units per acre is 1166 Higuera St. The zoning
of the property is Commercial-Retail, C-R, with over 18,000 square feet. The property
immediately west of this site is smaller than one-half acre and in 2009 is being redeveloped with
a mixed-use project that will include 8,000 s.f. of commercial floor area and five residential
units, equivalent to 15 dwelling units per acre. Mixed-use development is allowed by right in the
C-R zone, and the only entitlement necessary to develop this property with residential units is
architectural review of the proposed site and building designs.
5. Existing and Proposed Incentives to Facilitate Housing Development
The City uses a combination of regulatory and financial incentives to facilitate housing
development. As described in Appendix C, dwellings are allowed in 14 of the City’s 16 land use
zones, and Zoning Regulations include density bonuses and relaxed parking requirements for
affordable housing development. Dwellings destroyed by fire, flood or other catastrophic event
may be rebuilt at the same density and up to the same size provided that new construction
otherwise meets current building and zoning code requirements. Dwellings can be built on any
existing, legal non-conforming lot, irrespective of density requirements, provided they otherwise

                                                                 Housing Element
                                                                                       
meet building setback, height, and other property development standards. In the Downtown core
(C-D zone), the City allows up to 36 density units per acre (equivalent to 36 two-bedroom
dwellings, 55 one-bedroom dwellings, and 72 studio units on one acre), 100 percent lot coverage,
reduced parking, a baseline height allowance of 50 feet, a baseline floor area ratio of 3.0. As an
incentive for mixed-use housing development, Downtown building may reach 75 feet with
approval of a use permit, provided that 15% of the building’s new dwelling are affordable to low
and moderate income households, and that it meets meeting other community objectives
including pedestrian amenities, view access, economic benefits, historic preservation, energy
efficiency.
As listed in Appendix C, Table C-3; the City offers a range of incentives to developers of
affordable housing, including development review fee waivers, impact fee deferrals, City
affordable housing funds, Community Development Block Grant and HOME funds, permit
streamlining, flexible property development standards and other incentives. For example, when
a developer agrees to construct housing for households of very-low, lower or moderate income
households, or qualifying senior households, the City offers a range of “by right” incentives and
alternative or additional incentives. For housing developments of five or more units, if at least
10 percent of the proposed units are dedicated for low income affordable housing, or 5 percent
dedicated to very low income, the developer shall be entitled to receive a density bonus starting
at 20 percent and increasing for every additional affordable unit, with a maximum density bonus
of 35 percent. As provided in Program 6.26, the density bonus provisions will be updated to
meet State law. In addition, the City waives planning, engineering and building application and
permit fees for certain affordable projects, and can defer payment of impact or inclusionary
housing “in-lieu” fees until issuance of certificate of occupancy rather than at construction
permit issuance, thereby allowing “soft” development costs to be paid for through proceeds from
unit sales. As part of the Inclusionary Housing requirement, developers may choose to pay a fee
in-lieu of building affordable units into their projects. This is a preferred option for most
commercial projects. In-lieu fees are then used to help fund land acquisition and construction of
affordable housing throughout the City. For example, in 2009 the City Council used $1.5 million
in in-lieu fees to help fund redevelopment of the historic Wineman Hotel for 48 single-room
occupancy apartments, of which 30 are permanently affordable to very low and low income
households.
The 2014-2019 Housing Element proposes additional housing incentives to encourage housing
development, including:
       Program 3.13 calls for the City to partner with faith-based organizations, non-profits, or
        the City’s Housing Authority to expand rental housing for extremely-low, very-low, low
        and moderate income households.
       Program 6.24 calls for the City proactively provide information for properties suitable
        for housing.

        Program 6.27 initiates an evaluation of residential densities allowed in various zones,
         with the possibility of increasing allowed residential densities in both residential and
         commercial zoning districts.
        Program 6.28 initiates an evaluation of multi-family zone densities and the consideration
         of establishing a minimum allowed number of dwellings on a legal lot, regardless of
         allowed density, provided other property development standards can be met.
        Program 6.29 pursues incentives to encourage the development of Secondary Dwelling
         Units (SDUs), including SDU design templates, flexible development standards, fee
         reductions or deferrals, or other measures.
        Program 6.30 would consider possible Subdivision and Zoning Regulations to facilitate
         small lot residential subdivisions, ownership bungalow court developments and other
         alternatives to conventional residential subdivision design.
        Program 6.31 would consider scaling development impact fees for residential
         development based on size, number of bedrooms and room counts.
6. Conclusion
Based on the analysis of City land resources with residential development potential, there is
sufficient zoned land that is suitable and available to meet the City’s RHNA need of 1,144
dwellings for this element’s planning period. As shown in Appendix K, the City’s land
inventory can accommodate construction of 3,477 dwelling units. As allowed by State law, the
City’s RHNA has been adjusted based on dwelling units built, under construction or approved
between January 1 2014 and June 30, 2019.
The City’s remaining housing need is 139 units in the moderate income category, plus 386 units
in the extremely-low, very low, and low income categories. The City has 92 acres of land
available and suitable for residential development at densities of 20 or more dwellings per acre,
with a development capacity of 1,840 dwellings, all of which can accommodate affordable
housing. During the planning period, the City’s housing objectives will focus mainly on
providing housing for lower income households. These affordable dwellings, as well as all new
dwellings in the downtown core (C-D zone) are exempt from the 1% maximum annual average
growth rate. New dwellings in the Margarita and Orcutt Specific Plan areas must conform to the
City approved phasing plans for those areas.

Appendix F
Five-Year Implementation Plan
This appendix describes the programs that the City will implement during the timeframe of this
Housing Element. The programs are designed to achieve goals and carry out policies listed in
Chapter 3, and to address housing needs and issues described elsewhere in the document. Each
program identifies specific actions to be accomplished, the responsible party, implementation
timeframe, potential resources, and comments on expected results or methodology.
The Five-Year Implementation Plan addresses a wide range of housing needs and represents a
commitment by the City to address those needs in a responsible manner. The programs are
intended to build upon one another; no single program is perceived as a solution to meeting the
City’s housing needs. The most effective approach is to combine a variety of programs or
“tools” to provide incentives and resources, secure financial and technical assistance, and remove
unnecessary impediments to housing to the maximum extent feasible.
These are uncertain times for cities and counties. The economic resources necessary to
implement some of the more ambitious housing programs, such as a First Time Homebuyer
Program, are extremely limited. To the extent such funds are available; the City intends to use
state and federal grants, loans, technical assistance or other forms of assistance in combination
with local resources. The City intends to implement the programs in the timeframes outlined
below; however these timeframes must remain somewhat flexible, allowing earlier or later
implementation in response to changing housing needs, resources and opportunities.
Appendix F has two parts: a list of all housing element programs by priority phasing, and a
numerical listing of all programs including implementation details. In the second table, each
housing goal below is followed by the housing programs to be implemented to help achieve that
goal. The symbol “n/a” is applied to programs that can generally be implemented as part of
regular City staffing and operations, without the need for outside funding.

Appendix G
General Plan Consistency Analysis
State law requires general plans to be internally consistent. Therefore, the goals and policies of
each element of the general plan must be consistent with other elements so that specific goals
and policies in one element do not conflict with or obstruct the accomplishment of those
contained in another element. San Luis Obispo’s General Plan contains the seven elements
required by State law. In addition, the City has also adopted optional elements as part of the
General Plan. State law requires that any optional elements adopted at the discretion of the
jurisdiction must also be consistent with the General Plan.
An analysis of the internal consistency, summarized in Table G-1, was done as part of the
Housing Element update process. Through this analysis, it has been determined that the Housing
Element is consistent with the goals, policies and programs set forth in the General Plan and its
associated elements. In the following matrix, “Y” indicates the Housing Element goal, policy or
program is consistent.

2.6 Continue to review existing and proposed building, planning, engineering and fire policies
and standards as housing developments are reviewed to determine whether changes are
possible that could assist the production of affordable housing, or that would encourage
preservation of housing rather than conversion to non-residential uses, provided such changes         Y          Y             Y            Y       Y        Y                 Y             Y             Y
would not conflict with other General Plan policies. Such periodic reviews will seek to remove
regulations that have been superseded, are redundant or are no longer needed.
2.7 Continue to implement existing procedures that speed up the processing of applications,
construction permits, and water and sewer service priorities for affordable housing projects. City
staff and commissions should give such projects priority in allocating work assignments,              Y          Y             Y            Y       Y        Y                 Y             Y             Y
scheduling, conferences and hearings, and in preparing and issuing reports and water and sewer
service allocations.
2.8 Continue to pursue outside funding sources for the payment of City impact fees so that new
dwellings that meet the City’s affordable housing standards can mitigate their facility and service   Y          Y             Y            Y       Y        Y                 Y             Y             Y
impacts without adversely affecting housing affordability.
2.9 To the extent outside funding sources can be identified to offset impacts on the City funds,
exempt dwellings that meet the moderate income, Affordable Housing Standards from planning,
building and engineering development review and permit fees, including water meter installation       Y          Y             Y            Y       Y        Y                 Y             Y             Y

2.10 Continue to coordinate public and private sector actions to encourage the development of
housing that meets the City’s housing needs.                                                          Y          Y             Y            Y       Y        Y                 Y             Y             Y
2.11 Continue to assist with the issuance of bonds, tax credit financing, loan underwriting or
other financial tools to help develop or preserve affordable units through various programs,
including, but not limited to: (1) below-market financing through the SLO County Housing Trust        Y          Y             Y            Y       Y        Y                 Y             Y             Y
Fund and (2) subsidized mortgages for extremely-low, very-low, low- and moderate-income
persons and first-time home buyers, and (3) self-help or “sweat equity” homeowner housing.
2.12 Consider incorporating HOA fees and a standard allowance for utilities in the calculation for
affordable rents and sales prices.                                                                    Y          Y             Y            Y       Y        Y                 Y             Y             Y

 3.2 Discourage the removal or replacement of housing affordable to extremely low, very-low, low-
 and moderate income households, and avoid permit approvals, private development, municipal
 actions or public projects that remove or adversely impact such housing unless such actions are
 necessary to achieve General Plan objectives and: (1) it can be demonstrated that rehabilitation
 of lower-cost units at risk of replacement is financially or physically infeasible, or (2) an        Y          Y             Y            Y       Y        Y                 Y             Y             Y
 equivalent number of new units comparable or better in affordability and amenities to those being
 replaced is provided, or (3) the project will correct substandard, blighted or unsafe housing; and
 (4) removal or replacement will not adversely affect housing which is already designated, or is
 determined to qualify for designation as a historic resource.
 3.3 Encourage seismic upgrades of older dwellings to reduce the risk of bodily harm and the loss
 of housing in an earthquake.                                                                         Y          Y             Y            Y       Y        Y                 Y             Y             Y

California Legislative Changes
Affecting Housing
Legislative Change
Housing element content and organization are governed by State law. Housing elements require
regular updates, in part, to be consistent with legislative changes. The following is a synopsis of
changes in housing and related laws adopted since 2009 that have shaped this housing element.
                                      Bill Synopsis
                                     Senate Bill 812 (2010)
     General: SB 812 requires local governments include an analysis of the special housing
     needs of the disabled, including persons with developmental disabilities, in their
     respective housing elements. By expanding the duties of local jurisdictions in relation
     to general plans, this bill imposes a state-mandated local program.
     Specifically, SB 812 provides that local agencies:
          Analyze the special housing needs of the disabled, including persons with
           developmental disabilities, discuss the potential resources that the
           developmentally disabled need and identify the population in the local
           jurisdiction that have developmental disabilities.
          Define "Developmental disability" as a disability that originates before an
           individual attains age 18 years, continues, or can be expected to continue,
           indefinitely, and constitutes a substantial disability for that individual.
          Create a program which allows fair housing accessibility for those with the
           disability.

Appendix I
Public Outreach
Updating the Housing Element has been a community effort, involving public participation
solicited through workshops, legal notices, email lists, web-site information, stakeholder
meetings, public hearings and consultation with providers. Over the past year, the City
conducted extensive public outreach to identify housing needs, issues and opportunities in the
community. The primary goals of the outreach effort were to:
    1. Actively engage the diverse populations of the City in discussions about housing needs.
    2. Ensure that affected residents, housing providers, homeless services providers, and
        funding entities have opportunities to be actively involved in the process.
The City facilitated 10 public workshops and meetings over the past year and compiled feedback
received into three categories of criteria: needs, issues and opportunities. These categories were
used throughout the public outreach process for consistency. The Housing Element’s policies
and programs represent a wide range of community perspectives on housing, including
neighborhoods, housing consumers, developers, realtors, chamber of commerce, downtown
businesses, and many others.
Example of news releases and emails sent prior to public workshops.

     2. Support for Program 9.12, which considers incentives for the development of
         smaller dwelling units.
     3. Concern regarding program 4.6, which considers amendments to require affordable
         housing units in a development be of similar size, number of bedrooms, amenities,
         character and basic quality of the non-restricted units.
     4. Consideration of a policy regarding support for employer/employee financing
         programs and partnerships to increase housing opportunities targeted towards the
         local workforce.

Chapter 3
City of San Luis Obispo Housing Element, January 2015
Purpose
The City has prepared this document to describe and quantify the supply and location of
affordable housing within the City of San Luis Obispo. Affordable dwellings are summarized
according to affordability level, affordability program and occupancy types.
Definitions
Affordability Level
This document lists dwellings deemed affordable under City standards to extremely-low, very-
low, low, and moderate-income persons. Income level categories are based on the percentage of
the county median income, as follows:
            Extremely Low        30% or Less
            Very Low             31 to 50%
            Low                  51% to 80%
            Moderate             81% to 120%
            Above Moderate       121% or Higher
Affordability Program
Affordability program refers to the organization/program used to create or manage the affordable
housing unit. The various affordability programs in the City include Building Equity and Growth
in Neighborhoods (BEGIN), Housing Authority of San Luis Obispo (HASLO), U.S. Department
of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), City Inclusionary Housing and State/Federal Tax
Credit projects. The affordability term varies depending on the organization/program used to
create or manage the affordable housing unit.
Occupancy Type
Inclusionary housing units are those units that have been created due to inclusionary housing
requirements imposed upon developments of five or more units. According to the terms of
inclusionary housing agreements, these units typically must remain affordable for a period of no
less than 30 years at which time they may be sold at market rate prices. These regulations were
implemented in order to create and maintain more affordable units within the community. The
affordability term was established to preserve a unit’s affordability over the longest period
possible to maximize public benefits from the Inclusionary Housing Program.
Housing Type
For ease of mapping, housing types were classified as either owner or rental. Ownership units
typically include single-family residences and condominiums. Rental units typically include
apartments and group housing. Descriptions of each housing type are as follows:
    Single Family Residences (SFRs) are individually owned dwelling units intended to be
     occupied by a single household.
    Condominiums (condos) are characterized as complexes of individually owned dwelling units
     within a larger building occupied by more than one household where common parts of the
     property are jointly owned.

    Apartments are characterized as complexes of dwelling units rented out to tenants within a
     larger building occupied by more than one household.
    Group Housing includes dwelling units in which assemblages of non-related persons reside
     together.
The following tables provide a summary of the City’s affordable housing units broken down by
income level, program type and tenure. As of January 2014, there are 947 affordable housing
units in the City of San Luis Obispo.

Residential Development Capacity
Inventory
Purpose
This survey lists properties within the City’s Urban Reserve Line (URL) with additional
housing development potential. The purpose of the survey is to document the City’s residential
land capacity to meet its Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA). The RHNA is the
number of housing units that California cities and counties must accommodate in their housing
elements, and is specific to each jurisdiction. Properties were determined to have capacity for
additional housing development if they were vacant, underutilized, or blighted and had zoning
to support residential development. By documenting residential development potential, the
Planning Commission and City Council can assess the City’s housing stock and make informed
decisions regarding housing needs for the 2014 General Plan Housing Element update.
Definitions
For the purpose of this survey, the following definitions were used:
    1. “Vacant” refers to a property with no structures other than signs, walls, or fences.
    2. “Underutilized” means a property with only minor accessory buildings, such as garages
       or sheds, or if developed, where less than 40 percent of the lot was covered with
       buildings (excluding properties in the Downtown Core, C-D Zone).
    3. “Blighted” properties are identified by one or more of the following conditions:
       a. damaged, sagging, or failed roof, walls, foundation, stairs or porch;
       b. broken, missing, or extremely weathered siding (stucco, wood, asbestos tile);
       c. broken, boarded, or missing windows, torn window screens;
       d. badly damaged or missing doors;
       e. exterior; outdated plumbing.
    4. “Property”, “lot”, and “parcel” are used interchangeably and refer to one or more
       adjacent lots of record under common ownership.
    5. “Urban Reserve Line” or URL refers to the area which encompasses urban land and can
       be inside or outside of the City Limits.
    6. “In-City properties” include only those properties located within the City Limits.
    7. “Outside-City properties” are those outside of the City limits, but within the Urban
       Reserve Line.

As part of the data collection and analysis phase of the Housing Element update, Community
Development staff worked over a period of three months to document the condition of the
housing stock and identify sites with residential development or redevelopment potential.
This involved three steps:
     1. Establish survey areas
     2. Identify and document vacant, underutilized, or blighted properties
     3. Determine potential for additional residential development
Staff began by dividing the City into 28 survey areas (See Figure 1 below), including land
outside of the City limits but within the Urban Reserve Line (URL). Survey area boundaries
generally follow major circulation routes, natural barriers, and neighborhood boundaries and
are identical to the boundaries used in the 2010 survey, with a few minor changes to reflect
recent annexations.
A “windshield survey” was then conducted, in which staff would drive each street of the
selected area and take notes of each property, which met the definition of vacant, underutilized,
or blighted. Notes for each property included the address (where applicable), existing use,
zoning, slope, housing type and number of units, and if buildings were present, their exterior
condition.
After completing each survey area, staff documented the correct address (if not visible),
County Assessor’s Parcel number (APN), General Plan and zoning designation, and total
square footage of each property using the City’s Land Use Program.
Once each area was surveyed and documented, staff summarized the number of vacant,
underutilized, or blighted properties and their acreages for each area and then for the entire
City.
Staff added properties that had been annexed into the City since the previous survey, or were
found to have changed status. Properties, which were vacant or underutilized in 2010, and have
since been developed to their maximum capacity, were removed from the 2013 survey.
Development Constraints
Under State law, the site inventory analysis must include an estimate of the number of housing
units that can be accommodated on each site identified in the land inventory within the
planning period. The element must describe the methodology used to estimate the realistic
capacity. The element should not estimate unit capacity based on the theoretical maximum
build-out allowed by the zoning. Development capacity estimates must consider:
1. Applicable land-use controls and site improvement requirements. The analysis must
     consider the imposition of any development standards that impact the residential
     development capacity of the sites identified in the inventory. When establishing realistic
     unit capacity calculations, the jurisdiction must consider existing development trends as
                                                  Page K-2

                                                                 Housing Element
                                                                                        
   well as the cumulative impact of standards such as maximum lot coverage, height, open
   space, parking, and FARs;
2. Existing Uses: The inventory must consider the impact of existing development when
   calculating realistic development capacity. For example, to demonstrate the unit capacity of
   underutilized sites, the analysis should describe and explain the factors that make
   developing additional residential units feasible (within the planning period). Consider the
   following example: A one-acre parcel zoned for 20 dwelling units per acre and developed
   with a single-family home. The element must demonstrate the local government has a track
   record of facilitating and supporting the intensification of sites, and describe the incentives
   the local government would offer (through a specific program action) to attract and assist
   developers; and
3. Small Sites (less than one acre): The element should include an analysis demonstrating the
   estimate of the number of units projected on small sites, is realistic or feasible. The analysis
   should consider development trends on small sites as well as policies or incentives to
   facilitate such development. For example, many local governments provide incentives for
   lot consolidation. In addition, while it may be possible to build housing on a small lot, the
   nature and conditions (i.e., development standards) necessary to construct the units often
   render the provision of affordable housing infeasible. For example, assisted housing
   developments utilizing State or federal financial resources typically include 50-80 units. To
   utilize small sites to accommodate the jurisdictions share of the regional housing need for
   lower-income households, the element must consider the impact of constraints associated
   with small lot development on the ability of a developer to produce affordable housing.

                              Residential Capacity Survey Subareas
To verify and update the status of each property in the 2010 survey, staff compiled a list of
properties that received building permits between 2009 and 2013. Vacant or underutilized
properties that had been developed to their full potential were removed from the survey and
vacant properties that were partially developed were then considered underutilized.
For blighted properties, the condition of the structure was re-evaluated. If the property was
rebuilt or repaired to a point that it no longer met the definition of blight, the property was
removed from the survey.
Properties were also added to the survey in one of three different ways:
1. If the property had been annexed since the previous planning period;
2. If the property had become vacant or underutilized due to the demolition of buildings;
3. If a property had become sufficiently deteriorated to meet the definition of blight.
Development Capacity Calculation
After reviewing the survey sheets for each property, the potential for development on each
property was calculated by applying the following rules.
                                                  Page K-4
                                                               Housing Element
                                                                                    
Development Potential was calculated by:
   1. Determining the maximum allowed density in units per acre according to average
      slope and land use zone designation (See Table 1).
   2. Determining the maximum number of density units allowed on the property by
      multiplying the developable lot in acres (excluding creek setbacks, street right-of-ways
      or plan-lines, and designated open space areas, or areas outside of the Urban Reserve
      Line) by the maximum allowed density units per acre. Recent housing projects within
      the City indicate that most properties do not develop to their maximum build out
      potential due to parking and setback requirements, access, and landscaping
      requirements. With this knowledge, the City has applied a conservative estimate of 75
      percent of the maximum residential capacity, to all properties within the survey. (max
      allowed density x .75 = surveyed capacity)
   3. Vacant property potential was calculated by applying the “75 percent rule”
   4. If the property was considered both underutilized and blighted, it was assumed that the
      property would be redeveloped, in its entirety, and would then follow the vacant
      property “75 percent rule.”
   5. If a property was underutilized, but not blighted, the percentage of the property that
      was developed was subtracted from the developable lot area and the remainder
      (anything not developed) was multiplied by 75 percent. For example, a 20,000 square
      foot property, with a building footprint of 5,000 square feet, has a total of 15,000
      square feet that can be developed. The remaining 15,000 square feet would then be
      multiplied by the maximum density and by 75 percent ((total area-developed area) x
      max density x .75).
   6. Blighted properties were considered to have development potential and likely to be
      redeveloped to their existing capacity if the buildings had structural issues (damaged,
      sagging, or failed roof, wall, foundation, or porch degradation). In these cases, the
      properties were not assigned additional development capacity, but were flagged as
      properties with the potential for redevelopment or rehabilitation.
   7. Vacant properties with the potential for mixed-use commercial/residential development
      were calculated following the same residential capacity method, as the City allows
      mixed use properties to meet both the residential and commercial maximum capacities
      determined by lot size.
   8. Where site features, such as lot orientation, natural features or the presence of historic
      buildings, warranted a further reduction from the maximum residential capacity, an
      adjustment factor was applied on a case-by-case basis.

Survey Assumptions
The following assumptions were made to determine development capacities for each property:
     1. Downtown (C-D zone) properties were considered to have development potential if
         they had:
         a. Less than 100 percent building lot coverage;
         b. An approved or proposed development plan;
         c. Had not undergone seismic retrofit or significantly modified in the last 5 years.
     2. If a property had a proposed development plan (planning approval or building permit),
         development capacity was assumed to equal the number of approved dwelling units,
         less the number of existing units.
     3. For single properties with multiple zoning designations, the development potential was
         calculated for the area of the property in each zone and then added together.
     4. Housing capacity for property with an approved or proposed specific plan, utilized the
         numbers outlined in the Specific Plan document to calculate housing capacity. The
         Orcutt Area Specific Plan (OASP) and Margarita Area Specific Plan (MASP) were
         used for this survey.
     5. The potential for adding secondary dwelling units was not included in development
         capacity calculations.
     6. Property development capacity is based on existing zoning, except in limited cases
         where rezoning is anticipated based on a pending application or Planning Commission
         or City Council action.
     7. Properties located within any of the Airport Land Use Plan’s “S-1” safety zones were
         determined to have no additional housing capacity.
     8. Properties with restrictions that prohibit further subdivision and density were left in
                                                  Page K-6

                                                                  Housing Element
                                                                                      
        the inventory, but calculated with a capacity of zero additional units to acknowledge
        that they were included in the survey.
Survey Organization
Once the development potential for each property was calculated, the information was
organized in three different ways: by survey area, zoning designation, and development status
(vacant, underutilized, blighted). Each organizational method provides the City’s staff and
decision makers with important indicators of which areas, zones, or types of properties are best
suited for future residential growth.
Summary of Residential Capacity
Survey results indicate the City has approximately 725 acres of vacant, underutilized or
blighted property that can accommodate approximately 3,477 dwelling units. A substantial
portion of this residential development capacity is located in the Margarita and Orcutt Area
Specific Plans. The City’s residential capacity exceeds the 1,144 unit RHNA, and therefore, a
property rezoning program will not be required with the Housing Element update.
Development Capacity by Area
Organizing the inventory by survey area gives staff, the Planning Commission, and City
Council a better geographic idea of where to expect or plan for residential growth over the next
five years. Figure K-2 shows the number of additional dwelling units that could be developed
within the planning period by survey area. Each survey area can realistically accommodate
with the development of all vacant, underutilized, and blighted properties. This survey has
determined that the City has the potential to accommodate 3,477 additional two-bedroom
dwellings, or the equivalent in density units, within the City’s Urban Reserve Line, based on
existing available land and the current condition of existing housing.
Areas with little or no potential for additional housing capacity were determined to be at or
near full residential build-out or affected by other restrictions like the Airport Land Use Plan.
Areas 18 and 21 include the Margarita Area and Orcutt Area Specific Plans, which account for
a majority of the potential for additional housing.

Development Capacity by Zoning Designation
Organizing the City’s development capacity by zoning designation rather than subarea gives a
better idea of what types of density and housing the City can accommodate. Only properties
within city limits have zoning designations in Figure K-3 below. Properties located outside city
limits but within the Urban Reserve Line are included in the “Outside City” category, due to a
lack of zoning designation. While zones R-1, R-2, R-3, and R-4 zones are specifically intended
for residential use, the City’s commercial, office, public facility, and manufacturing zones also
allow dwellings as part of mixed use development or freestanding use when compatible with
onsite and surrounding uses.

         *Parcels outside City are within Urban Reserve Line
The zones with the most potential for accommodating additional residential units located outside
a specific plan area include Low density residential (R-1), Medium density residential (R-2),and
High density residential (R-4) with potential for an additional 237 density units, 127 density
units, and 124 density units respectively. Figure K-3 shows residential development potential by
zone. For the purpose of this survey, properties with overlay zoning districts, such as R-2-H
(Medium Density Residential with Historic District Overlay), were not separated from the
primary zoning designation.
Development Capacity by Development Status
Properties were sorted by development status into three groups: vacant, underutilized, and
blighted. This was to allow an examination of the condition of housing and to identify sites with
infill development and redevelopment opportunities. In some cases, a property was categorized
as underutilized and blighted, when it met the characteristics of both definitions. Vacant
properties account for 55 percent of the City’s total residential capacity, blighted properties
accounting for about 4.5 percent, and the balance comprised of underutilized properties. All
statistics about Development Status can be found in Appendix D.
Table K-2 summarizes the number of potential density units for each subarea, and the total
acreage available for future development of each type of land. Additionally, the table is broken
down by available land within the city and land outside of the city limits but within the URL.

                                                   INTRODUCTION
The City’s General Plan guides the use and protection of various resources to meet community purposes. It reflects
consensus and compromise among a wide diversity of citizens’ preferences, within a framework set by State law. The
General Plan is published in separately adopted sections, called elements, which address various topics.
State law requires the City to adopt a noise element that assesses noise sources and noise exposure, and which aims to
minimize noise conflicts. The City’s first Noise Element was adopted in 1975. This revision, prepared in conjunction with
updates to the Land Use Element and the Circulation Element, was adopted in 1996. These elements are related, since
traffic circulation is the source of much community noise, and the location of noise-sensitive receptors is largely
determined by land use designations.
The Noise Element sets noise exposure standards for noise-sensitive land uses, and performance standards for new
commercial and industrial uses. A companion document, the Noise Guidebook, contains guidelines for those involved in
land use choices, and in project design and review, with methods for reducing noise exposure in relatively simple
situations. The Noise Guidebook also contains more detailed background information on local noise levels. The Noise
Guidebook is not part of the General Plan.
Before adopting or revising any General Plan element, the Planning Commission and the City Council must hold public
hearings. The City publishes notices in the local newspaper to let citizens know about the hearings at least ten days
before they are held. Also, the City prepares environmental documents to help citizens understand the expected
consequences of its planning policies before the hearings are held.
Anyone may suggest or apply for amendments to General Plan elements. The City will probably update this element
about every ten years, or more frequently if necessary.

                                                      GOALS
       1. Protect people from the harmful and annoying effects of exposure to noise.
       2. Preserve the tranquility of residential neighborhoods by preventing noise-producing uses from encroaching
            upon existing or planned noise-sensitive uses.
       3. Help citizens understand the effects of exposure to excessive noise and the methods available for
            minimizing such exposure.
       4. Emphasize the reduction of noise impacts through careful site planning and project design, giving second
            preference to the use of noise barriers and structural features.
       5. Prevent incompatible land uses from encroaching on existing or planned uses which are desired parts of
            the community, but produce noise.
       6. Encourage practices and technologies which reduce noise.
                                               1.       POLICIES
1.1. Minimizing Noise
     The numerical noise standards of this element are maximum acceptable noise levels. New development should
     minimize noise exposure and noise generation.
1.2. Land Use and Transportation Noise Sources
     Figure 1 shall be used to determine the appropriateness of designating land for noise-sensitive uses, considering
     noise exposure due to transportation sources. Figure 1 shows the ranges of noise exposure, for various noise-
     sensitive land uses, which are considered to be acceptable, conditionally acceptable, or unacceptable.
         In acceptable noise environments, development may be permitted without requiring specific noise studies or
         specific noise-reducing features.
         In conditionally acceptable noise environments, development should be permitted only after noise
         mitigation has been designed as part of the project, to reduce noise exposure to the levels specified by the
         following policies. In these areas, further studies may be required to characterize the actual noise exposure
         and appropriate means to reduce it.
         In unacceptable noise environments, development in compliance with the policies generally is not possible.
1.3. New Development Design and Transportation Noise Sources
     New noise-sensitive development shall be located and designed to meet the maximum outdoor and indoor noise
     exposure levels of Table 1.

1.4.        New Transportation Noise Sources
            Noise created by new transportation noise sources, including road, railroad, and airport expansion projects, shall
            be mitigated to not exceed the levels specified in Table 1 for outdoor activity areas and indoor spaces of noise-
            sensitive land uses which were established before the new transportation noise source.
1.5.        Traffic Growth
            The noise level standards in Table 1 should be used as criteria for limiting traffic growth on:
                  Residential Collector streets, as designated by the Circulation Element;
                  Local Streets, as designated by the Circulation Element, which extend through areas designated for
                   residential uses.
1.6.        New Development and Stationary Noise Sources
            New development of noise-sensitive land uses may be permitted only where location or design allow the
            development to meet the standards of Table 2, for existing stationary noise sources.
1.7.        New or Modified Stationary Noise Sources
            Noise created by new stationary; noise sources, or by existing stationary noise sources which undergo
            modifications that may increase noise levels, shall be mitigated to not exceed the noise level standards of Table 2,
            for lands designated for noise-sensitive uses. This policy does not apply to noise levels associated with
            agricultural operations.

1.8.     Preferred Noise Mitigation Approaches
         When approving new development of noise-sensitive uses or noise sources, the City will require noise mitigation
         in the descending order of desirability shown below. For example, when mitigating outdoor noise exposure,
         providing distance between source and recipient is preferred to providing berms and walls. Before using a less
         desirable approach, the applicant must show that more desirable approaches are not effective or that it is not
         practical to use the preferred approaches consistent with other design criteria based on the General Plan.
     1.8.1.   Mitigating Noise Sources
              A. Arrange activity areas on the site of the noise-producing project so project features, such as buildings
                   containing uses that are not noise-sensitive, shield neighboring noise-sensitive uses;
              B. Limit the operating times of noise-producing activities;
              C. Provide features, such as walls, with a primary purpose of blocking noise.
     1.8.2.   Mitigating Outdoor Noise Exposure
              A. Provide distance between noise source and recipient;
              B. Provide distance plus planted earthern berms;
              C. Provide distance and planted earthern berms, combined with sound walls;
              D. Provide earthern berms combined with sound walls;
              E. Provide sound walls only;
              F.   Integrate buildings and sound walls to create a continuous noise barrier.
     1.8.3.   Mitigating Indoor Noise Exposure
              A. Achieve indoor noise level standards assuming windows are open
              B. Achieve indoor noise level standards assuming windows must be closed (this option requires air
                   conditioning or mechanical ventilation in buildings.)
                                                                    Page 4-9

Chapter 4
1.9.  Sound Walls
      Noise mitigation walls (sound walls) may be used only when it is shown that preferred approaches are not
      effective or that it is not practical to use the preferred approaches consistent with other design criteria based on
      the General Plan. Where noise mitigation walls are used, they should help create an attractive pedestrian,
      residential setting through features such as setbacks, changes in alignment, detail and texture, places for people
      to walk through them at regular intervals, and planting.
      In the Irish Hills Special Design Area and the Margarita and Orcutt expansion areas, dwellings shall be set back
      from Regional Routes and Highways, Parkway Arterials, Arterials, Residential Arterials, and Collector streets so
      that the interior and exterior noise standards can be met without the use of noise walls.
1.10. Existing and Cumulative Impacts
      The City will consider the following mitigation measures where existing noise levels significantly impact existing
      noise-sensitive land uses, or where cumulative increases in noise levels resulting from new development
      significantly impact existing noise-sensitive land uses. (See also Chapter 2 of the Land Use Element, concerning
      residential neighborhoods.)
           A. Rerouting traffic onto streets that can maintain desired levels of service, consistent with the Circulation
                Element, and which do not adjoin noise-sensitive land uses.
           B. Rerouting trucks onto streets that do not adjoin noise-sensitive land uses.
           C. Constructing noise barriers.
           D. Lowering traffic speeds through street or intersection design methods (see also the Circulation Element).
           E. Retrofitting buildings with noise-reducing features.
           F.   Establishing financial programs, such as low cost loans to owners of noise-impacted property, or
                establishment of developer fees to pay for noise mitigation or trip reduction programs.
1.11. Exceptions for Residential Noise Barriers
      The City shall approve fence height exceptions to the extent required for effective noise-blocking walls in existing
      residential street yards, where existing traffic noise levels exceed the standards in Table 1. Such fence height
      exceptions shall be conditioned to minimize the aesthetic impacts to neighborhood character as perceived from
      the street and sidewalk. Such walls should help create an attractive pedestrian, residential setting through
      features such as setbacks, change sin alignment, detail and texture, places for people to walk through them at
      regular intervals, and planting.

                                                        PROGRAMS
To carry out its noise goals and policies, the City will undertake the following programs. These programs focus on
preventing noise-related land use conflicts by requiring that new development be reviewed to determine whether it
complies with the policies. Figure 2 outlines the steps in determining and mitigating noise levels for development
projects.
Information sources for development review include this element’s noise exposure maps and the Noise Guidebook.
The noise exposure maps are intended for screening proposed developments to see if they may be exposed to excessive
noise levels, and so need mitigation. The maps also guide long range planning. Generally, the noise exposure maps
provide a conservative (worst-case) assessment of noise exposure for the major noise sources identified in this element.
Other major sources of noise may be identified during project review. This will be especially true of stationary noise
sources, since only a representative sample of such sources was evaluated during the preparation of this element.
The Noise Guidebook includes standard noise mitigation packages which may be used to reduce indoor and outdoor noise
exposure by specified amounts. The Guidebook can help decide if proposed noise mitigation measures are a reasonable
application of the techniques available, and likely to achieve the desired results.
1.12.    Development Review
         The Community Development Department shall review new public and private development proposals to
         determine conformance with the policies of this element.
1.13.    Noise Studies
         Where a project may expose people to existing noise levels or projected built-out noise levels exceeding
         acceptable limits, the City shall require the applicant to provide a noise study early in the review process so that
         noise mitigation may be included in the project design. The City will maintain standards and procedures for the
         preparation of noise studies. (See the Noise Guidebook for specifics.)
1.14.    Assuring Compliance
         The City will ensure that required noise mitigation measures are carried out as a project is built, including
         enforcement of the State Building Code Chapter 35, “Sound Transmission Control,” as amended, and the “Noise
         Insulation Standards” (California Code of Regulations, Title 24).
1.15.    Monitoring
         The City will monitor compliance with required noise mitigation measures after completion of projects.
1.16.    Vehicle Code Enforcement
         The City will enforce within its jurisdiction California Vehicle Code sections on loud vehicle exhaust systems and
         sound amplification systems, and ask the California Highway Patrol and the County Sheriff’s Office to do so within
         their jurisdictions.
1.17.    City Operations and Purchasing
         The City will pursue alternatives to the use of noisy equipment, such as leaf blowers, and will purchase
         equipment and vehicles only if they incorporate the best available noise reduction technology.
1.18.    Noise Element Updates
         The City will periodically review and update the Noise Element to ensure that noise exposure information and
         policies are appropriate and consistent with other elements.

1.19.    Design Guidelines
         The City will make the Noise Guidebook available to anyone involved in project design and review.
                                     NOISE EXPOSURE INFORMATION
Noise Levels in San Luis Obispo
Most areas of San Luis Obispo are noisier than surrounding rural land, but not as noisy as many more urbanized places.
Major noise sources are road traffic, the airport, and the railroad. Noise level measurements in the community show that
the noise exposure polices have a reasonable basis in local conditions. Citywide noise levels at build-out are not expected
to be substantially different from 1990 noise levels. Most additional noise is expected to come from higher road traffic
levels and more frequent aircraft operations, which will be largely offset by quieter aircraft and vehicles. In a few cases,
road extensions will expose residents to higher noise levels.
Considering mapped 1990 noise contours and 1995 land use patterns, about 700 dwellings (less than four percent of the
City’s total) are in locations with noise levels above 65 dB, and lack noise walls or other deliberate measures to reduce
outdoor noises. These dwellings are mainly where arterial streets, highways, and the railroad are bordered by residential
development dating from the 1970’s or earlier. Sixty-five decibels was chosen as an indicator of “excessive” noise levels
because it is midway I the “conditionally acceptable” range (Figure 1), and the 75dB contour is often close enough to the
noise source that intervening landforms and buildings will not substantially reduce noise exposure. The 60dB contour,
corresponding to the upper limit of “acceptable” noise exposure, typically lies a block or more beyond the edge of major
noise sources (such as Highway 101) where intervening buildings would be expected to reduce actual noise exposure.
Figure 3 shows where to find noise exposure information. The Noise guidebook provides details on how noise levels were
measured or estimated.

                                                 BACKGROUND
1.20. Effects of Noise
      Community noise has often been cited as being a health problem, in terms of inhibiting general well-being and
      contributing to stress and annoyance. The health effects of community noise arise from the interference with
      human activities such as sleep, speech, recreation, and tasks demanding concentration or coordination. When
      community noise interferes with human activities or contributes to stress, public annoyance with the noise
      sources increases, and the acceptability of the environment for people decreases. This decrease in acceptability
      and the threat to public well-being are the basis for land use planning policies directed toward the prevention of
      exposure to excessive community noise levels. There are also economic effects of community noise: reduction in
      property values, inefficiency in the workplace, and lost hours due to stress.
1.21. State Direction
      Noise element contents and preparation methods are determined by Section 65302 (f) of the California
      Government Code, and by the Guidelines for the Preparation and Content of Noise Elements of the General Plan
      (by the California Department of Health Services) which are included in the State of California General Plan
      Guidelines, published by the State Office of Planning and research. The Guidelines requires that major noise
      sources and areas containing contours for current and projected conditions. Contours may be prepared in terms
      of either the Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) or the Day-Night Average Level (Ldn), which are
      descriptors of total noise exposure at a given location for an annual average day. (CNEL and Ldn are generally
      considered to be equivalent descriptors of the community noise environment within plus or minus 1.0 dB. (See
      the Definitions section for special terminology used in this element and in the Guidebook.)
1.22. Relationships with Other General Plan Elements
      The Noise Element is related in particular to the Land Use, Housing, Circulation, and Conservation and Open
      Space elements of the General Plan. The relationships between noise and these four mandated elements must
      be understood to prepare an internally consistent general plan, and to make decisions which will keep noise
      exposure within acceptable levels. Relationships between these elements are outlined below.
           Land Use: Ideally, to be consistent with Noise Element, the Land Use Element would show acceptable land
           uses in relation to existing and projected noise levels. This can be done in the city’s expansion areas. Doing
           so is more difficult where most land uses and major noise sources were developed before there was
           attention to noise issues. In those areas, acceptable noise exposure must be achieved through project
           design, since changes to land use designations often would not be consistent with other General Plan
           policies. (For example, designating as commercial part of a residential neighborhood near the highway would
           not be consistent with policies concerning protection of residential areas.)
           Housing: The Housing Element describes adequate sites for housing and some standards for residential
           development. Since residential land uses are noise-sensitive, the noise exposure information of the Noise
           element must be considered in planning and designing housing. The State Noise Insulation Standards and
           other noise mitigation measures may influence the locations and construction costs of dwellings, which
           should be considered by the Housing Element.
           Circulation: The circulation system, which is a major source of noise, must be correlated with the Land Use
           Element. This is especially true for roads which carry significant numbers of trucks. Noise exposure will be a
           factor in locating and designing transportation facilities, and in mitigating noise produced by existing
           facilities.

                                                                                            Noise Element
                                                                                                                
           Open Space: Excessive noise impairs the enjoyment of recreational open space, particularly where quiet is a
           valued part of the recreational experience. Thus, noise exposure should be considered in planning for this
           kind of open space use. Conversely, some types of open space can be used to buffer noise-sensitive uses
           from noise sources.
1.23. Relationship to Noise Ordinance
      Noise elements are directed at minimizing future noise conflicts, while noise ordinances are intended mainly to
      resolve noise conflicts. A noise control ordinance addresses noise generated by industrial, commercial,
      agricultural, and residential uses that are not subject to Federal or State noise regulations. The regulation of
      noise sources such as traffic on public roads, rail line operations, and aircraft in flight is preempted by Federal and
      State regulations, meaning that such sources generally cannot be controlled by a local ordinance. The Noise
      Element can address the prevention of noise conflicts from all sources, however. The standards of a noise control
      ordinance should be consistent with the Noise Element, to achieve consistency in the implementation of noise
      control programs, and to provide businesses with consistent design criteria for development or expansion. The
      City has adopted, occasionally amends, and enforces a noise control ordinance, which is chapter 9.12 of the
      Municipal Code.

Introduction
The City’s General Plan guides the use and protection of various resources to meet community purposes. It reflects
consensus and compromise among a wide diversity of citizens’ preferences, within a framework set by State law. The
General Plan consists of sections, called elements, which focus on certain topics.
In 1975 the California Legislature made a safety element and a seismic safety element mandatory parts of the General
Plan. Cities and counties were to adopt, at a minimum, policies concerning fire, flooding, and geologic hazards. San Luis
Obispo adopted its first Seismic Safety Element in 1975, and its first Safety Element in 1978. In 1984 the Legislature
expanded the list of hazards that were to be covered and encouraged their combination in a single element. According to
the legislation, the safety element should provide direction to help reduce death, injuries, property and environmental
damage, and the economic and social dislocation resulting from natural hazards. While the element is required to focus
on fire, flooding, geologic, and seismic hazards, jurisdictions may address any relevant safety issues that are considered
important.
This Safety Element focuses on achieving acceptable levels of risk through decisions on land use and the form of
development, with consideration for the closely related factor of transportation. Other public efforts deal with other
types of threats to health and safety, such as crime, use of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs, exposure to ultraviolet light,
the use of weapons, and the design and operation of vehicles. The Land Use Element of the General Plan prescribes land
uses within the planning area, as well as standards for population density and building intensity. To avoid unacceptable
risk, the Land Use Element must respond to the hazard evaluation of the Safety Element. By limiting development
intensity in areas that may be subject to significant geologic and other hazards, risks can be minimized. One of the
purposes of the Open Space Element is to preserve open land for public health and safety.
This Safety Element provides a broad survey of hazards in the San Luis Obispo area, to be used for general land use
planning. This information does not take the place of site evaluations by qualified professionals. Several of this element’s
goals, policies, and programs will be implemented through City review of individual development proposals and site
assessments.
In the General Plan, a goal is the desired end state or condition that the community would like to achieve. A policy
describes an approach to achieving the goals. A program is a specific action the City intends to take to implement policies.
Numbering of goals, policies, and programs is for ease of reference, and does not imply relative importance.
The Nature of Risk
People living, working, or visiting in San Luis Obispo are subject to a variety of hazards. San Luis Obispo wants to avoid the
loss of life, property, and prosperity that can result from disasters, and to accomplish a rapid recovery from unavoidable
disasters. Some hazards are caused by natural processes, some by people’s activities, and many by a combination of both
factors. Natural hazards are processes such as earthquakes, landslides, flooding, and lightning-set fires, which have been
occurring for millions of years. They have helped create the landscape of San Luis Obispo, and become disasters only
when they disrupt people’s lives. Other hazards result from technology, such as aircraft crashes and the use and transport
of toxic materials. Many disasters result from a combination of natural processes and people’s choices: developing in
flood-prone areas; grading that triggers landslides; building and occupying structures that collapse in an earthquake.
People have become so dependent on the benefits of modern technology that it would be undesirable to eliminate man-
made hazards. Usually, little can be done to prevent natural disasters. (However, there is mounting evidence that human
activity is changing the atmosphere, resulting in global warming that may cause more extreme weather conditions, and
therefore risks of flooding and wildland fire, in Central California. Reducing “greenhouse” gas emissions may therefore
reduce the severity of some disasters.)
                                                            Page 5-5

Chapter 5
To minimize loss from disasters, resources must be committed. While it would be desirable to provide the maximum level
of safety for all hazards, this is generally not feasible. Resources for disaster avoidance, preparedness, and recovery
compete with desires for other services. Community efforts to avoid unacceptable risks may conflict with individual’s
desires to use land in certain ways. So, risk-control standards must meet the constitutional test of proper regulation: that
there is a clear connection between regulation and the public purpose it serves.
The community can define acceptable risk levels and make choices to achieve them. Risk is part of everyday life. Almost
all activities have some degree of risk, and there is no hazard-free environment. The cost of providing protection generally
increases with the severity of the hazard and the level of risk reduction that is desired. At some point, the cost of
providing protection –either in dollars or in opportunities foregone– becomes prohibitive when compared to the benefits
derived. “Acceptable risk” is the level of risk below which no specific action by government is deemed necessary to
protect life and property. “Unacceptable risk” is the level of risk above which specific action by government is deemed
necessary to protect life and property.
An “avoidable risk” is one that can be eliminated while achieving other individual or public objectives.
Scientific expertise can predict the magnitude of a disaster and its probable effects, and can estimate the probability that
it will occur. But the public ultimately decides what level of risk is acceptable as well as the acceptable methods for
avoidance and protection. In evaluating acceptable risk, the following factors are considered:
Severity of loss: Will the loss from an event be large or small? Consequences include injury, loss of life, property, and
function, and environmental damage.
Probability of loss: How often is the event expected to occur? Many disasters have an inverse relationship between
magnitude and frequency: small losses occur frequently, large ones less often.
Capacity to reduce risk: What methods and resources are available to reduce the risk?
Adequacy of knowledge: How well do we understand the magnitude of the loss-causing event, its consequences, and the
probability of it occurring?
Additional information on hazards in the San Luis Obispo area can be found in the Technical Background Report for the
San Luis Obispo County and Cities Safety Element (June 1999). Additionally, the City of San Luis Obispo Local Hazard
Mitigation Plan presents a comprehensive risk assessment of natural hazards that have the potential to affect the City of
San Luis Obispo. The Local Hazard Mitigation Plan was developed by the City in accordance with the Federal Disaster
Mitigation Act of 2000, adopted by the City Council and approved by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The
Local Hazard Mitigation Plan suggests possible mitigation actions for reducing the effects of potential hazards. It is
incorporated by reference into the Safety Element and should be consulted when addressing known hazards to ensure
the general health and safety of people within the City of San Luis Obispo. The goals and policies within this Safety
Element support and are consistent with the recommended mitigation strategy within the Local Hazard Mitigation Plan.

                                                 1.        SAFETY GOALS
                    1. Minimize injury and loss of life.
                    2. Minimize damage to public and private property.
                    3. Minimize social and economic disruptions resulting from injury, death, and property damage.
                                                      2.       FLOODING
Flooding occurs in response to heavy rainfall, when creeks and drainage channels overflow. Flooding may also occur in
low-lying areas that have poor drainage, or when culverts become blocked, even during moderate storms. Flood severity
can be increased by fires in the watershed, structures or fill placed in flood-prone areas, and increased runoff resulting
from development of impervious surfaces (such as parking lots, roads, and roofs). Flood plains are usually described as the
                                                   area that has a one percent chance of being submerged in any year, which
                                                   is often called the “100-year flood.”
                                                   The 100-year floodplain in the San Luis Obispo area is shown by maps on
                                                   file at the Community Development Department and the Public Works
                                                   Department, and is generally indicated in Figure San Luis Obispo Creek and
                                                   several tributaries flow through San Luis Obispo. In the San Luis Obispo
                                                   area, floods cause damage by submerging structures, utilities, and vehicles,
                                                   and by eroding channels and undermining structures. Floods in 1969, 1973,
                                                   and 1995 caused substantial property damage. Local waterways typically
                                                   reach and then decline from flood stage in a matter of hours.
In 1969, floodwaters covered the intersection of
Higuera and Marsh streets and damaged several
businesses in the area.

San Luis Obispo is not subject to inundation from dam failure, beach erosion, or coastal or lakefront flooding due to
earthquake-induced waves (tsunami or seiche). However, the Whale Rock pipeline that brings water to the city is
potentially subject to damage from tsunami in the vicinity of Cayucos and Morro Bay. Sudden failure of Whale Rock Dam
(owned and operated by the Whale Rock Commission) or Salinas Reservoir (owned by the Federal government and
operated by the County) could cause disastrous flooding for communities immediately downstream, and would severely
reduce the City’s water supply.
Several large tanks on hillsides around the city store treated water for domestic use and fire suppression (Figure 1). A
strong earthquake could damage the tanks. Sudden failure of such a tank, which is very unlikely, would cause localized
flooding and erosion immediately downstream from the tank, in addition to interrupting water distribution. The tanks
located on the South Hills and on Islay Hill, which were set into the ground partly for esthetic reasons, pose a minimal
hazard.
The City’s Flood Damage Prevention Regulations and Federal Flood Insurance standards require new building floors to be
above the 100-year flood level, while not displacing floodwaters in a way that would raise flood levels. They also are
intended to keep floating debris and other made-made obstructions out of floodways.
2.0.     POLICIES
2.1.     Policy S: Flood Hazard Avoidance and Reduction
              A. The City will develop and carry out environmentally sensitive programs to reduce or eliminate the
                 potential for flooding in previously developed, flood-prone areas of the city.
              B. The City should allow flood waters to move through natural channels. Flow should be accommodated by
                 removing debris and man-made obstructions. The City recognizes that many natural channels cannot
                 contain runoff from a storm greater than a 25-year event. Areas flooded by storms as large as a 100-year
                 event will be mapped.
              C. No new building or fill should encroach beyond, or extend over, the top-of-bank of any creek.
              D. Within predominantly developed areas (such as downtown) infill, remodel, and replacement projects
                 should not displace more flood water than previous structures on the site or in the vicinity. Commercial
                 buildings may be flood-proofed where providing floor levels above the 100-year storm flow is not
                 appropriate due to adjacent improvements. New infill buildings may be required to have greater
                 setbacks than their older neighbors.
              E. Within new development areas, such as the potential expansion areas shown in Figure 2 of the Land Use
                 Element, substantial displacement of flood waters should be avoided by:
                 1. Keeping a substantial amount of flood-prone land in the vicinity as open space;
                 2. Enlarging man-made bottlenecks, such as culverts, which contribute to flood waters backing up from
                      them;
                 3. Accommodating in such places uses which have relatively low ratios of building coverage to site area,
                      for which shallow flooding of parking and landscape areas would cause minimum damage.
                 4. Requiring new buildings to be constructed above the 100-year flood level.
              F. Creek alternations shall be considered only if there is no practical alternative, consistent with the
                 Conservation and Open Space Element.

              G. Development close to creeks shall be designed to avoid damage due to future creek bank erosion.
                  Property owners shall be responsible for protecting their developments from damage caused by future
                  bank loss due to flood flows.
2.2.     Policy: Water Impoundments
         The design and review of proposed water reservoirs, ponds, and tanks, will conform to State standards for
         seismic safety and will include an evaluation of potential inundation areas.
                                                         3.      FIRE
Fires cause significant losses to life, property, and the environment. They occur in both urban and rural settings. Urban
fire hazards result from the materials, size, and spacing of buildings, and from the materials, equipment, and activities
they contain. Additional factors are access, available water volume and pressure, and response time for fire fighters. Fire
hazards in rural areas, or on the edge between urban and rural land, combine these factors with land slope and natural
and modified vegetation. The mosaic of grassland, scrub and chaparral, and oak woodland around San Luis Obispo has
been shaped by, and to some extent depends on, fire. Where the burning of natural vegetation is a threat to people’s lives
and property, plant fuels are often managed by replacement planting, grazing, plowing, or mechanical clearing.
“Wildland” is a shorthand description for areas characterized by low density development, concentrations of natural
vegetation and steeper slopes. Wildland areas may be subject to significant fire hazard due to natural vegetation’s
properties as fuel, and the steepness of the land, which affect how fast fire spreads and may limit access for fire-fighting.
San Luis Obispo faces wildland fire hazards due mainly to its climate and to the steeper hillsides around the city. Areas
with high wildland fire hazard include the Irish Hills, Santa Lucia foothills, Cerro San Luis Obispo, Bishop Peak, and Islay Hill
(Figure 1). Fire hazards in wildlands are often compounded by their distance from firefighting resources.
Fuel modification in conjunction with appropriate construction techniques may reduce the risk of wildland fires spreading
to the urban environment. In 2009 the City Fire Department in cooperation with the Natural Resource Manager
contracted with the Cal Fire Cuesta Camp Hand Crew to clear or modify natural fuels in the Cerro San Luis, Irish Hills, and
Bowden Ranch Open Space. Currently the City has contracts with the Cuesta Crew to modify fuels in open space areas by
French Hospital and the Johnson/Fixlini areas. The fire department aims to reduce fire risk through its weed-abatement
program, which covers all wildland areas within the city’s jurisdiction. The department also works with the County, which
has a State and locally approved fire management plan that coordinates among a number of State, regional, and county
agencies.
Construction techniques, including the use of ignition resistant materials and building design that can resist the intrusion
of flame or burning embers projected by a vegetation fire (wildfire exposure) reflect other efforts California communities
have made to avoid the repeating cycle of interface fire disasters.
Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zones
Government Code Sections 51175 through 51189 require identification of land within very high fire hazard severity zones
so that public officials are able to identify measures that will mitigate uncontrolled fires that threaten to destroy
resources, life, or property, and to require that those measures be taken. Property within these zones is required to
utilize Wildland-Urban Interface Fire Area Building Standards to minimize the threat of property damage in the event a
wildfire occurs in close proximity to these properties. The objective of the Wildland-Urban Interface Fire Area Building
Standards is to establish minimum standards for materials and construction to provide a reasonable level of exterior
wildfire exposure protection for buildings in Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zones and other areas designated by the City

Council after a public hearing. The City has decided not to create Wildland-Urban Interface Fire Zones within its
jurisdiction.
3.0.      Adequate Fire Service
          Development shall be approved only when adequate fire suppression services and facilities are available or will
          be made available concurrent with development, considering the setting, type, intensity, and form of the
          proposed development.
3.1.      Wildland Fire Safety
              A. Wildland fire hazard severity zones shall be classified as prescribed by Cal Fire. Areas within the City,
                 including “Very High” Fire Hazard Severity Zones, if any, shall be classified by the City’s Fire Code Official
                 based on findings supported by substantial evidence in the record as required by Government Code
                 Section 51179 and considered by City Council at a public hearing. Meaningful, early notification and input
                 shall be obtained from nearby neighborhoods which may be affected.
              B. New subdivisions shall be prohibited in areas of “Very High” wildland fire hazard as shown in Figure 2
                 unless part of conservation or open space acquisition program. Development of existing parcels shall
                 require a development plan to manage fuels,           maintain a buffer zone, and provide adequate fire
                 protection to the approval of the Chief Building Official. The development plan must be consistent with
                 Policies required by the City’s Conservation and Open Space Element.
              C. The City of San Luis Obispo is considered a “Community at Risk” due to the threat of wildfire impacting
                 the urban community. The City shall continue to enhance the fire safety and construction codes for new
                 buildings in order to reduce the risk of urban fires that may result from wildfires. Citywide building code
                 enhancements should include: Fire resistant exterior wall coverings; Sprinkler protection in attic areas;
                 and Ember resistant vent systems for attics and under floor areas and other provisions identified in the
                 California Building Code Chapter 7A.

                   4.       EARTHQUAKES AND OTHER GEOLOGIC HAZARDS
Overview
Geologic conditions encompass the form of the ground surface, the composition of the soils, rocks, and water at the
ground surface and below, and the long-term movement of the Earth’s crust and mantle. These conditions determine the
stability of the ground at a site, and how that site will respond to changes caused by people and by the natural forces of
earthquakes and weather.
                                                                   The frequency and strength of earthquakes depend on the
                                                                   number and type of faults that pass through an area. San Luis

                                                                   result in significant harm to people and property. Some fault

                                                                   recent earthquakes in California have shown that not all active

4.0.       Surface Rupture
           Surface rupture refers to the top of the ground moving unevenly along a fault: one side moves horizontally,
           vertically, or both, with respect to the other side. It typically occurs within an area of linear traces along previous
           ruptures, which mark a fault zone, and often in concert with movement on adjacent or intersecting faults.
           Rupture of the ground surface along a fault trace typically occurs during earthquakes of about magnitude 5 or
           greater. Surface rupture endangers life and property when structures or lifeline facilities are located on, or cross
           over, a fault.
           The Los Osos Fault, adjacent to the City of San Luis Obispo, is identified under the State of California Alquist-Priolo
           Fault Hazards Act (Figure 3). This fault’s main strand lies near the intersection of Los Osos Valley Road and Foothill
           Boulevard. It has been classified as active within the last 11,000 years. Additional site-specific studies may find
           other segments of the fault, in which case it would be appropriate for the California Department of Mines and
           Geology to expand the zone. The Los Osos Fault presents a high to very high fault rupture hazard to development
           and facilities in the Los Osos Valley.
           Other faults in the vicinity of San Luis Obispo are the West Huasna, Oceanic, and Edna faults. These faults are
           considered potentially active and present a moderate fault rupture hazard to developments near them. Figure 3
           shows the locations of faults in the immediate San Luis Obispo area.
4.1.       Ground Shaking
           Ground shaking refers to the vibration that occurs in response to displacement along a fault. Typically, ground
           shaking has a side-to-side component as well as a vertical component, with the actual movement depending on
           the type of fault, a site’s distance from the fault, and the rock and soil conditions at the site. Shaking endangers
           life and property by damaging or destroying structures and lifeline facilities.
           Several faults are capable of producing strong ground motion in San Luis Obispo. These are the Los Osos, Point
                                                                 San Luis, Black Mountain, Rinconada, Wilmar, Pecho, Hosgri, La

                                                                 probability of producing a major earthquake within an average

                                                                 soils that were deposited by water, are geologically recent, and
                                                                 have many pore spaces among the soil grains. These are
                                                                 typically in valleys (Figure 5).
                                                                 Engineering standards and building codes set minimum design

4.2. Settlement and Liquefaction
     In this context, settlement means the ground supporting part of a structure or facility lowers more than the rest
     or becomes softer, usually because ground shaking reduces the voids between soil particles (and often with
     groundwater rising in the process). The result can be more strain on the supporting features than they were built
     to withstand, leading to cracked walls or floors and broken water and sewer lines. Liquefaction is the sudden loss
     of the soil’s supporting strength due to groundwater filling and lubricating the spaces between soil particles as a
     result of ground shaking. Soils with high risk for liquefaction are typically sandy and in creek floodplains or close
     to lakes. In extreme cases of liquefaction, structures can tilt, break apart, or sink into the ground. The likelihood
     of liquefaction increases with the strength and duration of an earthquake
     The soils in the San Luis Obispo area that are most susceptible to ground shaking, and which contain shallow
     ground water, are the ones most likely to have a potential for settlement and for liquefaction (Figure 5). The
     actual risk of settlement or liquefaction needs to be identified by investigation of specific sites, including
     subsurface sampling, by qualified professionals. Previous investigations have found that the risk of settlement for
     new construction can be reduced to an acceptable level through careful site preparation and proper foundation
     design, and that the actual risk of liquefaction is low. (An example is the City’s fire station at Madonna Road and
     Los Osos Valley Road.)
     The building code requires site-specific investigations and design proposals by qualified professionals in areas
     that are susceptible to settlement and liquefaction.
4.3. Slope Instability and Landslides
     Slope instability can occur as a gradual spreading of soil, a relatively sudden slippage, a rockfall, or in other forms.
     Causes include steep slopes, inherently weak soils, saturated soils, and earthquakes. Improper grading and man-
     made drainage can be contributing factors. Slope instability may result in gradual or sudden damage to buildings,
     roads, and utility lines. Sudden movement can be a threat to lives through immediate injury or suffocation, or loss
     of access.
     In the late 1990’s, rain-saturated soil moved above houses on the Santa Lucia foothills.
     Much of the development in San Luis Obispo is in valleys, where there is low potential for slope instability.
     However, the city contains extensive hillsides. Several are underlain by the rocks of the Franciscan group, which is
     a source of significant slope instability. The actual risk of slope instability needs to be identified by investigation of
     specific sites, including subsurface sampling, by qualified professionals.
     The building code requires site-specific investigations and design proposals by qualified professionals in areas
     that are susceptible to slope instability and landslides.
4.4. Damage-prone Buildings
     Any type of building can be damaged in an earthquake, but some types are much more able to withstand quakes.
     In the past, many buildings were constructed of clay blocks, bricks, stone, or concrete blocks, with few or no steel
     members to resist separation of the masonry units. The weight and lack of connectivity within these unreinforced
     masonry buildings make them a particular threat to safety in an earthquake. Because many unreinforced
     masonry buildings have historic and architectural value, and contain viable businesses, there is reluctance to
     remove or replace them quickly. State law has required the City to identify unreinforced masonry buildings and
     implement a locally devised program to reduce risks. The City has surveyed them and required owners to
     evaluate their deficiencies and reinforcing needs. The City requires upgrades as buildings are remodeled or uses
     change, and provides fee credits to help offset some of the cost. A City law requires the owners to complete
     seismic upgrades or demolish the buildings by 2017.

                                                                                             Safety Element
                                                                                                               
     Some non-masonry buildings are especially prone to earthquake damage because they lack connections to their
     foundations or resistance to side-to-side motion. Examples include wood-frame buildings with apartments over
     garages that have one side occupied by a door opening, and hillside houses with little or no bracing for tall
     supports on the downhill side. The City participates in a rehabilitation loan program that helps correct such
     problems, along with other measures such as bracing masonry chimneys and anchoring water heaters, mainly for
     older homes.
4.5. Policy: Avoiding Faults
     Development shall not be located atop known faults. Applications for the following types of discretionary
     approvals within 100 meters (330 feet) of any fault that is previously known or discovered during site evaluation
     shall be subject to review and recommendation by a State-registered engineering geologist: change to a more
     intensive land-use designation; subdivision into five or more parcels; development of multifamily, commercial,
     industrial, or institutional buildings. (See also Policy S 8.3, Critical Facilities Locations.)
4.6. Policy: Avoiding Slope Instability
     Development shall not be located on or immediately below unstable slopes, or contribute to slope instability. Any
     development proposed in an area of moderate or high landslide potential shall be subject to review and
     recommendation by a State-registered engineering geologist.
4.7. Policy: Avoiding Liquefaction Hazards
     Development may be located in areas of high liquefaction potential only if a site-specific investigation by a
     qualified professional determines that the proposed development will not be at risk of damage from liquefaction.
     The Chief Building Official may waive this requirement upon determining that previous studies in the immediate
     area provide sufficient information.
                                    5.        HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
5.0. Radiation Hazards
     Ionizing radiation damages tissues at the molecular and genetic levels, causing a host of illnesses and
     reproductive problems. The particular type of damage depends on the intensity and duration of exposure and the
     part of the body that is exposed. People have evolved in an environment that includes very low-level exposure to
     natural sources of radiation. Various sources can cause exposure to much higher levels.
     The Diablo Canyon Power Plant is the primary hazard for ionizing radiation in the San Luis Obispo area. Risks
     result from the potential for mistakes during day-to-day operations, accidents associated with refueling, and
     damage from earthquakes or other causes. There is added risk from on-site storage of spent fuel that remains
     radioactive for several generations. Long-term, off-site storage facilities for spent fuel are not available. A release
     of radioactive material could seriously damage health and make property unusable. The plant operator and local
     agencies have jointly prepared plans for warning, sheltering, evacuation, and other responses to radiation
     emergencies. Updated information regarding the Emergency Response Plan is distributed to the public each year.
     The plant is regulated by the Federal Government. Land close to the plant, and downwind from it under
     prevailing conditions, is under County jurisdiction.
     Relatively low-level radioactive materials and waste result from some medical facilities and other sources. The
     use, transportation, and disposal of these materials are governed by State and Federal regulations.
                                                        Page 5-19

Chapter 5
         Radon is a naturally occurring gas produced by the breakdown of traces of uranium in certain soils and rocks. This
         gas can accumulate inside structures where building materials emit or trap radon, posing a significant health
         hazard. Soils and rocks in the San Luis Obispo area are not known to be sources of radon, so it is not considered a
         substantial local hazard.
5.1.     Other Hazardous Materials
         Hazardous materials include a wide range of solids, liquids, and gases that are flammable, explosive, corrosive, or
         toxic. Because large amounts of hazardous materials are shipped through the San Luis Obispo area daily,
         transportation accidents pose the most significant hazardous material risk to City residents and the environment.
         Hazardous materials are transported along highways, the railroad, and pipelines, which pass through the city.
         Public exposure to hazardous materials also can result from their use by industry, agriculture, and services. In
         1999, there were about 145 businesses in the City using hazardous materials in sufficient quantities to require
         filing a report with the Fire Department, as required by the California Health and Safety Code. Household use of
         hazardous materials is also a threat to health and the environment.
5.2.     Policy: Minimizing Hazardous Materials Exposure
         People’s exposure to hazardous substances should be minimized.
5.3.     Policy: Hazardous Materials in City Operations
         The City should avoid using hazardous materials in its own operations to the greatest extent practical, and will
         follow all established health and safety practices when they are used.
                                     6.      ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS
The flow of electricity through a conductor creates electromagnetic fields (EMF’s). These fields form around power
transmission and distribution lines, wiring in buildings, and equipment and appliances used at home and in businesses.
The strength of an electromagnetic field depends mainly on the voltage in the conductor, and declines with distance from
the conductor. Other EMF characteristics depend on the type of current (alternating or direct) and the frequency of
alternation. While an EMF from one conductor may interact with and in effect “neutralize” an EMF from another
conductor, there is generally no way to shield against EMF exposure.
Studies of the relationships between exposure to EMF’s and illness have shown that there is cause for concern, especially
from long-term exposure to strong fields. The mechanisms for the harmful effects have not been clearly defined. But it is
known that all life processes involve electromagnetic interactions at the cellular and molecular level, and fields from
external sources may interfere with these processes. The studies appear to show that there is not a clear dose-response
relationship. In other words, unlike ingesting a toxin, there is not a simple progression of harm as the amount ingested
increases.
The California Department of Health Services has recommended that, until information is available to make better-
informed decisions about possible health effects due to long-term EMF exposure, people and local governments should
consider keeping schools, dwellings, and workplaces away from high-voltage power transmission lines. With this
approach, exposure to strong EMF’s would be avoided through location choices when it is practical, inexpensive, and
simple to do so.
Figure 6 shows the high-voltage power transmission routes in the San Luis Obispo area.
                                                           Page 5-20

Chapter 5
          Policy: Exposure to Electromagnetic Fields
          Land-use decisions should avoid prolonged exposure of people to strong electromagnetic fields. Appropriate uses
          for areas under or next to high-voltage power transmission lines are agriculture, floodwater detention, roads,
          parking, materials storage, and parks and greenways with low-intensity use. Residential yards may be located
          along but outside of high-voltage power transmission line easements. School buildings and playgrounds,
          residential buildings, and work places should be set back from high-voltage power transmission lines. The amount
          of setback will be a matter of judgment, considering the space available in which to locate uses within the site
          being planned.
6.1.      Policy: Notification to Buyers Near Electromagnetic Fields
          When land containing major sources of electromagnetic fields, such as power transmission lines, is subdivided,
          the City will determine if a condition will be imposed requiring notification of prospective buyers that a source of
          electromagnetic fields exists and that studies have raised concerns about long-term exposure.
                                            7.        AIRPORT HAZARDS
The San Luis Obispo County Airport provides commuter, charter, and private service to the area (Figure). The primary
hazard associated with the airport is the risk of aircraft crashing on approach and take-off Aircraft flight operations are
determined largely by the physical layout of the airport and rules of the Federal Aviation Administration. Activities on the
airport property are managed by the County.
In April 1998, a private plane made an emergency landing on Los Osos Valley Road west of Foothill Boulevard, narrowly
missing power lines and cars.
Existing land uses under the approach and take-off paths include agriculture and businesses close to the airport, and
shopping centers, dwellings, and schools at greater distances. State law requires the independent, countywide Airport
Land Use Commission to adopt an Airport Land Use Plan for each airport. This plan establishes zones based on flight
patterns, with the aim of having future development be compatible with airport operations, considering safety and noise
exposure. State and County policies encourage future development to be consistent with the Airport Land Use Plan.
The City’s General Plan Land Use Element designates land-use categories that are meant to be consistent with the Airport
Land Use Plan. When the City comprehensively updated its Land Use Element in 1994, the Airport Land Use Commission
was preparing an update of the Airport Land Use Plan. When this Safety Element was adopted in 2000, the Airport Land
Use Plan update had not been completed. The Airport Land Use Plan was last amended in 2005 and is in process of being
updated again. With the most recent update to the Land Use and Circulation Elements, the City went through an
exhaustive process to evaluate safety, hazard, obstruction, and noise concerns associated with the current and future
operation of the airport. Proposed development associated with the Land Use and Circulation Elements update is
consistent with the County of San Luis Obispo County Airport Land Use Plan unless a determination of inconsistency by
the Airport Land Use Commission is made and the City overrules that determination as allowed under Section 21676.5 et.
seq. of the Public Utilities Code. Should an overrule action be taken, development shall be consistent with direction in the
State Aeronautics Act, the FAA regulations and guidance provided in the Caltrans Division of Aeronautics Airport Land Use
Planning Handbook. The City will continue to work with the Airport Land Use Commission as it updates the Airport Land
Use Plan for San Luis Obispo County Regional Airport to strive to achieve consistency between the Airport Land Use Plan
and the City’s General Plan.

                                                                                            Safety Element
                                                                                                                
7.0.      Policy: Uses in the Airport Land Use Plan Area
          Development should be permitted only if it is consistent with the requirements of the California State
          Aeronautics Act (Public Utilities Code §21670, et. seq.), guidance from the California Airport Land Use Planning
          Handbook, other related federal and state requirements relating to airport land use compatibility planning, and
          the San Luis Obispo County Regional Airport Land Use Plan unless the City overrules a determination of
          inconsistency in accordance with Section 21676.5 et. seq. of the Public Utilities Code. Prospective buyers of
          property that is subject to airport influence should be so informed.
                                            8.       HAZARDOUS TREES
Trees help make San Luis Obispo attractive for people and wildlife. However, as trees age, particularly massive or tall
ones, they pose a risk from dropping limbs or toppling. Strong winds, and saturated soils or erosion around roots,
contribute to the hazard. Falling branches or whole trees can harm people, damage property, and interrupt access, storm
runoff, and power and communications. Particularly for some types of pines in the San Luis Obispo area, pitch canker is
killing trees in a relatively short time. The weakened or dead trees increase the hazard.
The City trims trees along streets and on City parks and grounds, with safety as one objective. The City also notifies
property owners of hazardous trees, and works with owners, the local flood control district, and State programs to deal
with trees along creeks.
8.0.      Policy: Hazardous Trees
          Minimize danger to people and property from trees that are weakened and susceptible to falling or limb loss
          during storms.
8.1.      Program: Hazardous Trees
          The City will identify, and maintain or remove, trees on City property to minimize hazards, and will work with
          property owners to do the same.

        9.         AVOIDING AND PREPARING FOR EMERGENCIES IN GENERAL
Even if the City did not have this Safety Element, it would have in place many programs and requirements intended to
avoid several kinds of emergencies and to respond to those that occur. This element does not repeat in detail those
programs. Instead, it contains broad policies and programs reflecting the City’s commitment to achieving acceptable
levels of risk.
9.0.     Policy: Avoiding and Mitigating Hazards [reworded from the Open Space Element]
               A. Development, including access and utility systems, shall be directed away from hazardous areas, which
                   should be designated for appropriate open space or park uses.
               B. Where development, including access and utility systems, cannot avoid hazardous areas, the
                   development shall adequately mitigate the hazards.
               C. Hazard mitigation measures shall not significantly impact the environment, including wildlife habitats and
                   views.
               D. Development shall pay an equitable share of the costs to mitigate area wide hazards.
               E. Hazard mitigation measures shall not burden taxpayers with high maintenance costs.
               F.  Development shall not increase hazards for other properties in the area.
9.1.     Policy: Emergency Preparedness and Response
         There should be adequate planning, organization, and resources for emergency preparedness and emergency
         response.
9.2.     Program: City Activities
         The City’s Disaster Preparedness Committee will be responsible for planning and coordinating City preparedness
         activities. (This committee is comprised of the Fire Chief and representatives of the police, public works, utilities,
         and administration departments.) With direction from the Disaster Preparedness Committee, the Fire Chief will
         maintain and annually update a basic plan for emergency response.
9.3.     Program : Response Performance Standards
               A. The City will evaluate fire-flow capacities and identify deficiencies through testing and modeling of the
                   water system. For identified deficiencies, the Utilities Department will propose remedies to meet
                   recommended service levels based on Insurance Service Organization ratings and other objective criteria.
Discussion
            To effectively fight fires, water must be available sufficiently close to the fire, at a sufficient rate, for a sufficient
            duration. The City’s water system is typically designed and operated so the Fire Department personnel and
            equipment responding to a fire in one structure can at least prevent the fire from spreading to nearby
            structures. Automatic fire sprinklers, which are required in nearly all new buildings, greatly reduce the
            likelihood that a fire will consume a structure or threaten other structures. First-response fire equipment often
            carries water or chemical extinguishes that can be used to extinguish or contain small fires, especially where
            the fire is at the edge of the city or where the water system may not meet recent standards. Land Use Element
            policies discourage development beyond the area that can be served by the gravity-supplied water system,
            because public or private pump-fed systems that may be adequate for domestic use are usually not adequate
                                                            Page 5-25

Chapter 5
       for fire-fighting, and can support a sustained fire-fighting effort only if there is on-site water storage that fire
       engines can pump from.
       The City’s water system is typically not designed to fight a wildland fire some distance from the developed area,
       or approaching on a broad front and threatening scores of buildings. The City relies on mutual and automatic
       aid, including special equipment such as aerial tankers, in these situations.
       An earthquake that damages many structures would probably start several fires and cause some leaks in the
       water system. The City tries to avoid the injury and property loss that could occur in this situation by:
           Replacing old water mains, valves, and hydrants. Newer materials and properly back-filled trenches reduce
            the chances for breaks and leakage.
           Requiring looped water mains in new development areas, so leaks can be isolated while preserving water
            service in most of the area.
           Requiring new buildings to have fire detection and suppression systems, and fire-resistive construction.
           Training citizens to deal with emergencies at times when professional responders would be overwhelmed.
       The Water and Wastewater Management Element of the General Plan identifies the annual water supply
       needed for the entire city currently and at build-out of the Land Use Element. Municipal Code Chapter 2.44,
       “Development Impact Review Procedures,” requires that the adequacy of services, including water for
       firefighting, be addressed for each proposed development. In 2000, the City prepared a new Water System
       Master Plan. This plan focuses on the facilities needed to correct existing deficiencies and to serve new
       development. The draft plan recommended the following safety-related items:
           For the Stenner Canyon Water Treatment Plant, improved emergency standby power, a seismic evaluation
            of the existing treated water storage and clearwell facilities, and evaluation of means to protect the water
            treatment plant from railroad accidents.
           To serve the Margarita and Airport areas, about 10 kilometers (six miles) of new water mains.
           To serve the southwestern part of the city, a 6-million-liter (1.6-million-gallon) water tank.
       The following response-time programs are intended to apply to recurrent types of emergencies, not rare, area
       wide disasters.
          A. The Fire Department has set a response-time objective of four minutes. (The Fire Department’s standard
              of coverage recommends that a three-person engine company, with paramedic, meet this standard 95
              percent of the time.)
          B. The Police Department has set a 30-percent available-time objective for patrol response. (“Available
              time” is the fraction of total time that a patrol unit is not previously assigned or otherwise unavailable for
              response to a new emergency call for service.)
          C. The Public Works Department and the Utilities Department will set response-time objectives, based on
              the values at risk and acceptable levels of risk, and will work to achieve the objectives. (Typical incidents
              requiring timely response are water main breaks and large trees down in the street.)
9.4. Program: Staff Training
          A. The City will train fire fighters, police officers, building inspectors, and public works and utilities staff to
              levels appropriate for their tasks and responsibilities.
                                                        Page 5-26

                                                                                           Safety Element
                                                                                                              
          B. The City will provide training for those of its staff who apply its building regulations and planning
               standards, emphasizing the lessons learned in locations that have experienced disasters.
          C. The City will conduct disaster-response exercises for the types of non-nuclear disasters discussed in this
               element, coordinated with participation in required, periodic nuclear-disaster response training
               exercises.
9.5. Program: Specific Emergency-Response Information
     The City will obtain information about the specific location and type of fire and toxics hazards and values at risk,
     and use the information in its preparedness and response actions.
9.6. Program : Coordinated Emergency Planning
          A. The City will work within the Standardized Emergency Management System, an emergency response and
               coordination system used throughout California. The City will participate in periodic disaster-response
               drills, on a regional basis with all involved jurisdictions and involving the news media.
          B. The City will review the hazard assessment studies and emergency response plans of utilities and of
               transportation agencies and companies operating in the San Luis Obispo area, and update the City’s
               Emergency Plan, including evacuation routes, as necessary.
          C. The City will work with Caltrans to assure transport of hazardous materials follows Caltrans-approved
               routes, with all necessary safety precautions taken to prevent hazardous materials spills.
9.7. Program: Emergency Operations Center
     The City will maintain an Emergency Operations Center Plan, to prescribe the intended activation and operation
     of a single facility from which disaster response will be managed. The Headquarters Fire Station will serve as the
     Emergency Operations Center, with the Corporation Yard and the Police Station serving as back-up emergency
     operations centers or as department operating centers.
9.8. Program: Information and Planning Updates
     Working with other agencies in the area, the City will expand and keep current safety-related information. The
     City will use sufficiently detailed analysis of hazards, and will update the City’s safety and emergency plans as new
     information becomes available.
9.9. Program : City Emergency Plan
     The City will keep current and implement its Multihazard Emergency Response Plans, as required by the
     California Emergency Services Act, with the objectives of:
           Saving lives and protecting property
           Providing a basis for direction and control of emergency operations
           Assuring the continuity of government
           Repairing and restoring essential systems and services (such as water supplies)
           Providing for the protection, use, and distribution of resources that are available immediately after a
            disaster
           Making the City as self-reliant as possible following a major disaster.
           Coordinating operations with other local jurisdictions
                                                          Page 5-27

Chapter 5
9.10. Program : Mutual and Automatic Aid
      The City will work with other jurisdictions to obtain and follow adequate mutual-aid and automatic-aid
      agreements.
9.11. Program : Disaster Recovery
      The City will prepare for post-disaster recovery, including measures to address:
           Prompt assessment of the condition of buildings and utilities;
           Temporary shelter for displaced residents, including the potential for sites on parks or other public land;
           Temporary facilities for non-critical public services;
           Recovery of inventory and records from damaged commercial buildings;
           Temporary facilities for displaced businesses and not-for-profit organizations;
           Removal, reconstruction, or replacement of unsafe buildings, including historically or architecturally
            significant buildings;
           High volumes of planning and building applications;
           High demand for public capital improvement spending to replace damaged facilities or to take advantage
            of opportunities to implement longer-range plans.
9.12. Policy : Critical Facilities Locations
          A. The following City facilities that are necessary for community function and emergency response will not

9.13. Policy : Emergency Access and Evacuation
      Substantial development will be allowed only where multiple routes of road access can be provided, consistent
      with other General Plan policies on development location and open space protection. “Substantial development”
      means industrial, commercial, and institutional uses, multifamily housing, and more than ten single-family
      dwellings. ”Multiple routes” include vehicle connections that provide emergency access only, as well as public
      and private streets.
Discussion
        The City has determined that its roadway policies and standards provide adequate opportunities for evacuation
        and emergency access, considering the conditions and types of development planned for the city. Policies on
        connectivity are found in the Land Use Element (policies 2.2.4 and 2.3.11). Design standards are found in the
        Circulation Element (Table 5) and Subdivision Regulations (Municipal Code Chapter 16.36, Article II). When this
        Safety Element was last revised, some areas that were developed before the current policies and standards
        were adopted did not have the desired access. Those areas and proposed access improvements are listed
        below.
                                                 Proposed Access Improvements
          Area                   Deficiency                                Proposed Improvement
          Royal Way              One way out to Los Osos Valley Road       Emergency access only at Quail Drive,
                                 for about 200 dwellings, 25 of which      through the DeVaul Ranch project
                                 are adjacent to an area of moderate
                                 wildland fire hazard.
          Margarita Avenue       One way out to South Higuera Street       Public streets and emergency-drive access
                                 for about 250 dwellings                   through future development in the
                                                                           Margarita Specific Plan Area.
          Los Verdes Tracts      One way out to Los Osos Valley Road       None proposed, due to “enclave” design of
                                 for two tracts each with 88 dwellings,    tracts and creek channel. Future
                                 and one way out to South Higuera          development west of the Los Osos Valley
                                 Street for one tract with 93 dwellings,   Road tracts may provide an opportunity for
                                 under an aircraft climb-out path          emergency-only access.
          Chumash Village        One way out to South Higuera Street       Potential for an emergency-only access to
          Mobile Home Park       for 239 dwellings.                        the east through the Margarita Specific
                                                                           Plan Area is being evaluated.
          Villa Fontana          One way out to South Higuera Street       None proposed, due to “enclave” design of
                                 for 54 dwellings.                         tract, topography and adjacent
                                                                           development.
9.14. Policy: Preparedness Education
      Citizens should be well informed of hazards and ways to minimize the effects of disasters. Special attention
      should be given to children, seniors, and handicapped.

9.15. Program : Citizen Information and Training
           A. The City will help inform homeowners about local fire hazards, appropriate responses to fire, and ways to
               prevent loss, including home improvements that can reduce the impact of fire.
           B. The City will promote the efforts of the Fire Safe Council.
           C. The City will continue the Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) training as effective preparation
               for residents to aid themselves when needs exceed the availability of professional emergency response
               workers.
           D. The City will support education programs in the lower grades, using displays and demonstrations to
               inform young children about fire safety, and in secondary schools, demonstrating the dynamic aspects of
               fire, including major factors contributing to fire hazard and the relationship of fire to the natural ecology.
               Fire prevention and evacuation lessons will be included in each program.
9.16. Program : Other Organizations
      The City will help organizations that provide emergency outreach and education programs in the area, will help
      schools teach children how to avoid dangers and how to behave during an emergency, and will encourage other
      organizations dealing with large groups (such as seniors and handicapped) to develop their own emergency
      education and response programs.
9.17. Program : Voluntary Inspections
      The City will encourage and participate in programs to inspect individual houses, particularly those occupied by
      the elderly or handicapped, including encouraging occupants to check their own smoke detectors.
9.18. Policy : Safety of Structures and Facilities
      Existing and new structures and facilities should reflect adopted safety standards.
9.19. Program : Reducing Structural Hazards
      The City will identify and evaluate hazards in existing structures and work toward reducing those hazards to
      acceptable levels of risk. The City will advocate that other organizations and agencies do the same. Highest
      priority will be given to critical facilities (listed in Policy 8.3) and transportation facilities. This overall effort has
      five basic components:
           A. The City’s continuing steps to evaluate, maintain, and replace its own facilities, in particular bridges,
               public assembly rooms, fire stations, water tanks, and water and wastewater treatment plants.
           B. Routine inspections for code compliance in commercial, industrial, public-assembly, group-housing, and
               multifamily residential buildings.
           C. Complaint-based inspections for code compliance in all buildings.
           D. Implementation of the City-adopted program to identify and mitigate hazards of unreinforced masonry
               buildings.
           E. Subject to adequate resources being provided through the budget process, outreach for private, wood-
               frame buildings involving attachments to adequate foundations, cripple-wall bracing, water-heater
               attachment, and bracing or attachment of masonry chimneys.
9.20. Program : Planning Standards
      The City will maintain and administer its zoning and subdivision standards and architectural guidelines in
      conformance with the General Plan. The standards and guidelines will be consistent with the requirements and
      recommendations of City police and fire departments.

9.21. Program : Development Review
      City fire, police, public works, and utilities personnel will review applications for subdivisions and development
      projects, for consistency with safety objectives.
9.22. Program : Building and Fire Regulations
      The City will maintain and administer its building and fire regulations in conformance with State requirements,
      including adoption of updated editions of uniform codes.
9.23. Program : Required Inspections
      The City will conduct safety inspections for fire and hazardous materials in commercial, industrial, and multifamily
      residential buildings.

                                                       Conservation and Open Space Element
                                                                                                               
                                              1.       Introduction
1.0. Background.
     In the early 1970s, the California Legislature made the open space
     element and conservation element mandatory parts of a general plan.
     San Luis Obispo adopted its first conservation element and its first open
     space element separately in 1973. Both elements guide the use and
     protection of various resources to meet community needs and purposes.
     They reflect consensus and compromise among a wide range of citizens’
     preferences, within a framework set by State law.
     The Open Space Element was extensively revised and expanded in 1994,
     mainly to address protection of creeks, plants and wildlife. The City
                                                                                   Hikers enjoying one of the City’s many
     adopted its optional Energy Conservation Element in 1981 and its optional open spaces and trails.
     Water and Wastewater Management Element in 1987. The 1994 update
     of the Land Use Element contained detailed policies on protection of archaeological and historical resources. The
     1994 update of the Circulation Element established many policies on alternatives to single-occupant vehicle trips,
     which affect air quality and energy use. The Circulation Element also contained a section on roads and scenic
     resources. The 2004 Housing Element update also contains policies on energy, water and materials conservation.
     This Conservation and Open Space Element (COSE) combines and revises material from the previous
     Conservation, Open Space and Energy conservation elements, as well as from parts of the land use and housing
     elements, and the Scenic Roadways section of the Circulation Element. Why combine general plan elements?
     For several reasons: ease of use, to eliminate redundancy and maintain consistency, to group like policies for
     emphasis, and to address related community issues more comprehensively in one element. Combining and
     integrating related general plan policies in this manner is allowed for and encouraged by State law. All general
     plan elements carry equal weight, and policy repetition or redundancy conveys no added legitimacy or legal
     standing.
     While inevitably some overlap remains among the General Plan elements, the Conservation and Open Space
     Element emphasizes protection of natural resources associated with land that is not developed with urban uses:
     open space for farming, wildlife habitat, scenery, water supply and separation between cities. It also addresses air
     and water quality, energy sources and conservation, materials recycling, minerals and cultural resources. Other
     General Plan elements will be amended for consistency with the Conservation and Open Space Element and may
     still contain policies which address open space or conservation topics as part of other City objectives. For
     example, the Land Use Element focuses on the types and intensities of development on land designated for urban
     uses. The Safety Element is concerned mainly with avoiding hazards from fire, flood, unstable land and aircraft
     flights, in areas where agriculture and natural landscape are often the most appropriate uses. The Parks and
     Recreation Element consists of plans for indoor and outdoor recreational facilities primarily for active recreational
     uses, such as parks, playfields and community centers.

1.1. Use of Terms
     In the General Plan, a goal is a desired end state or condition that the community wants to achieve. A policy
     describes an approach to achieving a goal. A program is a specific action the City intends to take to implement
     policy. Numbering of goals, policies and programs is for ease of reference and does not imply relative importance
     unless so stated. As used here, the terms “shall” or “will” are mandatory and mean that an action shall be taken
     or procedure followed without exception. “Should” means that such an action or procedure will be followed
     unless there are significant, countermanding reasons or factors that prevent or discourage implementation. The
     terms “encourage”, “promote” and “support” are permissive and indicate a desirable, but not a mandatory
     action. They indicate intent to take action but are not linked to a specific time frame or work program.
1.2. Purpose
     San Luis Obispo residents are justly proud of their rich and diverse
     environmental setting. Creeks, hills, morros, valleys and farmland
     create a striking landscape which is home to a wide variety of plants
     and animals. These natural gifts form a distinctive city backdrop and
     help maintain the overall quality of life for all to enjoy. And unlike
     many other heavily urbanized areas, San Luis Obispo’s environmental
     character and diversity remains. However, the City and region’s
     special character is threatened by development pressure that
     incrementally degrades special geographical, biological, geological
     and other natural resources.
     The Conservation and Open Space Element is a tool to protect and
     preserve these unique community resources. Its overarching goal is
     to protect resources (such as air and water, wildlife habitat, scenic
     and agricultural lands, watershed and historic features) with a
     secondary goal of accommodating passive recreation where it will
     not harm the environment or interfere with agricultural operations.
     San Luis Obispo’s environmental quality is a precious gift. When
     surveyed, City residents have repeatedly placed open space and
     environmental conservation high on the list of community goals,
     values and priorities. Thus, conservation and open space acquisition Reservoir Canyon Waterfall
     are values that strongly influence City decision-making and
     operations. This Element reaffirms and clarifies the Community’s on-going commitment to these values.
1.3. How This Element is Organized
     The Conservation and Open Space Element encompasses a broad range of relatively complex issues and policies.
     Preparing a document which is both comprehensive and enjoyable to read has been a key objective in this effort.
     To maintain brevity without sacrificing content, policies and programs have been condensed and combined
     where possible without changing their meaning or effect. Narratives and detailed discussions of issue areas have
     been minimized, with maps, tables and other graphics used in lieu of text where possible. Lastly, expanded
     Glossary and References sections have been included for those wishing to delve into greater detail. Each chapter
     begins with an introduction, including a brief discussion of topics covered, how it pertains to San Luis Obispo, and
     why it’s important. This is followed by goals and policies for that resource, and finally, a list of programs which
     the City will undertake. Goals, policies and programs are grouped for easy reference and all carry equal “weight.”
     They are not listed in order of priority unless so stated.

                                                       Conservation and Open Space Element
                                                                                                             
1.4. Public Participation
     The COSE update has involved extensive public outreach and public hearings. Work on updating the
     Conservation, Energy Conservation and Open Space Elements began in 1998. In 2003, after several years of work
     and at least 10 public hearings, the August 2002 Draft Conservation and Open Space Element was put on hold
     due to Planning Commission and citizen concerns with the draft element and the public participation process. At
     the City Council’s direction, work on the draft began anew in fall 2004 with a series of public “visioning”
     workshops to identify key issues to be addressed.
     After restarting the update process in September 2004, the Commission held three public workshops and 11
     televised public hearings. In addition, community input was solicited through direct mailings to stakeholder
     individuals, groups and agencies, newspaper ads, individual interviews with stakeholders, and the City’s website.
     Project goals, workshop results, staff reports, revised drafts and other information were posted on the City’s
     website to help reach a wider audience. During the update process, staff met with various individual and group
     stakeholders, including ECOSLO, Santa Lucia Chapter of the Sierra Club, San Luis Obispo Chamber of Commerce,
     San Luis Obispo County Land Conservancy and SLO Green Build. Community Development Department staff
     worked closely with the Natural Resources Manager, Dr. Neil Havlik, in preparing the COSE and in meeting and
     working with stakeholders.
     Through three draft elements, Planning Commissioners, citizens and staff spent hundreds of hours reviewing and
     revising three successive drafts and related background information. During 14 public meetings, the Commission
     took public testimony, reviewed the revised drafts in detail, and refined the draft goals developed at the earlier
     workshops. At its February 8, 2006 meeting, the Planning Commission voted unanimously to recommend that
     the City Council: 1) approve a negative declaration of environmental impact on the new Element and related
     General Plan amendments, 2) adopt the March 2006 “City Council Hearing Draft”, and 3) amend the General Plan
     for consistency. Throughout the eight-year process, many citizens’ comments have shaped and improved the
     final document. Their important contributions are acknowledged and are sincerely appreciated.
     This final Element includes many changes from the August 2002 draft. It includes new goals, policies and
     programs in response to citizen and Planning Commission comments, plus significant changes and additions
     primarily in the sections on energy, materials, natural communities and open space. It also includes new and
     updated graphics and maps based on the most current information available. Besides content changes, this draft
     also has a new format, organization and style to make it easier to use and find information on specific topics.
     New maps and graphics were added to highlight key issues and add visual interest. In summary, the Conservation
     and Open Space Element represents a significantly broader and bolder statement of the City’s role in
     conservation and open space combined into a single, primary policy document.
1.5. What’s New in this Element
     This new Element is intended to:
           Update and combine relevant conservation and open space policies from several General Plan elements
            into one document so they are easier to find and use.
           Add to or expand policies and programs in response to changing community needs and issues.
           Establish the City of San Luis Obispo as a leader in the fields of conservation, environmental sustainability
            and open space preservation.
           New conservation and open space policies and programs have been included to address comments
            expressed by Planning Commissioners, the public and community specialists.

     These include:
          Increased protection of archaeological sites, historically and architecturally significant buildings and other
           cultural features that contribute to “sense of place”
          Monitoring programs for air and water quality, and for natural populations
          Requirements for wildlife corridors to be incorporated into the design of major roadways
          Preparation of a Strategic Energy Resource Plan to promote sustainability in City services and facilities
          “Green Building” standards to encourage energy efficiency in new private and public buildings
          Incentives for private development projects that incorporate sustainable “green building” technologies
          Passive recreational uses of open space where compatible with other open space and ecological objectives
          Exterior lighting design standards to prevent light pollution and preserve nighttime sky views, while
           enhancing public safety and lighting efficiency
          Streetscape corridor design standards to enhance the visual quality, function and safety of major streets
          Increased emphasis on preservation of the Morros
          Revised greenbelt boundary to expand open space buffers around the City and more closely reflect natural
           viewsheds, watersheds and geographic features like valleys, ridgelines and peaks
          The Ahwahnee Principles
1.6. The Ahwahnee Principles
     In 2005, the Council adopted Resolution No. 9689, dedicating the City to the Ahwahnee Principles and the
     Ahwahnee Water Principles, Chapter 10.22.2. The City believes these principles are the foundation of a safe,
     environmentally healthy and life-sustaining community, and intends to incorporate these principles into its
     General Plan and all future updates of the General Plan. These principles are hereby incorporated into and shall
     guide the interpretation of this Element:
       1. All planning should be in the form of complete and integrated communities containing housing, shops,
           workplaces, schools, parks and civic facilities essential to the daily life of the residents.
       2. Community size should be designed so that housing, jobs, daily needs and other activities are within easy
           walking distance of each other.
       3. As many activities as possible should be located within easy walking distance of transit stops.
       4. A community should contain a diversity of housing types to enable citizens from a wide range of economic
           levels and age groups to live within its boundaries
       5. Businesses within the community should provide a range of job types for the community's residents.
       6. The location and character of the community should be consistent with a larger transit network.
       7. The community should have a center focus that combines commercial, civic, cultural and recreational uses.
       8. The community should contain an ample supply of specialized open spaces in the form of squares, greens
           and parks whose frequent use is encouraged through placement and design.
       9. Public spaces should be designed to encourage the attention and presence of people at all hours of the day
           and night.
       10. Each community or cluster of communities should have a well-defined edge, such as agricultural greenbelts
           or wildlife corridors, permanently protected from development.

11. Streets, pedestrian paths and bike paths should contribute to a system of fully connected and interesting
    routes to all destinations. Their design should encourage pedestrian and bicycle use by being small and
    spatially defined by buildings, trees and lighting, and by discouraging high-speed traffic.
12. Wherever possible, the natural terrain, drainage and vegetation of the community should be preserved
    with superior examples contained within parks or greenbelts.
13. The community design should help conserve resources and minimize waste.
14. Communities should provide for the efficient use of water through the use of natural drainage, drought
    tolerant landscaping and recycling.
15. The street orientation, placement of buildings and use of shading should contribute to the energy
    efficiency of the community.

Air
2.0.     Background
         We live at the bottom of a relatively shallow “ocean of
         air” that sustains and protects us. While progress has
         been made in reducing toxic emissions from individual
         sources, growth in the number of sources and the
         accumulation of gasses that produce climate change
         are growing concerns. The City is located in an air
         basin that continues to be designated as a State non-
         attainment area for PM10 (fine particulate matter) air
         pollution.
2.1.     Goals and Policies                                         An “inversion layer” is formed by stable air masses with different
                                                                    temperatures trapping pollutants. San Luis Obispo has one of the
                                                                    lowest inversion layers in the state
     2.1.1.   Goal air quality.
              Achieve and maintain air quality that supports health and enjoyment for those who live or work in the City
              and for visitors.
2.2.     Policies
     2.2.1.   Atmospheric change.
              City actions shall seek to minimize undesirable climate changes and deterioration of the atmosphere’s
              protective functions that result from the release of carbon dioxide and other substances.
     2.2.2.   Health standards.
              Air quality should meet State and Federal standards, whichever are more protective, for human health.
     2.2.3.   No decline.
              Air quality should not decline from levels experienced during the early 1990s, when the community’s growth
              capacity was last re-examined.
     2.2.4.   Promote walking, biking and use of public transit use to reduce dependency on motor vehicles.
              City actions shall seek to reduce dependency on gasoline- or diesel powered motor vehicles and to encourage
              walking, biking and public transit use.
     2.2.5.   Model city.
              The City will be a model of pollution control efforts. It will manage its own operations to be as pollution free
              as possible. The City will work with other agencies and organizations to help educate citizens in ways to
              prevent air pollution.
2.3.     Programs
         The City will do the following in support of air quality, and will encourage individuals, organizations and other
         agencies to do likewise:
                                                           Page 6-12

                                                    Conservation and Open Space Element
                                                                                                           
2.3.1. Employ best available practices in City operations.
       “Best available practices” means behavior and technologies that produce the least air pollutants for a desired
       outcome, considering available equipment, life-cycle costs, social and environmental side effects and the
       regulations of other agencies. If the level of air pollution continues to exceed State or Federal standards, the
       City will consider modifying its General Plan to comply with the standards.
2.3.2. Air quality monitoring.
       Along with other agencies and organizations, the City will help the Air Pollution Control District implement
       the County Clean Air Plan. The City, working with involved agencies and organizations, will help implement
       programs to reduce the number of single occupant trips in gasoline and diesel-fueled vehicles, including
       restrictions on and alternatives to car access for California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo (Cal
       Poly) and Cuesta College. In addition, the City will monitor air quality as one measure of achieving
       environmental sustainability.
2.3.3. Alternative transportation/land use strategies.
       Implement public transit-, bicycle- and pedestrian-oriented land use and design strategies in new
       development, as described in the Land Use and Circulation Elements of the General Plan to reduce the
       number of single-occupant trips in fossil-fueled vehicles.
2.3.4. Alternative transportation incentives.
       Encourage Cal Poly students, faculty and staff, Cuesta College students, faculty and staff and San Luis Obispo
       County government employees to provide incentives for students and employees to use alternative
       transportation such as walking, public transit and bicycles, and disincentives to discourage single-occupant
       motor vehicle use. Examples of possible incentives may include flexible employee schedules, financial
       incentives for carpooling or use of public transit, preferential carpool parking and other similar measures.
2.3.5. General Plan amendment.
       If General Plan policies and programs, environmental mitigation measures required as conditions of
       development approvals, or other programs or incentives intended to offset significant air-quality impacts of
       growth prove to be ineffective, the City: 1) will consider amending its General Plan to reduce its
       development capacity and 2) will encourage other jurisdictions to reduce theirs so that air quality will not
       deteriorate to unacceptable levels due to growth.

                                                  3.       Cultural Heritage
Cultural Background
3.0.   Background
       San Luis Obispo is blessed with a rich heritage, as
       evidenced by many noteworthy archaeological
       sites and historical buildings. These cultural
       resources constitute a precious, yet fragile, legacy
       which contributes to San Luis Obispo’s unique
       “sense of place.”
       Before Europeans arrived on the central coast,
       native Chumash and Salinan people had lived in
       the area for centuries. While most reminders of
       these peoples are now gone, evidence of their
       presence remains in various archaeological,
       historical and spiritual sites throughout the City.
       These sites should be respectfully protected,             San Luis Obispo, circa 1890
       preserved and studied. The Town of San Luis
       Obispo began with the founding of Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa in 1772. Since then, the community has
       experienced many changes. The older buildings, historic sites and landscape features that remain help us
       understand the changes and maintain a sense of continuity. The City wants to preserve these cultural resources –
       tangible reminders of earlier days in San Luis Obispo.
       Starting in the early 1980s, the City of San Luis Obispo inaugurated a program formalizing and adopting policies to
       address historic and prehistoric cultural resources. The first of the City’s historic districts was formed, and the
       City Council created the Cultural Heritage Committee (CHC). The City subsequently adopted numerous policies in
       its General Plan that addressed the preservation and protection of historic and prehistoric resources. About 700
       historic residential and commercial buildings continue to give the community its “historic” character and charm,
                                                                   while adapting to owners’ changing uses and needs.
                                                                   After two decades, the City has made important strides

         feeling the effects of growth and intensification due to contemporary development which often dwarfs or lacks
         the grace of older homes it replaces. Commercial areas are also feeling the impact of a changing economy with
         new uses, development patterns and economic realities.
         Underutilized sites with historic resources are often prime targets for redevelopment projects, with the resulting
         loss of those resources. Moreover, some cultural resources have been lost due to unclear or conflicting public
         policies, incomplete information and the lack of funding. The loss of significant historic, cultural and
         archaeological resources can reduce the community’s uniqueness and make it a less desirable place in which to
         live, work or visit.
         As San Luis Obispo enters the 21st century, it is prudent to look into the future to anticipate problems which may
         lie ahead. We have already experienced some of these same pressures, and it is reasonable to expect that we
         will continue to face similar challenges in the near future. Through its General Plan policies and related
         implementation measures, the City intends to help balance cultural resource preservation with other community
         goals.
3.1.     Goals and Policies
3.2.     Historical and architectural resources.
         The City will expand community understanding, appreciation and support for historic and architectural resource
         preservation to ensure long-term protection of cultural resources.
3.3.     Policies
     3.3.1.   Historic preservation.
              Significant historic and architectural resources should be identified, preserved and rehabilitated.
     3.3.2.   Demolitions.
              Historically or architecturally significant buildings shall not be demolished or substantially changed in
              outward appearance, unless doing so is necessary to remove a threat to health and safety and other means
              to eliminate or reduce the threat to acceptable levels are infeasible.
     3.3.3.   Historical documentation.
              Buildings and other cultural features that are not historically significant but which have historical or
              architectural value should be preserved or relocated where feasible. Where preservation or relocation is not
              feasible, the resource shall be documented and the information retained in a secure but publicly accessible
              location. An acknowledgment of the resource should be incorporated within the site through historic signage
              and the reuse or display of historic materials and artifacts.
     3.3.4.   Changes to historic buildings.
              Changes or additions to historically or architecturally significant buildings should be consistent with the
              original structure and follow the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Buildings.
              New buildings in historical districts, or on historically significant sites, should reflect the form, spacing and
              materials of nearby historic structures. The street appearance of buildings which contribute to a
              neighborhood's architectural character should be maintained.
     3.3.5.   Historic districts and neighborhoods.
              In evaluating new public or private development, the City shall identify and protect neighborhoods or
              districts having historical character due to the collective effect of Contributing or Master List historic
              properties.

3.4.     Archeological resources.
         The City will expand community understanding, appreciation and support for archaeological resource
         preservation.
3.5.     Policies
     3.5.1.  Archaeological resource protection.
             The City shall provide for the protection of both known and
             potential archaeological resources. To avoid significant damage
             to important archaeological sites, all available measures,
             including purchase of the property in fee or easement, shall be
             explored at the time of a development proposal. Where such
             measures are not feasible and development would adversely
             affect identified archaeological or paleontological resources,
             mitigation shall be required pursuant to the Archaeological
             Resource Preservation Program Guidelines.
     3.5.2.  Native American sites.
             All Native American cultural and archaeological sites shall be
             protected as open space wherever possible.
     3.5.3.  Non-development activities.
             Activities other than development which could damage or
             destroy archaeological sites, including off-road vehicle use on or
             adjacent to known sites, or unauthorized collection of artifacts,
             shall be prohibited.                                                   Rehabilitation of the Historic Michael Righetti
                                                                                    House
     3.5.4.  Archaeologically sensitive areas.
             Development within an archaeologically sensitive area shall require a preliminary site survey by a qualified
             archaeologist knowledgeable in Native American cultures, prior to a determination of the potential
             environmental impacts of the project.
     3.5.5.  Archaeological resources present.
             Where a preliminary site survey finds substantial archaeological resources, before permitting construction,
             the City shall require a mitigation plan to protect the resources. Possible mitigation measures include:
             presence of a qualified professional during initial grading or trenching; project redesign; covering with a layer
             of fill; excavation, removal and curation in an appropriate facility under the direction of a qualified
             professional.
     3.5.6.  Qualified archaeologist present.
             Where substantial archaeological resources are discovered during construction or grading activities, all such
             activities in the immediate area of the find shall cease until a qualified archaeologist knowledgeable in Native
             American cultures can determine the significance of the resource and recommend alternative mitigation
             measures.
     3.5.7.  Native American participation.
             Native American participation shall be included in the City's guidelines for resource assessment and impact
             mitigation. Native American representatives should be present during archaeological excavation and during
             construction in an area likely to contain cultural resources. The Native American community shall be
             consulted as knowledge of cultural resources expands and as the City considers updates or significant
             changes to its General Plan.

     3.5.8.  Protection of Native American cultural sites.
             The City will ensure the protection of archaeological sites that may be culturally significant to Native
             Americans, even if they have lost their scientific or archaeological integrity through previous disturbance;
             sites that may have religious value, even though no artifacts are present; and sites that contain artifacts
             which may have intrinsic value, even though their archaeological context has been disturbed.
     3.5.9.  Archaeological site records.
             The City shall establish and maintain archaeological site records about known sites. Specific archaeological
             site information will be kept confidential to protect the resources. The City will maintain, for public use,
             generalized maps showing known areas of archaeological sensitivity.
     3.5.10. Sunny Acres.
             Sufficient acreage should be provided around Sunny Acres to enable use of the property for a community
             center, urban garden, natural history museum and adjoining botanical garden, or similar uses.
     3.5.11. Southern Pacific Water Tower.
             The historic Southern Pacific Water Tower and adjoining City-owned land shall be maintained as open space
             or parkland.
     3.5.12. Cultural resources and open space.
             Within the city limits the City should require, and outside the city limits should encourage the County to
             require, public or private development to do the following where archaeological or historical resources are
             protected as open space or parkland:
                1. Preserve such resources through easements or dedications. Subdivision parcel lines or easements shall
                     be located to optimize resource protection. Easements as a condition of development approval shall
                     be required only for structural additions or new structures, not for accessory structures or tree
                     removal permits. If a historic or archaeological resource is located within an open space parcel or
                     easement, allowed uses and maintenance responsibilities within that parcel or easement shall be
                     clearly defined and conditioned prior to map or project approval.
                2. Designate such easements or dedication areas as open space or parkland as appropriate.
                3. Maintain such resources by prohibiting activities that may significantly degrade the resource.
3.6.     Programs.
         The City will do the following to protect cultural resources, and will encourage others to do so, as appropriate.
     3.6.1.  Cultural Heritage Committee.
             A. The City’s Cultural Heritage Committee will:
                1. Help identify, and advise on suitable treatment for archaeological and historical resources.
                2. Develop information on historic resources.
                3. Foster public awareness and appreciation of cultural resources through means such as tours, a web
                     site, identification plaques and awards.
                4. Provide recognition for preservation and restoration efforts.
                5. Communicate with other City bodies and staff concerning cultural resource issues.
                6. Provide guidance to owners to help preservation and restoration efforts.
                7. Review new development to determine consistency with cultural resource preservation guidelines or
                     standards.

  3.6.2.  Financial assistance and incentives.
          The City will participate in financial assistance programs, such as low-interest loans and property tax
          reduction programs that encourage maintenance and restoration of historic properties.
  3.6.3.  Construction within historic districts.
          The Cultural Heritage Committee and Architectural Review Commission will provide specific guidance on the
          construction of new buildings within historic districts.
  3.6.4.  Post-disaster Historic Preservation.
          The City will be prepared to assess the condition of historic buildings that may be damaged by disasters and
          to foster their restoration whenever feasible.
  3.6.5.  Archaeological resource preservation standards.
          The City will maintain standards concerning when and how to conduct archaeological surveys, and the
          preferred methods of preserving artifacts.
  3.6.6.  Educational programs.
          The City will foster public awareness and appreciation of cultural resources by sponsoring educational
          programs, by helping to display artifacts that illuminate past cultures and by encouraging private
          development to include historical and archaeological displays where feasible and appropriate.
  3.6.7.  Partnering for preservation.
          The City will partner with agencies, non-profit organizations and citizens groups to help identify, preserve,
          rehabilitate and maintain cultural resources.
  3.6.8.  Promote adaptive reuse of historic buildings.
          The City will, consistent with health, safety and basic land-use policies, apply building and zoning standards
          within allowed ranges of flexibility, to foster continued use and adaptive reuse of historic buildings.
  3.6.9.  City-owned adobes and historic structures.
          The City will preserve and, as resources permit, rehabilitate City-owned historic adobes and other historic
          structures by aggressively seeking grants, donations, private-sector participation or other techniques that
          help fund rehabilitation and adaptive reuse.
  3.6.10. Cultural Heritage Committee Whitepaper.
          The City will implement the recommendations of the Cultural Heritage Committee’s “Whitepaper”, including
          the adoption of a historic preservation ordinance.

4.0.     Background
         Our dependence on fossil fuels makes it difficult to avoid air and
         water pollution and economic uncertainty. One of the best things
         we can do for our environmental and economic well-being is to use
         energy more efficiently and shift to cleaner, renewable, locally
         controlled energy sources. While the City has made significant
         progress in energy conservation in recent years, more can be done
         through emerging technologies and increased emphasis on
         “sustainable” practices and building design in both public and
         private development.
4.1.     Goals and Policies
4.2.     Goal. Sustainable energy use.
         Increase use of sustainable energy sources such as solar, wind and
         thermal energy, and reduce reliance on non-sustainable energy
         sources to the extent possible with available technology and
         resources.
4.3.     Policies
                                                                                  Natural gas co-generation equipment at Sinsheimer
     4.3.1.  Use of best available practices.
                                                                                  Pool saves City residents energy and money by

             likewise. “Best available practices” means behavior and
             technologies that reflect recommendations of specialists and
             that use the least energy for a desired outcome, considering available equipment, life-cycle costs, social and
             environmental side effects, and the regulations of other agencies. Best available practices include use of
             sustainable sources. Sustainable sources are naturally renewed in a relatively short time and avoid
             substantial undesirable side effects. Table 1 summarizes Sustainable Energy Sources.

     4.3.3.    Energy-efficiency improvements.
               The City will continue to identify energy efficiency improvement measures to the greatest extent possible,
               undertake all necessary steps to seek funding for their implementation and, upon securing availability of
               funds, implement the measures in a timely manner.
     4.3.4.    Use of energy efficient, renewable energy sources.
               The City will promote the use of cost effective, renewable, non-depleting energy sources wherever possible,
               both in new construction projects and in existing buildings and facilities.
     4.3.5.    Cooperation with other entities.
               The City will cooperate with Federal, State and local governments and other appropriate entities to
               accomplish energy conservation objectives throughout the state, and inform employees, its contractors, staff
               and the general public of the need for and methods of energy conservation.
     4.3.6.    Energy efficiency and Green Building in new development.
               The City shall encourage energy-efficient “green buildings” as certified by the U.S. Green Building Council’s
               LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Program or equivalent certification, as further
               described in Chapter 5.5.7.
     4.3.7.    City Form.
               The City’s form will support energy efficiency and the use of sustainable energy sources.
4.4.     Policies
     4.4.1.    Pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly design.
               Residences, work places and facilities for all other activities will be located and designed to promote travel by
               pedestrians and bicyclists. (Also see the Land Use and Circulation Elements)
     4.4.2.    Alternative transportation.
               The City’s transportation and circulation systems shall foster travel by modes other than motor vehicles,
               including walking, bicycles and public transit. (See also the Community Trip Reduction Policies in the
               Circulation Element)

     4.4.3.  Compact, high-density housing.
             The City will promote higher-density, compact housing to achieve more efficient use of public facilities and
             services, land resources, and to improve the jobs/housing balance.
     4.4.4.  GOAL. Solar access.
             Encourage the provision for and protection of solar access.
4.5.     Policies
     4.5.1.  Solar access standards.
             To encourage use of solar energy, reasonable solar access shall be provided and protected. The City will
             protect reasonable solar exposure for existing collectors and likely locations of future collectors, both active
             and passive. Standards for the subdivision and development of property should assure desirable solar access,
             as described in Table 2. Protection beyond that established by the City may be provided by recorded
             agreement among private parties.

     4.5.2.  Subdivision design for solar access.
             In subdivisions, the layout of streets and lots shall provide and protect solar exposure. To assure maximum
             control over potential shading features, the longest dimension of each lot should be oriented within 30
             degrees of south, unless the subdivider demonstrates that for certain lots any of the following applies:
             A. The lots are large enough to allow desirable solar access, regardless of lot orientation.
             B. Buildings will be constructed as part of the tract development, and the buildings will be properly
                  orientated, with adequate solar access.
                                                           Page 6-23

Chapter 6
         C. Topography makes variations from the prescribed orientation desirable to reduce grading or tree
              removal, or to take advantage of a setting that would favor greater reliance on early morning or late
              afternoon solar exposure.
         D. Topographical conditions, such as steep, north-facing slopes or shading by the mass of a hill, make solar
              energy use infeasible.
         E. The size of the subdivision, combined with the existing orientation of surrounding streets and lots,
              precludes desirable lot orientation.
  4.5.3. Solar Access Easements.
         Solar access easements will be required in all new subdivisions, as provided in the State of California Solar
         Rights Act, unless any of the following applies:
         A. The subdivision incorporates a building development plan that will assure desirable solar access.
         B. Desirable solar exposure will be protected by the City’s Zoning Regulations.
         C. The subdivision establishes yard or height standards designed to assure desirable solar access,
              supplementary to the Zoning Regulations, which would make a system of easements for each lot
              unnecessary.
  4.5.4. Solar collector placement.
         When solar collectors are proposed as part of a development, the development plan will locate solar
         collectors and include features to assure adequate solar access.
  4.5.5. Solar access exceptions.
         Exceptions to the standards for desirable solar access may be made if any of the following applies:
         A. Shading would be an insignificant part of the total solar exposure, in terms of area, duration or both.
         B. Structures on protected properties have an insignificant probability of being modified or replaced, and
              likely collector locations are sufficiently protected, in spite of shading that would normally be
              unacceptable, or such structures already have adequately protected collectors.
         C. Shading is between lots in a subdivision for which a customized system of solar access easements will
              provide an adequate level of protection.
         D. Use of solar energy is unfeasible due to topographical conditions.
  4.5.6. Solar collector appearance.
         The following design standards shall apply to solar collectors:
         E. Solar collectors should be compatible with the appearance of the structures that contain or support
              them. Features of compatibility are:
              1. Location within the dominant lines of the building or roof.
              2. Rooftop collectors match the roof plane as closely as practical; ends of mounting racks covered with
                   an architecturally compatible material.
              3. Exposed mechanical, plumbing and structural components minimized; where visible, color is the
                   same as roof, or a compatible color.
              4. Location minimizes need to remove trees.
              5. Where glare cannot be avoided by location or orientation, surface has low reflectivity.

            A. Retrofitting buildings with solar collectors should be subject
                 to the lowest level of discretionary review that will
                 implement City policies. Within historic districts or for
                 historically designated sites or buildings, such projects may
                 be referred to the Cultural Heritage Committee.
     4.5.7.   Unwanted solar heat gain.
              Sites and buildings should be designed to avoid unwanted
              heat gain from solar exposure. Features that provide shading
              at suitable times of the day and year and generally should be
              “passive” or automatic, avoiding the need for occupants to
              regularly monitor or adjust them.                                 Roof-mounted photovoltaic panels produce
                                                                                electricity which helps meet the Ludwick

              The City will do the following in support of energy
              sustainability, and will encourage others to do so, as appropriate.
     4.6.1.   Efficient City energy use.
              Manage City operations for energy efficiency, including purchase and use of vehicles, equipment and
              materials.
              A. Outdoor and indoor lighting.
              B. Space conditioning and water heating.
              C. Vehicles, travel and traffic flow.
              D. Office equipment.
     4.6.2.   Manage City operations for energy self-reliance.
              Manage City operations for energy self-reliance and production of sustainable energy, consistent with
              primary functions such as public safety, water supply and wastewater treatment.
     4.6.3.   Sustainable design in City facilities.
              Incorporate conservation and sustainable energy sources and features in existing and new City facilities.
     4.6.4.   Reduce obstacles to energy conservation.
              In its review and approval of new development, the City will seek to minimize unnecessary obstacles to
              energy conservation and encourage use of sustainable energy sources and technologies while promoting the
              economic benefits of conservation in its regulation of private activities. For example, the City will encourage
              new residential development to provide space for outdoor clothes drying, and will not allow private
              restrictions on doing so.
     4.6.5.   Encourage sustainable employee commuting practices.
              Encourage alternatives to employees commuting as occupants of individual vehicles powered by non-
              sustainable fuels.
     4.6.6.   Energy conservation education.
              Educate planning and building staff and citizen review bodies on energy conservation issues, including the
              City’s energy conservation policies, and instruct that they work with applicants to achieve the housing goals
              that conserve energy.
     4.6.7.   State Building Energy Standards.
              Administer the State’s building energy standards through its construction permit and inspection activities.
                                                              Page 6-25

Chapter 6
  4.6.8.  Energy-efficient project design.
          Encourage energy-efficient project design by emphasizing use of daylight and solar exposure, shading and
          natural ventilation, as opposed to designing a particular image and relying on mechanical systems to
          maintain functionality and comfort. Educate City staff, citizen advisers, developers and designers on ways to
          exceed minimum State energy standards.
  4.6.9.  Solar access for new development.
          Address solar access in all plans needing City discretionary approval, considering both structures and
          vegetation. Shading by vegetation is also subject to the California Solar Shade Control Act. This act prohibits
          the placement of vegetation that would shade a solar collector on another’s property, if the collector meets
          certain height and setback criteria. The City will advise those seeking permits for solar collectors to document
          vegetation existing when the collector is installed or built.
  4.6.10. Retrofit City facilities for energy savings.
          As funding allows, the City will retrofit existing City buildings with energy-saving features such as insulation,
          glazing and fluorescent lighting fixtures, and will participate in programs to encourage private property
          owners to do the same.
  4.6.11. Financial assistance for energy efficiency improvements.
          The City will actively seek all available sources of funding for implementing energy efficiency improvement
          and utilities infrastructure renewal projects, including federal and state budget appropriations, federal, state
          and private sector grant opportunities, utilities and other unique public/private sector financing
          arrangements.
  4.6.12. Monitor energy use.
          The City will monitor energy usage in major City facilities and prepare a system-wide biennial report on
          energy use and efficiency.
  4.6.13. Prepare energy plan.
          The City will prepare an energy plan leading to the long range reduction in the use of non-renewable
          resources and increased use of renewable resources in City services and facilities. Such a plan shall include
          standards for construction of new City buildings, public facilities’ maintenance, water conservation, solid
          waste management, and energy conservation strategies in City facilities. The plan will be implemented by all
          City departments.
  4.6.14. Adopt Green Building standards.
          The City will adopt an ordinance containing requirements and incentives for innovative, environmentally
          friendly (also known as “green” or “sustainable”) development and building projects. Examples of projects
          that may qualify for such incentives may include:
          A. Those incorporating innovative, technologically advanced energy-efficient design concepts significantly
               exceeding State of California Title 24 standards.
          B. Those utilizing “green” building materials and permaculture landscape concepts.
          C. Those containing specific, implementable and sustainable measures for reduced dependence on
               automobile parking demand.
          Possible development incentives to be considered in this ordinance could include density bonuses, setback
          variations, modified street standards, reduced parking standards or similar modifications to standard
          requirements

4.6.15. Consider City-owned green energy utility.
        As conditions and resources allow, the City may examine the potential to create a city-owned energy utility.
4.6.16. Promote technology and energy conservation businesses.
        The City’s Economic Development Manager should help establish the City as a center for conservation
        technology by working with other community organizations and individuals to attract and promote such
        businesses. This effort should build on existing community capacity and resources, such as that existing in
        local government, business groups, Cuesta College and at Cal Poly.
4.6.17. Require solar power for new dwellings.
        Within new single-family residential projects of 20 or more dwelling units, 5% of the total number of
        dwellings shall be built with photovoltaic solar collectors beginning in 2008; this percentage shall increase 4%
        each year until 2020. Multi-family residential developments shall be exempt from this requirement, except
        for common-use facilities such as recreation rooms, spas or swimming pools. In these cases, the common
        facilities shall be built with photovoltaic solar collectors.
4.6.18. County Air Pollution Control District support.
        Seek the support of the San Luis Obispo County Air Pollution Control District in calculating emission
        inventories and the development of balanced strategies for addressing climate protection through
        development of model ordinances and guidelines designed to meet the City’s goals.

                                                       5.       Materials
5.0.     Background
         Many commonly used materials have limited natural sources and
         few potential substitutes if they were to be depleted. Also,
         finished materials embody the energy used to extract, refine,
         form, and transport them. These processes typically involve some
         land disturbance and pollution at each step. Efficient materials
         use, reuse and recycling therefore represent energy savings and
         pollution avoidance. With encouragement from citizens and from
         state government, progress has been made in avoiding the one-
         time use and discard of materials.
         However, inefficient recycling efforts can add to resource
         consumption and pollution if materials with low utility must be
                                                                                     Curbside waste recycling and collection programs
         transported long distances or harmful components must be                    help reduce the amount of materials going to
         separated and disposed of.                                                  landfills and conserve valuable resources
         Several materials, notably metals and some types of glass and paper, have economic value that justifies their
         recycling. For other materials, market prices alone may not be enough to avoid disposal. Modern mass-
         production and consumption systems make it difficult for individuals and local governments to deal with the “life
         cycles” of complex products and wastes. But more can be done to imitate nature’s scheme for using the residue
         of one process as the raw material for another. Emerging ideas and technologies in “sustainable” building
         construction and operation offer the potential for more efficient use of finite resources, new business
         opportunities and enhanced public health.
5.1.     Goals and Policies
5.2.     GOAL: Efficient use of materials.
         The City will use materials efficiently in its buildings and facilities, services and operations, and encourage others
         to do the same
5.3.     GOAL: Minimize undesirable effects resulting from use of toxic or potentially toxic materials.
         The City will avoid and, where possible, stop using materials which cause secondary or indirect adverse
         environmental or health impacts.
5.4.     Policies
     5.4.1.   Best available practices.
              The City will employ the best available practices in materials procurement, use and recycling, and will
              encourage individuals, organizations and other agencies to do likewise. “Best available practices” means
              behavior and technologies that, considering available equipment, life-cycle costs, social and environmental
              side effects, and the regulations of other agencies:
              A. Use the least amount of newly refined materials for a desired outcome;
              B. Direct the largest feasible fraction of used materials to further use;
              C. Avoid undesirable effects due to further use of materials.

     5.4.2.   Material recycling in City facilities and operations.
              The City will set a community example for waste diversion and material recycling in City facilities, services
              and operating systems to achieve a goal of 100 percent recycling of paper, bottles and cans and require
              similar goals in contracts and procurement for public goods and services and capital improvements.
     5.4.3.   Material recycling in private development, businesses and operations.
              The City will promote waste diversion and material recycling in private development, business and
              operations, and will encourage businesses or nonprofit entities to provide building materials recycling and
              source reduction services.
5.5.     Programs
         The City will do the following in support of efficient materials use and recycling, and will encourage others to do
         so, as appropriate.
     5.5.1.   Efficient use of materials in City operations.
              The City will manage its operations for efficient materials use by:
              A. Substituting electronic information exchange for paper whenever feasible and cost effective.
              B. Reproducing paper documents as two-sided publications whenever cost effective
     5.5.2.   Promote City materials reuse and recycling.
              The City will manage its operations to foster reuse and recycling by:
              A. Avoiding use of inks, papers, and plastics that inhibit recycling or that produce pollutants in preparation
                   for recycling.
              B. Purchasing products incorporating recycled materials.
              C. Using plant trimmings for mulch and compost, while avoiding the introduction or spread of invasive, non-
                   native species and pathogens.
              D. Making wood from tree removal available for mulch, milling, pulping or heating, depending on its
                   characteristics and the volume available, while avoiding the introduction or spread of invasive, non-

                   consideration their eventual disposal.
              E. Producing biosolids (sewage sludge) suitable for land application as an agricultural fertilizer or soil
                   amendment, under scientific and health-based criteria.
     5.5.3.   Coordinate waste reduction and recycling efforts.
              The City will coordinate local, and participate in regional, household and business waste-reduction and
              recycling efforts.
     5.5.4.   Use materials with reduced environmental impacts.
              In its facilities and operations, the City will use materials and systems with reduced environmental impacts.
              The design team (architect/engineer) for new buildings and facilities shall recommend building materials and
              methods with life cycles (manufacture, installation, maintenance, repair and replacement) of reduced
              environmental impacts. Considerations will include energy efficiency; energy required in the manufacturing
              process; life-cycle duration; and maintenance and replacement costs.
     5.5.5.   Recycling businesses inventory.
              The City will maintain an inventory of current recycling businesses and services and make it available to the
              public.

  5.5.6. Expanded public education.
         The City will expand its public education outreach efforts to raise public awareness of energy and materials
         conservation goals, sustainable technology, benefits and incentives.
  5.5.7. Energy efficiency and Green Building in new development.
         The City shall encourage material and energy-efficient “green buildings” as certified by the U.S. Green
         Building Council’s LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Program or equivalent certification,
         as described below. (See also Chapter 4.6.14)
         “Green Building Checklist” defined: In the items below, “green building checklist” means the checklist of a
         green building certification system approved by the Community Development Department. For projects
         greater than 5,000 square feet of gross floor area, LEED is approved. For residential projects, LEED or the
         California Green Building Guidelines (with San Luis Obispo amendments) are approved.
         A. Submit Checklist:
              1. The applicant of any nonresidential project over 5000 square feet of gross floor area, or any
                   residential project with five or more dwelling units shall submit a completed green building checklist
                   to the Community Development Department. The applicant shall be encouraged to submit an
                   optional narrative describing how each credit will be achieved.
              2. The applicant for any other development project not included above shall be encouraged to submit a
                   completed green building checklist to the Community Development Department.
         B. CDD Comments:
         The Community Development Department shall provide non-mandatory comments in regards to the
         submitted green building checklist as appropriate
         C. Posting of Checklist:
              Completed green building checklists and optional narratives shall be posted for public education, to track
              success and to make useful information available to future building occupants.
         D. Checklist Goals:
              All projects listed above shall be encouraged to achieve a score that would allow at least the baseline
              certification level of that system, but strive for greater achievement. LEED or other outside certification
              is not required.
         E. Projects over 60,000 Square Feet:
              Developers of nonresidential projects greater than 60,000 square feet gross floor area, as further
              described in Chapter 17.40 of the Zoning Regulations, shall be encouraged to achieve at least a LEED
              Silver Certification from the US Green Building Council, or the equivalent rating using another approved
              green building certification system approved by the Community Development Department. One means
              of implementing this policy will be through development review of and Zoning Regulations regarding
              large commercial buildings.
         F.   City Projects:
              City-owned projects with a floor area of greater than 5,000 square feet gross floor area shall achieve at

                                                 6.      Native Materials
6.0.     Background
         Native minerals are those occurring in the San Luis Obispo
         area that have, or are expected to have, economic value.
         Sand, gravel and stone used in construction, and metal
         ores, are examples of economically valuable minerals.
         State guidelines and rules aim for continued accessibility to
         native minerals, while avoiding significant harm to the
         environment or human health from their extraction.
         In the past, quarries and mines in the San Luis Obispo area
         produced basaltic stone for masonry, “red rock” for road
         base and surfacing, and cinnabar, an ore of mercury. No
         quarry or mine operations are expected to be reactivated
         or initiated. In the 1980s, a petroleum company asked to
         explore City-owned land in the Lopez Lake area. The             In early San Luis Obispo, mines and quarries for cinnabar
         request was denied based on the environmental qualities         and other minerals were common in local hills
         of the area. Since that time, no other such requests have
         been received, and the City’s policy on mineral extraction
         within City limits has remained unchanged.
6.1.     Goals and Policies
6.2.     GOAL: Site reclamation.
         Achieve environmentally responsible reclamation of past mineral-extraction sites.
6.3.     Policies
     6.3.1.   Old mineral-extraction sites.
              The City will implement the following policies and will encourage other agencies with jurisdiction to do so:
              A. Land use designations for old mineral-extraction sites shall reflect risks associated with them, and should
                   generally be limited to “Open Space”, “Agriculture”, or “Park” designations on the Land Use Element
                   map.
              B. Previously active mineral-extraction sites should be secured and reclaimed in conjunction with any
                   development approvals for the land on which they are located. Securing them means preventing access
                   that entails unacceptable risk. Reclamation means re-establishing ground contours and vegetation to the
                   extent feasible, use of erosion control measures to enhance and protect soil stability, water and air
                   quality, wildlife habitat values and views.
6.4.     GOAL: Mining operations.
         Ensure environmentally responsible operation and reclamation of any mineral extraction that may occur in the
         San Luis Obispo planning area.

6.5.     Policies
     6.5.1.  Potential mineral-extraction sites.
             On sites with mineral-extraction potential, the City will:
             A. Prohibit mineral extraction within the city limits.
             B. Prohibit mineral extraction and surface entry for extraction of oil or gas within open space owned by the
                 City in fee or as an easement.
             C. Encourage other agencies with jurisdiction to permit mineral extraction only if significant impacts to
                 human health and the environment will be avoided and site restoration will be assured. Impacts to be
                 addressed include air and water quality, noise, habitat disruption, aesthetics and geologic stability. All
                 phases of the activity, including site access, must be addressed.

                                                             7.0.     Background
                                                             “Natural Communities” refers to the web of organisms, other
                                                             than people, that live in the area. Many of the physical
                                                             requirements for natural communities are provided by open
                                                             space. Natural communities give open space much of its value
                                                             for human enjoyment. Natural communities also have value in
                                                             their own right, independent of their role as sustainers of the
                                                             human community or as pleasant vistas. As urban uses expand
                                                             into open space, the natural cycles and interrelationships upon
                                                             which natural communities depend are altered. This results in
         Southern steelhead trout                            the disturbance, displacement, loss of habitat or mobility and
                                                             the loss of animal or plant populations. For example, each
         species requires a specific range of environmental conditions to survive and reproduce. Areas within this range
         constitute the species’ niche or more generally, habitat. Animals move within and through habitat areas to find
         water, food, shelter, and to reproduce. Such movements have evolved over time to fit animals’ needs within the
         natural landscape. Urban development and linear barriers such as major roadways change the landscape too
         quickly for many animals to adapt, thus interrupting and blocking such movement. As a result, wildlife
         populations are separated from their historic habitat and from other breeding populations of the same species.
         The result: a gradual reduction in the numbers and diversity of wildlife. As a steward for the natural resources of
         future generations, the City must preserve habitat and the species that it supports.
         San Luis Obispo is surrounded by extensive open space areas that provide habitat to many animal species. The
         City’s many creeks provide sheltered corridors that allow wildlife to move between habitats and open space
         areas. To help preserve natural communities, it is important to protect, improve and where appropriate and
         feasible, protect and re-establish these corridors.
7.1.     Goals and Policies
7.2.     GOAL: Sustainable natural populations.
         The City will maintain and enhance conditions necessary to enable a species to become self-sustaining. Within
         the San Luis Obispo planning area, the City will seek to achieve self-sustaining populations of the plants, fish and
         wildlife that made up the natural communities in the area when urbanization began.
7.3.     Policies
     7.3.1.   Protect listed species.
              A. The City will identify the location, habitat and buffer needs of species listed for protection. This
                   information will be developed by qualified people early in the planning and development review process.
              B. The City will establish and maintain records on the location of listed species. The City will maintain, for
                   public use, generalized maps showing known locations of listed species. Specific site information may be
                   kept confidential to protect the resources.
              C. The City will comply with State and Federal requirements for listed species.

                                              Conservation and Open Space Element
D. The City will protect listed species through its actions on: land-use designations; development standards;
   development applications; location, design, construction and maintenance of creeks, City roads and
   facilities; and on land that the City owns or manages.
E. City actions that could impact listed species shall be consistent with mitigation policies in Chapter 8.25.3.
   Subject to the approval of agencies with jurisdiction, the City may approve a project where mitigation
   requires relocation of listed species, but only if there is no practical alternative and relocation is limited
   to individuals or small parts of a larger population, not the entire remaining population of a species. (If an
   agency with jurisdiction determines that relocation of an entire population is needed for its survival
   regardless of a project’s development, the City will help with the relocation)
F. Species listed for protection” are:
   1. Classified by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as:
             a. “Endangered” - In danger of extinction
                  throughout all or a significant portion of its
                  range.
             b. “Threatened” - Likely to become endangered
                  without protection and management.
             c.   “Proposed Endangered” or “Proposed                      Local Bracken Fern species
                  Threatened” - Presently being considered for
                  endangered status.
             d. “Candidate, category 1” - U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has sufficient data to support listing
                  as endangered.
             e. “Candidate, category 2” - Needs U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service further data on threats.
   2. Classified by the California Department of Fish and Game as:
             a. “Endangered” - Prospects for survival are in immediate jeopardy.
             b. “Threatened” - Likely to become endangered without protection and management.
             c.   “Rare” - May become endangered if present environment worsens. (only refers to plants)
             d. “Species of Special Concern” - Are not rare on a State scale, but are found in limited
                  locations.
   3. Classified by the California Native Plant Society as:
             a. “List 1A, Plants of Highest Priority” - Presumed extinct in California.
             b. “List 1B, Plants of Highest Priority” - Plants rare and endangered in California and elsewhere.
             c.   “List 2” - Plants rare and endangered in California, but common elsewhere.
             d. “List 3” - Plants about which more information is needed.
             e. “List 4” - Plants of limited distribution (a watch list).
   4. Not listed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the California Department of Fish and Game or the
        California Native Plant Society, but which can be shown to meet the criteria of the California
        Environmental Quality Act Guidelines, Section 15380, “Endangered, Rare or Threatened Species.”

  7.3.2. Species of local concern.
         The City will:
         A. Maintain healthy populations of native species in the long term, even though they are not listed for
              protection under State or Federal laws. These “species of local concern” are at the limit of their range in
              San Luis Obispo, or threats to their habitat are increasing.
         B. Identify the location, habitat and buffer needs of species of local concern. This information will be
              developed by qualified people early in the planning and development review process. (These species are
              listed in Appendix A, which may be revised by the City’s Natural Resources Manager or other biological
              resource professional upon public notice. Anyone may nominate species for the list.)
         C. Protect species of local concern through: its actions on land use designations, development standards,
              development applications; the location, design, construction and maintenance of City facilities; land that
              the City owns or manages.
         D. Encourage individuals, organizations and other agencies to protect species of local concern within their
              areas of responsibility and jurisdiction.
         E. Protect sensitive habitat, including creeks, from encroachment by livestock and human activities.
  7.3.3. Wildlife habitat and corridors.
         Continuous wildlife habitat, including corridors free of human disruption, shall be preserved and where
         necessary, created by interconnecting open spaces, wildlife habitat and corridors. To accomplish this, the
         City will:
         A. Require public and private developments, including public works projects, to evaluate animal species and
              their movements within and through development sites and create habitats and corridors appropriate
              for wildlife.
         B. Plan for connectivity of open spaces and wildlife habitat and corridors using specific area plans,
              neighborhood plans, subdivision maps or other applicable planning processes, consistent with Open
              Space Guidelines.
         C. Coordinate with San Luis Obispo County and adjoining jurisdictions, federal and state agencies such as
              Caltrans to assure regional connectivity of open space and wildlife corridors.
         D. Preserve and expand links between open spaces and creek corridors, as shown in Figure 3.

7.4.     GOAL: Trees and other plants
         Protect, preserve and create the conditions that will promote the preservation of significant trees and other
         vegetation, particularly native California species.
7.5.     Policies
     7.5.1   Protection of significant trees.
             Significant trees, as determined by the City Council upon the recommendation of the Tree Committee,
             Planning or Architectural Review Committee, are those making substantial contributions to natural habitat or
             to the urban landscape due to their species, size, or rarity. Significant trees, particularly native species, shall
             be protected. Removal of significant trees shall be subject to the criteria and mitigation requirements in
             Chapter 8.6.3. Oak Woodland communities in the Greenbelt and in open space areas shall be protected.
     7.5.2.  Use of Native California plants in urban landscaping.
             Landscaping should incorporate native plant species, with selection appropriate for location.
     7.5.3.  Heritage Tree Program.
             The City will continue a program to designate and help protect “heritage trees.”
     7.5.4.  Preservation of grassland communities and other habitat types.
             Grassland communities and other habitat types in the Greenbelt and in designated open space areas shall be
             preserved.
     7.5.5.  Soil conservation and landform modification.
             Public and private development projects shall be designed to prevent soil erosion, minimize landform
             modifications to avoid habitat disturbance and conserve and reuse on-site soils.
     7.5.6.  Minimize synthetic or organic environmental toxins.
7.6.     Policies
     7.6.1.  Environmental toxins.
             The City will avoid the use of synthetic organic chemicals unless there is no practical alternative, and support
             use of integrated pest management techniques. When the use of a synthetic organic chemical cannot be
             avoided, the material shall be selective (its effect limited to the target species so far as possible), and it shall
             be applied selectively.

7.7.     Programs
     7.7.1. Protect natural communities.
            The City will do the following in support of natural communities and will encourage individuals, organizations,
            and other agencies to take the same actions within their areas of responsibility and jurisdiction:
     7.7.2. Implement the Natural Communities policies above.
     7.7.3. Participate in any area-wide planning efforts such as Habitat Conservation Plans under the U.S.
            Endangered Species Act.
     7.7.4. Participate in environmental review conducted by other agencies for projects that could affect
            natural communities in the San Luis Obispo planning area.
     7.7.5. Develop and maintain current benchmark information on habitat types and conditions.
            For listed species, species of local concern and California Native Plant Society listed species, develop and
            maintain benchmark information on the known and likely locations of populations, population number and
            density estimates, limiting factors, environmental threats and other pertinent information for use in planning
            and environmental review.
     7.7.6. Replace invasive, non-native vegetation with native vegetation.
            The City and private development will protect and enhance habitat by removing invasive, non-native
            vegetation that detracts from habitat values and by replanting it with native California plant species. The
            Natural Resources Manger will prioritize projects and enlist the help of properly trained volunteers to assist
            in non-native vegetation removal and replanting when appropriate.
     7.7.7. Preserve ecotones.
            Condition or modify development approvals to ensure that “ecotones,” or natural transitions along the edges
            of different habitat types, are preserved and enhanced because of their importance to wildlife. Natural
            ecotones of particular concern include those along the margins of riparian corridors, marshlands, vernal
            pools, and oak woodlands where they transition to grasslands and other habitat types.
     7.7.8. Protect wildlife corridors.
            Condition development permits in accordance with applicable mitigation measures to ensure that important
            corridors for wildlife movement and dispersal are protected. Features of particular importance to wildlife
            include riparian corridors, wetlands, lake shorelines, and protected natural areas with cover and water.
            Linkages and corridors shall be provided to maintain connections between habitat areas.

7.7.9.  Creek Setbacks.
        As further described in the Zoning Regulations, the City will maintain creek setbacks to include: an
        appropriate separation from the physical top of bank, the appropriate floodway as identified in the Flood
        Management Policy, native riparian plants or wildlife habitat and space for paths called for by any City-
        adopted plan (Figure 4). In addition, creek setbacks should be consistent with the following:
        A. The following items should be no closer to the wetland or creek than the setback line: buildings, streets,
            driveways, parking lots, above-ground utilities, and outdoor commercial storage or work areas.
        B. Development approvals should respect the separation from creek banks and protection of floodways and
            natural features identified in part A above, whether or not the setback line has been established.
        C. Features which normally would be outside the creek setback may be permitted to encroach where there
            is no practical alternative, to allow reasonable
            development of a parcel, consistent with the Conservation
            and Open Space Element.
        D. Existing bridges may be replaced or widened, consistent
            with policies in this Element. Removal of any existing bridge
            or restoration of a channel to more natural conditions will
            provide for wildlife corridors, traffic circulation, access,
            utilities, and reasonable use of adjacent properties.
7.7.10. Tree Committee.
        The Tree Committee will help implement Natural Communities          Mature Coast Live Oak on the lower flanks of
        policies through expanded tree preservation and planting            Bishop Peak
        programs.

The Morros of San Luis Obispo with Chorro Valley and Morro Bay in the distance, with State Highway 1 crossing diagonally
Background.
San Luis Obispo’s desirability as a place to live, visit and do business is closely tied to its scenic character, environmental
quality and surrounding open space. This picturesque valley community, traversed by hillsides and creeks and surrounded
by mountains, farmlands and oak woodlands has a unique scenic character. San Luis Obispo’s charm and character have
enriched residents, attracted newcomers and supported a healthy tourist industry. It is this character, defined in large
measure by the City’s open spaces and Greenbelt, which must be protected for present and future generations while
allowing for sufficient urban growth.
As discussed in the Land Use Element’s Preamble, Vision and Community Goals, community decisions must respect and
protect open space. As explained below, the Greenbelt and open space are tools for preserving habitat, protecting air
and water quality, protecting view sheds and defining the City’s urbanized boundaries. San Luis Obispo’s future must be
compatible with the preservation of its open spaces -- hills, creeks, farmlands, its historic resources and other
environmental assets. Without these, San Luis Obispo’s charm and character will be lost.
Understanding open space.
Unless noted otherwise, this element uses the term “open space” generally -- that is, to refer to any land or water area
that remains in a predominantly natural or undeveloped state and which is generally free of structures, inside or outside
City limits, within the San Luis Obispo Planning Area. As more precisely described in the Land Use Element, such lands
protect and preserve the community’s natural and historical resources, define the urban boundary, and provide visual and
                                                                Page 6-43

Chapter 6
physical relief from urban development. Open spaces may consist of small portions of a parcel such as a Small Wilderness
Preservation Area, or large tracts of land. Such lands may include: prime agricultural soils, range and farmland; creeks,
marshes, watershed and floodplains; scenic resources; plant and animal habitat; historic and archaeological resources;
and passive recreation areas. Open space is, however, a broad term and often applied to other situations. For example,
going from the general to most specific sense of the term, open space includes:
            A. Undeveloped or mostly undeveloped lands that are generally free of structures, including privately-owned
                 agricultural land, “Rural Lands” under County of San Luis Obispo jurisdiction, government-owned lands, and
                 lands held by land trusts or other non-profit entities. These lands appear to be open space but may or may
                 not have any official open space protection. The City’s “Greenbelt” consists mostly of these rural lands.
            B. Lands designated as “Open Space” in the General Plan Land Use Element Map. These can be under either
                 public or private ownership, either inside or outside the City limits. Such designation does not provide any
                 official protection for lands outside the City limits unless they are owned by the City or have open space
                 easements over them.
            C. Lands designated as “Interim Open Space” in the General Plan Land Use Element Map. These are lands to
                 be kept open for an indefinite period until constraints (such as flooding or access) can be resolved and
                 urban development or Open Space designation is appropriate.
            D. Lands owned or controlled by the City and intended for long term preservation of agricultural, natural
                 resources, wildlife habitat, cultural resources, passive recreation, visual resources, watershed and for other
                 environmental purposes.
Related terms that are often used interchangeably with open space include the terms Greenbelt, Conservation/Open
Space zone and Agriculture. “Greenbelt” refers to a geographic area, shown in Figure 5 of the Conservation and Open
Space Element, within which the City seeks to use open space as a tool to achieve multiple community objectives, such as
soil and water conservation, open space preservation, wildlife enhancement, growth management, public safety, passive
recreation, view preservation and clearly defined urban boundaries. The second is “Conservation/Open Space Zone”,
shown as “C/OS” zoning in the Official Zoning Map. Properties zoned C/OS are subject to specific provisions and land use
standards under the Zoning and Subdivision Regulations. Agriculture is land where there has been a history of agricultural
cultivation or keeping of livestock, which remains generally open and is designated as Agriculture, Open Space or Interim
Open Space in the General Plan Land Use Element Map.
8.0.     Goals and Policies
8.1.     Greenbelt. Open space outside the urban area
         Secure and maintain a healthy and attractive Greenbelt around the urban area, comprised of diverse and
         connected natural habitats, and productive agricultural land that reflects the City’s watershed and topographic
         boundaries.
8.2.     Policies
     8.2.1.   Open space preserved.
              The City will preserve as open space or agriculture the undeveloped and agricultural land outside the urban
              reserve line, including the designated Greenbelt as shown in Figure 5, and will encourage individuals,
              organizations and other agencies to do likewise.

     8.2.2.  GOAL: Open space within the urban area.
             Within the urban area, the City will secure and maintain a diverse network of open land encompassing
             particularly valuable natural and agricultural resources, connected with the landscape around the urban area.
             Particularly valuable resources are:
             A. Creek corridors, including open channels with natural banks and vegetation.
             B. Laguna Lake and its undeveloped margins.
             C. Wetlands and vernal pools.
             D. Undeveloped land within the Urban Reserve not intended for urban uses.
             E. Grassland communities and woodlands.
             F.   Wildlife habitat and corridors for the health and mobility of individuals and of the species.
             G. The habitat of species listed as threatened or endangered by the State or Federal governments.
             H. Prime agricultural soils and economically viable farmland (Figure 10).
             I.   Groundwater recharge areas.
             J.   Historically open-space settings for cultural resources, native and traditional landscapes.
             K. Hills, ridgelines and the Morros.
             L.   Scenic rock outcroppings and other significant geological features.
             M. Unique plant and animal communities, including “species of local concern.”
8.3.     Policies
     8.3.1.  Open space within the urban area.
             The City will preserve the areas listed in Goal 8.2.2, and will encourage individuals, organizations, and other
             agencies to do likewise. The City will designate these areas as Open Space or Agriculture in the General Plan.
     8.3.2.  Open space buffers.
             When activities close to open space resources within or outside the urban area could harm them, the City will
             require buffers between the activities and the resources. The City will actively encourage individuals,
             organizations and other agencies to follow this policy. Buffers associated with new development shall be on
             the site of the development, rather than on neighboring land containing the open space resource. Buffers
             provide distance in the form of setbacks, within which certain features or activities are not allowed or
             conditionally allowed. Buffers shall also use techniques such as planting and wildlife-compatible fencing.
             Buffers shall be adequate for the most sensitive species in the protected area, as determined by a qualified
             professional and shall complement the protected area’s habitat values. Buffers shall be required in the
             following situations:
             A. Between urban development -- including parks and public facilities-- and natural habitats such as creeks,
                  wetlands, hillsides and ridgelines, Morros, scenic rock outcrops and other significant geological features,
                  and grassland communities, to address noise, lighting, storm runoff, spread of invasive, non-native
                  species, and access by people and pets (see also the Safety Element for “defensible space” next to
                  wildland fire areas).
             B. Between urban development and agricultural operations, to address dust, noise, odors, chemical use,
                  and access by people and pets.

Chapter 6
         C. Between agricultural operations and natural habitat, to address noise, chemical use, sediment transport,
            and livestock access.
         D. Between new development and cultural resources, to
            address visual compatibility and access by people.
         E. Between new development and scenic resources or the
            greenbelt, to address view blockage, lighting and noise, and
            visual transition from urban character to rural character.
         F. Urban development or uses located adjacent to the Urban
            Reserve Line (URL) to provide a transition to open space or
            greenbelt areas. Transition areas should add to the
            preservation of open space lands or resources. At a
            minimum, a 50 foot transition area (preserved in essentially
                                                                           Open space buffers provide a transition between
            a natural state) shall be provided within the project along
                                                                           urban development and contiguous wildlife
            the project boundary with the URL, unless the transition       habitat areas
            area is defined elsewhere in this Element.

     8.3.3.  Open space for safety.
             Secure open space where development would be unsafe. Generally, the following locations are considered to
             be unsafe:
             A. Areas within the most restrictive aviation safety zone as defined in the Airport Land Use Plan.
             B. Land straddling active or potentially active earthquake faults.
             C. Land where risks of ground shaking, slope instability, settlement, or liquefaction cannot be adequately
                 mitigated.
             D. Areas subject to flooding, where the frequency, depth, or velocity of floodwaters poses an unacceptable
                 risk to life, health, or property.
             E. Areas of high or extreme wildland fire hazard.
8.4.     Policies
     8.4.1.  Open space for safety.
             The City will preserve as Open Space, or as Agriculture, the areas listed in Goal 8.3.3 and will encourage
             individuals, organizations, and other agencies to do likewise. (See also the Safety Element.)
     8.4.2.  GOAL: Open spaces access and restoration.
             The City intends to allow public access to open space that fosters knowledge and appreciation of open space
             resources without harming them and without exposing the public to unacceptable risk. The main goal is to
             protect open space and wildlife habitat, with a secondary goal of providing passive recreation where it will
             not harm the environment.
8.5.     Policies
     8.5.1.  Public access.
             Public access to open space resources, with interpretive information, should be provided when doing so is
             consistent with protection of the resources, and with the security and privacy of affected landowners and
             occupants. Access will generally be limited to non-vehicular movement, and may be visually or physically
             restricted in sensitive areas. Public access to or through production agricultural land, or through developed
             residential lots, will be considered only if the owner agrees (Land for active recreation is typically designated
             “Park” in the General Plan Land Use Map). The City shall also designate open space areas that are not
             intended for human presence or activity.
     8.5.2.  Creekside trails.
             Creekside trails shall not be established in or across from existing, substantially developed residential areas of
             the City (such as the San Luis Drive area) where such trails could create a compatibility or privacy conflict with
             surrounding land uses.
     8.5.3.  Open-space enhancement and restoration.
             The City will enhance and restore open space resources identified in Goals 8.2.1, 8.2.2 and 8.3.2, and will
             encourage individuals, organizations and other agencies to do likewise.
     8.5.4.  Fire prevention activities.
             Except in an emergency, fire prevention activities such as fuel clearance or thinning, grading, prescribed
             burns or other activities shall be conducted pursuant to an approved Conservation Plan, and under the
             supervision of the Natural Resources Manager and Fire Marshall. Habitat preservation shall be given equal
             priority with fire prevention.
                                                            Page 6-49

Chapter 6
     8.5.5.  Passive Recreation.
             The City will consider allowing passive recreation where it will not degrade or significantly impact open space
             resources and where there are no significant neighborhood compatibility impacts, in accordance with an
             approved open space conservation plan. Passive recreation activities may include: hiking, nature study,
             bicycle use, rock climbing, horseback riding or other passive recreational activities as permitted and regulated
             in the Open Space Ordinance.
     8.5.6.  Determination of appropriate uses for City-owned open space.
             Determination of the appropriate land management practices and the recreational uses of City-owned open
             space lands shall be made on an area-specific basis, based upon the policies in the Conservation and Open
             Space Element, the Open Space Ordinance (SLOMC 12.22), and the adopted “Conservation Guidelines for
             City-Owned Open Space Lands.” These policies will be applied through the public planning and review
             process specified in the Conservation Guidelines, and will guide the preparation and adoption of conservation
             plans for City-owned open space properties.
     8.5.7.  GOAL: Open space mitigation.
             The City will avoid the loss of and require mitigation for the loss of open space resources.
8.6.     Policies
     8.6.1.  Loss of open space.
             The City may permit loss of an open space resource as described in Goals 8.2.1 and 8.2.2 only when:
             A. Preserving the resource would permanently deprive the landowner of all reasonable use, and acquisition
                  by the City or a conservation organization is not feasible, or
             B. There is a demonstrated need, based on public health, safety, or welfare, and there is no practical
                  alternative to loss of the resource, or
             C. The resource is on a small parcel essentially surrounded by urban development, and the development
                  contributes to the protection of agricultural land in the urban reserve or greenbelt through transfer of
                  development credit, dedication of open space easements or fee ownership, direct funding for open
                  space acquisition or another equally effective method, as further described in the Land Use Element.
     8.6.2.  Extent of open space loss.
             The extent of loss or degree of harm to the resource shall be minimized, consistent with the justifications for
             any loss provided above. Where creeks must be modified
             for flood protection or bank stability, the modification shall
             be patterned after natural conditions to the maximum
             extent feasible.
     8.6.3.  Required mitigation.
             Loss or harm shall be mitigated to the maximum extent
             feasible. Mitigation must at least comply with Federal and
             State requirements. Mitigation shall be implemented and
             monitored in compliance with State and Federal
             requirements, by qualified professionals, and shall be
             funded by the project applicant.
                                                                               View of Cuesta Pass, looking north along State
             A. For natural habitat that is relatively limited in extent       Highway 101
                  (such as riparian or wetland habitat) mitigation shall
                  consist of creating twice the area of habitat lost, of
                  equal quality, in the following order of preference:
                                                           Page 6-50

     1. The same kind on the same site.
     2. The same kind on a different site (the site shall be within the San Luis Obispo planning area).
     3. A similar kind (such as seasonal wetland in place of freshwater marsh) on the same site.
     4. A similar kind on a different site (the site shall be within the San Luis Obispo Planning Area).
B. Habitat created as mitigation should be located and designed to minimize the need for long-term
     artificial support (such as supplying wetlands from a well requiring energy and maintenance).
C. For a widespread habitat type or for farmland, mitigation shall consist of permanently protecting an
     equal area of equal quality, which does not already have permanent protection, within the San Luis
     Obispo Planning Area.
D. For projects involving enlargement of the urban reserve, mitigation shall consist of permanently
     protecting an area not previously protected, that is located and that has sufficient size (generally four
     times the area to be developed) to secure a permanent edge to the city.
E. Individual small projects, each with an incremental impact on an extensive resource, may provide
     mitigation through payment of a fee, to be used for protecting that resource within the San Luis Obispo
     planning area.
F.   The City may establish or participate in a “mitigation bank,” through which resources are protected in a
     consolidated location ahead of the need to mitigate impacts of individual, small projects. The City will
     work with other agencies to assure successful operation of any mitigation bank that is established.
G. Any development that is allowed on a site designated as Open Space or Agriculture, or containing open-
     space resources, shall be designed to minimize its impacts on open space values on the site and on
     neighboring land.
     1. Hillside development shall comply with the standards of the Land Use Element, including
          minimization of grading for structures and access, and use of building forms, colors, and landscaping
          that are not visually intrusive. (See also Chapter 9.2.1)
     2. Creek corridors, wetlands, grassland communities, other valuable habitat areas, archaeological
          resources, agricultural land, and necessary buffers should be within their own parcel, rather than
          divided among newly created parcels (Figure 8). Where creation of a separate parcel is not practical,
          the resources shall be within an easement. The easement must clearly establish allowed uses and
          maintenance responsibilities in furtherance of resource protection.
     3. The City will encourage the County not to create new parcels within the greenbelt, with the
          exception of those permitted under the County’s agriculture cluster incentive. Outside of cluster
          districts, allowed parcel sizes within the greenbelt should be no smaller, and the number of dwellings
          allowed on a parcel should be no greater than as designated in the September 2002 San Luis Obispo
          Area Plan and related County codes.
The City will encourage the County to adopt and implement a mandatory cluster district for appropriate areas
of the Greenbelt under County jurisdiction to preserve open space qualities, consistent with this Element.
The City will encourage other agencies to follow these policies.

8.7.     Programs
     8.7.1. Protect open space resources.
            The City will take the following actions to protect open space, and will encourage individuals, organizations,
            and other agencies to take the same actions within their areas of responsibility and jurisdiction:
            A. Maintain the urban reserve line location, except where a relatively small enlargement of the urban area
                is tied to permanent protection of substantial open land that did not previously have assured protection.
            B. Promote open space protection by annexing and applying Conservation and Open Space (C/OS) and
                Agriculture zoning to private property where appropriate and consistent with General Plan goals and
                policies.
            C. Set conditions of subdivision and development approvals consistent with General Plan goals and policies.
            D. Acquire land or interests in land for open space, pursuant to City Open Space Guidelines and acquisition
                priorities. (See also Appendix B, “Acquisition of Open Space.”)
                1. Obtain dedications of fee ownership or easements as gifts or in exchange for development
                      approvals.
                2. Seek and use grants, donations, other revenue sources, and long-term financing mechanisms to
                      purchase fee ownership or easements. The City will maintain annual funding for open space
                      acquisition and protection, and will explore all potential funding sources and other creative incentive
                      programs, including general obligation bonds, sales tax increase, property transfer tax, assessment
                      districts, tax incentives, and state and federal loans and grants.
                3. Advocate countywide planning and funding for open space protection.
            E. Manage its open space holdings and enforce its open space easements, consistent with General Plan
                goals and policies and the Open Space Ordinance. (See also Appendix C, “Management of Open Space.”)
            F.  Encourage transfer of development credit from open lands to lands designated for development, or
                retirement of development credit.
            G. Locate, design and operate facilities consistent with General Plan goals and policies.
            H. Encourage sustainable agricultural practices to protect the health of human and natural communities,
                and to minimize conflicts between agriculture and urban neighbors, avoid grading adjacent to or within
                creeks and wetlands and limit livestock access within creeks and wetlands.
            I.  Provide information for citizens and in particular, landowners, on the values and techniques for resource
                protection and land conservation.
            J.  Improve interagency cooperation for open space acquisition, greenbelt, creeks, wetlands, and wildlife
                habitat protection in open space areas by coordinating with other government agencies and
                organizations having interest or expertise in resource protection.
            K. Avoid imposing taxes or fees that discourage retention of open space or agricultural uses.
            L.  Establish mutually respectful, long-term relationships with landowners, and conservation organizations
                such as land trusts, and local environmental organizations.
            M. Maintain the position of Natural Resources Manager so that open space functions are consolidated in
                one existing City department under one person.

         N. The Natural Resource Manager will establish and periodically review performance standards and
              dimensions for buffers between open space or agricultural resources and urban uses.
  8.7.2.   Enhance and restore open space.
           The City will do the following in support of open space
           enhancement and restoration, in coordination with other
           agencies and organizations, and will encourage individuals,
           organizations, and other agencies to take the same actions within
           their areas of responsibility:
           A. Inventory natural areas that have been degraded, beginning
                with City-owned property, and prepare a list of sites and
                activities, in priority order, for restoration efforts.
                                                                                    Citizen volunteers and youth groups assist
           B. Establish self-sustaining populations of native species that          in open space revegetation programs
                were historically found in natural habitat areas.
                1. Revegetate disturbed and over-grazed upland areas, including grassland communities, using site-
                     specific or region-specific plants so far as practical.
                2. To reverse historical trends of creek channelization and modification, re-establish native riparian
                     vegetation.
                3. Eliminate sources of water pollutants and improper water diversions.
           C. Remove invasive, non-native species in natural habitat areas, and prevent the introduction or spread of
                invasive, non-native species and pathogens.
           D. Where allowed by City ownership, easements, or other agreements, remove man-made elements such
                as buildings, paving, concrete lining of waterways, signs, and utilities, when they are contrary to the
                purpose for the open space and they are not needed for public
                health or safety, or for implementation of City plans.
           E. Provide and maintain suitably-sized access corridors through
                or under new and previously established, man-made obstacles
                to wildlife movement (such as appropriately sized culverts
                under arterial streets, highways and other major roads).
           F.   Remove trash, debris, and contaminants, using methods that
                minimally disrupt the open-space resources.
           G. Provide continuing community education and outreach for all
                                                                                      City-owned open spaces must be carefully
                citizens, youth and youth groups, and property owners on              managed to protect open space resources
                open space and natural resource values, programs and
                responsibilities.
           H. Enlist the help of volunteers and academic programs in restoring and monitoring habitat health.
           I.   Set conditions of subdivision and development approvals consistent with General Plan goals and policies.
                (See also Chapter 8.6.1)
           J.   Following adequate public review, adopt conservation plans for open space areas under City easement or
                fee ownership. The plans shall include a resource inventory, needs analysis, acceptable levels of change,
                grazing, monitoring, wildlife (including listed species, sensitive species, and species of local concern,
                management and implementation strategies, including wildfire preparedness plans.

          K. Identify and secure alternative funding mechanisms for re-planting degraded creek corridor sections with
              native California vegetation.

Background
San Luis Obispo has been favored with a beautiful natural setting. Also, the
community has strived for attractive urban development. Protection of these
assets enhances the community’s quality of life and economic vitality.
Protection involves both the integrity of the resource being viewed, and lines
of sight to the resource.
Goals and Policies
9.0.      Viewsheds.
9.1.      Policies
                                                                                     City limits form a well- defined urban edge, with
                                                                                     open space beyond
     9.1.1.   Preserve natural and agricultural landscapes.
              The City will implement the following policies and will encourage other agencies with jurisdiction to do
              likewise:
              A. Natural and agricultural landscapes that the City has not designated for urban use shall be maintained in
                   their current patterns of use.
              B. Any development that is permitted in natural or agricultural landscapes shall be visually subordinate to
                   and compatible with the landscape features. Development includes, but is not limited to buildings, signs
                   (including billboard signs), roads, utility and telecommunication lines and structures. Such development
                   shall:
                   1. Avoid visually prominent locations such as ridgelines, and slopes exceeding 20 percent.
                   2. Avoid unnecessary grading, vegetation removal, and site lighting.
                   3. Incorporate building forms, architectural materials, and landscaping, that respect the setting,
                        including the historical pattern of development in similar settings, and avoid stark contrasts with its
                        setting.
                   4. Preserve scenic or unique landforms, significant trees in terms of size, age, species or rarity, and rock
                        outcroppings.
              C. The City’s non-emergency repair, maintenance, and small construction projects in highly visible locations,
                   such as hillsides and downtown creeks, where scenic resources could be affected, shall be subject to at
                   least “minor or incidental” architectural review.
     9.1.2.   Urban development.
              The City will implement the following principle and will encourage other agencies with jurisdiction to do so:
              urban development should reflect its architectural context. This does not necessarily prescribe a specific
              style, but requires deliberate design choices that acknowledge human scale, natural site features, and
              neighboring urban development, and that are compatible with historical and architectural resources. Plans
              for sub-areas of the city may require certain architectural styles.
     9.1.3.   Utilities and signs.
              In and near public streets, plazas, and parks, features that clutter, degrade, intrude on, or obstruct views
              should be avoided. Necessary features, such as utility and communication equipment, and traffic equipment
                                                              Page 6-58

                                                            Conservation and Open Space Element
                                                                                                                    
             and signs should be designed and placed so as to not impinge upon or degrade scenic views of the Morros or
             surrounding hillsides, or farmland, consistent with the primary objective of safety. New billboard signs shall
             not be allowed, and existing billboard signs shall be removed as soon as practicable, as provided in the Sign
             Regulations.
     9.1.4.  Streetscapes and major roadways.
             In the acquisition, design, construction or significant modification of major roadways (highways/regional
             routes and arterial streets), the City will promote the creation of “streetscapes” and linear scenic parkways or
             corridors that promote the City’s visual quality and character, enhance adjacent uses, and integrate roadways
             with surrounding districts. To accomplish this, the City will:
             A. Establish streetscape design standards for major roadways.
             B. Encourage the creation and maintenance median planters and widened parkway plantings.
             C. Retain mature trees in the public right-of-way.
             D. Emphasize the planting and maintenance of California Native tree species of sufficient height, spread,
                  form and horticultural characteristics to create the desired streetscape canopy, shade, buffering from
                  adjacent uses, and other desired streetscape characteristics, consistent with the Tree Ordinance or as
                  recommended by the Tree Committee or as approved by the Architectural Review Commission.
             E. Encourage the use of water-conserving landscaping, street furniture, decorative lighting and paving,
                  arcaded walkways, public art, and other pedestrian-oriented features to enhance the streetscape
                  appearance, comfort and safety.
             F.   Encourage and where possible, require undergrounding of overhead utility lines and structures.
     9.1.5.  View protection in new development.
             The City will include in all environmental review and carefully consider effects of new development, streets
             and road construction on views and visual quality by applying the Community Design Guidelines, height
             restrictions, hillside standards, Historical Preservation Program Guidelines and the California Environmental
             Quality Act and Guidelines.
     9.1.6.  Night-sky preservation.
             City will adopt a “night sky” ordinance to preserve nighttime views, prevent light pollution, and to protect
             public safety by establishing street and public area lighting standards.
     9.1.7.  GOAL: Viewing opportunities.
             Provide ample opportunities for viewing attractive features.
9.2.     Policies
     9.2.1.  Views to and from public places, including scenic roadways.
             The City will preserve and improve views of important scenic resources from public places, and encourage
             other agencies with jurisdiction to do so. Public places include parks, plazas, the grounds of civic buildings,
             streets and roads, and publicly accessible open space. In particular, the route segments shown in Figure 11
             are designated as scenic roadways.
             A. Development projects shall not wall off scenic roadways and block views.
             B. Utilities, traffic signals, and public and private signs and lights shall not intrude on or clutter views,
                  consistent with safety needs.
             C. Where important vistas of distant landscape features occur along streets, street trees shall be clustered
                  to facilitate viewing of the distant features.
                                                            Page 6-59

Chapter 6
             D. Development projects, including signs, in the viewshed of a scenic roadway shall be considered
                  “sensitive” and require architectural review.
     9.2.2.  Views to and from private development.
             Projects should incorporate as amenities views from and within private development sites. Private
             development designs should cause the least view blockage for neighboring property that allows project
             objectives to be met.
     9.2.3.  Outdoor lighting.
             Outdoor lighting shall avoid: operating at unnecessary locations, levels, and times; spillage to areas not
             needing or wanting illumination; glare (intense line-of-site contrast); and frequencies (colors) that interfere
             with astronomical viewing.
9.3.     Programs
         The City shall do the following to protect and enhance views, and will encourage others to do so, as appropriate:
     9.3.1.  Public facilities.
             Locate and design public facilities and utilities consistent with General Plan goals and policies.
     9.3.2.  Update Community Design Guidelines.
             Update and maintain Community Design Guidelines to address views from scenic roadways and include them
             in design standards in plans for sub-areas of the City.
     9.3.3.  Sign Regulations.
             Maintain and apply Sign Regulations consistent with General Plan goals and policies. When possible, signs in
             the public right-of-way should be consolidated on a single low-profile standard.
     9.3.4.  Environmental and architectural review.
             Conduct environmental review and architectural review consistent with General Plan goals and policies
             regarding visual impacts and quality.
     9.3.5.  Visual assessments.
             Require evaluations (accurate visual simulations) for projects affecting important scenic resources and views
             from public places.
     9.3.6.  View blockage along scenic highways.
             Determine that view blockage along scenic roadways is a significant impact.
     9.3.7.  Development proposals in unincorporated County.
             Review County-proposed general plan amendments and development proposals within the City’s Planning
             Area for consistency with City General Plan goals and policies.
     9.3.8.  Scenic highway designation.
             Advocate State and County scenic highway designations and protective programs for scenic routes
             connecting San Luis Obispo with other communities.
     9.3.9.  Undergrounding utilities.
             Place existing overhead utilities underground, with highest priority for scenic roadways, entries to the city,
             and historical districts.
     9.3.10. Prohibit billboards.
             Not allow additional billboards.
     9.3.11. Billboard removal.
             Remove existing billboards through amortization, conditions of development approval, and grants for
             enhancing open-space and transportation corridors, with highest priority for scenic roadways, entries to the
             city, and historical districts.

9.3.12. Preserve the Morros.
        In cooperation with the County of San Luis
        Obispo, other government agencies, non-profit
        agencies and property owners, the City will seek
        to preserve the Morros as open space through
        preservation incentives, easements, land
        acquisition, or other measures to preserve visual
        qualities.
9.3.13. Monitor viewsheds.
        The City will establish and maintain a program of
        describing and monitoring viewsheds within and
        adjacent to City limits to establish a             Islay Hill, one of the “Seven Sisters”, a series of extinct volcanoes
        photographic baseline of visual setting and        that transect the City
        conditions.

Introduction
Water is the fluid of life, essential for natural and human communities.
The Water and Wastewater Management Element contains detailed
information and policies, focusing on the relationship between urban
water demand and supply. The following goals and policies address water
as a component of a sustainable community.
Goals and Policies
10.0.    GOAL: Urban water needs.
         Meet urban water needs without substantial harm to natural
         communities or productive agriculture.
                                                                                 City wastewater treatment facility on Prado Road
10.1.    Policies
     10.1.1. Water use planning.
             In planning for urban water needs, the City will adopt and strive for the most efficient available practices. The
             City will encourage other agencies to follow this policy. “The most efficient available practices” means
             behavior and devices that use the least water for a desired outcome, considering available equipment, life-
             cycle costs, social and environmental side effects, and the regulations of other agencies. Water use planning
             shall take into account the reliability reserve and related concepts set forth in Section 909 of the Charter of
             the City of San Luis Obispo and the Water and Wastewater Element.
     10.1.2. Competition for supplies.
             The City will consider the effects of water supply projects on agriculture, wildlife habitat and stream flows,
             and should ensure continued water availability for these uses in planning for long-term water supplies. The
             City will encourage individuals, organizations, and other agencies to follow this policy.
     10.1.3. GOAL: Water Quality
             Protect and maintain water quality in aquifers, Laguna Lake, streams and wetlands that supports all beneficial
             uses, agriculture, and wildlife habitat.
10.2.    Policies
     10.2.1. Water Quality
             The City will employ the best available practices for pollution avoidance and control, and will encourage
             others to do so. “Best available practices” means behavior and technologies that result in the highest water
             quality, considering available equipment, life-cycle costs, social and environmental side effects, and the
             regulations of other agencies.
     10.2.2. Ahwahnee Water Principles.
             In planning for its water operations, programs and services, the City will be guided by the Ahwahnee Water
             Principles and will encourage individuals, organizations, and other agencies to follow these policies:
             A. Community design should be compact, mixed use, walkable and transit-oriented so that automobile-
                  generated urban runoff pollutants are minimized and the open lands that absorb water are preserved to
                  the maximum extent possible.
                                                           Page 6-63

Chapter 6
            B. Natural resources such as wetlands, flood plains, recharge zones, riparian areas, open space, and native
                habitats should be identified, preserved and restored as valued assets for flood protection, water quality
                improvement, groundwater recharge, habitat, and overall long-term water resource sustainability.
            C. Water holding areas such as creekbeds, recessed athletic fields, ponds, cisterns, and other features that
                serve to recharge groundwater, reduce runoff, improve water quality and decrease flooding should be
                incorporated into the urban landscape.
            D. All aspects of landscaping from the selection of plants to soil preparation and the installation of irrigation
                systems should be designed to reduce water demand, retain runoff, decrease flooding, and recharge
                groundwater.
            E. Permeable surfaces should be used for hardscape. Impervious surfaces such as driveways, streets, and
                parking lots should be minimized so that land is available to absorb storm water, reduce polluted urban
                runoff, recharge groundwater and reduce flooding.
            F.  Dual plumbing that allows grey water from showers, sinks and washers to be reused for landscape
                irrigation should be included in the infrastructure of new development, consistent with State guidelines.
            G. Community design should maximize the use of recycled water for appropriate applications including
                outdoor irrigation, toilet flushing, and commercial and industrial processes. Purple pipe should be
                installed in all new construction and remodeled buildings in anticipation of the future availability of
                recycled water.
            H. Urban water conservation technologies such as low-flow toilets, efficient clothes washers, and more
                efficient water-using industrial equipment should be incorporated in all new construction and retrofitted
                in remodeled buildings.
            I.  Ground water treatment and brackish water desalination should be pursued when necessary to
                maximize locally available, drought-proof water supplies.
10.3.   Programs
    10.3.1. Efficient water use.
            The City will do the following in support of efficient water use, and will encourage individuals, organizations,
            and other agencies to do likewise:
            A. Landscaping:
                1. Choose plants that are suitable for the climate and their intended function, with emphasis on use of
                     native and drought-tolerant plants.
                2. Prepare soils for water penetration and retention.
                3. Design and operate suitable and efficient irrigation systems.
                4. The City will encourage drought-tolerant landscaping, vegetable gardens and fruit trees in lieu of
                     large expanses of lawn or other more water-demanding plantings.
                5. Landscape maintenance: Landscaped areas will be properly designed for efficient water use, and
                     shall be properly installed and maintained, including the upkeep and replacement of low-flow
                     irrigation fixtures and equipment.
                6. Facilitate use of tertiary-treated water and seek to legalize use of grey water for non-potable
                     household purposes.
                                                          Page 6-64
                                                      Conservation and Open Space Element
                                                                                                               
            7. Promote water conservation through leak control in residential, commercial, industrial and public
                 plumbing systems.
10.3.2. Maintain water quality.
        The City will do the following in to maintain a high
        level of water quality, and will encourage
        individuals, organizations, and other agencies to do
        likewise:
        A. Design and operate its water supply, treatment,
            and distribution system to prevent adverse
            effects on water quality (potential point source
            of pollutants such as chlorine).
        B. Design and operate its wastewater collection
            and treatment system to prevent adverse
            effects on water quality (potential point source
            of pollutants such as untreated sewage and
            chlorine).                                           Looking southwest from Bishop Peak, toward Laguna Lake
        C. Design, construct, and maintain its facilities such as parks, buildings and grounds, storm water facilities
            and parking to prevent adverse effects on water quality (potential point sources for pollutants such as
            petroleum and non-point sources of runoff contaminated with fertilizers, pesticides, litter, and vehicle
            residues).
        D. Regulate the design, construction, and operation of private facilities over which the City has permit
            authority to ensure they will not have adverse effects on water quality (potential point sources for, as
            examples, sediment from construction and chemicals used in operations, and non-point sources for
            contaminated runoff).
        E. Participate with other agencies, in particular the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, in
            watershed planning and management.
        F.  In locations subject to flooding, not allow activities, such as outdoor storage, that would be substantial
            sources of chemical or biological contamination during a flood, even though buildings associated with the
            activities would meet flood-protection standards.
        G. Establish standards for non-point source water pollution in cooperation with the Regional Water Quality
            Control Board.
        H. Establish a program of baseline water quality testing for City creeks.
        I.  Identify and protect groundwater recharge areas to maintain suitable groundwater levels and to protect
            groundwater quality for existing and potential municipal water sources.

                    APPENDIX B: ACQUISITION OF OPEN SPACE LANDS
1. The City will strive for the most effective protection of open space resources through its use of public funds.
2. The City will partner with land trusts, environmental organizations and other groups to acquire open space lands,
   either in fee or as an easement.
3. To be considered for City acquisition, a site must have value in one or more of the following categories:
   A. Valuable natural resources, such as habitat for listed species or species of local concern, groundwater, or surface
        water.
   B. Scenic qualities, cultural resources, or unusual geologic features.
   C. Natural hazards to public health or safety, such as flooding or landslide, which make reasonable development on
        the property unlikely.
   D. Important opportunities for low-impact recreation, such as connecting the Morros by a hiking trail, linking San
        Luis Obispo to connecting trails in the unincorporated County, or for providing valuable environmental education
        opportunities.
   E. Proximity to land that is already permanently protected as open space, or the property is close to land that is
        likely to be protected in the foreseeable future, thus forming or potentially forming a continuous area of
        protected lands.
   F. Productive or potentially productive agricultural land, or an effective buffer that would protect agricultural
        operations.
   G. Individually or cumulatively forms an important part of the City’s greenbelt.
4. A site that meets one or more of the criteria in part 3 above should have high priority for purchase if it meets one or
   more of the following criteria:
   A. The property, or resources on the property, are under threat of incompatible development or irreversible
        damage.
   B. The site has timely or attractive purchase considerations or conditions (for example, local cash contributions are
        available or additional land area is available).
   C. The site is one of the last sections providing continuous habitat or a wildlife corridor, or a trail linkage.
   D. The site is of sufficient size that resources are likely to remain intact, even if adjacent properties are developed.
   E. Purchase of the site would maximize the effectiveness of acquisition expenditures (for example, purchasing one
        piece of property may guarantee that a second piece of property remains in open space or agriculture, even
        though a public agency does not obtain the second property.
5. The City should generally obtain fee ownership for:
   A. Sites that may have or require frequent public access to or through them, such as a public trail.
   B. Agricultural lands when (1) there may be harmful impacts from current or future agricultural practices, (2) the
        property could be leased back for continued agricultural use, or (3) public access is desired.
   C. Lands for which buying the development rights is almost as expensive as obtaining the land in fee.
   D. Lands that contain delicate habitat requiring monitoring and enforcement.
   E. Land on which enforcing an easement would be difficult or costly.
6. A site that meets the criteria in parts 3 through 5 above should generally not be acquired by the City as open space if:
   A. The site is developed with facilities or structures, and thus would not be consistent with the open space
        definition.
   B. The site or resource can be obtained in a timely manner as a condition of City, State, or County development
        approvals or agreements.
   C. The site’s values are primarily scenic, but the property cannot be readily viewed by the general public.
   D. Adjacent properties are being developed in a way that is likely to significantly diminish the conservation values of
        the property in question.

Chapter 6
   E. Management of the property would be very costly, or the terms of an easement would be unusually difficult to
       enforce.
   F. The site cannot be acquired with reasonable effort in relation to its value or purpose.
7. The City should generally obtain an easement or development rights:
   A. On agricultural lands where the cost of development rights is significantly less than fee ownership.
   B. Where continuation of the private use is compatible with the open space designation, and management by the
       City is not required.
   C. To protect views or scenic resources involving little or no public access.
8. The City will sell, exchange, or transfer an interest in open space lands, or relinquish a permanent open space
   easement, only by approval of the City Council following a public hearing, and only after a 60-day period in which the
   decision can be suspended pending reversal by referendum.
9. The City’s Natural Resource Manager will be responsible for the Open Space Acquisitions Program.

              APPENDIX C: MANAGEMENT OF OPEN SPACE LANDS
1. The City will manage land that it owns, or controls through lease or easement, to implement the policies of this
   element, and will encourage other agencies to do so on their land. This Appendix focuses on management
   practices for lands designated by the Land Use Element as Open Space or Agriculture, but does not exclude other
   designations such as Park or Public.
2. The City’s Conservation Guidelines for Open Spaces, in conjunction with approved individual Open Space
   Conservation Plans and the City’s Open Space Ordinance, shall guide day-to-day management decisions and
   activities in open space areas.
3. On open space land that the City manages, the City may decide to permit more than one type of activity or use.
   Where different uses may not be compatible, the following priorities will guide decisions. The items listed under a
   priority heading are co-equal. (Land uses are subject to any deed restrictions placed by owners conveying land to
   the City for open space purposes, and to easements or rights retained by others.)
   Priority 1
       Protection of existing wildlife and natural habitat generally.
       Protection of existing listed species and their existing habitat, or re-establishment of such habitat where
        damaged.
       Protection of public resources such as water quality (watershed runoff and groundwater recharge).
       Avoidance of threats to public health and safety, such as ground instability (In the case of vegetation
        management for wildland fire, separation between hazardous vegetation and structures generally should be
        provided on the land containing the structure, by the owner of the land containing the structure. Where
        vegetation management on City-owned land is needed or desirable, management practices will minimize
        harm to wildlife habitat and scenic resources).
   Priority 2
       Public access and passive recreation.
       Protection of scenic resources.
   Priority 3
       Scientific study.
       Agricultural production.
4. Any encroachment of a private use onto the City’s land must benefit the City’s ownership and management
   objectives, and shall be subject to approval by the City Council.
5. The City will adopt conservation plans (or master plans with conservation components) for large parcels, and for
   small parcels where conservation challenges and solutions need to be clarified. The preparation and adoption
   process shall foster participation by resource-protection experts and by the public. On lands designated Park
   (such as Laguna Lake, Mission Plaza, and Meadow Park), the plans will provide for previously established
   recreational uses. They may provide for passive recreational uses that do not adversely impact listed species and
   that minimize adverse impacts on other wildlife resources. The City’s Lopez Canyon property (outside the
   planning area) and Reservoir Canyon property will be managed as open space.
6. The City will coordinate law enforcement and emergency response for its open space lands with all potentially
   affected agencies.
                                                     Page 6-75

Chapter 6
7.   The City may lease land to other agencies or organizations for maintenance or service activities, provided the
     lease agreement reflects all City policies and management objectives.
8.   The City should lease lands designated Agriculture for continued agricultural use, provided the lease agreement
     reflects all City policies and management objectives.
9.   The City may provide services to or maintain resource-protection lands owned by others, where warranted by
     adjacency to City-owned land and long-term resource-protection needs. Such activity shall be subject to an
     agreement approved by the City Council. The costs for such services shall be borne by the owner, unless the City
     Council determines that bearing part or all of the cost is necessary to implement City policies.
10.  The City will monitor its open space holdings often enough for timely discovery and response to problems such as
     substantial hazards, encroachment, trespass, and degradation of resources.
11.  The City may enlist volunteers, including community organizations and neighboring landowners, to help monitor
     and maintain open space and recreational resources. Volunteers will receive training appropriate to the tasks
     they will be performing, including recognition of situations and conditions requiring professional response.
12.  The City will maintain a publicly accessible inventory of the location and type of its open space holdings and
     easements. The inventory will contain or be linked to documentation of the initial condition, and the evolving
     conditions, of land and easement areas that it acquires.
13.  When compatible with the primary purpose of the open space, the City should use revenue from open space
     lands, such as agricultural lease payments, to fund open-space maintenance. Such revenues may also be used to
     acquire open space.
14.  Mitigation for the impacts of private projects shall generally be conducted on private lands. However, special
     circumstances may arise that justify use of City-owned land as a mitigation site:
        A. Where there is a clear City benefit from a transaction that involves the use of City land as a mitigation site,
            or
        B. Where General Plan goals will be furthered by the appropriate use of City lands for mitigation purposes.
            Private mitigation actions on City-owned land shall have a clear resource-protection or amenity value to
            the site, and shall be subject to approval by the City Council. Mitigation at a City park shall be subject to
            review and recommendation by the Parks and Recreation Commission. Mitigation on City-owned open
            space shall be subject to review and recommendation by the Natural Resources Manager.
15.  The City may form an Open Space Committee to advise staff on open space acquisition and management.

1.0. VISION
     San Luis Obispo’s recreation activities, facilities, parks and open spaces are strongly influenced by city residents.
     The community speaks and the Council and staff listen. San Luis Obispo is renowned for its unique features,
     including environment, archaeology, history, neighborhoods, and style of citizen-driven government. Our
     recreation programs and facilities clearly display the direction received as a result of on-going public
     participation. The City’s vision is to continue enhancing our network of trails, located in both open space and
     developed areas, and to provide pedestrian and bicycle trail links between parks, recreation facilities, recreation
     activities and open space.
     While recreation needs and requests for activities continue to evolve as the population changes, the community
     has clearly voiced a preference for active recreational pursuits. These pursuits include multi-use paths, hiking
     trails, playgrounds, and swimming as outdoor activities and indoor needs for fitness and exercise. There is also a
     collective interest in more indoor, passive pursuits, such as lectures, fine arts, and social opportunities for our
     senior population. In keeping with a widespread trend throughout the United States, San Luis Obispo is
     experiencing the growth of a new entry population of “senior citizens” called the “Baby Boomer” generation. This
     group will be characterized by seeking more of the active pursuits they enjoyed in their teen and young adult
     years. It is envisioned this population will significantly increase in number, as those born between 1945-1964
     turn the magic age of fifty. This emerging population is expected to result in two distinct groups of “Senior
     Citizens” – each with very different recreational and leisure time needs. There is a universal trend developing
     which reflects these needs: the increased need for “50 and over” sports leagues, classes, and activities, and the
     continuing need to provide recreational opportunities for older seniors, ages 70 and above. Balancing the needs
     of these two dynamic senior populations will be a key focus of the Parks and Recreation Department’s services
     and facilities.
     While it is necessary to continue to fund unmet recreational needs, it is equally important to maintain a balance
     between continued renovation and improvement of existing parks, facilities, recreational activities and open
     space, and the development of new facilities and programs. Traditionally, City recreation programs have tried to
     balance unmet needs with on-going community recreational needs. Moreover, it is the City’s guiding philosophy
     that all city residents, regardless of interest, ability, and needs shall have the opportunity to help shape and
     participate in City recreation programs.
     City officials, staff and volunteers who will implement the Parks and Recreation Element and Master Plan are
     responsible for ensuring city programs and facilities are current and meaningful by regularly seeking input and
     evaluation from those who use these services. They must also ensure that new or expanded recreation programs
     and facilities are implemented because they represent a need expressed by a cross-section of the community and
     not just by a small, special-interest group.
1.1. Executive Summary
     The purpose of the Parks and Recreation Element and Master Plan is to evaluate current and future parks and
     recreation needs, identify city recreation goals, policies and programs, and to establish short- and long-range
     implementation and funding mechanisms to ensure our facilities and programs keep pace with our changing
     community.
     The Vision Statement and Chapters 1 through 4 constitute the Parks and Recreation Element of the General Plan.
     The Master Plan, Chapters 5 and 6, provides technical and procedural details to implement the Parks and
     Recreation Element. Chapter 7 summarizes technical background information on City recreation facilities. The
     findings identified in the Parks and Recreation Element and Master Plan update are derived from citizen
     comments and participation. The use of public hearings, surveys, and comments received by City commissions all
     contributed to the goals, policies, and programs of this element.
                                                           Page 7-5

Chapter 7
     Recreational policies, programs and priorities must be reviewed in a broad community context, considering both
     needs and opportunities, and must be consistent with other General Plan elements. City decision-makers will use
     these policy and program guides to review land use, circulation, fiscal and other important matters that shape the
     City's character.
     Major topics addressed in this document include:
            Updated goals, policies and programs
            Facility needs
            Activity needs
            Implementation strategies
     Despite increasing demands for recreation services, the ability of local government to meet those demands is
     increasingly constrained by funding limitations. In 2001, the City’s recreation infrastructure is operating at peak
     capacity. There are also outside impacts on our parks, recreation facilities and activities from the college and
     university community and growing areas adjacent to the city. Consequently, San Luis Obispo's parks and
     recreation services have, in recent years, had to do more with increasingly limited resources. As demand for
     recreation facilities and activities grows and changes, the City intends to focus its efforts in the following critical
     areas:
            Continued development of athletic fields and support facilities;
            Providing parks in underserved neighborhoods;
            Providing a multi-use community center and therapy pool;
            Expanding paths and trails for recreational use and to link recreation facilities;
            Meeting the special needs of disabled persons, at-risk youth, and senior citizens.
     The City intends to meet growing recreational needs through more efficient delivery of services, user fees which
     more closely reflect the cost of providing the services, community support through donations of time and
     materials, and special grant programs. The City also intends to continue and to expand participation in joint use
     programs with the San Luis Coastal Unified School District and other agencies, enabling shared use of public and
     private parks and facilities.
1.2. Updating the Parks and Recreation Element and Master Plan
     This document will be updated by January 2006. Citizens may propose changes to the Parks and Recreation
     Element at any time. Such changes are considered General Plan amendments and can be adopted by the City
     Council after holding public hearings. For more information on parks and recreation in San Luis Obispo, contact
     the Parks and Recreation Department, 1341 Nipomo Street, San Luis Obispo, CA 93401-3964, or phone (805) 781-

                                2.       INTRODUCTION AND GOALS
2.0. Introduction
     State law requires each city and county to adopt a general plan to guide the physical development of the
     community, and to guide the conservation and use of certain resources. General plans are required by state law
     to include at least seven elements: land use, circulation, housing, conservation, open space, noise, and safety. In
     addition, state law allows cities and counties to adopt optional elements to guide the community's physical
     development. The Parks and Recreation Element is one of several optional elements of the City's General Plan.
     The Parks and Recreation Element and Master Plan sets forth a plan for a balanced park and recreation system. It
     has been prepared to help plan, develop, and maintain community parks, sports and other recreation facilities,
     and recreation activities. The Vision Statement, Introduction and Chapters 1-4 contain parks and recreation
     goals, policies, programs, and comprise the General Plan Parks and Recreation Element. Chapters 5 and 6 provide
     implementation details and identify the most critical recreational needs. They also contain funding
     recommendations.
     Other General Plan elements and plans that may affect the City's parks and recreation system include the
     Conservation and Open Space, Circulation Elements and the Bicycle Transportation Plan.
2.1. Public Participation
     A key component in the update of the Parks and Recreation Element and Master Plan has been citizen input.
     Prior to the preparation of the final phase of the Master Plan, San Luis Obispo citizens had a variety of
     opportunities to comment including public hearings and an opinion survey.
                                                        As part of the needs assessment for a community center and
                                                        therapy pool, three public meetings were held to determine
                                                        unmet recreational needs. While these meetings focused on the
                                                        community center, other unmet community needs were
                                                        considered. Over 200 people attended these meetings,
                                                        representing a variety of users, organizations, and neighborhoods.
                                                        In addition, over 500 community members were interviewed at
                                                        random to gain a citywide perspective on unmet needs. The
                                                        results of the information gathering are available from the Parks
                                                        and Recreation Department in a separate document entitled “the
      Advisory Body Meeting                             Community Center/Therapy Pool Needs Assessment Study.”
2.2. Acquisition and Development
     High quality parks, recreation activities, open space, and recreational trail systems that relate to existing demand
     and changing community needs are essential for a well-balanced and healthy community. The Parks and
     Recreation Element and Master Plan focus on issues, policies and programs unique to the Parks and Recreation
     Department. Figure1 shows the location of City parks, joint use sites, other recreation facilities and open spaces.
     Chapter II describes specific recreation facilities and their individual amenities referred to in Figure 1.
                                                         Page 7-7

Chapter 7
     Parks and recreation needs must be considered in the context of all recreation services available throughout the
     community. The City of San Luis Obispo is served by:
        City parks, recreation centers, and special facilities
        Joint use sites of the City and San Luis Coastal Unified School District (S.L.C.U.S.D.) and other agencies
        Non-joint-use school sites (Churches, private, and commercial recreation facilities)
        Other governmental sites (County, State, and Federal)
     Acquisition and development priorities are derived
     from citizens preferences expressed at public hearings
     and through surveys. This data is used to help set
     priorities for acquisition of new parkland, renovation
     of existing areas, renovation of existing facilities and
     construction of new parks and facilities. Whenever
     possible, land will be acquired through donation or
     dedication by a private individual, family,
     development, or corporation.
     The priority of land acquisition will be:
       1. areas in developed areas of the community
            lacking parks,
       2. areas scheduled for developments and not yet            Damon-Garcia Sports Field
            built out, and
       3. land within identified City expansion areas.
     Recreation development will focus on renovation of existing facilities, completion of parks in built-out
     developments lacking parks, and implementation of the approved Parks and Recreation Master Plan. Facility
     development will include constructing a community center, additional sports fields, neighborhood parks,
     recreational trails, and improvements to ensure that all parks are safe and accessible.
2.3. Overall Parks and Recreation Goals And Policies
     The City's parks and recreation goals, policies and programs will guide the development of parks, sport fields, and
     other recreation facilities and activities well into the future. It is important to understand how these statements
     define and implement the Community's recreational needs. Here is how the three levels of statements differ,
     with goals at the top and being the most general statements, working down to programs, the most specific
     statements of intent:
2.4. Definition of Goals, Policies, and Programs
     Goals. Goals are desirable conditions or ends that the City will attempt to reach over the long term. They are
     general expressions of community values and intent, and therefore, not precisely measurable or action-oriented.
     Although it may not be possible to attain all goals during this element's planning period, they will guide City
     actions during this period.
     Policies. Policies are clear statements of intent that guide decision-making. They show a clear commitment by
     the City, and become the basis for specific projects and programs. Most policies have a time frame that fits
     within this element's planning period. Policies are directives to those involved in the review of projects to do or
     not do certain things. Policies often include the use of "shall" or "will" when providing directives for future
     actions.

                                                                                 Parks and Recreation
                                                                                                                 
     Programs. Programs are actions the City intends to carry out, or which the City is cooperating with other
     agencies to carry out. Programs translate goals and policies into specific projects and actions.
2.5. Statement of Overall Department Goals
     The City's Parks and Recreation facilities and programs will enable all citizens to participate in fun, healthful, or
     enriching activities which enhance the quality of life in the community.
     Recreation services shall enhance the quality of life in San Luis Obispo and meet the changing needs of residents.
2.6. Statement of Overall Department Policies
       1. Recreation services will be operated in a manner that is environmentally sensitive and that conserves
           natural resources.
       2. Recreation facilities shall be developed and operated, and services delivered in the most efficient and
           economical methods possible.
       3. Recreation facilities and activities shall be accessible to all individuals, regardless of race, religion, age,
           gender, disabilities, and income level.
       4. Recreation services shall be designed and administered to avoid duplicating commercial, private, and
           university recreation services.
       5. Recreation policies and programs shall reinforce the objectives and programs in the Conservation and
           Open Space Element, Land Use Element, Circulation Element, Bicycle Transportation Plan, and Pedestrian
           Transportation Plan.
       6. New development should contribute to the development of park facilities in proportion to the demand
           resulting from increased population.
       7. Parks and Recreation staff should provide volunteer opportunities for residents, particularly teens and
           young adults.
       8. Parks and Recreation facilities and activities should be developed, whenever possible, as collaborative
           efforts with school districts, colleges, private entities, and non-profit organizations.
       9. Open space shall be managed in such a manner as to allow for habitat conservation uses, for appropriate
           public uses and to maintain and enhance its environmental quality.
       10. Trails shall be designed as recreational amenities and shall link to appropriate parks and open spaces.
       11. Recreation services shall consider the use of technology to provide enhanced service delivery and program
           offerings.

     was upgraded in 2000. Renovation of Islay and Emerson Parks has also been completed. Purchase of land to
     accommodate athletic fields was accomplished in 2000 and design work began on the Damon-Garcia Sports
     Complex. In cooperation with the school district, six youth-sized gymnasiums have been constructed. Work has
     also begun on the implementation on the master plans for Sinsheimer and Laguna Lake Parks Specialty facilities,
     such as the Santa Rosa skate park, have been constructed.

Introduction
Section 3.12 of the Parks and Recreation Element and Master Plan identifies the areas of greatest need for new recreation
facilities. Upcoming capital projects funding requests for recreational facilities will concentrate on these needs. In
addition there are many proactive steps that can be taken to address the identified needs.
Programs
6.0.      Athletic Fields
     Program 6.0.1 Continue to improve existing fields through renovation and providing additional resources for
                      maintenance.
     Program 6.0.2 Transitions from multi-use to single use fields, centering different sports at single locations.
     Program 6.0.3 Develop joint use agreements with other public agencies, in addition to the current agreement with
                      the San Luis Coastal School District, to maximize the use of existing facilities.
     Program 6.0.4 Develop new programs, such as senior athletics, at times other than when existing athletic fields are
                      heavily used.
     Program 6.0.5 Insure that athletic fields are provided within new residential developments within the community.
     Program 6.0.6 Consider additional fields for needs not addressed by the Damon Garcia Sports Fields.
6.1.      Community Center And Therapy Pool
     Program 6.1.1 Complete the upgrades and renovation of the Recreation Center to provide an interim community
                      center.
     Program 6.1.2 Secure funding for a therapy pool to be located at the SLO Aquatics Center.
     Program 6.1.3 Consider revenue enhancement measures on a citywide basis that will fund the construction of a
                      new community center.
6.2.      Mini-Parks
     Program 6.2.1 Construct mini-parks on Purple Sage Drive [the Rodriguez Adobe] and at the corner of Marsh and
                      Santa Rosa Streets through the City’s normal Capital Improvement process.
     Program 6.2.2 Support efforts of neighborhoods lacking adequate park space to develop mini-parks.
6.3.      Trails
     Program 6.3.1 Acquire property to be preserved as open space on which trails can be constructed and maintained.
     Program 6.3.2 Use a variety of techniques to acquire open space, including: purchase, grants, donations, and
                      developer agreements.
     Program 6.3.3 Design new parks so that they can be connected by recreational trails.
     Program 6.3.4 Connect existing parks and open space areas with trails.

Chapter 7
6.4.     Other Unmet Needs
         These may include: lighted tennis courts, neighborhood parks, upgraded playground equipment, dog parks, BMX
         park, other mini-parks, and specialty facilities such as bocce ball court.
     Program 6.4.1 Schedule “unmet needs” projects for construction through the normal capital improvement
                     proceeds, as funding exists.
     Program 6.4.2 Look for alternate methods to construct some of these projects, such as community and volunteer
                     participation.
6.5.     Master Plans
     Program 6.5.1 Complete the implementation of existing master plans, such as those for Sinsheimer and Laguna
                     Lake Parks.

                                          APPENDIX C
            Park Land Acquisition and Improvement in Annexation Areas
A. OVERVIEW
    The purpose of these guidelines is to provide a framework for achieving General Plan park system goals
    in annexation areas. While these guidelines are not intended to be “hard and fast rules,” they are
    intended to provide sufficient direction to help ensure that:
  1. We clearly communicate our goals – and method for achieving them – to those proposing residential
       annexations in order to avoid any misunderstandings about development requirements and related
       costs.
  2. We achieve these goals in the most effective manner possible.
B. GENERAL PLAN POLICIES
    The General Plan sets forth two key policies regarding the City’s park system standards, and new
    development’s responsibility to pay for the cost of the park land necessary to serve it:
  3. The City shall develop and maintain a park system at the rate of 10 acres of park land per 1,000
       residents (PR 6.1.1).
  4. The costs of public facilities and services needed for new development shall be borne by the new
       development, unless the community chooses to help pay the costs for a certain development to obtain
       community-wide benefits (LU 1.14).
C. IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES
    In accordance with General Plan policies, the City will use the following guidelines in acquiring and
    improving park land whenever State law allows us to do so. This is most likely to occur in the case of
    annexations. However, these guidelines are also applicable whenever discretionary approvals of the City
    are requested, such as zone changes, general plan amendments or development agreements.
  5. Park land acquisition and improvement goal. The City will achieve a ratio of 10 acres of park per 1,000
       residents projected to reside in the annexation area. This includes land and improvements.
              a. Privately owned and maintained landscaped areas such as interior parkways and
                  community greens may be considered as contributing to this goal. This will be
                  determined on a case-by-case basis depending on the purpose and nature of such areas,
                  and the level of public access to them.
              b. School sites may also be considered as contributing towards this goal. This will be
                  determined on a case-by-case basis depending on the location of the proposed school
                  site to planned park sites, and the likelihood that the school site will be used as a “joint
                  use” facility.
              c. Open space will not typically be counted as park land in meeting the 10 acres per 1,000
                  residents standard. The City’s General Plan is clear in its distinctions between open
                  space and parks, and the purpose of these guidelines is to help implement the General
                  Plan’s park system goals, not open space goals.
  6. Property owner dedication and developer improvement requirement. Through an annexation
       agreement, the City will generally require the dedication and full improvement of required park land
       by the property owner and/or developer (applicant) as a condition of the annexation. This means that
       the City will typically not take the lead role in acquiring and improving parks in annexation areas; this is
       the applicant’s responsibility similar to the construction of other on-site, project-related infrastructure
                                               Page 7-31

Chapter 7
             improvements such as streets, sidewalks, storm drainage collection, water distribution lines and sewer
             collection lines.
          7. Acquisition and improvement phasing. The phasing of when dedication and improvements are
             required by the applicant will be set forth in the annexation agreement, specific plan or development
             plan. While this will be determined on a case-by-case basis, land dedication and improvements should
             generally be phased as follows:
                    a. Land should be dedicated upon annexation.
                    b. Phase 1 improvements (as defined in the annexation agreement, specific plan or
                         development plan) should be completed before the first certificate of occupancy is issued;
                         other improvement phases and standards may be established in the annexation
                         agreement, specific plan or development plan.
                    c. All improvements should be completed by the time that about two-thirds of the units are
                         available for occupancy.
          8. Fees in-lieu of dedication and improvement. Depending on the circumstances, the City may prefer to
             develop some portion of the required park acquisition and improvements on property that is not being
             annexed. This would generally occur when the City plans to meet part of the “10 acres per 1,000
             residents” requirement through a community-wide facility that is not located in the annexation area,
             or when the annexation area is not large enough to dedicate and improve a meaningful amount of
             park land. Whenever fees are paid in lieu of dedicating and improving park land, they will be:
                    a. Restricted solely for park land acquisition and improvement.
                    b. Determined, assessed, collected and accounted for in a manner consistent with state
                         requirements for development impact fees as set forth in AB 1600.
                    c. Used for park land and improvements that directly serve the annexation area, unless a
                         finding is made that the area is already adequately served by existing neighborhood
                         facilities. In this case, fees will be used to acquire or improve community-wide facilities.
          9. Case-by-case review. The following issues will be addressed on a case-by-case basis as part of the
             specific plan or development review process:
                    a. Amount of park land to be dedicated and improved within the annexation areas versus
                         the amount that will be met through the payment of in-lieu fees in meeting the overall goal
                         of 10 acres of parks per 1,000 residents.
                    b. Location and type of park land to be developed in the annexation area.
                    c. Value of the park land and improvements that will not be developed in the annexation,
                         and the resulting amount of fees to be paid.
                    d. Timing as to when these fees will be paid.
                    e. Timing as to when park improvements will be made by the applicant.
                    f. Distribution of any in-lieu fees between neighborhood versus community parks and
                         facilities, and the need to redress any deficit in the availability of neighborhood parks in
                         the vicinity of the annexation area.

                                                   INTRODUCTION
The City's General Plan guides the use and protection of various resources to meet community purposes. It reflects
consensus and compromise among a wide diversity of citizens' preferences, within a framework set by State law. The
General Plan contains elements that address various topics.
The City decided to adopt an element addressing water resources and wastewater services because of the vital role of
these resources and the far-reaching impacts of water policies on community growth and character. This element
translates the Land Use Element's capacity for development into potential demand for water supply and wastewater
services. This element outlines how the City plans to provide adequate water and wastewater services for its citizens,
consistent with the goals and policies of other General Plan elements.
Before adopting or revising any General Plan element, the Planning Commission and the City Council must hold public
hearings. The City publishes notices in the local newspaper and on the City’s website to let citizens know about the
hearings at least ten days before they are held. Also, the City prepares environmental documents to help citizens
understand the expected consequences of its planning policies before the hearings are held.
Anyone may suggest or apply for amendments to General Plan elements.

                                     A.        WATER MANAGEMENT
INTRODUCTION
A 1.0 Background
      The original Water and Wastewater Management Element was adopted in 1987 around the time the City
      experienced its most severe drought period which lasted from 1986 to 1991. During this point in time mandatory
      water use restrictions were instituted and restrictions on new development were imposed. Following this period,
      the City pursued additional water supplies to meet the existing water needs of the community, as well as to fulfill
      the goals of the General Plan. The policies in the Water Management section of the Element were written in a
      manner to address the water scarcity issues the City was facing. With the addition of the Nacimiento Water
      Project to the City’s water portfolio, the City has an adequate water supply to serve the community’s existing and
      future water needs as defined by the General Plan. The 2010 revisions to the Water and Wastewater
      Management Element reflect the change in the water supply situation.
A 1.1 Purpose
      The Water Management section of the Element includes goals, policies, and programs related to water supply,
      demand, and other emerging issues.

                                      MULTI-SOURCE WATER SUPPLY
A 2.0 Background
      The City is the sole water purveyor within the city limits. This allows the City to maintain uniformity of water
      service and distribution standards, and to be consistent in developing and implementing water policy. As the sole
      water purveyor, the City maintains control over water quality, distribution, and service to users of the system, as
      well as ensuring consistency with the City's General Plan policies and goals.
      The Water Element of the General Plan, adopted in 1987, identified multiple water projects to meet projected
      short and long-term water demand. Having several sources of water avoids dependence on any one source that
      may not be available during a drought or other water supply reduction or emergency. There is usually greater
      reliability and flexibility if sources are of different types (such as surface water and groundwater) and if the
      sources of one type are in different locations (such as reservoirs in different watersheds). In November of 1990,
      the Council affirmed the multi-source concept.
      Consistent with the multi-source concept, the City obtains water from five sources: Salinas Reservoir (Santa
      Margarita Lake), Whale Rock Reservoir, Nacimiento Reservoir, recycled water from the City’s Water Reclamation
      Facility (WRF), and groundwater. See Figure 1.
      Salinas Reservoir
      The Salinas Dam was built in 1941 by the War Department to supply water to Camp San Luis Obispo and,
      secondarily, to meet the water needs of the City of San Luis Obispo. The Salinas Reservoir (Santa Margarita Lake)
      captures water from a 112 square mile watershed and can store up to 23,843 acre-feet. In 1947, the Salinas Dam
      and delivery system was transferred from the regular Army to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Since the late
      40s or early 50s, the San Luis Obispo County Flood Control and Water Conservation District has operated this
      water supply for the City under a lease from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Water from the reservoir is
      pumped through the Cuesta Tunnel (a one-mile long tunnel through the mountains of the Cuesta Ridge) after
      which it flows by gravity to the City’s Water Treatment Plant on Stenner Creek Road.
      Whale Rock Reservoir
      The Whale Rock Reservoir is a 40,662 acre-foot reservoir created by the construction of an earthen dam on Old
      Creek near the town of Cayucos. The dam was designed and constructed by the State Department of Water
      Resources in 1961 to provide water to the City of San Luis Obispo, Cal Poly State University, and the California
      Men’s Colony. The Whale Rock Dam captures water from a 20.3 square mile watershed and water is delivered to
      the three agencies through 17.6 miles of 30-inch pipeline and two pumping stations. The City of San Luis Obispo
      owns 55.05 percent of the water storage rights at the reservoir. The remaining water storage rights are divided
      between the two State agencies with Cal Poly owning 33.71 percent and the California Men’s Colony owning
      11.24 percent.
      Nacimiento Reservoir
      The Nacimiento Reservoir provides flood protection and is a source of supply for groundwater recharge for the
      Salinas Valley. It is owned and operated by the Monterey County Water Resources Agency. Since 1959, the San
      Luis Obispo County Flood Control and Water Conservation District has had an entitlement to 17,500 acre-feet per
      year (AFY) of water from the reservoir for use in San Luis Obispo County. Approximately 1,750 AFY have been
      designated for uses around the lake, leaving 15,750 AFY for allocation to other areas within the County of San
      Luis Obispo.

        The County began construction in 2007 on a 45-mile pipeline project to deliver water from the Nacimiento
        Reservoir to five participating agencies and cities. The City has a contractual entitlement to 3,380 AFY of water
        from the project.
        Recycled Water
        Recycled water is highly treated wastewater approved for reuse by the California Department of Public Health for
        a variety of applications, including landscape irrigation and construction dust control. Completed in 2006, the
        Water Reuse Project created the first new source of water for the City since 1961 following construction of Whale
        Rock Dam. The Project resulted in improvements at the City’s Water Reclamation Facility and an initial eight miles
        of distribution pipeline. The City’s first delivery of recycled water took place in 2006. The City estimates demand
        exists for approximately 1,000 acre feet of recycled water for landscape irrigation and other approved uses.
        Additional information is provided on recycled water in subsections A 3.0, A 7.0, and B 3.0 of this Element.
        Groundwater
        The groundwater basin beneath the City is relatively small and recharges very quickly following normal rainfall
        periods. The groundwater basin also lowers relatively quickly during periods of below-average rainfall. Extensive
        use of groundwater sustained the City through most of the drought of 1986-1991. However, the City’s two largest
        producing wells, the Auto Parkway and Denny’s (Calle Joaquin) wells, were shut down when elevated nitrate
        levels were detected. Additionally, portions of the groundwater basin are contaminated with a chemical solvent
        (tetrachloroethylene) which would require treatment facilities to remove.
        The City operates one well for domestic potable water use that produces approximately 11 acre-feet per month
        or approximately two-percent of the City’s total water use. The City also maintains a non-potable well at the
        City’s Corporation Yard for use by contractors for construction activities such as dust control and soil compaction.
        The City’s Laguna Lake Golf Course also has two wells that meet a portion of the irrigation demand for the course.
        The remainder of the irrigation demand for the golf course is met using recycled water from the City’s Water
        Reclamation Facility.

                                                Water Resource Availability
A 3.0     Background
          As described in Section A 2.0, the City has five water resources to meet current and future City water demand:
          Salinas Reservoir (Santa Margarita Lake), Whale Rock Reservoir, Nacimiento Reservoir, recycled water from the
          City’s Water Reclamation Facility, and groundwater. In order to ensure water supply reliability, the City must
          determine the amount of water available from these water resources on an annual basis. The method to
          determine the available yield from each resource varies based on water right, contractual agreement, or the
          amount of water actually supplied.
          For Salinas and Whale Rock Reservoirs the term “safe annual yield” is used to define the annual amount of water
          available from these two resources. The two reservoirs are operated in a coordinated manner to increase the
          available water. In contrast, the “dependable yield” from Nacimiento Reservoir is the contractual amount of
          water to which the City has rights. Since Nacimiento Reservoir is operated as a water supply project for Monterey
          County, the concept of safe annual yield is not used for the City’s contractual water supply from this source. For
          recycled water, the annual amount delivered is counted in the water availability calculation. Though groundwater
          is part of the City’s water portfolio, due to the limitations on its use, the City will not consider this supply in
          estimating available water resources to meet community needs.
          Another issue the City must address is the potential impact of climate change on the City’s water resources.
          Climate change could have a significant impact on future water availability in the form of droughts or increased
          siltation in reservoirs as a result of wildland fires which could affect the safe annual yield of the City’s reservoirs.
          As research on the topic continues, the City will monitor the potential for long-term impacts to its water supply
          resources.
          The following sections provide more detail about each water resource. Table 1 is a summary of the City’s
          available water resources.

Chapter 8
     Salinas and Whale Rock Reservoirs
     For Salinas and Whale Rock Reservoirs the term “safe annual yield” is used to define the quantity of water which
     can be withdrawn every year, under critical drought conditions. The safe annual yield available from Salinas and
     Whale Rock Reservoirs is estimated by simulating the operation of these two water supply sources over a
     historical period to determine the maximum level of demand that could be met during the most severe drought
     for which records are available. The two reservoirs are operated in a coordinated manner to maximize the
     available water from these sources. Salinas Reservoir fills and spills every two to three years due to its larger
     drainage area and more favorable runoff characteristics, yet has higher evaporation rates. Whale Rock Reservoir
     fills much less frequently. The combined yield from the two reservoirs can be maximized by utilizing water from
     Salinas as the City’s primary source, and using Whale Rock as a backup source during periods when Salinas is
     below minimum pool or unable to meet all of the demand. This approach increases the long-term water supply
     from these two sources.
     Safe annual yield analyses of water supply sources are based on rainfall, evaporation, and stream flow
     experienced during a historical period. The City’s safe annual yield analysis utilizes data from 1943 through 1991
     including drought periods in 1946-51, 1959-61, 1976-77, and 1986-91. Although future conditions are unlikely to
     occur in the precise sequence and magnitudes as have occurred historically, this technique provides a
     conservative estimate of the future water supply capability of the existing sources, since the long-term historical
     record is considered a good indicator of future conditions.
     In 1988, the City contracted with the engineering firm of Leedshill-Herkenhoff, Inc., to prepare a detailed analysis
     of the City's water supplies and create a computer model to determine safe annual yield, based on coordinated
     operation of the two reservoirs. The report Coordinated Operations Study for Salinas and Whale Rock Reservoirs
     was completed in 1989. Key assumptions used in the 1988 model were that the "controlling drought period" was
     from 1946 to 1951 and that the City only used Whale Rock Reservoir when Salinas was below minimum pool or
     could not meet the City’s monthly demand. The study also assumed a minimum pool at Salinas and Whale Rock
     of 400 and 500 acre-feet respectively. The minimum pool at each lake is the amount of water that must be left in
     the lake for fishery and habitat resources. The current minimum pool established for each lake is 2,000 acre feet.
     The study estimated the City’s total safe annual yield from the two reservoirs to be 9,080 acre-feet per year. This
     amount was never adopted by Council since the study period was only to 1988 and the City was then in a drought
     period of unknown length.
     In 1991, staff updated the computer model to examine the impact of the 1986-1991 drought on safe annual yield
     and revise the assumptions on the amount of water used from Whale Rock Reservoir each year to more
     accurately reflect the way the City actually used that resource. The analysis determined that the 1986-91 drought
     was the critical drought of record for the two reservoirs. These revised assumptions resulted in a reduction in the
     safe annual yield estimate.
     The City’s safe annual yield for 2010, from the coordinated operation of Salinas and Whale Rock Reservoirs is
     6,940 acre feet. This includes reductions due to siltation at both reservoirs to the year 2010. Future losses due to
     siltation are addressed in Section 4.0 of this Element.

Nacimiento Reservoir
The “dependable yield” from Nacimiento Reservoir is the contractual amount of water that the City has rights to
from Nacimiento Reservoir. This amount is 3,380 acre-feet per year. The San Luis Obispo County Flood Control
and Water Conservation District (County) has held an entitlement to 17,500 acre-feet of water from Nacimiento
Lake since 1959. Since that time, a small portion has been dedicated for uses in the immediate areas around the
Lake. Several times in the past, the County has evaluated opportunities for utilizing water to meet identified
needs throughout the County. In the early 1990’s, the City was facing dire drought conditions and dwindling
water supplies and was considering building an emergency water supply project on its own to provide a new
water source. The City requested the County allocate 3,000 acre feet to the City on a permanent basis. While the
County denied this request, this triggered the initiation of investigations on a county-wide basis for separate
contracts for use of the available water from Nacimiento Reservoir.
Engineering studies, environmental impact reports, dependable yield analyses, and preliminary design reports
were undertaken in an effort to meet the various water needs within the County. In 2004, the County requested
interested agencies to approve the contractual agreements for participation in the Nacimiento Project. The four
initial project participants included the cities of San Luis Obispo and Paso Robles, the Atascadero Mutual Water
Company, and the Templeton Community Services District. All of these agencies executed participation
agreements with San Luis Obispo County for entitlements of water which totaled 9,630 acre feet. Since 2004, the
County Service Area 10A, which serves the southern portion of Cayucos, has become a project participant (25
AFY). In addition, 1,750 acre-feet was reserved for uses around the lake.
On June 29, 2004, the City Council authorized participation in the Nacimiento Water Project for the delivery of
3,380 acre-feet of water. This amount is considered to be the City’s dependable yield from this water source and
will be utilized to meet existing and future water demands based on analyses prepared during the Nacimiento
Project planning process (“Nacimiento Reservoir Reliability as a Water Source for San Luis Obispo County”, Boyle
Engineering Corporation, October 2002).
Recycled Water
With an average influent flow of just under 4.6 million gallons per day (2009), the City’s Water Reclamation
Facility produces over 5,100 acre-feet of disinfected tertiary-treated effluent per year. A minimum of 1,807 acre-
feet is discharged to San Luis Obispo Creek annually to provide satisfactory habitat and flow volume for fish
species (steelhead trout) within the San Luis Obispo Creek environment. The balance makes up the City’s
available recycled water resource (See Table 2) which is available for approved uses including:
       Landscape and golf course irrigation
       Wetlands, wildlife habitat, stream augmentation
       Groundwater recharge
       Toilet flushing
       Vehicle washing
       Surface irrigation of orchards and vineyards
       Landscape impoundments
       Industrial cooling processes
       Food crop irrigation

Plan Buildout 2
 Notes:
 1. As a condition of approval of the City's Water Reuse Project by the National Marine Fisheries Service in 2005, the City is required to
      maintain a minimum average daily release, year-round, of treated effluent to San Luis Obispo Creek at a rate of 2.5 cubic feet per second
      (cfs), or 1.6129 million gallons per day (mgd) to provide satisfactory habitat and flow volume for anadromous fish species (steelhead
      trout) within the San Luis Obispo Creek environment. This totals a minimum of 1,807 acre feet per year. The City monitors the release of
      effluent through an effluent meter at the WRF and a stream gauge in San Luis Obispo Creek.
 2. Master planning for the expansion of the WRF to accommodate General Plan buildout is underway in 2010. When the WRF is expanded in
      the future it will have an estimated treatment capacity of 5.8 mgd.

           At this time (2010), the City assumes that irrigation will continue to be the primary use of recycled water. Based
           on a market assessment, potential customer surveys, and water demand estimates for the Margarita, Airport,
           and Orcutt Specific Plan areas the City estimates that demand will exist for approximately 1,000 acre-feet of
           recycled water annually. Irrigation demand is seasonal, with approximately 60 percent of recycled water
           deliveries occurring over a three-month period (June through August).
           Additional background information on recycled water, as well as applicable goals, policies and programs, is
           provided in subsection A 7.0 of the Water Section and subsection B 3.0 of the Wastewater Management Section.
A 3.1      Goal
           Manage the City’s water resources to meet the current and future water demand requirements associated with
           development envisioned by the General Plan.
A 3.2      Policies
A 3.2.1          Basis for Planning
                 The City will plan for future development through the Land Use Element taking into consideration available
                 water resources from the Salinas, Whale Rock, and Nacimiento Reservoirs and recycled water.
A 3.2.2          Coordinated Operation
                 The City will coordinate the operation of the Salinas, Whale Rock, and Nacimiento Reservoirs to maximize
                 available water resources.
A 3.2.3          Groundwater
                 Due to limitations for the use of the groundwater resources, the City will continue to use groundwater for
                 domestic purposes when available, but will not consider this source of supply as part of its water resource
                 availability.

                                                     SILTATION
A 4.0 Background
      Siltation at reservoirs is a natural occurrence that can reduce the storage capacity over long periods. The
      reduction of available storage reduces the safe annual yield of the reservoirs. Siltation at reservoirs varies
      depending on factors such as rainfall intensity and watershed management practices. Numerous studies and
      reports addressing siltation at Salinas Reservoir have been completed, but no studies have been done for Whale
      Rock Reservoir.
      During the drought period ending in 1991, water at Salinas Reservoir fell to record low levels. Recognizing the
      unique opportunity presented by the low water level, the County of San Luis Obispo contracted with a local
      engineering consultant to provide an aerial survey of the lake and prepare revised storage capacity information.
      Early studies indicated average annual siltation rates from 23 acre-feet per year to 34 acre-feet per year. The
      study done by the U.S. Geological Survey in 1975 estimated that the siltation rate was approximately 82 acre-feet
      per year. The 1990 analysis conducted by the County of San Luis Obispo indicates that the siltation rate is on the
      order of 40 acre-feet per year.
      It should be noted that siltation impacts to the reservoirs are a long-term impact to the resources and should be
      considered in the City’s long range plans for adequate water resources. At an annual siltation rate of 40 AFY at
      each reservoir, it would take approximately 530 years to fill up the Salinas Reservoir and 960 years to fill up
      Whale Rock Reservoir. Siltation does not occur uniformly over time but the situation should continue to be
      monitored into the future.
      The City has recognized the need to evaluate the siltation rates at Whale Rock Reservoir and has identified
      funding in fiscal year 2011-12 to conduct the study. Since no information is available to indicate what rate of
      siltation is occurring at the Whale Rock Reservoir at this point, it is assumed for planning purposes that the
      annual average rate of siltation is similar to Salinas Reservoir.
      The safe annual yield from the two reservoirs will be continually reduced as a result of siltation. The City’s
      computer model can be used to calculate the reduction in safe annual yield from Salinas and Whale Rock
      reservoirs to-date, which is reflected in the safe annual yield amount in Section A 3.0 which accounts for
      estimated siltation losses to 2010.
      Since the storage capacity for Salinas Reservoir was last estimated in 1990, the annual loss of 40 acre-feet per
      year can be applied from that date. However, since siltation at Whale Rock Reservoir has never been factored
      into the total available water storage, the loss of 40 acre-feet per year would apply to the period since the
      reservoir was constructed in 1961.
      The estimated loss in storage capacity for Salinas Reservoir between 1990 and 2010 is 800 acre-feet. The
      estimated loss at Whale Rock Reservoir between 1961 and 2010 is 1,960 acre-feet. Based on these reduced
      storage capacities, the computer model was used to estimate the safe annual yield from the combined operation
      of the two reservoirs. With an estimated loss of 40 acre-feet per year at each reservoir, the total safe annual yield
      from the two reservoirs is estimated to be reduced by 10 acre-feet per year.

A 4.1   Goals
A 4.1.1     Accurately account for siltation in the Salinas and Whale Rock Reservoirs.
A 4.1.2     Recognize and account for future projected water losses due to siltation at Salinas and Whale Rock
            Reservoirs.
A 4.2   Policies
A 4.2.1     Accounting for Past Siltation
            The City shall account for siltation losses that have occurred to date (2010) in the safe annual yield from
            Salinas and Whale Rock Reservoirs.
A 4.2.2     Accounting for Future Siltation
            The City will account for estimated safe annual yield losses at Salinas and Whale Rock Reservoirs for the next
            50 years (2060) by deducting 500 acre feet of available water supplies to account for these future losses. The
            siltation rate will be updated as information becomes available from subsequent siltation analyses.
A 4.3   Programs
A 4.3.1     Work cooperatively with other agencies and/or watershed management groups, including the County of San
            Luis Obispo and Resource Conservation Districts, implementing best management practices (BMPs) to reduce
            erosion and subsequent siltation consistent with other City watershed management goals and water quality
            objectives included in the Conservation and Open Space Element.
A 4.3.2     Continue public education and outreach to property owners in the watersheds above the reservoirs to
            encourage practices that reduce erosion and other practices that could impact siltation or water quality in
            the reservoirs.
A 4.3.3     Consider periodic siltation studies at each reservoir to evaluate and document the impacts associated with
            siltation.
A 4.3.4     An update on siltation at the City’s reservoirs will be provided to the City Council as part of the annual Water
            Resources Status Report.

Chapter 8
            WATER SUPPLY ACCOUNTING AND DEMAND PROJECTION
A 5.0 Background
      The City is located in a Mediterranean climate that is prone to drought. As a result, the City has experienced
      serious water supply deficits. In 1991, during an extended drought, the community was within 18 months of
      running out of water in Salinas and Whale Rock Reservoirs. In fact, Salinas Reservoir was below minimum pool
      and was not available to the City toward the end of this drought period. In 1996, citizens voted to incorporate
      Section 909 into the City’s Charter identifying a water reliability reserve. In an effort to reduce the impacts of
      drought on the community, the City Council has enacted numerous water policies to strengthen its water
      resources portfolio. The City will account for water supplies necessary to meet three specific community needs:1)
      primary water supply, 2) reliability reserve, and 3) secondary water supply.
         1. Primary water supply is the amount needed to meet the General Plan build-out of the City. The quantity of
             water needed for the City’s primary water supply needs is calculated using a ten-year average of actual
             per-capita water use and the City’s build-out population.
         2. Reliability reserve provides a buffer for future unforeseen or unpredictable long-term impacts to the City’s
             available water resources such as loss of yield from an existing water supply source and impacts due to
             climate change.
         3. Secondary water supply is the amount needed to meet peak water demand periods or short-term loss of
             City water supply sources. The City’s secondary water supply is identified as any water supply resources
             above those needed to meet the primary water supply and reliability reserve.
      In order to support growth projections and other goals of the General Plan, the City must project how much
      water will be needed to serve residents, businesses, and other users. This can be done by using different
      methods, all of which involve assumptions about future usage rates and the numbers and types of users expected
      in the future. There will always be some uncertainty in estimating development capacity (such as the number of
      dwellings or residents) as well as the usage per customer type (such as acre-feet per dwelling or per resident).
      The estimating method must use reasonable assumptions, based on experience, to assure an adequate level of
      water supply while not overstating demands.
      As shown in Figure 2, the City’s historical per capita usage water use has ranged from a high of 182 gallons per
      capita per day (gpcd) in 1987 to a low of 86 gpcd in 1991 (during mandatory water rationing). To project the City’s
      primary water supply and reliability reserve into the future, an average per capita water use rate will be used,
      moderated by the use of the ten-year running average to normalize weather events. In 2010, the ten-year
      average is 123.2 gpcd as shown in Table 3, Population and Water Use. This water use rate is used with the City’s
      build-out population and current population to project the primary water supply and reliability reserve. The City’s
      remaining water resources make up secondary water supply, as shown in Table 4.

      to 2060.
2. Primary Water Supply was calculated using the City’s buildout population (57,200, per Land Use Element, Table 2, Anticipated City
      Population Growth, 2006) and the water use rate of 123.2 gallons per capita per day (a ten-year running average of the City’s actual per
      capita water use), per policy A 5.2.2.
3. Reliability Reserve was calculated using the City’s 2010 population (44,948, per CA Dept. of Finance, E-4 Population Estimates for Cities,
      Counties and the State, 2001-2010, with 2000 Benchmark. Sacramento, CA, May 2010) and 20 percent of the water use rate of 123.2
      gallons per capita per day (a ten-year running average of the City’s actual per capita water use), per policy A 5.2.3.

A 5.1.1          Identify and meet the City’s multi- source water supply needs.
A 5.1.2          Accurately forecast future water demand for planning purposes.
A 5.2       Policies
A 5.2.1          Water Use Rate
                 The City will calculate the per capita water use rate based on a ten-year running average of the City’s actual
                 per capita water use.
A 5.2.2          Primary Water Supply
                 The City shall establish the amount of water needed for General Plan build-out using the water use rate
                 established in Policy A 5.2.1 multiplied by the projected General Plan build-out population identified in the
                 Land Use Element.
A 5.2.3          Reliability Reserve
                 The City will establish a reliability reserve that is 20-percent of the water use rate established in Policy A 5.2.1
                 multiplied by the current population. The water supply designated as the reliability reserve may not be used
                 to serve future development.

                                         WATER CONSERVATION
A 6.0 Background
      Water conservation was first referenced as a part of the City's water management policy in 1973. In 1985, the
      City adopted the Annual Water Operational Plan policy establishing water conservation as a means of extending
      water supplies during projected water shortages. Since 1985, many technological and philosophical changes have
      occurred which are proving water conservation to be both a short-term corrective measure for immediate water
      supply shortages and a long-term solution to water supply reliability.
      Because of the experience during the drought of 1986 to 1991, the City developed a Water Shortage Contingency
      Plan (Plan) to deal with immediate, short-term water shortages. The Plan is designed to require mandatory
      actions when there is a projected three year supply of water remaining from available water resources. The Plan
      uses a combination of water allocations based on customer classification and water use surcharges for exceeding
      the allocation as a means to decrease water use during critical water shortages. For instance, residential
      customers are given a water allocation based on the average water use for multi- or single-family households
      having three occupants. If there are more residents, additional water may be allocated with sufficient proof.
      Commercial customers are allocated water either by a reduction based on their historical water use or by the
      average water use by business type. Surcharges for exceeding a water allocation results in their bill either
      doubling or tripling depending on the actual amount of water used. The Plan is also a required component of the
      City’s Urban Water Management Plan which is updated every five years per State Water Code.
      The City also recognizes the importance of long-term water efficiency by supporting programs that will enhance
      water supply reliability and comply with any current and/or future state mandates in water use reductions. In
      2009, Senate Bill X7-7 was passed requiring water agencies to reduce per capita water use by 20 percent by the
      year 2020. There are three options (with a fourth being developed) on how to determine the year 2020 target for
      the City. Using the methodology which best corresponds to the City’s situation and recognizes the City’s past
      investment in conservation, the City’s target per capita water use would be 117 gpcd which is an additional five
      percent reduction from 2010 per capita water use.
      In terms of water supply reliability the City was one of the original signatories to the Memorandum of
      Understanding Regarding Urban Water Conservation (MOU) and has actively pursued the implementation of the
      water efficiency best management practices (BMPs) prescribed in the MOU. The MOU was a negotiated
      agreement between water purveyors statewide and environmental organizations on how best to utilize the
      State’s water resources by incorporating conservation into their water management practices.
      The BMPs have been developed over the years by water purveyors, environmental groups, and industry
      stakeholders. They represent the best available water conservation practices based on research and experience
      and include:
            Water conservation pricing and rate structures
            Technical assistance for water customers
            Incentives for indoor and outdoor water saving technologies
            Public information and outreach
            Water audits

        Additionally, the City has adopted the Ahwahnee Principles as part of the General Plan’s Conservation and Open
        Space Element (COSE). The water conservation components of the principles align with both the indoor and
        outdoor water conservation BMPs.
        In the future, the City will reevaluate and update its water conservation efforts in response to changing water
        demand, supplies, technology, and economic conditions.
A 6.1   Goal
        The efficient use of the City’s water resources to protect both short- and long-term water supply reliability.
A 6.2   Policies
A 6.2.1      Long-term Water Efficiency
             The City will implement water-efficiency programs which are consistent with accepted best management
             practices and comply with any State-mandated water use reductions.
A 6.2.2      Short-term Water Shortages
             Mandatory water conservation measures as described in the City’s Water Shortage Contingency Plan will be
             implemented when the City's water supplies are projected to last three years or less.
A 6.3   Programs
A 6.3.1      Work cooperatively with other San Luis Obispo County water agencies to identify cooperative water
             efficiency measures that can be implemented in each jurisdiction.
A 6.3.2      Participate in State and regional water conservation efforts and research and development opportunities.
A 6.3.3      Implement the Water Shortage Contingency Plan as required.

                                              RECYCLED WATER
A 7.0 Background
      Water recycling was envisioned as part of the City’s overall water supply strategy since the 1980’s. In 1994, the
      City completed a major capital improvement project at the Water Reclamation Facility that included addition of
      tertiary treatment and other unit processes required to meet stringent effluent quality limits intended to protect
      and enhance the receiving waters of San Luis Obispo Creek. While a municipal water reuse program was
      envisioned at the time of this upgrade, the City did not receive regulatory approvals for diversion of treated
      effluent for off-site landscape irrigation and other approved uses until 2002.
      The City’s 2004 Water Reuse Master Plan identifies the areas of the City to be served with recycled water (See
      Figure 3, Water Reuse Master Plan Area and Distribution System), as well as potential customers and anticipated
      future recycled water demand.
      The City completed construction of the Water Reuse Project in 2006 which included:
            A diversion structure and modulating control valve to split the effluent flow between the recycled water
             tank and San Luis Obispo Creek.
            A new 220,000-gallon chlorine contact tank to meet recycled water disinfection requirements which differ
             from those for discharge to San Luis Obispo Creek.
            A new 600,000 gallon buried concrete recycled water storage tank to provide the storage necessary for
             operation of the distribution system.
            A pump station to deliver recycled water into the distribution system. It included two 40-horsepower and
             three 120-horsepower variable speed pumps and was designed to accommodate two additional 120
             horsepower pumps for a future capacity expansion.
      The Water Reuse Project also included the initial eight miles of the recycled water distribution system with two
      main branches, as described below:
             West Branch: The west branch extends west from the WRF under Highway 101, then along Calle Joaquin to
             Los Osos Valley Road (LOVR) to near the westerly city limits on LOVR. There is a secondary branch which
             extends from LOVR along Madonna Road to Laguna Lake Park.
             East Branch: The east branch begins at the WRF and follows Prado Road easterly to the city limits, then
             along existing easements to Broad Street, thence southerly along Broad to Tank Farm Road, then easterly
             to the terminus at Islay Hills Park.
      Recycled water deliveries began in October 2006. In 2009, recycled water was delivered to 17 sites with total
      usage over 130 acre feet per year (See Table 5). Additional sites continue to be connected to the recycled water
      distribution system through retrofits of existing irrigation systems as well as the irrigation systems associated
      with new development in the area. In the future, recycled water will be delivered to development in the Airport,
      Margarita, and Orcutt specific plan areas. Recycled water will be used for the irrigation of parks, streetscape, and
      median landscaping, common area (homeowners association) landscaping, and landscaping in commercial
      centers, industrial areas, and business parks.

                              B.       WASTEWATER MANAGEMENT
INTRODUCTION
B 1.0 Background
      The Wastewater Management section was first incorporated into the Water and Wastewater Management
      Element of the General Plan in 1987. The City owns and operates, under regulatory permits, a wastewater
      collection system and a water reclamation facility that produces recycled water. In order to adequately maintain
      the systems, meet the needs of the community, and meet increasingly stringent regulations the City implements
      infrastructure replacement and upgrade projects at the Water Reclamation Facility (WRF) and throughout the
      wastewater collection system. It also has a pretreatment program.
B 1.1 Purpose
      This section of the Water and Wastewater Management Element establishes goals, policies, and programs to
      ensure provision of adequate sanitary sewer infrastructure and wastewater treatment capacity to accommodate
      existing and future development in order to protect public health, human safety, and the environment.

WASTEWATER SERVICE
B 2.0      Background
           The City is the sole provider of wastewater service within the City. The service provides collection and treatment
           for residential, commercial, and industrial users on properties within the city limits. In 2010, the number of
           service connections is estimated to be 14,400. Through agreement, the City also provides service to the San Luis
           Obispo campus of California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) and the County of San Luis Obispo Airport.
           The collection system is primarily a gravity flow system. Where gravity flow is not feasible due to the topography,
           wastewater lift stations and pressurized force mains are used to move wastewater to the City’s Water
           Reclamation Facility (WRF) on Prado Road. Sewer pipelines measure from six inches to 48 inches in diameter.
           As shown in Figure 4, dry-weather flow to the WRF over the past nine years has ranged from 4.08 mgd to 5.12
           mgd during October. In 2010, the WRF is designed for an average dry-weather flow of 5.2 million gallons per day
           (mgd). Instantaneous peak flows exceeding 20 mgd are not uncommon during storm events due to infiltration
           and inflow into the wastewater collection system, discussed further in subsection B 4.0. As the City grows to its
           build-out population outlined in the Land Use Element, the average dry-weather flow of wastewater is expected
           to reach 5.8 mgd. In 2010, master planning for the expansion of the WRF to accommodate General Plan buildout
           is underway. When the WRF is expanded in the future it will have an estimated treatment capacity of 5.8 mgd.

B 2.1   Goal
        Adequate wastewater collection and treatment service to meet the long-term needs of the City.
B 2.2   Policies
B 2.2.1     Service Outside the City Limits
            To receive City wastewater service, property must be annexed to the City. The City Council may authorize
            exceptions to this policy provided it is found to be consistent with the General Plan.
B 2.2.2     Service Capacity
            The City's wastewater collection system and Water Reclamation Facility shall support population and related
            service demands consistent with the General Plan.
B 2.2.3     Wastewater Service for New Development
            New development shall pay its proportionate or “fair share” of expanded treatment and collection system
            capacity and upgrades. New development will only be permitted if adequate capacity is available within the
            wastewater collection system and/or Water Reclamation Facility.
B 2.2.4     City as Exclusive Provider
            The City will be the only provider of public wastewater treatment within the City (but on-site pretreatment of
            wastewater to meet City Standards may be required).
B 2.3   Programs
B 2.3.1     Expand capacity in the City’s collection system and Water Reclamation Facility in support of projected
            wastewater flows.
B 2.3.2     Evaluate the potential for the wastewater flows of a proposed project to exceed the capacity of collection
            and treatment systems.
B 2.3.3     The City will conduct periodic updates to its wastewater development impact fees.

WASTEWATER TREATMENT
B 3.0   Background
        The Water Reclamation Facility (WRF) processes wastewater in accordance with standards set by the State's
        Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB). The RWQCB issues a permit to the City under the National
        Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), setting standards for the discharge of treated wastewater. The
        standards are to protect beneficial uses of the receiving water (San Luis Obispo Creek) including recreation,
        agricultural supply, and fish and wildlife habitat.
        The WRF removes solids, reduces the amount of nutrients, and eliminates bacteria in the treated wastewater
        which is then discharged into San Luis Obispo Creek. Solids are separated and treated, to create biosolids.
        Biosolids are beneficially reused as compost, and/or soil amendment. As described in Section A 7.0, the WRF has
        been producing tertiary treated recycled water for delivery to water customers in the City since 2006.
B 3.1   Goals
B 3.1.1     Wastewater treatment that meets or exceeds regulatory requirements and ensures the protection of public
            health and the environment.
B 3.1.2     A high-quality, dependable recycled water supply that meets an increasing portion of the City’s non-potable
            demand.
B 3.2   Policies
B 3.2.1     Treating Wastewater
            The City will treat all wastewater in compliance with approved discharge permits.
B 3.2.2     Recycled Water Production
            The City will produce high-quality, dependable recycled water, suitable for a wide range of non-potable uses.
B 3.2.3     Beneficial Use
            The City will pursue treatment and disposal methods which provide for further beneficial use of wastewater
            and biosolids.
B 3.3   Programs
B 3.3.1     Prepare and implement Water Reclamation Facility master plan consistent with regulatory requirements.
B 3.3.2     Work cooperatively on regional water quality issues.

                                                                  Water and Wastewater Element
                                                                                                                  
COLLECTION SYSTEM
B 4.0 Background
      The first sanitary sewers were built in San Luis Obispo in the late 1800s. Today portions of the collection system
      are over 100 years old. It includes nine lift stations, approximately 135 miles of gravity sewer line and three miles
      of force main. Approximately 2,900 manholes provide access to the collection system. The sewer lines are made
      of a variety of materials, including terra cotta salt-glazed pipe, vitrified clay pipe (VCP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC),
      and asbestos concrete.
      The City’s wastewater collection system requires maintenance to ensure uninterrupted flows and minimize
      sanitary sewer overflows. Area and preventive maintenance programs are regularly evaluated to ensure their
      effectiveness. The City also utilizes video inspection to prioritize problem areas for replacement, maintenance,
      assess overall mainline conditions, conduct inflow and infiltration evaluations, and assess new construction.
      The City issues discharge permits to and conducts inspections of facilities that have the potential to discharge
      pollutants in concentrations that could pose a threat to worker safety, the wastewater collection system, and/or
      the Water Reclamation Facility. Through its Pretreatment Program, the City also implements programs to target
      constituents of special concern.
      Like most cities in California, San Luis Obispo has separate sewer and storm drain systems. This means each
      system of pipes in the ground is designed to accommodate either sewer or stormwater flows. One set of pipes
      takes sanitary waste to the Water Reclamation Facility while a second set carries stormwater runoff from street
      drains directly into bioswales, detention basins, or creeks.
      The City’s wastewater collection system and the WRF have long experienced problems associated with wet
      weather infiltration and inflow (I & I). Inflow is water that enters the collection system at points of direct
      connection (non-soil) such as around manhole covers or through illegal connection of roof drains, downspouts, or
      landscape drains. Infiltration is water that flows through the ground into the collection system usually through
      cracks in public sewer mains and/or private sewer laterals (See Figure 5). I & I overloads the collection system
      during heavy rains and can result in sanitary sewer overflows. During periods of significant rain events, the WRF
      can become hydraulically overwhelmed (as mentioned previously, instantaneous peak flows exceeding 20 mgd
      are not uncommon during storm events) increasing the chance of effluent violations and the release of partially
      treated wastewater to San Luis Obispo Creek. Table 6 includes data on the highest average daily flows
      experienced at the WRF during rain events over a nine-year period.

  Agricultural land is generally open land where there has been a history of agricultural cultivation or keeping of
  livestock, which remains generally open, and if located within the City limits, is a specific land use designation in
  the General Plan Land Use Element.
  Alternative Forms of Transportation
  Alternative Forms of Transportation are transportation modes other than single-occupant vehicles, including
  buses, bicycles, car and van pools, and walking.
  Annexation
  Annexation is the extension of the City limits, to increase the area which is subject to City laws and, sometimes,
  eligible for City utilities and services. Annexations are acted on by the Local Agency Formation Commission,
  according procedures and standards in State law. This commission is made up of two members of the County
  Board of Supervisors, two members of councils of the cities within the County, and a public member.

     Average Vehicle Ridership (AVR)
     Average Vehicle Ridership (AVR) is a number derived by dividing the number of people in a geographic area or at
     a specific site by the number of cars that they drive to that location. For example:
     If 100 people work at a site and they all drive a car to work, then AVR = 1.0 (100 people divided by 100 cars). If
     100 people work at a site but only 50 drive cars and the rest use alternative forms of transportation, then AVR =
     2.0 (100 people divided by 50 cars)

  Building Intensity
  Building intensity is a measure of the amount of floor space in relation to site area. It is expressed as the ratio of
  gross building floor area to site area. For example, where a ratio of 1.0 is allowed, building floor area can equal
  site area. In this example, a one-story building could cover the entire site (except any required setbacks), a two-
  story building could cover one-half the site, or a three-story building could cover one-third of the site. (See also
  "density.")

  That level of urban development characterized by full occupancy of all developable sites within the City’s Urban
  Reserve, in accordance with the General Plan; the maximum level of development anticipated by the General
  Plan. Build-out does not assume that each parcel is developed with the maximum floor area or dwelling units
  possible under zoning regulations.

     and on-going activities.
     Conservation, Energy
     Energy Conservation means the use of less energy in any form than would otherwise occur. It may be
     accomplished by greater efficiency (for example, more miles per gallon) or reduced activity (for example, going to
     a nearby park instead of a distant park).
     Conservation Plan
     Conservation Plan is a document prepared by the City or a City designated representative which specifies the care
     and management of specific open space sites or areas, in compliance with the General Plan. This plan outlines
     resources existing on the site, resource preservation, allowed recreational uses, and other similar programs.
     Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions (CC&Rs)
     Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions (CC&Rs). Restrictions or requirements that are placed on a property and
     its use by a property owner, usually as a condition of subdivision approval. CC&Rs are deed restrictions that “run
     with the land” and are legally binding.
     Creek
     Creek is a waterway or portion of a waterway so designated on the Conservation and Open Space Element "Creek
     Map," or other source as defined in the Conservation and Open Space Element; creek includes a natural
     watercourse or altered natural watercourse where water flows in a definite channel, with a bed and banks.
     Drainage ditches, concrete swales, underground culverts and storm drains are not considered creeks. Creeks
     located in the greenbelt or Outer Planning Area are as designated by the USGS 7.5 Minute series quadrangle
     maps or San Luis Obispo County data.
     Creek Corridor
     Creek corridor is that area of the creek between physical top of bank on one side of the creek and physical top of
     bank on the other side of the creek, or the area between the outer edge of the riparian vegetation on one side of
     the creek to the outer edge of the riparian vegetation on the other side of the creek (whichever is greater).

  Creek Maintenance
  Creek maintenance means work within a creek corridor that involves the trimming of vegetation, the use of
  herbicides or pesticides, removing debris or trash, removing vegetation necessary to maintain flood control, or
  similar maintenance activities. Projects that involve creek alterations should not be considered creek
  maintenance.
  Creek Restoration
  Creek restoration is the process of restoring a creek to a more natural condition. Restoration includes planting
  native riparian vegetation, removing wildlife barriers, providing fish ladders, removing debris and trash, removing
  invasive non-native creek species, grading and changes to the creek associated with creek restoration work, and
  other similar activities. Creek restoration is not considered development.
  Creek Setback
  Creek setback means the minimum distance that development must be located from a creek's physical top of
  bank or the outer edge of the riparian vegetation (whichever results in a greater setback), as provided in the
  Conservation and Open Space Element and Section 17.16.025 of the Municipal Code. An adequate creek setback
  should allow for future natural changes that may occur within the creek corridor and allow adequate space for
  storm design capacity.
  Cultural Resources
  Cultural resources consist of any prehistoric or historic district, site, building, landscape, structure, or object
  included in, or eligible for local, State or National historic designation, including artifacts, records, and material
  remains related to such a property or resource. Cultural resources represent the full range of prehistory and
  history by indigenous cultures and historic American settlement in San Luis Obispo, including traditional cultural
  properties. Cultural resources also include the remains of historic settlement and development activities of Euro-
  Americans, Asians, and other non-Native cultural activities over the past 200 years.

D
  Day/Night Average Sound Level
  Day/night average sound level, abbreviated “Ldn”, is the equivalent energy (or energy average) sound level
  during a 24-hour day, obtained by adding ten decibels to sound levels between 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. The Ldn
  is generally computed for annual average conditions.
  Decibel
  Decibel, abbreviated “dB”, is a measure of sound, which people perceive as loudness. Technically, decibel is a
  unit for describing the amplitude of sound, equal to 20 times the logarithm to the base 10 of the ratio of the
  pressure of the sound measured to the reference pressure, which is 20 micropascals (20 micronewtons per
  square meter).

Chapter 9
     Density
     Density describes how many things of a certain kind occupy an area of land. Density is often expressed as the
     number of residents, dwellings, or employees per acre. In this element, it means the maximum number of
     dwellings per acre that may be allowed. (See also "building intensity.")
     Density Bonus
     An increase in the allowed base density applied to a residential development project. The increase allows the
     development of more dwellings than a property’s zoning would otherwise allow, and is usually in exchange for
     the provision or preservation of affordable housing or housing amenity.
     Density, Residential
     The number of permanent dwellings per net acre, measured in Density Units, as further described in Chapter
     17.16 of the Zoning Regulations. In the AG, C/OS and R-1 zones, each dwelling counts as one density unit. In all
     other zones, dwellings with different bedroom numbers have density unit values as follows:
     (1) Studio Apartment (450 sq. ft. or less)                       0.50 Density Unit
     (2) One-bedroom Dwelling                                         0.66 Density Unit
     (3) Two-bedroom Dwelling                                         1.00 Density Unit
     (4) Three-bedroom Dwelling                                       1.50 Density Units
     (5) Dwelling with four or more bedrooms                          2.00 Density Units
     Development
     Development means the erection of structures (including agricultural buildings and accessory structures such as
     decks and spas), the associated grading, vegetation removal, and paving associated with structures, the
     subdivision of land, mining, excavation, and drilling operations. Where creeks, wetlands, unique resources,
     sensitive habitat, and historical resources occur on-site or may be affected, development also includes
     agricultural uses (such as tilling the soil, grazing, agricultural grading, and similar uses) as well as grading (greater
     than 50 cubic yards), paving, and vegetation removal (the removal of a tree or riparian vegetation such that a
     major portion of a creek bank is exposed) whether such activities are associated with a structure or independent
     of a structure. Enhancement or restoration of a natural resource is not considered development.
     Development Limit Line

  identified by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) or the California Department of Fish and Game (F&G).
  Energy
  Energy means the capacity to change the characteristics of a material, most often its location or temperature. In
  the realm of daily life, energy is never really used up, only changed from a more useful state to a less useful state,
  with all forms eventually dissipating as heat.
  Enforceably Restricted
  Refers to housing that is deemed affordable under the City’s Affordable Housing Standards and that is subject to
  deed restrictions, affordable housing agreements or other mechanisms to ensure the housing remains affordable
  for a prescribed period.
  Enterprise Activity
  Programs in which fees and rates fully cover direct operating costs. Programs with a focus on youth and seniors
  may be subsidized by the General Fund to cover indirect costs with Council approval
  Equivalent Sound Level
  Equivalent sound level, abbreviated “Leq”, is the constant or single sound level containing the same total energy
  as a time-varying sound, over a certain time. For example, if 64 dB is measured for 10 minutes, 68 dB is
  measured for 20 minutes, and 73 dB is measured for 30 minutes, the 1-hour Leq is about 71 dB. The Leq is
  typically computed over one, eight, or 24-hour sample periods.

  Greenbelt
  Greenbelt is essentially undeveloped land beyond the City's Urban Reserve Line (as depicted on the Greenbelt
  Map). The greenbelt generally includes the City’s view shed and the northern part of the watershed for San Luis
  Obispo Creek. The greenbelt may consist of private and public property composed of (1) open space area that is
  preserved to define the limit to urban growth, (2) open space area utilized to protect natural resources, (3)
  agricultural lands and associated agricultural uses, and (4) rural lands and recreation. A greenbelt functions to
  preclude adjacent urban communities from merging together by maintaining urban growth in designated urban
  areas.
H
  Habitat Buffer
  Habitat buffer is an area around a sensitive habitat or unique resource that protects the resource from
  development or associated impacts of development. A habitat buffer should: (1) be located between sensitive
  habitat or unique resources and proposed, existing, or potential development; (2) be a sufficient width and size to
  protect the species most sensitive to development disturbances and to compensate for project impacts; and (3)
  be designed to complement the habitat value associated with the sensitive habitat or unique resource and to
  protect such resource(s).
  Hazards
  Hazards include landslides and soil creep, flooding, potentially active or active earthquake faults, liquefaction
  areas, wildland fires, and dangers associated with locating too near to an airport.

K
L
  Levels of services (LOS)
  Level of services (LOS) is a qualitative measurement of the degree of congestion on a street or at an intersection.
  LOS is described by a letter scale from A to F, with Level of Service (LOS) “A” describing a free-flowing traffic,
  while LOS “F” describing a situation of extreme congestion. LOS E occurs when the volume of traffic approaches
  the road's capacity. LOS E is characterized by low operating speeds and numerous delays with much congestion.
  LOS F represents a forced flow situation with more traffic attempting to use the road than it can handle. LOS F is
  characterized by stop-and-go traffic with numerous, lengthy delays.
  Life-cycle Cost
  Life-cycle cost means the total cost of buying and operating a building or a piece of equipment over its useful life.
  Lifelong Recreation Pursuits
  Activities that can be enjoyed by persons over a wide span of years, physical abilities and interest, such as from
  youth through one’s senior years.
  Live-Work or Work-Live Unit
  An integrated housing unit and work space, occupied and utilized by a single household in a structure, either
  single-family or multi-family, that has been designed or structurally modified to accommodate joint residential
  occupancy and work activities, and which includes: (1) complete kitchen and sanitary facilities in compliance with
  City building code, and (2) working space reserved for and regularly used by one or more occupants of the unit.
  The difference between “live-work” and “work-live” units is that the work component of a live-work unit is
  secondary to its residential use and may include only commercial activities and pursuits compatible with the
  character of a quiet residential environment, while the work component of a work-live unit is the primary use, to
  which the residential component is secondary.

     Local street is a street providing access to all or part of a neighborhood and not carrying through traffic. See also
     the Circulation Element.
     Low-Density Residential
     Low-Density Residential is a land-use category for dwellings that provide a sense of individual identity and
     neighborhood cohesion for the households occupying them, generally consisting of detached, one- or two-story
     buildings, with private outdoor space separating them from neighboring dwellings and near other uses which are
     supportive of and compatible with these dwellings.
 M
     Mainstreaming
     Mainstreaming refers to the practice of incorporating those with special needs into regular leisure programs or
     everyday activities.
     Medium Density Residential
     Medium-Density Residential is a land-use category for dwellings that provide a sense of individual identity and
     neighborhood cohesion for the households occupying them, but in a more compact arrangement than Low-
     Density Residential. Such dwellings are generally one- or two-story detached buildings on small lots, or attached
     dwellings, with some private outdoor space for each dwelling. Other uses which are supportive of and compatible
     with these dwellings, such as parks, schools, and churches, may be permitted.
     Medium-High Density Residential
     Medium-high density residential is a land-use category for attached or closely spaced dwellings, usually in
     multistory buildings, for group housing, and for other uses that are supportive of and compatible with residential
     neighborhoods.
     Mixed-Use Development
     Development in which various uses, such as office, commercial, manufacturing, institutional, and residential are
     combined in single building or in multiple buildings on a single parcel or on multiple, contiguous parcels,
     developed as integral unit with significant functional interrelationships and a coherent physical design; property
     designated “MU” on the City’s Zoning Map.
     Mitigation Banking
     Mitigation banking is a method of resource or habitat protection. It is a method for compensating for unavoidable
     impacts of development. It involves a public or private entity creating, restoring, or preserving fish, plant, and
     wildlife habitats in advance of an anticipated need for actual mitigation. When habitat areas are created a credit
     is created. When unavoidable impacts occur to habitat or a resource as a result of development, the developer
     (whether public or private) may utilize an existing credit created from previous successful habitat restoration,
     create an additional bank area, or pay a mitigation fee (as specified by the City).
     Mitigation Fee
     Mitigation fee is a fee paid to mitigate development impacts to creek, sensitive habitat, unique resource, or
     similar resources. This fee is paid to protect existing resources or buy land for the future protection of resources
     or habitat.

  Terrace Hill, Cerro San Luis, Bishop Peak, Chumash Peak, Cerro Romauldo, Hollister Peak, Cerro Cabrillo, Black Hill,
  and Morro Rock.
  Multi-Family Dwelling
  A dwelling that is part of a structure containing one or more other dwellings, or part of a non-residential use. An
  example of the latter is a mixed-use development where one or more dwellings are part of a structure that also
  contains one or more commercial uses (retail, office, etc.). Multi-family dwellings include: duplexes, triplexes,
  fourplexes (buildings under one ownership containing two, three or four dwellings, respectively, in the same
  structure); apartments (five or more units under one ownership in a single building); and townhouse
  development (three or more attached dwellings where no unit is located above another unit. It does not include
  Granny Flats or Secondary Dwelling Units.

Chapter 9
     Natural State
     Natural state means how a site would be found in nature under climax conditions and not altered appreciably by
     humans. Providing a natural state on a hillside or creek is to provide plants typical to that resource. Within a
     creek or wetland, an essentially natural state would allow some non-riparian vegetation (which would not
     negatively impact that resource) to remain or to be planted.
     Neighborhood Commercial
     Neighborhood Commercial is a commercial land-use category for businesses which primarily meet the frequent
     shopping demands of people who live nearby, such as neighborhood grocery markets and drug stores.

     Noise exposure contours are lines drawn around a noise source, indicating constant levels of noise exposure, as
     shown in the Noise Element.
     Noise Level Reduction
     Noise level reduction, abbreviated “NLR”, is the arithmetic difference between the levels of sound outside and
     inside a building, measured in decibels. For example, if the sound level outside a house is 70dB and the level
     inside a room of the house is 45 dB, the NLR is 25 dB (70 – 45 = 25).
     Noise-Sensitive Land Use
     Noise-sensitive land use means: residential land uses; hotels, motels, bed-and-breakfast inns, or hostels; schools;
     libraries; churches; hospitals and nursing homes; playgrounds and parks; theaters, auditoriums, and music halls;
     museums; meeting halls and convention facilities; professional offices; and similar uses as determined by the

     Open Space
     Open Space is land or water area which remains in a predominantly natural or undeveloped state, and is
     generally free of structures. Such lands protect and preserve the community’s natural and historical resources,
     define the urban boundary, and provide visual and physical relief from urban development. Open spaces may
     consist of small portions of a parcel, such as small wilderness preservation areas, or large tracts of land. Such
     lands may include farming and grazing; creeks, marshes, watershed and floodplains; scenic resources; plant and
     animal habitat; historic and archaeological resources; and passive recreation areas.

  architectural features to collect and store energy directly, without any external, mechanical or electrical power
  source. Such systems are nearly always used for heating or cooling space within a building. Many passive systems
  work best with some management by the occupant, such as opening windows or closing curtains.
  Peak Hour Traffic
  Peak Hour Traffic is the single time period during the day when the greatest number of vehicles is using a street.

Chapter 9
     Planning Area
     Planning area is the land within the City limits where the City can control development, as well as the area
     outside the City limits where the City is particularly concerned with land use. See Figure 1 in the Land Use
     Element.
     Practical Alternative
     Practical alternative shall mean (1) the project's basic purpose could still be accomplished either through a
     redesign or a reduction in massing, scale, or density, or (2) if changes are required to the project's design, scale,
     or density, reasonable use of the subject property could still occur. Reasonable use of the property in the case of
     new development may include less development then indicated by zoning. In the case of additional development
     on an already developed site, reasonable development may mean that no additional development is reasonable
     considering site constraints and the existing development's scale, design, or density.

     Prime farmland is the land that is best suited to producing food, feed, forage, fiber, and oilseed crops. It must
     either be used for producing food or fiber or be available for these uses. It has the soil quality, length of growing
     season, and moisture supply needed to economically produce a sustained high yield crops when it is managed
     properly. Prime farmland commonly has an adequate and dependable supply of moisture from precipitation or
     irrigation (as defined by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service, Soil Survey of San Luis
     Obispo, CA, 1984).
