1. GENERAL PLAN CONTEXT AND VISION
1.1 General Plan Purpose
      California law requires each city to adopt a comprehensive, long-term general plan
      for the physical development of the city. The general plan must be an integrated,
      internally consistent, and compatible statement of policies for the city. It serves as a
      framework for public and private development, and establishes requirements for
      additional planning studies where greater specificity is needed.
      The general plan is the constitution for the City's development, and governs all land
      use regulations, including zoning.
      The General Plan has the following purposes:
               !   To identify the community's land use, transportation, environmental,
                   economic and social goals and policies as they relate to land use,
                   conservation and development.
               !   To enable the City Council and the Planning Commission to establish
                   long-range conservation and development policies.
               !   To provide a basis for judging whether specific private development
                   proposals and public projects are in harmony with these policies.
               !   To inform citizens, developers, decision makers, and other jurisdictions
                   of the policies that will guide development and conservation within the
                   City of Manteca.
1.2 Manteca General Plan Context
      This revision of the Manteca General Plan updates the plan adopted in 1988, the last
      time the City comprehensively revised its General Plan.
      The City of Manteca, incorporated May 28, 1918, is located in the “heartland” of
      California, with historical roots as an important agricultural center. For much of the
      early 20th century, the Manteca area has been predominantly an agricultural area due
      to the excellent soil, mild climate, and access to clean water. While agriculture still

CONTEXT AND VISION                                                MANTECA GENERAL PLAN 2023
      plays an important role in Manteca’s economy, the City’s economic base has become
      more diversified with the development of industries and the influx of Bay Area
      workers seeking affordable housing.
      The preparation of this General Plan coincides with new circumstances that promise
      a bright future for Manteca.          The City is truly at a crossroads created by
      circumstances beyond its borders. If properly prepared, the City can ensure sustained
      economic growth, and maintain the existing quality of life for current and future
      residents. This General Plan defines a future based on these new circumstances.
      The new circumstances that will drive economic development in Manteca reflect
      broad changes in technology and demographic trends far beyond this community.
      Technology will change the way in which people will work, shop, and communicate
      with others socially and in business, and engage in leisure activities. These changes
      will make it more likely that individuals will choose a place to live based on quality
      of life issues, rather than traditional economic considerations.
      Regional, national and international trends present opportunities and challenges that
      can lead to the achievement of the long standing goal of a balanced economy with a
      wide range of employment opportunities and retail services. Manteca is located in
      the center of an emerging interregional metropolitan area that is undergoing an
      economic transformation. The traditional economic engine of agriculture and food
      processing, although still important, is being supplanted by warehousing and
      distribution industries that take advantage of the central location, relatively affordable
      land, and transportation network.         Manteca is also characterized by the high
      percentage of interregional commuters who are attracted by the community’s quality
      of life and relatively affordable housing.          This skilled workforce, presently
      commuting long distances, is a resource for economic development. Due in part to
      the skills of the commuter workforce, Manteca will become increasingly competitive
      for the location of manufacturing and office uses.
1.2.1 Vision 2020
      The General Plan builds upon the work of a community visioning process concluded
      in 1998.     Vision 2020, crafted by a task force of community volunteers, is a
      comprehensive statement of community goals and objectives. The Vision 2020

MANTECA GENERAL PLAN 2023                                                 CONTEXT AND VISION
      document addresses the downtown area, economic development, and residential
      development and community amenities.
1.3  Time Horizon
      This Plan guides the City to the year 2023. The "build-out," or full development,
      allowed by the General Plan is based on current projections of population and
      employment growth over the next twenty years. It is possible, however, that the total
      amount of development allowed by the Plan will not be constructed over this 20-year
      period, due to changes in economic conditions and other factors.
1.4  General Plan Study Area
      The city may include in its general plan any land outside its boundaries which relates
      to its planning. The General Plan Study Area encompasses approximately 25,975
      acres within and outside of the existing City limits. The purpose in establishing the
      Study Area boundary larger than the existing City is to identify and evaluate the areas
      surrounding the City that may affect the future economic viability, traffic, services,
      and aesthetic quality of the City.
       In addition, since many issues such as air quality, traffic and economic development,
      extend beyond political boundaries, the law provides for planning outside of the
      jurisdiction’s territory.
      The General Plan must cover all territory within its boundaries as well as “any land
      outside its boundaries which in the planning agency’s judgment bears relation to its
      planning,” (Government Code Section 65300). A local government can formally
      communicate its concerns for the future of lands under its neighbors’ jurisdictions by
      this means. “Cooperative ‘extraterritorial’ planning can be used to guide the orderly
      and efficient extension of services and utilities, ensure the preservation of open
      space, agricultural, and resource conservation lands, and establish consistent
      standards for development in the plans of adjoining jurisdictions” (State of California
      General Plan Guidelines). It is for these purposes that the City of Manteca General
      Plan Study Area boundary extends beyond the existing Sphere of Influence.
      However, the City of Manteca will not necessarily seek to initiate annexation of land
      that is either in the Sphere of Influence or the General Plan Study Area.

MANTECA GENERAL PLAN 2023                                                CONTEXT AND VISION
1.5  Organization of the General Plan
      The General Plan includes a policy document, background information, technical
      data, and an environmental impact report that evaluates the impacts of the General
      Plan on the environment.
      The Manteca General Plan includes the seven state-mandated elements and four
      optional elements. The eleven total elements that comprise this General Plan include:
              !   Land Use- establishes land use designations with types and intensities of
                  use and sets policies and programs regarding future development of the
                  City.
              !   Community Design- establishes urban design guidelines to ensure that
                  new development is attractive and contributes to the sense of Manteca as
                  a location.
              !   Circulation- contains policies for the City’s roadway system, transit,
                  pedestrian and bicycle circulation, and methods of managing
                  transportation demand, accounting for the relationship between land use
                  and circulation.
              !   Economic Development- addresses the need for Manteca to broaden its
                  employment base to maintain the high quality of life currently enjoyed
                  and implementing an economic development strategy.
              !   Housing- includes policies and programs to increase the variety and
                  types of housing in the City, emphasizing infill sites, increased density,
                  and mixed uses downtown, and also includes a discussion of housing
                  needs and programs to provide additional housing for special needs
                  populations.
              !   Public Facilities and Services- discusses public facilities including
                  domestic water, sewer, storm drainage, electricity services, solid waste,
                  education, police protection, fire protection, and parks and recreation.
              !   Safety- contains policies and programs to protect the community from
                  injury, loss of life, and property damage resulting from natural disasters
                  and hazardous conditions.
OCTOBER 6, 2003                                                                            1-5

CONTEXT AND VISION                                             MANTECA GENERAL PLAN 2023
              !    Resource Conservation- emphasizes the accommodation of population
                   growth while conserving and protecting the area’s natural resources and
                   quality of life.
              !    Noise- identifies policies that will protect the community from noise
                   hazards.
              !    Air Quality- addresses the community’s need to cooperate regionally so
                   that increased development does not further degrade the air quality.
              !    Administration
      Each General Plan element is organized in a similar format: 1) explanatory text to
      provide additional information about existing conditions or policies and programs; 2)
      the intent of the element; and 3) goals, policies, and implementation programs for
      that element.
      The key section of each element is the statement of goals, policies, and
      implementation programs. The issues addressed and goals and policies identified are
      based on input received from the community and the Steering Committee.
      The Housing Element differs slightly because State law specifies issues that must be
      addressed in housing elements. In addition to broad goals and policies, the Housing
      Element contains numeric goals for housing rehabilitation and new housing
      construction, as well as descriptions of programs the City will pursue toward those
      goals.
      Planning Goals are statements of the community’s desires and are comprised of
      broad statements of purpose or direction. The policies serve as guides to the City
      Council, Planning Commission, and City staff in their review of development
      proposals and execution of decisions that affect development.          Implementation
      actions and programs are directives that carry out General Plan policies and goals.
      Goals, policies, and implementation measures are distributed among the various
      General Plan elements. Each goal, policy, and implementation measure is numbered,
      based on the specific element. For example, in the Land Use Element goals are
      numbered as “Goal LU-1”, policies are numbered “LU-P-1”, and implementation
      measures as “LU-I-1”.

MANTECA GENERAL PLAN 2023                                                CONTEXT AND VISION
       Additional explanatory material is available in a Background Report that contains
       information and analysis for each of the topic areas covered by the General Plan. It is
       a reference document that provides the factual basis for General Plan policies.
       The Environmental Impact Report (EIR) determines the type and extent of
       environmental impacts that would result from implementation of the General Plan. It
       is a program-level analysis and identifies requirements for more detailed
       environmental analysis that may be required for site-specific projects.
1.6   Participants and Process
       The Manteca General Plan Update commenced on September 24, 2001 with a
       "kickoff" meeting at the Manteca Senior Center. From the beginning, the Manteca
       General Plan Update was aided by the leadership of an appointed Steering
       Committee. The Steering Committee had 10 regular members and 12 alternate
       members appointed by the City Council. The Steering Committee participated in
       regular meetings with staff and consultants, sponsored Public Workshops designed to
       afford members of the public opportunity to participate in General Plan development,
       and provided direction and review of the Draft General Plan.
1.7   Key Land Use Issues and Development Concepts
       The General Plan is a reflection of community vision and values, and the conditions
       that influence development of the community. This section provides a summation of
       the principle issues and concepts incorporated in this Plan.
1.7.1  Logical Growth of the City
       Manteca has generally grown in a compact pattern around the historic center of the
       city at the crossroads of Yosemite Avenue and Main Street.                 Residential
       neighborhoods have developed within boundaries established by the major streets
       spaced one mile apart. This General Plan directs land use to continue the historic
       pattern of compact urbanization. The developed portion of the city should retain its
       distinct, compact form with clear, well-defined edges.
OCTOBER 6, 2003                                                                           1-7
CONTEXT AND VISION                                                MANTECA GENERAL PLAN 2023
      The expansion of the urbanized area is enabled by the extension of basic public
      services, notably sewer, drainage and streets. The City plans the extension of these
      services through periodic preparation of various public facility master plans, such as
      water, sewer and drainage. These master plans are coordinated through a Public
      Facilities Implementation Plan (PFIP) that identifies and establishes the funding
      mechanism for specific capital improvements. The PFIP is a key to implementing
      the land use goals (Land Use Element) and public facilities goals (Public Services
      and Facilities Element) of the General Plan.
1.7.2 Community Form, Scale and Identity
      The community identity is established by important visual characteristics that provide
      cues for travelers, as well as residents. Among these are:
                   •    the scale or size of the city
                   •    well-defined edges and gateways
                   •   an identifiable pattern of streets and land uses
                   •   attractive streetscapes and public places
                   •   notable landmarks, both natural and man-made
      Attractive new land uses along the major highways, new landmarks visible from
      several vantage points throughout the city, and new gateway features along the
      highways and other major roads at city boundaries can contribute significantly to
      establishing a strong positive identity for Manteca.
      The existing commercial core area should be retained and reinforced as the functional
      and social center of the city for residents. Urbanization should generally extend
      outward from this center.
      In the future, population increases and a growing regional role for Manteca may
      generate the need for a second commercial, office, residential, institutional and
      entertainment core area east of the existing downtown. The Land Use Map identifies
      such a site designated as Commercial Mixed Use along Austin Road between
1-8                                                                       OCTOBER 6, 2003

MANTECA GENERAL PLAN 2023                                                  CONTEXT AND VISION
      Yosemite Avenue and the future extension of SR 120. This site would provide a new
      town center complex that would include employment, high density residential use,
      entertainment, and regional retail use under a comprehensive master plan.
1.7.3 Attractive, Sustainable Neighborhoods
      Neighborhoods are the fundamental organizing concept for residential land use. The
      neighborhoods are typically not more than one mile in any dimension to provide a
      reasonable walking distance from any part of the neighborhood to the schools, parks,
      and commercial centers.
      The land use in each neighborhood is predominantly residential, but will typically
      include a neighborhood school, parks, and a mixed-use commercial area that includes
      retail or commercial goods or service facilities.
      Preservation of the existing housing and enhancement of existing neighborhoods is
      important to maintaining the quality of life in the city.
1.7.4 Support of Public Transit and Bicycle and Pedestrian Circulation
      High activity areas should be located to facilitate the use of public transit.
      The organization of land use and circulation networks should permit and encourage
      walking and bicycling to major activity centers such as shopping, recreation facilities,
      and schools.     Commercial, employment, recreational and institutional land uses
      should be conveniently located near the residential neighborhoods.
1.7.5 Housing Opportunity
      The General Plan responds to the need for diversity in housing opportunity and
      changes in market demand for housing types in two primary ways.                First, the
      residential density (dwelling units per acre) categories are broadened to provide more
      flexibility and diversity in the types of dwelling units in each neighborhood.
      The Land Use Map identifies more sites distributed throughout the community for
      specific residential categories in order to ensure more diversity in the housing supply.

CONTEXT AND VISION                                                  MANTECA GENERAL PLAN 2023
1.7.6 Employment and Economic Development
      During the twenty-year horizon of this General Plan, Manteca will experience
      economic development that will add to and diversify the local economy. This will
      consist of additional growth in warehousing and distribution, but should also include
      significant new components, such as office and service sectors, research and
      development, and manufacturing.
      Increases in population have the potential to drive a demand for new retail
      establishments and local-serving professional office uses. The range of commercial
      and professional services will expand as Manteca reaches threshold populations.
      The General Plan Land responds to the needs of economic development by
      designating locations for:
                        •    warehouse, distribution and manufacturing;
                        •    business park
                        •    research and development and light manufacturing, and
                        •    a major mixed-use regional retail and service center.
      The General Plan also provides two new land use categories not previously used in
      the General Plan.       The newly-established Commercial Mixed Use (CMU) and
      Business Industrial Park (BIP) categories are intended to expand the opportunities for
      economic development by providing opportunities to integrate high density
      residential, office and retail/service uses on a single site.
1.7.7 Live/Work Housing
      It is anticipated that the percentage of individuals working at home will increase over
      the next twenty years. At home workers may include telecommuters, professional
      services, small service businesses, mail order, and any number of other
      entrepreneurial endeavors. It is the intent of this General Plan to support such
      activities. The residential design policies provide the flexibility to include most types
      of small business within the premises, and the mixed use commercial sites are
1-10                                                                         OCTOBER 6, 2003

MANTECA GENERAL PLAN 2023                                                 CONTEXT AND VISION
      intended to include services and facilities that would support workers in the
      neighborhood. Such support services include technical services, such as copy and
      secretarial services, teleconferencing centers and day care. The commercial sites will
      also typically contain coffee shops and plazas that provide a social setting for people
      who work at home.
1.7.8 Public Services and Fiscal Stability
      Growth will provide additional revenue sources, but will also place additional service
      burdens on the City of Manteca. The challenge is to balance growth with funds for
      required new services. The Land Use Element provides a mix of land use categories
      and implementation measures to ensure that the overall balance of land use is
      sustained over time.
      The City will monitor the mix of land use to gauge future decisions on land use,
      public service levels and capital investments.
1.7.9 Access to Open Space
      Existing open space is found in the neighborhood parks, a few agricultural areas
      within and on the perimeter of the urban area, and the utility corridors.
      The city is surrounded by agricultural land that provides visual open space on the
      north, east and south. Agricultural activity has significantly altered most of the
      natural features that predated the urban development of the area. Consequently, there
      are no natural drainage ways, significant stands of trees, or other natural features that
      would guide or provide the core of an open space network within the city.
      In the absence of natural features that could define an open space network, the
      General Plan encourages the creation of a network of open spaces in the storm
      drainage channels and naturalized landscaping along major thoroughfares and bike
      paths. The open drainage systems would provide a pedestrian connection between
      parks and access to open space from residential neighborhoods. The neighborhoods
      would be designed with homes oriented to, rather than backing on the open space
      corridor.

1.7.10 Agricultural Productivity
       Agricultural productivity will remain a significant element of the economy in San
       Joaquin County.      This General Plan supports the existing level of agricultural
       production by directing development in a compact, concentric form in order to reduce
       the demand for new development areas.       Existing agricultural activities will be
       retained within the city where practical.

2. LAND USE ELEMENT
      The Land Use Element establishes the goals that define the characteristics of land
      uses throughout the city.      Policies based on these goals will guide the overall
      development of Manteca including in-fill development, and addition of new land use
      areas.
      The General Plan Diagram (Land Use Map, Exhibit 2-1, included in the attached
      pocket) defines the location and relationships between land uses.
      The Land Use Element is a cornerstone of the General Plan. All other elements of
      the General Plan relate to the land uses and the physical form of the city. The type,
      intensity and location of land uses described in the General Plan are influenced by
      many diverse factors.      These include economic development potential, housing,
      traffic generation and circulation patterns, requirements for public services and
      utilities, safety from hazards, and environmental conditions.
2.1  Summary of Proposed Land Use
      Table 2-1 summarizes the proposed land use. The land use mix includes a diverse
      mix of dwelling types and densities, as well as major new employment centers.
      The General Plan land use is designed to achieve an adequate supply of land to
      accommodate the projected population through the General Plan horizon, within the
      City’s Growth Management ordinance.
      The total land use proposed in the Plan will accommodate a population of 94,000 to
      144,000. The projected population is derived from the General Plan land use through
      assumptions relating to residential density, the average density, the efficiency of the
      land use, vacancy factors, and a market reserve for each residential land use type. The
      General Plan Steering Committee reviewed and affirmed these assumptions for use in
      the General Plan process.

       The Plan also identifies substantial Urban Reserve land uses. These reserved
       categories are intended to accommodate growth beyond the twenty year horizon of
       this General Plan, but may be needed in the nearer term.

2.2   Land Use Categories
        The Land Use Element establishes land use categories tailored to meet the specific
        needs of the city.       Economic development opportunities, housing needs and
        environmental characteristics are among the factors that determine the appropriate
        land use categories. The land use categories established in this General Plan shall be
        implemented through the Manteca Municipal Code, Zoning Ordinance.
        Very Low Density Residential (VLDR) (less than 2 dwelling units per gross acre)
        The Very Low Density Residential land use category will provide for residences on
        larger lots and small, quasi-agricultural activities, including raising and boarding
        livestock. Residential units shall be permitted to deviate from standard lot dimensions
        within agricultural areas in order to cluster dwellings together and thereby allow for

       continued agricultural use. The agricultural use areas that remain on the residential
       parcel shall be subject to an easement dedicated to the City that allow continued
       agricultural use, but prohibits any further non-agricultural related development.
       Low Density Residential (LDR)              (2.1 to 8.0 dwelling units per gross acre)
       The Low Density Residential land use will establish a mix of dwelling unit types and
       character determined by the individual site and market conditions. The density range
       allows substantial flexibility in selecting dwelling unit types and parcel
       configurations to suit particular site conditions and housing needs. The type of
       dwelling units anticipated in this density range include small lots and clustered lots as
       well as conventional large lot detached residences.
       Medium Density Residential (MDR)            (8.1 to 15 dwelling units per gross acre)
       The medium density residential use includes single family homes, smaller scale
       multi-family developments, including garden apartments, townhouses, and cluster
       housing. The density range will accommodate small-lot single family homes that
       will typically be smaller in size and more affordable to residents.
       High Density Residential (HDR)             (15.1 to 25 dwelling units per acre)
       The high density residential use includes multi-family apartment style housing.
       The multi-family dwelling sites are typically located with direct access to arterial
       streets. The sites have access to the pedestrian and bikeway network along the street
       corridor and are located along the conceptual route of a public transportation shuttle
       route. Most sites are near a neighborhood park and a neighborhood commercial
       center or larger commercial facility.

      2.2.1     Commercial Mixed Use (CMU)                (15.1 to 25 dwelling units per acre)
      Floor Area Ratio: 1.0
      Maximum Site Coverage: 50%
      The Commercial Mixed Use designation will accommodate a variety of purposes
      including high density residential, employment centers, retail commercial, and
      professional offices.
      The mixed use concept would integrate a mix of compatible uses on a single site that
      include sales, services and activities which residents may need on a daily basis. With
      pedestrian access, these sites will enable residents to walk or bike for many local
      trips, instead of driving for convenience trips.
      The sites may be integrated vertically with mixed uses above one another, such as
      residential or office uses over a commercial use.            Sites may also be mixed
      horizontally with the uses side-by-side, but linked together through common
      walkways, plazas and parking areas.          In-fill sites in the existing urban area,
      particularly along the Main Street, Airport Way and Yosemite Avenue corridors may
      be developed entirely as multi-family residential projects. Sites developed primarily
      as residential may also include office and retail components.          The Commercial
      Mixed-Use designation may also be applied to smaller parcels within neighborhoods.
      These small parcels accommodate a variety of uses, but on a smaller, less intense
      scale that is compatible with the adjacent residential uses.
      The residential component of any Commercial Mixed-Use development shall provide
      dwellings at densities of 15.1 to 25 units per acre. The residential component shall be
      considered to be that portion of a site or plan area allocated exclusively to residential
      use, net of any commercial or office use.
      Commercial Mixed Use developments in the new urbanizing areas of the city may
      also develop primarily as multi-family residential, but are also intended to provide a
      commercial and office component designed to serve the surrounding neighborhood.
      In new urbanizing areas it the mixed-use concept would accommodate approximately

             35% of the land area allocated to High-Density Residential use, however, individual
             sites may be permitted to have significantly higher percentages of residential.
             The characteristics of the CMU developments will distinguish them from
             conventional neighborhood commercial or office development. Figure 2-1 illustrates
             the plan of a conceptual, neighborhood-scale, commercial mixed use development.

      •   The CMU developments will be truly mixed use.                 There will be a strong
          relationship between the different land uses so that pedestrian access is
          convenient and there is a clear common design theme.
      •   The CMU developments will include space for community activities within the
          center or on an adjacent park. It is intended that the park and neighborhood
          commercial center together form a neighborhood gathering place for recreation
          and socializing much as does a small town square.
      •   Where required, detention facilities will be designed as an amenity within the
          CMU site landscaping, and may also provide recreation opportunities.
      •   CMU developments will include public facilities where feasible, such as a post
          office, library, fire station, or satellite government office.
      •   CMU developments may also include neighborhood work centers that provide
          space for private offices that use telecommunications services such that
          telecommuters and other residents in the neighborhood may work near their
          homes.
      •   CMU developments will have a shared parking program with the objective of
          reducing the parking required for each individual use.
      Business Industrial Park (BIP)
      Floor Area Ratio: 1.0
      Maximum Site Coverage: 50%
      The Business Industrial Park designation is intended to provide sites for large uses in
      an office park environment that would include multi-tenant buildings. Business
      parks of this nature are well suited for research and development facilities and also
      provide an attractive business environment for unrelated businesses. Typical uses

       compatible with the landscape and building design standards for the business park
       will be permitted. All outdoor storage shall be screened so to not be visible from any
       public street or highway.
       The business industrial park land use will also permit a limited amount of service
       commercial and retail activities provided for the convenience of the employees
       within the area. The goal is to provide a mix of basic services in close proximity to
       employees to reduce daily convenience trips.            Typical service uses include
       restaurants, banks, day care, and personal services, such as hair care and shoe repair,
       specialty retail, and similar uses. Such uses may not account for more than ten
       percent (10%) of the total gross floor area allowed for the individual parcels.
       Convenience services within the business-professional land use should be distributed
       within the area to be easily accessible by employees. These uses should generally be
       located within the building complexes and not as freestanding structures.
       The Business Industrial Park uses shall incorporate the following characteristics.
       •   Common recreation/open space, landscaping, dining and meeting areas are
           amenity features that are desirable within all business-park developments.
       •   Required detention facilities shall be incorporated in the site landscaping as a
           visual amenity.

      Urban Reserve
      Urban Reserve is applied to many properties around the perimeter of the City. In
      most instances the Urban Reserve category overlies another land use category. In
      these instances the underlying land use is the intended use when the land is ultimately
      annexed to the City. Urban Reserve with no underlying land use indicates that the
      City intends to expand in the time horizon beyond the current General Plan and that it
      is premature to indicate a specific future land use in this area. Urban Reserve is
      shown on the Land Use Map to the north and east of the proposed growth areas.
2.3  Land Use Goals and Policies

                       with the limits imposed by the city’s infrastructure and the city’s
                       ability to assimilate new development.
      2.3.1    Policies:
      LU-P-1:          Growth shall mitigate its own impacts and shall provide a positive
                       benefit to the City of Manteca.

       LU-P-2: Growth must contribute to a strong diversified economic base and an
               effective balance between employment and housing opportunities for
               all income levels.
       LU-P-3: The City shall encourage a pattern of development that promotes the
               efficient and timely development of public services and facilities.
       LU-P-4: The City shall encourage a development pattern that is contiguous
               with the boundary of the City.
       LU-P-5: The City shall establish and maintain a Primary Urban Service
               Boundary line designating lands eligible for annexation and urban
               development prior to the year 2013 (see Figure 2-3).
       LU-P-6: The City shall establish and maintain a Secondary Urban Service
               Boundary line designating lands eligible for annexation and urban
               development beyond the year 2013 (see Figure 2-3). Lands outside
               the Primary Urban Service Boundary line, but within the Secondary
               Urban Service Boundary line, shall not be annexed to the City of
               Manteca prior to their inclusion within the Primary Urban Service
               Boundary line. Prior to 2013, the Primary Urban Service Boundary
               line may be amended through adoption of a specific plan, an area
               plan, or comparable planning process, or an amendment to the
               General Plan.
       LU-P-7: All lands within the Primary and Secondary Urban Service Boundary
               lines to be ultimately developed to urban standards should be
               developed under the jurisdiction of the City of Manteca. Pending
               annexation to the City, all such lands should remain in agricultural,
               open space, or other low intensity uses.       The City shall work
               cooperatively with the County to ensure that development approved
               by the County on unincorporated lands within the Primary and
               Secondary Urban Service Boundary lines is developed according to
               standards consistent with those of the City of Manteca. The City
               shall request all proposals for development on unincorporated lands
               within the Primary and Secondary Urban Service boundary lines be

3 COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT
      The Community Design Element addresses the community form and quality of the
      built environment.
      The City of Manteca has developed in a compact urban form around the historic
      downtown centered on the intersection of Yosemite Avenue and Main Street.
      Residential development in the past few decades has occurred in relatively compact
      neighborhoods defined by the established grid of major streets at one-mile intervals.
      Growth has occurred in a predominately northwest direction away from downtown and
      has diminished the downtown as the geographical center.
3.1 Compact Community Form
      Goal CD-1.           Retain the compact and cohesive community form of the City.
      Policies:
      CD-P-1:         Retain the existing central city core as the geographical center of the
                      City.
      CD-P-2:         Provide institutional and leisure activity uses in the downtown core to
                      attract residents and visitors.
      CD-P-3:         Retain a diversity of small businesses in the downtown core.
      CD-P-4:         Provide adequate parking and circulation within the downtown core
                      area.
      CD-P-5:         Provide a public transportation hub in the central area.
      CD-P-6:         Provide public spaces such as small parks and plazas, including a
                      single plaza or City park that is recognized as the City center.
      CD-P-7:         The City shall implement neighborhood design standards in the
                      Residential districts that contribute to the overall character of the

                  neighborhood by emphasizing traditional residential features that
                  enhance the sense of community, ensure a safe pedestrian orientation,
                  and minimize the visual prominence of garages.
      Implementation:
      CD-I-1.     The City shall implement an urban design plan for the Central
                  Business District (CBD). The plan should be designed to achieve the
                  following objectives:
                  •   Assess the urban design implications of each use of the vacant
                      parcels in the CBD and establish an overall urban design strategy;
                  •   Establish an overall parking strategy for the CBD in order to
                      provide a more unified and aesthetically desirable complex of
                      parking lots, including an overall strategy for landscaping and
                      screening such areas;
                  •   Establish design standards and design review procedures for
                      controlling height, bulk, and design of buildings, and for signs in
                      the CBD;
                  •   Establish a coordinated and unified street tree program for the
                      CBD;
                  •   Establish guidelines for street furniture in the CBD, such as
                      benches, trash containers, street lights, and street signs. Determine
                      strategies       for    enhancing       the      recently    installed
                      trellis/street/sign/bench structures;
                  •   Assess the potential for developing public and private open spaces
                      in the CBD, particularly with an eye toward tempering the hot
                      summer microclimate with aesthetically pleasing, shaded exterior
                      spaces;

                   in a manner that provides shelter from sun and rain for pedestrians.
      CD-P-33:     Passive solar design features are encouraged whenever possible.
                   Design of buildings should consider energy-efficient concepts such as
                   natural heating and/or cooling, sun and wind exposure and orientation,
                   and other solar energy opportunities.
      CD-P-34:     Solar collectors, if used, shall be oriented away from public view or
                   designed as an integral element of the roof structure.
      CD-P-35:     Architectural elements that contribute to a building’s character, aid in
                   climate control, and enhance pedestrian scale are encouraged.
                   Examples include canopies, roof overhangs, projections or recessions
                   of stories, balconies, reveals, and awnings.
      CD-P-36:     Encourage the creation of an urban forest comprised of street trees,
                   residential lot trees, and trees in non-residential parking lots and other
                   public open space.
3.4 Pedestrians and Bicycles
      Goal CD-10.       Establish a pedestrian and bicycle friendly environment in

      CD-P-38:       Commercial centers should provide for convenient, attractive
                     pedestrian access within the center with dedicated pedestrian ways
                     between all buildings and pedestrian spaces such as plazas, courtyards,
                     and terraces at natural gathering areas within the site.
      CD-P-39:       Integrating the pedestrian elements (walkways, plazas, and terraces)
                     with the buildings will enhance the pedestrian experience.           The
                     pedestrian relationship to buildings should be comfortable, convenient,
                     and protected from extremes of sun and wind.
      CD-P-40:       Outdoor plazas or other common areas that provide space for special
                     landscaping, public art, food service, outdoor retail sales, or seating
                     areas for patrons are encouraged in retail settings appropriate to such
                     pedestrian activity.    The plaza or other common area shall be
                     appropriately scaled to the retail use and shall be directly connected to
                     the primary walkway.
      CD-P-41:       Buildings adjoining public spaces, including pedestrian ways shall be
                     designed to allow the sun to reach sidewalks and plazas in the winter.
      CD-P-42:       Building configurations that provide “outdoor rooms,” courtyards,
                     paseos, and promenades are encouraged.
      CD-P-43:       Where practical, and in compliance with ADA standards, common
                     areas that provide seating should be separated from the primary
                     walkway by informal barriers, such as planters, bollards, fountains,
                     low fences and/or changes in elevation.
3.5  Agricultural Heritage
      Goal CD-11.        To the extent possible, new development shall retain or
                         incorporate visual reminders of the agricultural heritage of the
                         community.

4 CIRCULATION ELEMENT (Adopted April 5, 2011)
4.1  Introduction
      California Government Code Section 65302(b) that states that the General Plan is
      required to include:
                   “A Circulation Element consisting of the general location and extent
                   of existing and proposed major thoroughfares, transportation
                   routes, terminals, and other local public utilities and facilities, all
                   correlated with the Land Use Element of the plan.”
      The statute specifically identifies public utilities and facilities as components of the
      Circulation Element, but permits jurisdictions to organize elements in a manner
      appropriate to the community.           The Manteca General Plan addresses the public
      infrastructure, including sewer, water, energy and utilities, in the Public Facilities and
      Infrastructure Element.
      The Circulation Element addresses all aspects of transportation including commuter and
      truck traffic, intra-city vehicle traffic, rail, buses, bicycles, and pedestrians. Circulation
      master planning has traditionally focused on automobiles and truck traffic by ensuring
      that the road system will be adequate to accommodate future traffic demands. While
      automobile and truck traffic will continue to be important modes of transportation in the
      time horizon for this General Plan, the future is not necessarily a simple continuation of
      past trends. Several factors suggest that the conventional use of automobiles will change
      in significant ways within the time frame of this plan. While these factors cannot be
      predicted with assurance, the General Plan seeks to provide a balanced transportation
      system that accommodates all modes of travel and supports the City’s goals of remaining
      a vibrant community where people want to live, work, shop, and recreate.
4.2  Key Assumptions
      The following assumptions guide the goals and policies of this Circulation Element.
                  People will continue to demand high levels of access and mobility.
                   Therefore, the transportation network and land uses within the City must be
APRIL 5, 2011                                                                                     4-1

CIRCULATION                                               MANTECA GENERAL PLAN 2023
              developed in a coordinated manner to provide high degrees of mobility and
              access via a variety of travel modes.
             A significant percentage of the aging population will grow less capable of
              driving automobiles, but will demand the same level of independence in their
              daily lives. This will require a more comprehensive system of complete
              streets to facilitate mobility via other modes of travel, such as walking,
              bicycling, and transit.
             The actual cost of operating automobiles will continue to rise and consume a
              significantly higher percentage of household income.           Increasing the
              viability of other travel modes through transportation investments and land
              use decisions will become more important in the future.
             An efficient circulation system will also help to reduce construction costs
              through designs and standard plans that reduce the length and width of roads.
             Vehicles are the single largest source of air pollution and greenhouse gas
              emissions in the Central Valley. Transportation and land use goals and
              policies to minimize vehicle travel and promote alternative fuels (e.g.,
              hydrogen, electric vehicles) will reduce the emission of air pollution and
              greenhouse gasses into the community.
             Recognition about the health benefits of physical activity will increase the
              amount of recreational bicycle and pedestrian travel.
             As the population of Manteca and the surrounding area grows, there will be
              an increasing number of bicycles and pedestrians sharing the transportation
              network.
             Maintaining a high automobile level of service (LOS) is not feasible over the
              long run from a financial or environmental perspective.
             Manteca is developing into a significant regional retail and freight
              distribution center within the Northern San Joaquin Valley.               The
              transportation system must be designed in such a way to support these
              important industries.
             Manteca will continue to see new industrial, office, and retail development.
              This development, combined with increasing traffic congestion on area

MANTECA GENERAL PLAN 2023                                                       CIRCULATION
                   freeways will reduce the number of Manteca residents who will work and
                   shop outside of the City.
                  Personal safety, on the road and in public places, will become increasingly
                   important to the general public. This will result in higher demands for
                   complete street designs, which accommodate not only vehicles and trucks,
                   but also buses, pedestrians, and cyclists.
                  The railroad is an inherent safety concern because of the existing at-grade
                   street crossings and the potential for vehicle, bicycle, or pedestrian versus
                   train collisions.
      The circulation plan must be flexible enough to accommodate today’s travel needs while
      looking to address future travel trends that may emerge within the timeframe of this
      General Plan. In general, the City seeks to develop a circulation system which reflects
      the resident’s values and also fits within fiscal and environmental realities. The City
      does not wish to invest in outdated ideas or in improvements that do not increase the
      mobility of its citizens.
4.3  Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
      Circulation and land use are closely linked elements that provide the framework for
      much of the General Plan. The policies and strategies should demonstrate a balance
      between land uses and the transportation facilities that serve them. The location and
      intensity of land uses determines the need for circulation system components and, in
      turn, the capacity of the circulation system often determines the location and feasibility
      of land use. Within the context of the General Plan, the circulation policies are also
      interwoven with economic, housing, open space, air quality, noise, and safety policies.
      Coordination between the Land Use Element and the Circulation Element:
                  encourages walking and bicycle trips by promoting a compact urban form
                   with neighborhood destinations close to residents;
                  makes public transit feasible through coordination of the intensity and
                   location of land uses; and

                   reduces the length and number of vehicle trips outside of the community by
                    promoting mixed-use development and by providing employment centers,
                    shopping, and services within the city.
4.4   Relationship to the Regional Transportation System
       This Circulation Element is intended to be compatible with the 2007 San Joaquin County
       Regional Transportation Plan and to support local transportation linkages to the regional
       transportation network. These linkages include the Altamont Commuter Express (ACE)
       train and the regional bus systems as well as future opportunities for rail and bus
       transportation.
4.5   Time Horizon for the Circulation Element
       Perhaps more than other elements in the General Plan, the Circulation Element must take
       a very long-term view. Physical infrastructure, such as the road system, establishes a
       framework that is very difficult to alter. Land uses may change and buildings may be
       reconstructed, but the route of the public streets and utility corridors are typically fixed
       in place over time. Therefore, the circulation system components must be carefully
       considered for their long-term impacts on land use and community form. Major new
       roads are relatively expensive and must be planned long in advance in order to obtain
       sufficient funding and sufficient right-of-way.      For these reasons, the Circulation
       Element must look beyond the twenty-year horizon typical of other elements in the
       General Plan.
4.6   Circulation Goals
       The goals for the circulation system reflect the broader goals of this General Plan. These
       include improvement of the existing community, economic development, expanded
       tourism, improved aesthetic quality in the built environment, better public and personal
       health, improved safety, improved quality of life, and environmental protection.
       The circulation system goals are, in part a reflection of the City’s historic development
       pattern, which has built a system that is heavily focused on moving cars quickly through
       and around the City. While this type of circulation system provides a high degree of
       mobility and access to those who have cars, it does not adequately serve residents who

MANTECA GENERAL PLAN 2023                                                        CIRCULATION
      cannot or choose not to drive. Moreover, this type of circulation system is expensive to
      build and maintain since roadways and intersections are designed to accommodate the
      traffic volumes that occur during the peak one or two hours of the day. The majority of
      the time the roads are relatively empty, which promotes high vehicle speeds and
      decreases the viability of alternative modes.
      More recently, additional emphasis has been given to other modes. Examples include
      the construction of the Tidewater Bikeway, the adoption and implementation of a
      Bicycle Master Plan, streetscape improvements in Downtown, new street standards with
      improved pedestrian facilities, and the initiation of the City’s own transit service. While
      the City has made great strides toward developing a circulation system that better serves
      all modes of travel, this Circulation Element stresses the need for a balanced circulation
      system based on the concept of “complete streets.”
      Complete streets describes a comprehensive approach to the practice of mobility
      planning. The complete street concept recognizes that transportation corridors have
      multiple users with different abilities and mode preferences (e.g., driving, biking,
      walking, and taking transit). A well-integrated street system considers the
      complementary relationship between land use, local and regional travel needs, and the
      context that it serves. Complete streets apply equally to facilities like Yosemite Avenue
      through downtown and commercial corridors like Main Street near the State Route 120
      interchange. Complete streets consider the full range of users including vehicles, trucks,
      pedestrians, bicycles, children, the disabled, and seniors.
      Goal C-1.        Provide for a circulation system that allows for the efficient movement
                       of people, goods, and services within and through Manteca while
                       minimizing public costs to build and maintain the system.
      Goal C-2.        Provide complete streets designed to serve a broad spectrum of travel
                       modes, including automobiles, public transit, walking, and bicycling.
      Goal C-3.        Develop attractive streetscapes that include landscaping, street trees,
                       planted berms, and landscaped medians.
      Goal C-4.        Support the development of a Downtown area that is highly accessible to
                       all modes of travel, focusing primarily on pedestrians, bicyclists, and
                       transit riders.

       Goal C-5.        Balance the level of service for all modes so that residents and visitors
                        have a variety of transportation choices.
       Goal C-6.        Maintain a safe transportation system for all modes.
       Goal C-7.        Accommodate truck and freight movements by developing city-wide
                        truck routes and encouraging the development of freight and
                        warehousing centers near existing rail lines and spurs.
       Goal C-8.        Establish reasonable parking requirements (minimum and maximum
                        rates for uses) that limit parking encroachment while minimizing the
                        amount of land consumed by parking lots.
       Goal C-9.        Provide a safe, secure, and convenient bicycle route system that connects
                        to retail, employment centers, public facilities, and parks.
       Goal C-10.       Provide for safe and convenient pedestrian circulation.
       Goal C-11.       Maintain a coordinated, efficient bus service that provides both an
                        effective alternative to automobile use and serves members of the
                        community that cannot drive.
       Goal C-12.       Support and encourage regional transit connections that link Manteca to
                        other cities.
       The following sections of this Circulation Element will describe the components of the
       circulation system and will define policies and implementation actions to meet the goals
       defined above.
4.7   Street Network and Classification
       Manteca is built on a grid of major streets spaced at intervals of about one mile. This
       grid forms the backbone of the local street system and defines the boundaries of many
       residential neighborhoods. Between the major streets are a series of minor streets that
       provide access to neighborhoods, offices, and industrial areas. Along with the City’s
       trail system, the sidewalks and bike lanes on these streets also serve pedestrian and
       bicycle modes. Transit and goods movement needs are also served on the City’s street
       network. The street system in Manteca consists of four general classes of streets:
4-6

MANTECA GENERAL PLAN 2023                                                         CIRCULATION
                  expressways;
                  arterial streets;
                  major collector streets;
                  minor collector streets; and
                  local, small scale streets that serve residential neighborhoods.
      Each street classification is designed to standards appropriate to the conditions and
      intended use. In general, the standards use the minimum level of street cross-section
      needed for traffic safety and emergency access and evacuation.
      The Circulation Element does not establish street standards that specify the widths of
      overall pavement, travel lanes, medians, corridors, bike lanes, or sidewalk dimensions.
      Such standards may be adjusted over time to accommodate different needs and new
      conditions, and are therefore adopted as separate improvement standards.                The
      Circulation Element establishes the general parameters and intent for each street
      classification.
      Beyond fundamental traffic safety concerns, street design should emphasize ease and
      expense of maintenance, simplicity of construction, visual character, and multi-modal
      access. Street widths should be designed at the minimum necessary curb-to-curb width
      that can safely accommodate the number of vehicle lanes, bicycle lanes, and parking
      needed for the street. All streets should also feature sidewalks and/or multi-use paths on
      both sides where right-of-way is available.
      Expressways
      Manteca currently does not have any expressways; however, the proposed McKinley
      Avenue extension between SR 120 and SR 99 is planned as an expressway between SR
      120 and SR 99, consistent with the San Joaquin Regional Expressway Study (SJCOG
      May 2009). Expressways are high-capacity routes designed to serve through traffic.
      Expressway access would be limited to intersections with arterials and collectors with
      intersection spacing of no less than one-half mile. Based on the posted speed limit of the
      expressway, bicycle travel should be accommodated with either Class II bike lanes or a
      parallel off-street bike trail. Sidewalks should be provided on both sides of the street (or

       considered at intersections to reduce maintenance and operations costs associated with
       traffic signals.
       Arterial Streets
       Arterial streets are designed to serve through traffic and major local traffic generators
       such as high density housing areas, commercial, industrial, and institutional uses.
       Examples of arterials include Airport Way and Lathrop Road.
       Arterial streets are intended to provide high-capacity routes to serve vehicle, transit, and
       goods movement. The streets should have an aesthetically appealing character with
       curbside landscaping and a landscaped median islands, where appropriate. Existing
       arterial streets should provide sidewalks and bike lanes where space is available.
       Additional space may be provided by re-striping with narrower lanes to accommodate
       sidewalks and bike lanes to complete connections or close gaps in the bicycle and
       pedestrian systems.
       In general, new arterial streets should be designed to accommodate both bike and
       pedestrian facilities on both sides of the street while balancing concerns regarding traffic
       volumes, operations, and the safety of drivers, bicyclists, and pedestrians. Arterial
       streets shall also be designed to accommodate public transit routes by providing adequate
       lane widths and corner radii for safe operation of trucks and buses and bus turnouts
       where deemed appropriate.
       Major Collector Streets
       Major collector streets serve as smaller-scale parallel routes to arterial streets and
       provide access to neighborhoods. Examples include Center Street, Powers Avenue, and
       Daniels Street west of Airport Way. Major collector streets will typically provide two
       travel lanes, a Class II bike lane and a sidewalk on both sides. Median islands and turn
       lanes may be appropriate in certain conditions. For newly constructed major collector
       streets, on-street parking should be prohibited to reduce pavement width, pedestrian
       crossing distances, and maintenance costs. On-street parking for existing major collector
       streets should be restricted or limited by eliminating the parking lane or through the use
       of bulb-outs to minimize the cross section and discourage speeding.

      Minor Collector Streets
      Minor collector streets serve as the backbone circulation routes within larger
      neighborhoods and commercial/industrial areas. These streets provide primary access to
      light industrial and office properties and provide a link between low volume residential
      streets and larger collector and arterial streets. Examples include Pestana Avenue, North
      Street, DuPont Court, and Vanderbilt Circle. The minor collector street should be small
      scale, two lane streets. The streets should be wide enough to safely accommodate traffic
      flows, but not so wide as to encourage high-speed travel. On-street parking should be
      restricted or limited by eliminating the parking lane or through the use of bulb-outs to
      minimize the cross section and discourage speeding. Depending on the surrounding land
      uses (e.g., office, commercial, or residential areas), the minor collector may
      accommodate Class II bike lanes. Sidewalks should be provided on each side of the
      street.
      Residential Streets
      While they carry relatively light traffic loads, residential streets constitute the majority of
      Manteca’s street system. These streets are intended to serve residential driveways,
      providing access between homes and larger streets. In general, these streets should
      include narrow travel and parking lanes to slow travel and discourage through trips.
      Features like corner bulb-outs and traffic circles (which are a smaller version of a
      roundabout) should be incorporated to improve the aesthetic quality of the street, while
      calming traffic. Class II bike lanes should not be included on residential streets as
      volumes and speeds are slow enough to safely accommodate bikes and cars. However,
      Class III bike routes and special pavement markings for bicycles may be appropriate to
      provide continuity for the bicycle system. Sidewalks should be provided on both sides of
      the street. Where a residential street ends in a cul-de-sac, a shared bicycle/pedestrian
      path should be constructed (as appropriate and where right-of-way is available) to
      connect the cul-de-sac to other residential, collector, or arterial streets. These bicycle
      and pedestrian connections shorten travel distances and encourage the use of these
      modes.

       Intersections of City Streets
       Intersections are critical components of the street network since they tend to define how
       well the system operates. Drivers and transit users typically experience most of their
       traveling delay at intersections. In addition, intersections are important for pedestrians
       and bicycles since they provide controlled points where these modes can cross major
       roadways. The City’s Standard Plans should be updated to include a set of typical
       intersection treatments.
       In general, intersections should have minimum lane widths to serve the type of vehicles
       expected on the roadway (e.g., lanes should be sufficiently wide to accommodate trucks
       in industrial areas). Narrower lanes pose less of a barrier for pedestrians to cross and
       reduce maintenance costs. In addition, u-turn movements should be accommodated in
       the intersection design to the extent feasible to extend the length of landscaped medians.
       Also, bus bays should be included in intersection designs for expressways, arterials, and
       major collectors to maintain traffic flow while busses are loading and unloading.
4.8   Traffic Calming
       Traffic speed is a concern where local and collector streets are relatively straight and
       there are few intersections. Within the developed portions of the city, in residential and
       school areas, and where there are substantial numbers of pedestrians, it is desirable to
       maintain traffic flow at safe speeds.       This may be accomplished through “traffic
       calming” measures. These may include modified signing and striping, roundabouts and
       traffic circles, bulb-outs, and other physical improvements that cause drivers to slow and
       be more aware of other vehicles and pedestrian or bicycle traffic. To assist in
       determining where and what type of traffic calming measures are appropriate, the City of
       Manteca has a Neighborhood Traffic Calming Program that is based on public
       participation. This “bottom up” approach is common throughout California and relies on
       neighborhood participation to identify issues and solutions.
4.9   Level of Service Standards
       Level of Service (LOS) is a qualitative measure used to describe operations on
       transportation facilities for different user types, including vehicles, transit riders,
       bicyclists, and pedestrians. The Highway Capacity Manual provides guidance on state-
4-10

MANTECA GENERAL PLAN 2023                                                           CIRCULATION
        of-the-practice methods to measure LOS. Traditionally, the City has evaluated vehicular
        LOS on roadway facilities. This analysis compares existing or projected traffic volumes
        with the theoretical capacity of the street or intersection.             Factors taken into
        consideration include volume of traffic, street and intersection design, signal timing, and
        other variables.
        Each LOS is assigned a letter, ranging from “A” (free flow conditions) to “F” (severe
        congestion). Vehicular LOS letter “grades” should not necessarily be viewed like school
        grades where A is best and F is worst. Striving to provide free flow traffic conditions
        (LOS A) at all hours of the day requires wide streets, large intersections, substantial
        right-of-way, and considerable funds to construct and maintain these streets. “Good”
        vehicular LOS also tends to lead to poor LOS for bicycle and pedestrian modes since the
        larger streets and intersections, higher speeds, and longer waiting times to cross streets
        makes bicycling and walking more uncomfortable and less safe. Thus vehicular LOS
        must be balanced against mobility needs for other modes, environmental impact, and
        construction and maintenance costs. This General Plan establishes an LOS Standard that
        will guide street improvements in the City while meeting the City’s goals of developing
        an efficient circulation system that promotes travel via other modes.
Policies: Level of Service
        C-P-1:           The City shall strive to balance levels of service (LOS) for all modes
                         (vehicle, transit, bicycle, and pedestrian) to maintain a high level of
                         access and mobility, while developing a complete and efficient
                         circulation system.      The impact of new development and land use
                         proposals on LOS and accessibility for all modes should be considered
                         in the review process.
        C-P-2:           To the extent feasible, the City shall strive for a vehicular LOS of D or
                         better at all streets and intersections, except in the Downtown area where
                         right-of-way is limited, pedestrian, bicycle, and transit mobility are most
                         important and vehicular LOS is not a consideration. See Figure 4.1 for a
                         map defining the Downtown area. While vehicular LOS is not a
                         consideration in the Downtown area, traffic studies shall disclose
                         whether any proposed transportation or land use action will substantially
                         increase traffic at intersections and roadways within this area of the City.

       C-P-3: At the discretion of City staff, certain locations may be allowed to fall
              below the City’s LOS standard under the following circumstances:
              a. Where constructing facilities with enough capacity to provide LOS
                  D is found to be unreasonably expensive. This applies to facilities,
                  for example, on which it would cost significantly more per dwelling
                  unit equivalent (DUE) to provide LOS D than is deemed reasonable
                  by City staff.
              b. Where it is difficult or impossible to maintain LOS D because
                  surrounding facilities in other jurisdictions operate at LOS E or
                  worse.
              c. Where maintaining LOS D will be a disincentive to use of existing
                  alternative modes or to the implementation of new transportation
                  modes that would reduce vehicle travel. Examples include roadway
                  or intersection widening in areas with substantial pedestrian activity
                  or near major transit centers.
              d. In the Downtown area the City cannot maintain the vehicular LOS D
                  standard because of the historic nature of development and limited
                  street right-of-way. However, it is the City’s goal to maintain high
                  quality access and mobility in the area with a priority toward non-
                  auto modes. Therefore, the City shall require that new discretionary
                  land use action within the Downtown area, which generate net new
                  PM peak hour auto trips, to participate in enhancing access and
                  mobility for transit, bicycle, and pedestrian modes.            These
                  enhancements may include, but are not limited to:
                  •    Enhancing sidewalks to create a high quality pedestrian
                       environment,    including   wider    sidewalks    and   improved
                       crosswalks, landscaping, buffers between sidewalks and vehicle
                       travel lanes, enhanced pedestrian lighting, increased availability
                       of benches, provisions for café-style seating, and usage of
                       monument elements and other public art.

                         •   Improving bicycle facilities to include attractive and secure
                             bicycle parking, installation of bike lockers in appropriate
                             locations, and provision of bicycle lanes along appropriate
                             roadways.
                         •   Enhancing transit stops through high quality, well maintained
                             shelters, and provision of wayfinding signage and transit
                             timetables.
                         •   Providing off-street parking with high quality access to
                             Downtown businesses, and which is well-maintained and
                             provides amenities like shade streets, canopies, adequate
                             lighting, and wayfinding signage.
                         •   Supporting the      development      of    a Downtown Business
                             Improvement District or similar mechanism to help fund
                             ongoing maintenance of the streetscape enhancements.
                     The Public Works Department shall maintain a list of all City
                     intersections and roadway facilities that are exempt from the LOS D
                     standard.   This list shall note any alternate LOS standard that is
                     applicable at the exempted locations.
Implementation: Level of Service
      C-I-1.         The City shall maintain a master list of multimodal volume data for key
                     intersections and roadway segments. This master list shall be updated
                     regularly with traffic counts (for autos, transit, bicycles, and pedestrians)
                     taken in conjunction with project traffic studies and by special counts
                     conducted by the City as necessary.
      C-I-2.         Perform periodic evaluation of the mobility and access on major streets,
                     which could include evaluation of vehicular LOS conditions, as well as
                     access and mobility issues faced by transit riders, bicyclists, and
                     pedestrians. The use of multimodal LOS analysis techniques could also
                     be included.

       C-I-3.          The City shall develop Transportation Impact Analysis (TIA) Guidelines
                       to provide guidance on identifying deficiencies and impacts on all modes
                       of transportation caused by new development. The TIS guidelines will
                       also provide guidance on the types of mitigation measures that would be
                       appropriate to mitigate project-related impacts to transportation facilities
                       in the City.    The TIS guidelines will address impact thresholds for
                       vehicular, transit, bicycle, and pedestrian facilities.
       C-I-4.          The City shall develop a pedestrian, bicycle, and transit improvement
                       plan for the Downtown area to facilitate implementation of level of
                       service policy C-P-3 d. This plan will develop a list of multi-modal
                       improvements in the Downtown area to increase the viability and
                       encourage the use of non-auto modes.
4.10 Major Streets Master Plan
       The Major Streets Master Plan defines the framework of major streets. It is intended that
       the City will retain the existing compact form, with development occurring in a
       concentric pattern. Infill development is also encouraged in the Land Use Element as a
       means of accommodating new growth.            Consequently, selected existing streets will
       continue to function as the major streets. Nonetheless, there are potential growth areas
       within and adjacent to the existing City boundary that will require new major roads,
       roadway capacity expansion, transit, bicycle, and pedestrian improvements where
       development is permitted.
       Figure 4.2 is a schematic diagram of the anticipated alignment of the major streets
       necessary to accommodate growth over the long-term, including growth that is beyond
       what is currently envisioned in the Land Use Element. Figure 4.3 provides a more
       detailed diagram of the major streets, including the anticipated number of lanes required
       for the more near-term buildout of the Land Use Element. Clearly, the major street
       system shown in Figure 4.3 is a subset of the system shown in 4.2.

Based on the planned and reasonably foreseeable development known at the time this Circulation
Element was prepared, the major street system shown in Figure 4.3 meets LOS standard
established in this General Plan; however, as the plan develops some modifications may be
necessary to accommodate specific development projects.         The Public Facilities Fee (PFF)
Program will be the main implementing tool for collecting and allocating funds to implement
roadway improvements consistent with the Major Streets Master Plan.
Policies: Street System
        C-P-4:         Streets shall be dedicated, widened, extended, and constructed according
                       to street cross-section diagrams established in the City Standard Plans.
        C-P-5:         Major circulation improvements shall be completed as abutting lands
                       develop or redevelop, with dedication of right-of-way and construction
                       of improvements, or participation in construction of such improvements,
                       required as a condition of approval.
        C-P-6:         New development shall pay a fair share of the costs of street and other
                       transportation improvements based on impacts to LOS and other modes
                       in conformance with the goals and policies established in this
                       Circulation Element and the PFF program.
        C-P-7:         The street system shall be expanded in a contiguous and concentric
                       manner to serve new development areas and to provide improved
                       circulation for existing residents.
        C-P-8:         Street improvements will be designed to provide multiple, direct and
                       convenient routes for all modes.
        C-P-9:         Residential and collector street intersections with collector and arterial
                       streets shall be aligned with other residential and collector streets, where
                       feasible, to maintain a high degree of connectivity between
                       neighborhoods, minimize circuitous travel, and to allow bicyclists and
                       pedestrians to travel conveniently and safely from one neighborhood to
                       another without using major streets.
        C-P-10:        Access for bicycles and pedestrians shall be provided at the ends of cul-
                       de-sacs, where right-of-way is available, to provide convenient access

               within and between neighborhoods and to encourage walking and
               bicycling to neighborhood destinations.
       C-P-11: Signals, roundabouts, traffic circles and other traffic management
               techniques shall be applied at residential and collector street
               intersections with collector and arterial streets in order to allow
               bicyclists and pedestrians to travel conveniently and safely from one
               neighborhood to another.
       C-P-12: Where traffic congestion, pedestrian travel, collision history, or other
               factors warrant the installation of a traffic signal, the feasibility of a
               roundabout shall also be evaluated. In general, a roundabout should be
               installed at these locations unless right of way, cost, design limitations,
               or other issues preclude the installation of a roundabout.
       C-P-13: The City shall promote development of a future roadway system as
               shown in the Major Streets Master Plan.
       C-P-14: The City may allow development of private streets in new residential
               projects that demonstrate the ability to facilitate police patrol,
               emergency access, and solid waste collection as well as fund on-going
               maintenance.
       C-P-15: The City shall promote infill development that completes gaps in the
               circulation system.
       C-P-16: Residential subdivisions with lots fronting on an existing arterial street
               should provide for separate roadway access.            Ideally, access to
               residential lots should be from residential or collector streets. For those
               properties that currently front arterial streets, consideration should be
               given to providing separate roadway access as a condition of approval
               for any redevelopment or subdivision of the property.
       C-P-17: Residential subdivisions along arterials and freeways shall be buffered
               by a noise attenuation measure (sound wall, berm, greenbelt, etc.) as
               determined by a noise study. Any noise attenuation measure should be

      C-P-18:        The City shall aggressively pursue state and federal funding to augment
                     the PFF and implement the City’s Circulation Element.
      C-P-19:        The City shall coordinate with neighboring jurisdictions, including
                     Caltrans, San Joaquin Council of Governments (SJCOG), San Joaquin
                     County, the City of Lathrop, and the City of Ripon to pursue funding for
                     the following regional facilities:
                     •   A new interchange at McKinley Avenue and SR 120;
                     •   A new interchange at Austin Road/McKinley Avenue and SR 99;
                     •   A new interchange on SR 99 between Lathrop Road and French
                         Camp Road;
                     •   An easterly extension of the SR 120 freeway towards Oakdale; and
                     •   Regional bicycle lanes and bicycle paths.
Implementation: Street System
      C-I-5.         The City shall maintain a Major Street Master Plan showing the existing
                     and proposed ultimate right-of-way and street width for each road
                     segment within the City’s Sphere of Influence and Area of Interest. The
                     Major Street Master Plan shall also indicate the necessary right-of-way
                     to be acquired or dedicated and the expected method of financing
                     roadway improvements (i.e., City-funded or property owner/developer-
                     funded). The Major Street Master Plan shall be regularly updated.
      C-I-6.         When planning roadway facilities, incorporate the concept of complete
                     streets. Complete streets include design elements for all modes that use
                     streets, including autos, transit, pedestrians, and bicycles. Complete
                     streets shall be developed in a context-sensitive manner. For example, it
                     may be more appropriate to provide a Class I bike path, as opposed to
                     bike lanes along a major arterial. Pedestrian districts like Downtown

               Manteca or areas near school entrances should have an enhanced
               streetscape (e.g., narrower travel lanes, landscape buffers with street
               trees, etc.) to better accommodate and encourage pedestrian travel.
       C-I-7.  The City shall require new development to participate in the
               implementation of transportation improvements identified in the Major
               Street Master Plan.       Participation could include the construction of
               roadways, improvements to roadways, payment into the PFF program,
               payment into other fee programs, or fair-share payments. In general, the
               infrastructure needs and methods of participation will be determined
               through an environmental impact report or transportation impact
               analysis.
       C-I-8.  The City will coordinate with Caltrans and SJCOG to make sure that
               projects in the City’s Circulation Element and Major Street Master Plan
               are included in long range planning documents, including the Caltrans
               Long Range Plan, the SJCOG Regional Transportation Plan, and the San
               Joaquin County Congestion Management Program.
       C-I-9.  Appropriate sound attenuation measures shall be determined by a noise
               study. Walls and berms shall be attractive and developed to minimize
               maintenance. Bicycle and pedestrian access shall be provided through
               walls and berms to minimize travel distances and increase the viability
               walking and bicycling.
       C-I-10. To support the City’s goals of minimizing maintenance costs and
               encouraging active transportation, any new or substantially modified
               roadway shall be as narrow as feasible while being consistent with LOS
               and goods movement policies. In general, this implementation measure
               can be achieved by constructing narrower traffic lanes, although wider
               lanes may be necessary on certain truck routes.
       C-I-11. The City shall regularly update the PFF program to ensure that the fees
               are consistent with construction costs and the project list reflects
               changes in the transportation system that may occur as land use

4.11 Parking
       Parking demand is generated by existing businesses, new business, and residents, and is
       varies by the time of day, time of year, and presence of special events. Guiding new
       business and residential development is a fundamental purpose in this General Plan. The
       success of the Economic Development Element will rely, in part, on the ability to
       accommodate the traffic and parking associated with new businesses and special events.
       Policies: Parking
       C-P-23:         Future growth in traffic volumes may necessitate removal of on-street
                       parking spaces to provide additional traffic lanes.
       C-P-24:         New development shall provide an adequate number of off-street parking
                       spaces to accommodate the typical parking demands of the type of
                       development on the site.       The City may dictate both minimum and
                       maximum amounts of parking; the use of shared parking is encouraged
                       to reduce overall land consumed by parking areas. In the Downtown
                       area, parking supply and demand will be managed through a coordinated
                       approach led by the City.
       C-P-25:         The City may allow for changes to the parking requirements under
                       certain circumstances. In such cases, the City may require provision of
                       off-site parking, participation in a parking district or payment of an in-
                       lieu fee to cover the costs of land acquisition and construction of parking
                       spaces.
       C-P-26:         In the Downtown area, the Redevelopment Agency should assist in the
                       provision of off-street parking. Parking facilities in the Downtown area
                       should be within easy walking distance of the businesses

                     communities, the requirements of the Housing Element to achieve
                     specified residential density levels, and an assessment of the adequacy of
                     the City’s current standards.
      C-I-17.        Work with local merchants to improve on-street and off-street parking
                     conditions.
      C-I-18.        The City will consider preparing a Parking Management Plan for the
                     Downtown area to ensure that parking facilities are provided in a
                     coordinated manner, which maximizes access to local businesses and
                     connectivity with non-auto modes, including transit, bicycles, and
                     pedestrian facilities.
      C-I-19.        The City shall require a shared parking analysis for all proposed mixed-
                     use developments and new projects in the Downtown area to ensure that
                     parking is not oversupplied.
      C-I-20.        To maintain adequate parking supply for businesses, the City may
                     restrict parking on public streets through permit programs, time limits, or
                     parking meters, where appropriate.
      C-I-21.        If roadway widening requires the removal of on-street parking, a parking
                     supply study should be conducted to determine if the loss of on-street
                     parking spaces will create a parking shortage. If so, the parking supply
                     study should also discuss the feasibility of replacing the lost parking
                     spaces.

4.12 Bikeway and Pedestrian Systems
       The bikeway and pedestrian systems in Manteca are critical elements in the
       transportation network. After driving, walking and biking are the second most common
       means of travel in Manteca, particularly for recreational purposes. Encouraging these
       modes of transportation is important for the convenience and enjoyment of Manteca
       residents and enhancing public health and the quality of life.
       The existing bikeway and pedestrian network should be enhanced to further encourage

       continuity of the existing compact land use pattern in the Land Use Element, and by the
       creation of new bike routes and sidewalks wherever new streets are installed or existing
       streets are upgraded.

4.13 Public Transit
       Manteca is located at a major ground transportation hub in the state and has the
       opportunity to expand both rail service and bus service. The opportunities will grow
       with increasing population, and higher costs of travel by automobile. The City can
       enhance these opportunities by encouraging the use of public transit by Manteca
       residents and by implementing additional transit routes and services. But the most
       significant means of enhancing public transit opportunities is in planning land use and
       circulation networks.
       By locating higher density housing, commercial, employment, recreational, education
       and institutional facilities along major thoroughfares and by providing safe, convenient
       pedestrian routes to these facilities the City can make public transit more effective and
       viable. Sound land planning can produce benefits equal to a substantial investment in
       the labor and capital expenditures of a bus system.
       In addition to locating major development along the existing major thoroughfares, the
       land plan anticipates the development of small concentrations of commercial, high-
       density housing and public uses in the new growth areas. These concentrations are
       located at logical intervals along potential public transit routes. At full development of
       the land uses in the new growth areas new transit routes would be within a one-quarter
       mile walk of a substantial percentage of the new households.
       The City can further enhance the use of existing and future transit facilities by providing
       a local shuttle or small bus network linking residents to activity centers at or near the
       transit facility. Such transit facilities can provide connections to more than one form of
       transportation (a multi-modal center) or to a single transportation node.

       C-P-41:           The City shall encourage the expansion of interstate bus service in the

                        and local transit service.
4.14 Goods Movement
       Manteca’s central location and accessibility from major highways and rail lines has made
       the city a major center for goods movement.           The transportation system needs to
       facilitate the goods movement industries in the City to ensure safety for all modes of

                        City engineer to ensure that goods movement needs are adequately
                        served.
4.15 Transportation Demand Management
      The increase in traffic congestion within Manteca and throughout the region has
      intensified the need to promote alternative transportation modes.           Transportation
      Demand Management (TDM) refers to measures designed to reduce the number and
      length of automobile trips, particularly during peak commute hours. TDM measures
      typically include ridesharing, vanpools, and a variety of management techniques applied
      by larger employers in metropolitan areas. Typical TDM measures are most effective
      where they can be implemented by large employers.
      In communities where there is a significant number of workers commuting out to a larger
      metropolitan area the TDM measures focus on ridesharing and vanpooling to reduce the
      number of single occupant vehicle trips. Reduced vehicle travel can help reduce peak
      hour traffic congestion, reduce future air pollution concentrations, and reduce
      consumption of energy for transportation uses. Moreover, it can help reduce individual
      transportation costs for Manteca residents, yielding potentially significant savings as the
      cost of fuel rises.
      Policies: Transportation Demand Management
      C-P-53:           The City shall establish a requirement for a TDM program in any
                        business park, industrial or commercial land use that employs more than
                        50 full time equivalent employees.

      employment opportunities and retail services. Manteca is located in the center of an
      emerging interregional metropolitan area and its economy is in the process of
      transformation. The traditional economic engine of agriculture and food processing,
      although still important, are being supplanted by warehousing and distribution
      industries that take advantage of the central location, relatively affordable land, and
      transportation network. Manteca is also characterized by the high percentage of
      interregional commuters who are attracted by the community’s quality of life and
      relatively affordable housing. This skilled workforce, presently commuting long
      distances, is a resource for economic development. Due in part to the skills of the
      commuter workforce, Manteca is increasingly competitive for the location of
      manufacturing and office uses.
      Job creation is of primary importance in creating a stable economy. New employers
      and existing employers expanding business in Manteca (addressed in “Business
      Sector”) are ways that job creation can occur. It is critical that Manteca residents are
      able to find jobs in the community if desired, at an income level needed to sustain
      their existing lifestyle.
      The future of Manteca’s economic development will hinge on:
                        !     Land Use: Availability of land designated for commercial
                              development- appropriately located and with the correct mix of
                              industrial, office and retail land uses.
                        !     Labor Force: The skills and training of the Manteca workforce.
                        !     Business Sector: Attraction of private sector business
                              investment in the community.

                       !     Housing: The provision of housing that is affordable to the
                             Manteca workforce.
                       !     Quality of Life: The quality of life in the community to draw
                             commercial development and residents.
                       !     Infrastructure: The provision of adequate infrastructure- roads,
                             transit, water, sewer, power, telecommunications- to serve
                             planned development.
      The strategies underlying this Economic Development Element are to address each of
      these factors and to guide the community towards the achievement of the goal of
      economic growth, sustainability, balance, fiscal strength as well as social and
      physical health. This can be accomplished by establishing effective goals, policies,
      and standards in the General Plan and Manteca Municipal Code that will anticipate
      and accommodate new growth and protect and enhance Manteca’s quality of life.
      The General Plan delineates Manteca’s role in a growing regional economy by
      providing opportunities for local employment, a more diversified local economy, and
      increased retail sales. Land use guidelines create an opportunity to further economic
      self-sufficiency and foster sound economic bases that will afford quality service
      levels while maintaining economic competitiveness and encourage retention of
      Manteca’s quality of life.      The land use guidelines established will permit and
      encourage economic activities that create employment opportunities that are
      commensurate with local housing costs, generate a positive sustained revenue flow
      into the City, maximize economic multiplier effects, and minimize reliance on City
      services and expenditures.
5.2  Local Government’s Role in Economic Development
      Economic development is generally described as an activity intended to foster, create,
      or enhance economic opportunities, including jobs, industries, and sales tax base.
      These activities are often regional in scope and organized by local government.
      Private and public development organizations, local businesses, business groups, and
      residents all have a stake in a prosperous economy.           Economic development
      programs commonly include activities related to job creation and retention,

MANTECA GENERAL PLAN 2023                                           ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
      employment training programs, and opportunities for the creation of public and
      private capital investments.
      Local planning, through the inclusion of an Economic Development Element in a
      General Plan, is a key tool to strengthen community development activities, enhance
      economic growth, and reinforce the planning process as a positive part of economic
      development.       An improved local business climate that recognizes regional
      constraints and opportunities, expansion of the local tax base, and enhanced
      employment opportunities are benefits of a planning effort that has an emphasis on
      economic development. Reinforcement of the planning process through the adoption
      of an Economic Development Element is an effective method of managing growth in
      order to achieve a broad range of community goals and objectives, including a
      prosperous economy.
      A prosperous economy is the result of a dynamic interaction of the labor market,
      housing market, business sector, and quality of life. A successful union of these
      factors will help Manteca to capture high value, commercial projects that bolster
      municipal revenue, provide interesting and diverse jobs that pay well, and foster a
      balance of jobs and housing in the community.
5.3  Land Use
      The availability of land, properly located, in appropriate lot configuration, with a
      range of uses is critical to the development of the Community.        Land should be
      designated for commercial development that allows for a response to market pressure
      and which is guided to the correct locations to enhance and preserve the community.
      Goal ED-1.        Provide for adequate land for a wide range of commercial activities.

                        opportunities that match the skills of Manteca residents as well as
                        shopping to meet the needs of residents.

5.6  Housing
      The availability of quality housing, affordable to the existing and prospective
      workforce, is a critical factor in the attraction of employers to Manteca. Housing that
      is affordable to Manteca’s workforce is critical to reduce out-commuting. If the
      housing being developed were not affordable to the Manteca workforce, substantial
      out-commuting would still occur with the jobs filled by commuters from other lower-
      cost areas.    Such a “leapfrog” commute increases traffic, strains infrastructure,
      fractures the community, and undermines environmental quality. It is also important
      that a full range of housing be provided for each segment of the workforce, from
      laborers to executives.
      Goal ED-9.       Promote the development of affordable and market rate housing that
                       matches with the needs of the present and future Manteca work
                       force.
      Goal ED-10.      Provide a variety of housing types to house all segments of the
                       Manteca community in accordance with the Housing Element.
      Policies: Housing
      ED-P-16:         The City shall use appropriate land use, zoning, and permit
                       streamlining strategies, and other financial incentives to provide for
                       and encourage housing types that are compatible with wage
                       structures associated with existing and forecasted employment.
      ED-P-17:         Plan for a broad range of housing types and densities to
                       accommodate all income levels and job classifications.
      ED-P-18:         Plan for a balanced community where the Manteca workforce will be
                       able to afford housing within the city of Manteca.
      Implementation: Housing
      ED-I-44.         Use the Policies and Implementation Measures outlined in the
                       Housing Element to assure provision of housing affordable to the
                       existing and future workforce.

                       incentives to provide for and encourage housing types that are
                       compatible with wage structures associated with existing and
                       forecast employment.
      ED-I-46.         Encourage specific plans and large planned developments throughout
                       the City to include a mix of housing types and density ranges
                       (consistent with the Zoning Ordinance) related to local wage
                       structures to achieve a jobs/housing balance.
      ED-I-47.         Encourage creative approaches to encourage integration of housing
                       production with commercial development.
5.7  Quality of Life
      Maintaining a high standard of living and quality of life is critical to Manteca’s future
      success. Amenities, such as easy circulation, culture, good air quality, low housing
      costs, and availability of jobs, help to ensure a more stable population and attract
      residents and visitors to the community.

5.8  Infrastructure
      The availability of public and private infrastructure to support commercial
      development will dictate whether it will be possible to attract desired commercial
      development to Manteca. Infrastructure investment must be timed to encourage
      economic development activities so as to allow quick responses to market
      opportunities.

6 PUBLIC FACILITIES AND SERVICES ELEMENT
6.1   Purpose
      Public facilities and services provide the framework that supports and sustains the
      community.      They are essential to maintaining the current quality of life and
      accommodating economic growth and development in the community.                      The
      availability and capacity of public infrastructure determines the ability to use land.
      The Public Facilities and Services Element is focused on ensuring that the
      community infrastructure is in place to accommodate the growth and development
      identified in other elements of this General Plan. This element addresses both hard
      infrastructure (such as water and sewer) and public services (recreation and parks)
      that are provided by the City.
      The infrastructure facilities and public services addressed in this element are:
               !   Domestic Water
               !   Sewer
               !   Major Drainage
               !   Electricity Services
               !   Solid Waste
               !   Education
               !   Health Care

PUBLIC FACILITIES AND SERVICES                                    MANTECA GENERAL PLAN 2023
6.2   Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
        The location and capacity of basic infrastructure is closely related to the Land Use
        Element, Housing Element, Circulation Element, and Economic Development
        Element. The goals and policies of these other elements cannot be fully achieved
        where the basic public infrastructure is lacking.
        The Public Facilities and Services Element addresses a broad range of activities by
        the City and the other service agencies in the community. Each of these services and
        activities may have specific goals that relate only to the character of that service.
        These principles establish the fundamental direction for expanding and refining the
        public services in the community.
6.3   Projected Growth Relative to Public Facilities and Services
        Population growth and economic development affect all public services and
        facilities. The City promotes orderly development and accommodates projected
        growth by providing general engineering services to regulate the construction of
        municipal structures, city streets, sewage disposal, water supply, and storm drainage
        facilities. Through regulation, the City provides a high standard of construction for
        public services in order to preserve and protect public health, safety, and
        convenience.
6.4   General Services
        Goal PF-1.       The City will be innovative in new techniques and technologies to
                         provide the best available level of public services in a cost-effective
                         manner.
        Goal PF-2.       Public infrastructure and services will be affordable to the residents
                         and business interests in the City.
        Goal PF-3.       Facilities improvements and services required to serve development
                         will not place an economic burden on existing residents of the City.
                         Development will pay a fair share of all costs of required public
                         infrastructure and services.

      Goal PF-4.       Public improvements and facilities will be designed to enhance,
                       rather than degrade, the natural environment in the City and
                       surrounding area.
      Goal PF-5.       The City’s public services and facilities will support economic
                       development and residential growth in the City.
      Goal PF-6.       Public facilities and services agencies will cooperate on a regional
                       basis.
      Guiding Policies: General
      PF-P-1.          Facilitate  development     in   the  in-fill areas    by   extending
                       infrastructure.
      PF-P-2.          Encourage comprehensive development rather than incremental,
                       single project development.
      PF-P-3.          Make use of the public right-of-way as a tool for facilitating quality
                       design and development.
      Implementation Policies: General
      PF-I-1.          The City shall periodically review its fee schedules for water and
                       sewer connections and for city facilities and major equipment and
                       revise them as necessary.
6.5  Domestic Water
      Supply
      Water facilities in the City of Manteca consist primarily of water wells and
      transmission mains. Past development has generally occurred concentrically out
      from the center of the community. Water distribution facilities in the portion of the
      City that is generally developed (i.e., from Airport Way to SR 99 and from Lathrop
      Road to SR 120) have been near fully constructed and have the capacity to serve the

PUBLIC FACILITIES AND SERVICES                                    MANTECA GENERAL PLAN 2023
        existing development plus the future infill development. The outlying areas will
        need to have water transmission pipelines extended from the existing grid before
        development can occur. Additionally, these areas will need to develop new sources
        of supply, in the form of well, to provide for the water demands.
        The City of Manteca’s target Level of Service (LOS) for water is to supply an
        average of 200 gallons per day per person at pressures no less than 40 pounds per
        square inch (average conditions) and 20 pounds per square inch (emergency and
        peak demand conditions) (PFIP). Additional flow is needed for fire suppression of
        1,250 gallons per minute (gpm) for residential uses, 2,500 gpm for commercial land
        uses, and 3,500 gpm for industrial land uses.
        Future Water Demand
        The LOS targets identified should be maintained through all future development.
        The PFIP is intended to identify the location, timing, and financing of future water
        demand. Generally, water facilities to serve the demand created by new growth can
        be expanded relatively easily and in a cost-effective manner by constructing
        transmission pipelines and wells.
        Future demand for water facilities is generated by new development, in accordance
        with the Land Use Plan, based on the relative average demand for water by the
        various land use types. The PFIP addresses the specific calculation and provides for
        infrastructure improvements to meet future water demand.
        The City of Manteca currently relies entirely on groundwater to meet the water
        demand of its residents. The current demand overdrafts the existing groundwater
        supply, which if continued, will result in degradation of our groundwater resources.
        While the City’s water supply continues to comply with all Federal and State
        drinking water standards, measures must be taken to ensure future water quality.
        The City of Manteca has planned to supplement the groundwater with treated surface
        water from the South County Surface Water Project to eliminate over-drafting thus
        preserving groundwater quality for Manteca’s future.

                       irrigation where feasible, within the parameters of State and County
                       Health Codes and standards.
6.6  Sewer
      Generally, the land within the existing developed City has trunk sewer constructed to
      fully serve the expected development. Undeveloped areas will require new municipal
      sewer collection facilities in order to develop.
      Manteca’s target level of service for sewer is to collect and treat an average of 325
      gallons per day per dwelling unit equivalent (due). This standard is applicable both
      in the areas of Manteca that have already developed and in the geographic areas
      where development is expected. Maintaining this same standard as development
      occurs will require innovative solutions to extending the reach of the standard over
      greater distances than in the past.

        Average Household Demand for Sewer Service
        Demand for sewer facilities is generated by the land uses established in the Land Use
        Plan and by the residents, employees, and visitors of those land uses that are being
        served. Future expansion of sewer collection facilities is required to maintain the
        existing LOS and timing standards.
        Sewer collection dwelling unit equivalent (due) factors are calculated in the PFIP
        based on the relative average generation of wastewater for the various land use types.
        Sewer generation factors are based upon the expected building intensities and
        population densities. For example, the average daily generation per unit for Low
        Density Residential (LDR) is calculated as the product of the population per unit
        (3.25) times the average daily per capita generation (100 gallons). As a result, the
        LDR generation is 325 gallons per unit per day. Sewer flow generation factors are
        based upon industry standards applicable to conceptual level facilities planning and
        professional judgement.
        Sewer
        Goal PF-8.      Maintain an adequate level of service in the City’s sewage collection

                         !    designing wastewater systems to minimize inflow and
                              infiltration to the extent economically feasible; and
                         !    maintaining a Citywide map of all sewer collection system
                              components and monitoring the condition of the system on a
                              regular basis.
6.7   Major Drainage
        The capacity of the French Camp Outlet Channel and its tributary drains is the
        limiting factor that sets the flow rates for drainage systems in the city. Location of
        the discharge along the outlet conduits and channels is not a factor affecting the
        hydraulic capacity requirements of the system. Therefore, regardless of position
        along the channel, each tributary subarea along the system is provided the same level
        of service.
        The City of Manteca’s target level of service is to provide 10-year storm drainage
        protection for all development and to provide 100-year storm drainage protection for
        all structures.
        All storm water is to flow to detention basins in order to help control both the quality
        and quantity of storm runoff discharge to the main drainage system, and ultimately
        the San Joaquin River.        Detention basins are designed to temporarily hold and
        gradually release water for short periods not to exceed 72 hours. Retention basins do
        not provide for release but will allow water to percolate or evaporate within a 72-
        hour period.

                     detention basins as a condition of development approval according
                     to the standards of the Drainage Master Plan. The responsibility for
                     the dedication and improvement of detention basins shall be based
                     on the prorated share of stormwater runoff resulting from each
                     development.
      PF-P-28.       Storm drainage systems within new development areas shall include
                     open drainage corridors where feasible to supplement or replace an
                     underground piped drainage system. The drainage systems would
                     provide for short-term storm water detention, storm water
                     conveyance for storm waters exceeding a 10-year event, storm water
                     quality treatment, bike and pedestrian paths, and visual open space
                     within neighborhoods. The width and length of the corridors would
                     be determined by the stormwater management requirements. The
                     drainage systems would provide a pedestrian connection between
                     parks and access to open space from residential neighborhoods. The
                     neighborhoods would be designed with homes oriented to, rather

                         for adequacy and consistency with the General Plan.
6.8   Electricity
        The availability of relatively cost-effective power is essential for many types of
        businesses and residents of Manteca. In order to expand economic development
        opportunities and enhance the quality of life, the City must seek and support
        expansion of the available power supply. Recent events in California’s electric
        industry have further demonstrated the need for available power to new
        development.
        Over the past twenty years, California has transformed its electric system from one
        that was integrated and highly regulated to one that is unbundled and increasingly
        subject to competitive markets and federal oversight. In 1996, the State of California
        passed deregulation legislation to allow for wholesale trading of electricity and
        implement competition at the retail level. During the ensuing years, demand for
        electricity has increased and electric generating capacity has decreased (U.S.
        Department of Energy, June 2001).
        During the summer of 2001, California experienced rotating electrical outages.
        These outages have reduced the reliability of electricity; that is, the assurance of
        adequate supply and the security of operations. Electricity reliability is based on the
        following factors:
                 !   Higher summer temperatures will increase customer electrical demand.
                 !   Hydroelectric generation will be limited by low water levels and reduced
                     snowpack.
                 !   Planned new generating powerplants may not come online when
                     expected.
                 !   Forced outages of generating capacity may be more than expected.

6.10 Education
      Education opportunities are important for the quality of life of residents and the
      overall sense of community that a good school system provides. The education
      programs and facilities are an integral part of the community. Good local education
      opportunity is also an important factor in economic development. The local public
      school system is essential because future employees will prefer to locate where their
      children have access to quality education.
      Advanced education and training is important for residents to expand their interests
      and increase their job skills. Technological advances in many fields require that
      workers have access to on-going training. Therefore, adult education and life-long
      learning opportunities will become increasingly important.

        Parks are an important part of the overall vision for the City of Manteca. The
        primary intent of park improvements in the City is to provide recreation amenities
        for the residents. A secondary objective is to provide space for public gatherings
        that may attract visitors to the community. In addition to the typical purposes of
        providing for open space and recreation for City residents, the parks are envisioned
        as space for music, craft fairs, and other public events. Consequently, the parks need
        to be designed to serve a variety of roles.
        In order to meet the primary objective of resident recreation, the park facilities need
        to be designed with the local neighborhoods in mind. Parks should be distributed

7 SAFETY ELEMENT
      The Safety Element identifies the potential hazards in the community that must be
      considered when planning the location, type, and intensity of development. The
      primary objective of the Safety Element is to reduce the potential for loss of life,
      injuries, and property damage that could result from a natural or a man-made disaster.
      Specific topics addressed in this Element include:
               !   Geologic and Seismic Hazards
               !   Flood Hazards
               !   Hazardous Materials
               !   Emergency Response Planning
7.1 Geologic and Seismic Hazards
      Subsidence Potential
      Subsidence is the settlement of soils due to either desiccation (dehydration) and
      shrinkage or oxidation of organic material, or both, following drainage. Subsidence is
      not a characteristic of the nineteen soil series found within the Study Area. (Soil
      Survey of San Joaquin County, California, Soil Conservation Service, U.S.
      Department of Agriculture, 1988)
      Seismic Hazards
      A seismic hazard is due to existence of active or potentially active earthquake faults.
      The term “earthquake” is used to describe both sudden slip on a fault, and the
      resulting ground shaking and radiated seismic energy caused by the slip, or by
      volcanic or magmatic activity, or other sudden stress changes in the earth.
OCTOBER 6, 2003                                                                          7-1

       The Alquist-Priolo Special Studies Zone Act of 1972 is directed at areas identified by
       the California State Geologist as having active surface fault ruptures.          It is a
       regulatory prohibition to build across a surface fault rupture of active faults. It
       addresses earthquake safety in building permits and subdivision procedures by
       requiring project applicants to submit a registered geologist’s report describing the
       potential for on-site surface rupture.
       Manteca is not located within an Alquist-Priolo Fault-Rupture Hazard Zone. There
       are faults located in the region, but there are no known faults located within or
       adjacent to the study area.
       Goal S-1.        Prevent loss of lives, injury, and property damage due to geological
                        hazards and seismic activity.
       Goal S-2.        Prevent loss of lives, injury, and property damage due to the collapse
                        of buildings and critical facilities, and to prevent disruption of
                        essential services in the event of an earthquake.
       Policies: Geologic and Seismic Safety
       S-P-1.           The City shall require preparation of geological reports and/or
                        geological engineering reports for proposed new development
                        located in areas of potentially significant geological hazards,

7.2  Flood Hazards
      Flood hazards in the Planning Area are the result of the 100-year flood, localized
      drainage problems, and dam failure. The primary effects of flooding are caused by
OCTOBER 6, 2003                                                                       7-3
SAFETY                                                                MANTECA GENERAL PLAN
       the initial force of floodwaters that can shatter structures and uplift vehicles.
       Floodwaters can carry large objects downstream which have the force to remove
       stationary structures. Saturation of materials and earth can cause instability, collapse,
       and damage. Objects can be buried through sediment deposition. Floods can cause
       drowning or isolation of persons and animals. Floodwaters can break utility lines,
       interrupting services and potentially affecting health and safety, particularly in the
       case of broken sewer or gas lines. The secondary effects of flooding are due to
       standing water. Standing water can result in loss of crops, septic tank failure, and
       water well contamination. Standing water can also damage road, foundations, and
       electrical circuits.
       Impervious Surfaces and Stormwater Runoff
       Those development and redevelopment activities authorized under the General Plan
       Update will result in the introduction of additional impervious surfaces in the
       planning area and diminish the amount of pervious areas where rain waters can
       permeate. Based on the higher urbanized nature of the planning area, the extent of
       additional site coverage and the additional storm flows resulting therefrom will be
       minimal.
       Storm water pollution can result from the contamination of runoff from urban areas
       as it drains from streets or property through the municipal storm water drainage
       system and into waterways (rivers, sloughs, creeks etc.) The contaminated storm
       water may affect commercial fisheries, restrict swimming areas or affect the
       navigability of the regional waters.
       100-Year Flood Areas
       The primary flood hazard in the study area is the San Joaquin River and its
       tributaries. The hydrology of the region consists of this established river system and
       can be directly affected by several external factors. Meteorological events such as
       intense precipitation may adversely affect the natural drainage of the region. In
       addition, seasonal snowmelt will significantly contribute to the volume of water in
       the local hydrologic system. Urbanization contributes to an increased volume in the
       hydrologic system by maintaining a high percentage of impervious surface, which
7-4                                                                         OCTOBER 6, 2003
MANTECA GENERAL PLAN                                                                    SAFETY
      does not allow for infiltration of water into the soil and thus results in increased
      velocities and volumes of runoff. All of these factors can lead to exceeding the
      natural carrying capacity of the existing hydrology, which results in flooding of low-
      lying areas.
      Dam Failure Inundation
      Portions of the 100-year floodplain would be subject to inundation in the event of
      dam failure. Although the likelihood is remote, the area subject to inundation within
      the study area is not specifically defined, but would generally coincide with the area
      delineated as the 100-year floodplain.

7.3   Hazardous Materials
       The handling of hazardous materials is a daily activity in truck and train traffic that
       pass near or through the City. The Federal Government, under Title 49 of the Code
       of Federal Regulations, lists thousands of hazardous materials, ranging from
7-6                                                                         OCTOBER 6, 2003
MANTECA GENERAL PLAN                                                                    SAFETY
      radioactive waste and explosives to gasoline, insecticides, and household cleaning
      products.
      Urban development in general introduces potential for pollution. Often, pollution
      found on the ground can be carried to water sources through stormwater runoff. The
      stormwater runoff can be expected to contain trace concentrations of nutrients,
      turbidity, oil and grease, and heavy metals. Some common sources of pollution
      include:
                !     leakage of petroleum products from automobiles onto roads and
                      parking areas;
                !     fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides applied to lawns, golf course turf,
                      gardens and other landscaping;
                !     excrement from pets and livestock;
                !     human waste and waste water generation;
                !     inappropriate disposal of house-hold and commercial chemicals;
                !     sediment introduced from bare ground and graded surfaces; and
                !     solid waste disposal.
      Light industrial development is expected to involve storage and use of hazardous
      materials. Commercial development such as automotive repair shops will also utilize
      hazardous materials.      Hazardous wastes are expected to be generated by some
      businesses.
      Pollution and stormwater runoff can be hazardous to the general population as well as
      specific populations surrounding pollution sources.
      Storage
      Safe and proper storage of hazardous materials incorporates a variety of techniques,
      depending upon the type of material being stored. Underground storage tanks are
      commonly used for the storage of hazardous material, especially petroleum products.
OCTOBER 6, 2003                                                                             7-7

       These storage devices are found most often at gas stations and business operating
       vehicle fleets. Leaking underground storage tanks contaminate the surrounding soil
       and possibly the water table. There are several gas stations operating within the City
       of Manteca, especially near SR 99 and SR 120. The Union Pacific Railroad facilities
       are another potential location of hazardous materials storage.
       Transportation
       Hazardous materials are routinely transported by truck over state and federal
       highways as well as local roads (e.g., gasoline tankers). The California Vehicle Code
       Section 31303 requires that hazardous materials be transported via routes with the
       least overall travel time and prohibits the transportation of hazardous materials
       through residential neighborhoods.
       The Union Pacific Railroad through the City must be considered a possible source of
       hazardous material spills. In the event of a derailing or other railroad accident, the
       residents could be exposed to any hazardous materials being transported by the
       railroad.
       Disposal
       Hazardous material, used in many household products (e.g., drain cleaners, waste oil,
       cleaning fluids, insecticides, and car batteries) are often improperly disposed of as a
       part of normal household trash. Furthermore, there is risk to the community from
       exposure or explosion caused by adding hazardous waste to landfills that are not
       equipped to handle those materials.
       Emergency Response
       Response to a hazardous waste spill varies according to the circumstances under
       which it is released. Union Pacific Railroad has primary responsibility for hazards
       materials spill on its premises. Hazardous materials spills on the state and federal
       highways are the responsibility of Caltrans and the California Highway Patrol (CHP),
       providing on-scene management of the spill site and coordinating with the
       Environmental Health Department, Office of Emergency Services, and the local fire

8. RESOURCE CONSERVATION ELEMENT
      *(This element was titled Natural Resources in the 1988 General Plan).
      Clean air and water, healthy agricultural land and soil, and open space opportunities
      make Manteca an attractive place to live and work. These assets must be conserved
      and protected as the community grows and the population increases.
      This General Plan seeks to accommodate population growth while conserving and
      protecting the area’s natural resources and quality of life. Economic development
      (i.e. growth) and maintaining quality of life are not inconsistent and contradictory
      goals. Indeed, economic development for the City of Manteca depends on protecting
      the natural resources that are essential to the quality of life in Manteca.
8.1 Authority
      The Conservation Element and the Open Space Element are both mandated by the
      Government Code (Sections 65302(d) and 65302(e)). The Conservation Element is
      required to:
                   “...provide direction regarding the conservation, development,
                   and utilization of natural resources.”
      The Open Space Element is required to:
                   “...guide the comprehensive and long-range preservation and
                   conservation of ‘open-space land’ (Section 65563). Open-space
                   land is defined in the code as any parcel or area of land or water
                   that is essentially unimproved and devoted to open-space use
                   (Section 65560(b)).”
      The discussion of these topics are organized under the following headings:
               !   Water Conservation
               !   Energy Conservation
               !   Soils and Erosion Control

8.2   Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
       The required topics for the Resource Conservation Element indicate substantial
       overlap with other Elements of this General Plan. For example, water supply and
       energy sources are also addressed in the Pubic Services and Facilities Element. Open
       space is addressed in the Land Use Element. Energy efficiency is discussed in the
       Community Design Element and the Circulation Element.
8.3   Water Conservation
       Goal RC-1.      Minimize the consumption of water to reasonable levels consistent
                       with a high level of amenities and quality of life for City residents

8.4   Energy Conservation
       Successful growth in Manteca is dependent in part on conservation and planning for
       the future allocation of energy resources. The primary goals are not only to conserve
       and protect current energy resources, but also to seek new sources of energy for
       current and future land use.
       Energy supply and conservation are also addressed in the Public Facilities and
       Services Element and the Housing Element.

8.5  Soils and Erosion Control
      The primary concerns regarding soil erosion are soil loss, and water quality loss due
      to erosion and sedimentation. The effect on water quality is discussed below. Soil
      loss is due primarily to development and land management practices that leave
      disturbed soil exposed to weather.
      Goal RC-6.       Preserve and maintain Manteca’s soils to avoid pollution of surface
                       waters, decreased air quality, and loss of soil.

8.6   Water Quality
       Water quality refers to protection of both surface and groundwater resources from
       contamination. Protecting surface water quality involves minimizing sedimentation
       from soil erosion, and minimizing pollution of waterways and other water bodies
       from urban runoff. Protecting groundwater quality requires maintaining high water
       quality within the water systems.        The policies in this Element address the
       management of land development and use of potential contaminants.

       Tidewater Bikeway, which was a former railroad right-of-way. Protection of open
       space is fundamental to maintain the quality of life enjoyed by current and future
       residents. New development will inherently change some aspects of the open space
       resource through conversion of agricultural land. However, through planning for the
       location and character of new development, open space areas can be preserved.
       Open space is also addressed in the Biological Resources discussion below.
       Manteca’s open space areas are intended to serve the following purposes:
       •   Open space for the preservation of natural and biological resources. Such
           areas are required for the preservation of plant and animal life, including habitat
           for plant and wildlife species (particularly rare, endangered, or threatened plant
           and wildlife species), areas required for ecological and other scientific study
           purposes, tributaries of the San Joaquin River, and wetlands.
       •   Open space for the recreation opportunities. Many open space areas can be
           used for passive recreation, such as walking and hiking.
       •   Public health and safety. This refers to areas requiring special management or
           regulation due to hazardous or special conditions, such as earthquake fault zones,
           unstable soil areas, and areas required for the protection and enhancement of air
           quality.
       Goal RC-8.       To provide adequate land for open space as a framework for urban
                        development, to meet the passive recreation needs of the community,
                        and to set aside wildlife habitat.
8.7.1  Policies: Open Space
       RC-P-16.         Provide public and private open space within urbanized parts of
                        Manteca, in order to provide visual contrast with the built
                        environment and to provide for the recreational needs of residents
       RC-P-17.         Provide access to public open space areas.
       RC-P-18.         New development shall maximize the potential for open space and
                        visual experiences.

       RC-I-26.         Use a system of open space corridors to provide pedestrian and
                        bicycle connections between schools, parks and other recreation
                        areas, commercial uses, and employment centers. This system of
                        open space corridors should be connected to the Tidewater Bikeway
                        where feasible, and to a citywide bike and pedestrian trail system as
                        defined in the Circulation Element.
       RC-I-27.         Require all new development to provide linkages to existing and

                        space system and natural resource areas.
8.8   Agricultural Resources
       Manteca is located in an area of rich agricultural resources, including orchards,
       dairies, vineyards, row crops, and pasture land.      A wide variety of agricultural
       production takes place in Manteca. Manteca desires to recognize the value of local
       agricultural resources. The City of Manteca has adopted a right-to-farm ordinance
       that requires developers of new subdivisions adjacent to agricultural land to notify
       new homebuyers that agricultural uses may present problems such as dust, noise, and
       odors.
       Some of the farmland in Manteca has agricultural preserve status, under Williamson
       Act contracts (see Land Use Element).

8.9   Biological Resources
       The land area surrounding the urbanized portion of Manteca is predominantly
       farmland, including alfalfa, orchards, row crops, and pasture. Agricultural lands have
       become important foraging resources for a number of species, including Swainson’s
       Hawk which is a California State and federally protected species. Riparian woodland
       is found along the San Joaquin River to the west of the Study Area, and along its
       tributary, Walthall Slough. This riparian woodland is of special interest as the last
       remnant of natural vegetation that was once more extensive. Riparian woodland
       provides food and cover for a large number of wildlife species. Wetlands have also
       been identified along Highway 120 in the eastern portion of the Study Area.
8.10 San Joaquin County Multi-Species Habitat Conservation and Open Space
      Plan
       The San Joaquin County Multi-Species Habitat Conservation and Open Space Plan
       (SJMSCP) is a multi-species, multi-habitat, multi-purpose open space management
       program for all of San Joaquin County. The Manteca City Council adopted the
       SJMSCP (Resolution #R2001-46) on February 5, 2001, signing a Joint Powers
       Agreement with other City, County, State, and Federal agencies.
       The SJMSCP is a 50-year Plan (2001 – 2051) that provides compensation for the
       conversion of open space to non-open space uses which affect the plant, fish, and
       wildlife species covered by the Plan. The Plan also includes some compensation to
       offset the impacts of open space conversions on non-wildlife related resources such
       as recreation, agriculture, scenic values, and other beneficial open space.
       Goal RC-10.      Protect sensitive native vegetation and wildlife communities and
                        habitat in Manteca.

                       required by existing regulations. Project proponents shall comply
                       with all requirements for protecting federally protected wetlands.
       RC-I-35.        Continue to enforce the City’s heritage tree ordinance which defines
                       and identifies mature trees to be protected, and establishes
                       regulations for their protection and removal.
       RC-I-36.        Limit the access of pedestrians and bicyclists to wetland areas so that

                       feasible, that includes passive recreational and educational
                       opportunities with the protection of wildlife and vegetation habitat
                       areas.
8.11 Mineral Resources
       The State of California has identified lands in the General Plan Study Area, near the
       San Joaquin River, as areas of significant mineral resources. In particular, sand
       deposits in these areas are considered to be of regional significance. However,
       Brown Sand and Gravel, Incorporated, the only operator within the Study Area
       (Oakwood Lake Pit), has completed mining operations. Oakwood Lake Resort has
       been created from reclaimed mined lands.
8.12 CULTURAL RESOURCES
       The prehistory of the Manteca area is based on the archaeology of the greater
       Sacramento Delta region. Modern Manteca began as a railroad flag stop, Powell's
       Station, at the present location of downtown. Community life within Manteca's
       present city limits focused on the corner of Louise Avenue and Union Road.

       Residential neighborhoods were beginning to fill in by 1918. The City of Manteca
       was incorporated on May 28, 1918. During the 1950's, the City grew even faster, as
       Manteca's inexpensive housing and small-town atmosphere drew workers from the
       Sharpe Army Depot in Lathrop and industrial plants in outlying areas.

9 NOISE ELEMENT
9.1 INTRODUCTION
      Noise is generally defined as unwanted sound. A sound that may be disturbing to
      one person may go unnoticed by another. Noise levels have been quantified into
      units called “decibels” (dB) to remove the subjective reaction to noise by persons of
      differing sensitivities to noise. All sound levels referred to in this document are in
      A-weighted decibels (often abbreviated dBA). A-weighting de-emphasizes the very
      low and very high frequencies of sound in a manner that is similar to how the human
      ear perceives sound.
      The contents of the Noise Element and the methods used in its preparation have been
      determined by the requirements of Section 65302 (f) of the California Government
      Code and by the Guidelines for the Preparation and Content of the Noise Element of
      the General Plan prepared by the California Department of Health Services and
      included in the 1990 State of California General Plan Guidelines, published by the
      State Office of Planning and Research. The Guidelines require that major noise
      sources and areas containing noise-sensitive land uses be identified and quantified by
      preparing generalized noise exposure contours for current and projected conditions.
      Contours may be prepared in terms of either the Community Noise Equivalent Level
      (CNEL) or the Day-Night Average Level (Ldn), which are descriptors of total noise
      exposure at a given location for an annual average day. The CNEL and Ldn are
      generally considered to be equivalent descriptors of the community noise
      environment within plus or minus 1.0 dB.
      Sources of noise can be divided into two categories: stationary and mobile sources.
      Within the City of Manteca, the primary source of noise is vehicular traffic along SR
      99, SR 120, and other arterial routes (e.g. Yosemite Avenue). Additional noise
      impacts are produced from rail traffic along the rail lines that cross through the City.
      The purpose of the Noise Element is to define goals and policies for managing the
      effect of sound in the community. It is the overall goal of the Noise Element to
      protect the health and welfare of the community by promoting community
      development and activities that are compatible with noise level criteria.

9.2   Sensitive Land Uses
       Noise sensitive land uses refer to specific uses where a person would be adversely
       impacted by noise and where the person would have the expectation of a relatively
       quiet environment. Uses generally include residences of all types, nursing homes,
       day care centers, medical facilities, schools, parks, and open space (see Table 9-1 for
       complete list of sensitive land uses).
9.3   Noise Goals
       The existing city is a relatively quiet residential community with the notable
       exceptions of the railroad operations, traffic noise from SR 99 and SR 120, and
       commercial/industrial uses. These sources are endemic to the community and cannot
       be easily avoided.     The fundamental objective is to avoid creating new noise
       generating conditions that would degrade the existing community environment, or to
       place a sensitive land use where it would be adversely affected by an existing noise
       source.
       Goal N-1.        Protect the residents of Manteca from the harmful and annoying
                        effects of exposure to excessive noise.
       Goal N-2.        Protect the quality of life in the community and the tourism economy
                        from noise generated by incompatible land uses.
       Goal N-3.        Ensure that the downtown core noise levels remain acceptable and
                        compatible with commercial and higher density residential land
                        uses.
       Goal N-4.        Protect public health and welfare by eliminating existing noise
                        problems where feasible, by establishing standards for acceptable
                        indoor and outdoor noise, and by preventing significant increases in
                        noise levels.
       Goal N-5.        Incorporate noise considerations into land use planning decisions,

9.4   POLICIES AND IMPLEMENTATION MEASURES
9.4.1  Policies:
       N-P-1:        Areas within Manteca exposed to existing or projected exterior noise
                     levels from mobile noise sources exceeding the performance
                     standards in Table 9-1 shall be designated as noise-impacted areas.
       N-P-2:        New development of residential or other noise-sensitive land uses
                     will not be permitted in noise-impacted areas unless effective
                     mitigation measures are incorporated into the project design to
                     satisfy the performance standards in Table 9-1.
       N-P-3:        The City may permit the development of new noise-sensitive uses
                     only where the noise level due to fixed (non-transportation) noise
                     sources satisfies the noise level standards of Table 9-2.      Noise
                     mitigation may be required to meet Table 9-2 performance
                     standards.
       N-P-4:        The City shall require stationary noise sources proposed adjacent to
                     noise sensitive uses to be mitigated so as to not exceed the noise
                     level performance standards in Table 9-2.
       N-P-5:        In accord with the Table 9-2 standards, the City shall regulate
                     construction-related noise impacts on adjacent uses.
       N-P-6:        Where the development of residential or other noise-sensitive land
                     use is proposed for a noise-impacted area, an acoustical analysis is
                     required as part of the environmental review process so that noise
                     mitigation may be considered in the project design. The acoustical
                     analysis shall:
                    •    Be the responsibility of the applicant.
                    •    Be prepared by a qualified acoustical consultant experienced in
                         the fields of environmental noise assessment and architectural
                         acoustics.

                  sampling periods and locations to adequately describe local
                  conditions and the predominant noise sources.
              •   Estimate existing and projected (20 years) noise levels in terms
                  of the standards of Table 9-1 or Table 9-2, and compare those
                  levels to the adopted policies of the Noise Element.
              •   Recommend       appropriate    mitigation   measures   to   achieve
                  compliance with the adopted policies and standards of the Noise
                  Element.
              •   Estimate noise exposure after the prescribed mitigation measures
                  have been implemented.
              •   Describe a post-project assessment program that could be used to
                  monitor the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation measures.
      N-P-7:   Noise level criteria applied to land uses other than residential or
               other noise-sensitive uses shall be consistent with noise performance
               levels of Table 9-1 and Table 9-2.
      N-P-8:   The City shall enforce the Sound Transmission Control Standards of
               the California Building Code concerning the construction of new

         Each of the noise levels specified above should be lowered by five (5) dB for simple noise
       tones, noises consisting primarily of speech or music, or recurring impulsive noises. Such
       noises are generally considered by residents to be particularly annoying and are a primary
       source of noise complaints.

         No standards have been included for interior noise levels. Standard construction practices
       should, with the exterior noise levels identified, result in acceptable interior noise levels.
9.4.2  Implementation:
       N-I-1.             New development in residential areas with an actual or projected
                          exterior noise level of greater than 60 dB Ldn will be conditioned to
                          use mitigation measures to reduce exterior noise levels to less than
                          or equal to 60 dB Ldn.

                          by federal regulations, through coordination with the Manteca Police
                          Department and the California Highway Patrol.
       N-I-3.             In making a determination of impact under the California
                          Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), a substantial increase will
                          occur if ambient noise levels are increased by 10 dB or more. An
                          increase from 5-10 dB may be substantial. Factors to be considered
                          in determining the significance of increases from 5-10 dB include:
                               •    the resulting noise levels

                     routes, using the standards contained in Table 9-1. However, noise
                     from these projects may be allowed to exceed the standards
                     contained in Table 9-1, if the City Council finds that there are
                     special overriding circumstances.

10    AIR QUALITY ELEMENT
10.1 Introduction
      Clean air is a critical environmental resource that affects the daily life of residents
      and can be a significant factor in sustaining the economic viability of the City. The
      Air Quality Element promotes air quality standards in all aspects of development,
      transportation, and activity affected by this General Plan to protect the health and
      welfare of the community.
      The Air Quality Element addresses the primary air quality concerns in the region.
      These include ozone precursors from internal combustion engines (smog), dust and
      other man-made airborne particles, objectionable odors and hazardous or toxic
      fumes.
      Air pollution is typically a regional concern, but the City has influence over factors
      that contribute to local air pollution. Cities and counties are responsible for
      implementing air friendly community planning that promotes pedestrian traffic,
      commute alternatives, and cleaner transit fleets, and can cooperate in policies and
      implementation to redress existing jobs housing imbalances that result in significant
      commuting trips. Local government policies and implementation measures can have
      a strong beneficial effect on limiting air pollution.
      The methods by which the City can address these air quality concerns generally fall
      into the following action categories.
                       !    Reduce the number of vehicle miles traveled by automobiles,
                            particularly short range, cold-start trips that have the highest
                            emissions.
                       !    Reduce the use of two stroke internal combustion engines, such
                            as lawn mowers and leaf blowers.
                       !    Control activities that generate particulate materials, such as
                            woodburning fireplaces and stoves, leaf and trash burning, and
                            dust from construction activities.

                        !    Control activities that could generate toxic or obnoxious fumes
                             and separate these activities from residences, schools, hospitals
                             and other sensitive land uses.
10.2 Existing Conditions in Manteca
       Air pollution in Manteca and the San Joaquin Valley is attributable to several factors.
                        !    Vehicles, both from local traffic and from the presence of two
                             major thoroughfares (Interstate 5 and State Route 99)
                             transecting the Valley.
                        !    Long, warm summer days and surrounding mountains that trap
                             air within the San Joaquin Valley.
                        !    Pollution from other areas transported to the San Joaquin Valley
                             by prevailing winds.
       The City of Manteca is within the jurisdiction of the San Joaquin Valley Air
       Pollution Control District (SJVAPCD). SJVAPCD was created to improve the health
       and quality of life for all San Joaquin Valley residents through cooperative and
       effective air quality programs. The District develops plans and implements control
       measures in program areas. These controls primarily affect stationary sources such
       as factories and plants.
10.3 Air Quality Goals
       Goal AQ-1.       Improve air quality by:
                        !    Achieving and maintaining ambient air quality standards
                             established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the
                             California Air Resources Board, and the San Joaquin Air
                             Pollution Control District;
                        !    Minimizing public exposure to toxic or hazardous air pollutants;

11      ADMINISTRATION AND IMPLEMENTATION
        ELEMENT
11.1 Introduction
        The Administration and Implementation Element provides a tool to City staff and
        elected officials to administer and implement the General Plan. This Element is the
        framework for review of individual actions and programs (implementation measures)
        and review of the comprehensive General Plan.
        Although the General Plan covers a long-range period, it is not intended to be an
        inflexible document. This General Plan is based on estimates of future growth and
        development. As time passes, certain assumptions made in the General Plan may no
        longer be valid, due to changing circumstances or new information.
        To ensure that the General Plan is true to the original vision and principles it should
        be reviewed at regular intervals of approximately five years. Periodic adjustments to
        the General Plan may occur from time to time, as development opportunities emerge.
11.2 Administration and Implementation Goals
