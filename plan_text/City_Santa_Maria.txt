                                    PREFACE
The Environmental Resources Management Element (ERME) was adopted by the City
Council on April 4, 1981. The ERME includes the state-required Open Space and
Conservation Elements. Reformatted in April 1987, the ERME includes amendments
made through November 1993. This document updates the ERME that was adopted in
1981 and provides new information, and develops new goals, policies, objectives
and implementation programs.
The goals, policies, objectives and programs in the ERME Update are based on
the findings contained in the Background Information Report (BIR) that was
prepared in January 1996. The Background Information Report is included as the
technical appendix to the ERME Update.
The former ERME primarily addressed environmental issues with respect to
natural resources and did not fully address man-made resources such as public
infrastructure, facilities and services. In order to broaden the scope of this
element, public facilities and services, recreation and parks, private
community services (including schools), and growth management have been
incorporated into this document.    This element has also been renamed as the
Resources Management Element (RME).
The RME fulfills the State Planning Act (Government Code Sections 65302(d) and
65302(e)) which mandates that a local agency's general plan include a
conservation element and open space element. The RME consists of the City of
Santa Maria's Conservation and Open Space Elements, and Elements that address
Recreation and Parks, Public Facilities and Services, Private Community
Services, and Growth Management.
                                                                ADOPTED MAY 7, 1996

                                I. INTRODUCTION
A.    INTRODUCTION
The City's ability to sustain growth depends on the availability and
utilization of resources, and the capacity of public facilities and services.
As the City of Santa Maria's population increases, the demand for resources
will also increase.    Consequently, non-renewable resources will continue to
decrease, and without proper management, resources that are considered
renewable will also diminish. The quantity and quality of resources will also
be affected.   Thus, it is extremely important that the City of Santa Maria
address resource concerns.
Growth in Santa Maria does not only depend on natural resources and
environmental constraints.    The capacity and quality of the City's public
facilities and services are also important issues.       Without adequate public
infrastructure, the residents of the City will experience reduced levels of
service.
The Resources Management Element (RME) is a comprehensive long-range planning
document which sets forth goals, policies, objectives, and programs to address
the conservation and preservation of those resources that are valuable to the
City of Santa Maria and its planning area. The RME also includes the provision
of public facilities, public services, private community services, and park and
recreation facilities to meet the existing and future needs of the community.
B.    ASSUMPTIONS
The Resources Management Element is based on certain assumptions which have a
direct effect on the physical resources within the Planning Area, and the
City's ability to provide public facilities and services.            The following
assumptions are based on past and current trends as well as future projections.
      1)    The anticipated growth associated with development under the Land
            Use Element will result in a corresponding increase in demand for
            resources (renewable and nonrenewable), public facilities, public
            services, and parks and recreation facilities.
      2)    As current, nonrenewable resources (oil, natural gas, water) become
            scarce, conservation, and the utilization of renewable resources
            will become the only acceptable alternatives.
      3)    Based on the growth rate assumptions from the Land Use Element and
            Sphere Study, the City's population is expected to be about 82,400
            in the year 2000 and 100,000 by the year 2010. According to the
            1994 Growth Forecast prepared by the Santa Barbara County
            Association of Governments (SBCAG), Orcutt is expected to have a
            population of about 37,600 people by the year 2010. The population
            of the Santa Maria/Orcutt area is projected to be 137,600 by the
            year 2010.
                                                                    ADOPTED MAY 7, 1996

                    II.  CONSERVATION AND OPEN SPACE ELEMENTS
A.    INTRODUCTION
This Element of the General Plan combines the state-required Conservation and
Open Space Elements.       As such, the Element addresses the conservation,
development and utilization of natural resources, and the preservation and
enhancement of archaeological and cultural resources of historical significance
to the City of Santa Maria and the Santa Maria Valley.
1.    Conservation
      Conservation is the wise management of resources to prevent waste,
      destruction or neglect.       By conserving resources, their continued
      availability for use by present and future generations can be assured.
      Resources include water, energy, minerals, soils, rivers and other
      waterways, wildlife (plants and animals), archaeological sites, and
      historical buildings.
      California Planning Law states that local jurisdictions must have a
      Conservation Element for the conservation, development and utilization of
      natural resources including water, soils, rivers, wildlife, minerals and
      other natural resources (Government Code Section 65302(d)).
2.    Open Space
      In accordance with Government Code Section 65302(e), the Santa Maria
      General Plan must include an Open Space Element. The Open Space Element
      is a plan for the comprehensive and long-range preservation and
      conservation of "open space land" (Government Code Section 65563). "Open
      space land" is any parcel or area of land or water which is essentially
      unimproved and devoted for open space use as specified below:
      1.     Open space for the preservation of natural resources including, but
             not limited to, areas for preservation of plant and animal life,
             areas for ecologic study purposes, rivers, and watershed lands.
      2.     Open space for the managed production of resources, agricultural
             lands, recharge of groundwater basins, and mineral deposits.
      3.     Open space for outdoor recreation includes areas of historic and
             cultural value, park and recreation purposes, utility easements,
             corridors, trails, and pipeline and railroad corridors that serve
             dual purposes.
      4.     Open space for public, health, and safety includes areas for
             special management or regulation because of hazardous conditions
             such as earthquake fault zones, unstable soil areas, flood plains,
             watersheds, fire protection, water reservoirs, and airport clear
             zones.
3.    General Plan Open Space Designations
      There are four open space classifications within the General Plan Land
      Use Element. They are: Conservation Open Space, Agricultural Open Space
      (Prime), Agricultural Open Space (Secondary), and Recreation Open Space.
       The City's Open Space areas are identified on the Land Use Policy Map in
      the Land Use Element.
      The purpose of the Conservation Open Space (COS) classification is to
      preserve certain areas to protect natural resources, to provide scenic
      corridors along railroad rights-of-way and utility easements (e.g.,
      pipelines, drainage basins), and to provide land use buffers to minimize
      or reduce land use conflicts.      Areas designated COS include wildlife
      habitat areas, water resource areas, archaeological sensitive areas,
      urban forest, mineral resource areas, and hazardous open space.              The
      Safety Element identifies hazardous open space areas which includes flood
      zones, airport clear zone, earthquake zones, fire risk areas and unstable
      soils.    For additional discussion on the COS land use classification,
      please refer to the Land Use Element.
                                                                    ADOPTED MAY 7, 1996
                                                    AS AMENDED THROUGH JANUARY 16, 2001
                                      RME-2
      Agricultural   Open   Space    consists    of  two    classifications--Prime
      Agricultural Open Space (AOS-I) and Secondary Agricultural Open Space
      (AOS-II).    AOS-I includes all land classified as prime agricultural
      (Class I and II soils) with intensive agricultural uses (such as crops).
      AOS-II involves land of lesser quality with less intensive agricultural
      uses and grazing. Refer to the Land Use Element for further discussion
      on these land use classifications.
      The purpose of the Recreational Open Space (ROS) land use classification
      is to identify land to be used for future parks, preserve existing park
      and recreation facilities, and reserve open space corridors for
      recreational opportunities. As such, ROS includes existing and proposed
      recreational facilities, including neighborhood, community, and regional
      parks, multi-purpose trails (bicycle and pedestrian), and equestrian
      trails. Additionally, this land use classification is used to preserve
      public utility easements, railroad rights-of-way, drainage basins, and
      other areas that can be developed into recreational facilities without
      compromising the primary purpose of the right-of-way.
B.    FINDINGS AND PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS
Under the provisions of California Planning Law, this Element of the Santa
Maria General Plan provides for the conservation, development, and utilization
of natural resources, and provides for the preservation of archaeological and
cultural resources of historical significance to the City of Santa Maria and
its planning area.     This section discusses the planning considerations and
findings with respect to each resource.
1.    Water Resources
      Water is a limited resource and must be continuously monitored to
      identify changes in supply, demand, and quality.       Water supply changes
      with rainfall, drought, and use. Water demand changes with land use, and
      changes in population.      The quantity and quality of existing water
      resources is a primary concern of the City of Santa Maria.
      The City of Santa Maria and its sphere of influence depend entirely on
      groundwater as the only source of water.       Orcutt Creek and the Santa
      Maria River are the main surface resource areas, but serve only to
      recharge the groundwater basin.
      The water supply of the City has historically been the Santa Maria
      Groundwater Basin. Approximately one million acre feet of usable water
      is available in the Basin. 1 The Santa Maria Groundwater Basin has been
      in an overdraft state for about 70 years. The long-term average recharge
      of the Basin is 76,200 acre feet per year (AFY), and an annual overdraft
      of about 30,000 AFY.
      The City extracts water for municipal uses from the Orcutt Sub-basin of
      the Santa Maria Groundwater Basin (Figure RME-1). Urban and agricultural
      uses pump about 28,240 AFY while the safe yield is 9,670 AFY resulting in
      an overdraft of about 18,570 AFY. 2     The City currently extracts 12,000
      AFY from this sub-basin at a per capita water consumption rate of 0.21
      AFY. The amount of overdraft attributed to the City of Santa Maria is
      approximately 2,016 AFY.       The City's estimated share of the safe
      groundwater extraction yield is 4,270 AFY. 3

        This continuous overdrafting could damage the City's main water supply by
        reducing the total volume of the groundwater basin, and degrading the
        quality of water.    Further, continued overdrafting will cause both the
        Santa Maria Groundwater Basin and Orcutt Sub-basin to become unreliable
        sources of water.     Under these conditions, the existing water sources
        cannot supply the present and future water demands of the City and its
        sphere of influence.
        To improve water resources, the City has taken several actions.           These
        include groundwater recharge programs and the importation of water from
        the State Water Project (State Water).      The City also encourages water
        conservation.
        The City of Santa Maria and the Santa Barbara County Flood Control and
        Water Conservation District and Water Agency (SBCFCD) have instituted
        several programs to improve and increase groundwater recharge to the
        Santa Maria Basin.      The City and SBCFCD jointly developed regional
        recharge basins south of Blosser Road and south of Stowell Road (the
        LaBrea and Kovar Basins).      These basins are designed to retain storm
        water, and to allow that water to percolate into the groundwater basin.
        Groundwater recharge programs currently replenish the Basin by recharging
        more than 20,000 acre-feet of water annually through the Santa Maria
        River, local retardation basins, and regional recharge basins.
        For many years, the City of Santa Maria has been planning to import water
        from the State Water Project. The City has contracted for 16,200 acre-
        feet of water per year. Water from the State Water project is scheduled
        to arrive in 1996.       This new source of water will decrease local
        overdrafting, and improve the City's water quality.
        Water from City wells at the Santa Maria Public Airport contains more
        than 800 parts per million (ppm) total dissolved solids (TDS). Maximum
        federal limits for municipal water TDS is 500 ppm, and the State limit is
        1,000 ppm.     The Background Information Report (Technical Appendix)
        provides   a   more    detailed    discussion  of    water    resources       and
        infrastructure.
        The Land Use Element projects that the City of Santa Maria will have a
        population of about 100,000 people by the year 2010. Implementation of
        groundwater recharge programs, water conservation measures, and the
        importation of State Water will assure a reliable water source that would
        support the existing and future water demands of the City.          Sufficient
        water is available to support a City population of approximately 111,000
                4
        people.
  2.    Air Quality
        Clean air is an important resource to the people of Santa Maria and Santa
        Barbara County.     Good air quality enhances a community's living and
        working environment.     Conversely, poor air quality adversely affects
        public health.     Typical pollutants come from automobiles, solvents,
        industrial processes, fuel combustion, petroleum processes, agriculture,
        and construction activity (dust and particulates).                Agricultural
        pollutants include emissions from heavy equipment, the application of
        pesticides, cattle feed yards, and similar uses.       These air pollutants
        are considered local, and are difficult to quantify.
        Air quality and air emissions are regulated by the United States
        Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the California Air Resources Board
        (CARB) and the Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District
        (APCD). Air quality regulators are governed by the Federal Clean Air Act
        (FCAA) and the California Clean Air Act (CCAA). Santa Maria is located
        within the South Central Coast Air Basin which is administered by the
        Santa Barbara County APCD.

  Although air quality in Northern Santa Barbara County, including Santa
  Maria, has been generally improving during recent years, the EPA has
  designated all of Santa Barbara County as a moderate non-attainment area
  for the federal ozone standard.       The CARB has designated the entire
  county as a moderate non-attainment area for the State ozone standard,
  and fine particulates (particulate matter less than ten microns in
  diameter - PM10).
  Several air quality improvement plans have been adopted for Santa Barbara
  County. These plans include the Air Quality Attainment Plan and the Rate
  of Progress Plan (ROPP). In 1993, the APCD approved the Rate of Progress
  Plan (ROPP) for Santa Barbara County. The ROPP is a report to the CARB,
  as required by the Federal Clean Act Amendments of 1990.         The Rate of
  Progress Plan must demonstrate that the existing and proposed control
  measures will, by 1996, reduce emissions of reactive organic gases (ROG),
  an ozone precursor, to a level 15 percent below 1990 levels. These plans
  primarily address emissions from vehicles, commercial uses, industrial,
  and other urban activities.       In 1994, the APCD Board of Directors
  approved the 1994 Clean Air Plan which implements the 1993 ROPP.
  In Santa Maria, the state standard for ozone was exceeded one time in
  both 1992 and 1993. The federal ozone standard was not exceeded. The
  state standard for PM10 has been exceeded at least one from 1989 through
  1993.
  Cities employ various measures to reduce air pollution. These measures
  range from the application of standard control measures to the promotion
  of alternative forms of transportation (carpools, vanpools, bicycling and
  public transit), and other measures to reduce air pollution at the
  primary source.
  Biomass Pollution Shed Program
  In addition to standard measures, trees can be used to reduce air
  pollution.     Trees absorb and intercept harmful pollutants such as
  particulates and Carbon Dioxide.      And by means of evapotranspiration,
  providing shade, and blocking solar radiation, trees cool the urban air. 5
   This cooling effect lowers air pollutant concentrations which rise when
  temperatures increase.
  An urban forest can be classified as a "Biomass Pollution Shed" (BPS). A
  BPS is defined as an area of sufficient size to uptake or intercept a
  given amount of atmospheric pollutants.     By absorbing and intercepting
  harmful pollutants, trees act as a "biomass pollution shed." While it is
  generally accepted that trees and vegetation help improve air quality, it
  has historically been difficult to quantify the value of vegetation.
  Data from the Chicago Urban Forest Climate Study found that the value of
  vegetation could be quantified.
  Based on these findings of the Chicago Study, the City's Recreation and
  Parks Department (Parks Division) developed a BPS that converts the air
  pollution benefits from the urban forest into an "Emission Reduction
  Credit (ERC). A ERC is defined as an emission reduction of specific type
  and quantity that is registered with the Air Pollution Control District.
   The basic premise of the program is that publicly owned and managed
  vegetation could be used for emission reduction credit (the BPS program
  does not currently recognize private landscaping).
  The Biomass Pollution Program in Santa Maria is in its preliminary
  stages, and will likely take a few more years before it can be
  implemented. The City has presented the BPS concept to the Santa Barbara
  County Air Pollution Control District. APCD has shown little interest in
  the program thus far. To date, State officials have shown no interest in
  the program. Please see the Background Information Report for a complete
  discussion of the BPS concept.

3. Energy Resources
   Energy is an essential resource because it is necessary to operate and
   maintain our way of life. Consequently, people have become dependent on
   the adequacy and reliability of energy sources.
   Santa Maria relies primarily on electricity and natural gas for household
   energy, and petroleum (gasoline and diesel) for most modes of
   transportation.
   As traditional energy sources become more scarce and expensive, the
   continued use of these energy resources raise availability, conservation
   and environmental issues.
   The City of Santa Maria must achieve a balance between growth-induced
   increases in energy demand and availability.        Energy shortages cause
   disruptions in daily life.      In response to these concerns, energy
   conservation has become a prominent local, national and global issue.
   Over the years, many methods of conservation have been applied.          These
   range from increasing the energy efficiency of buildings, appliances, and
   buildings to the use of alternative forms of energy. Efficient use of
   energy reduces energy related costs, improves air quality, and conserves
   valuable resources.
   Measures applied in the City of Santa Maria include energy conserving
   building standards, recycling, and transportation system improvements.
   The City also encourages energy conservation through site and building
   orientation and landscaping. According to the EPA, proper placement of
   trees next to buildings can reduce summer air conditioning costs by as
   much as 15% to 35%.    The City has also instituted an alternative fuel
   vehicle pilot program. Local and state energy efficiency standards have
   contributed in the efforts to conserve energy resources.
   Alternative energy sources (solar and biomass), and uses continue to be
   studied but are not highly utilized.
4. Agricultural Resources
   Agriculture has historically played an important role in the economy and
   development of the City of Santa Maria and the Santa Maria Valley. Soil
   quality, water supply, year-round growing season, and level topography
   have made the Santa Maria Valley one of the most productive agricultural
   regions in the country.     The Valley possesses the soil and climatic
   conditions suitable for vegetable crops (i.e., broccoli, cauliflower and
   lettuce) and field crops (i.e., barley and corn) often yielding three to
   four crops per year. Strawberries are also grown in abundance.
   Agricultural activity in the Santa Maria Valley has progressively
   increased in terms of both acreage counts and crop values.               These
   increases are attributed to "double" and "triple" cropping as well as the
   utilization of marginal lands for labor intensive crops (i.e.,
   strawberries).   The Background Information Report (Technical Appendix)
   more fully discusses agriculture.        Figure RME-2 delineates prime
   agricultural soils and areas under Williamson Act contracts within the
   Planning Area.
   A majority of the land under agricultural production within the Planning

   While some of the recently annexed lands are planned for urban
   development, the City has taken actions to preserve agricultural land and
   to assure continued agricultural production. The Land Use Element shows
   the areas near Main Street, west of the City, and near Stowell Road, east
   of the City, as "Agricultural Land - No Urban Development." The City,
   along with Santa Barbara County and the Local Agency Formation
   Commission, adopted a greenbelt agreement to preserve land used for
   agriculture. The City also recognizes the California Land Conservation
   Act (the Williamson Act Contract Program) as a tool to preserve
   farmlands.    The continued availability of prime agricultural land is
   important to the prosperity of the Santa Maria Area.
5. Soil Resources
   High quality soils area a valuable resource to an area. Soils are rated
   and classified for their qualities which takes into account their
   suitability for agriculture or development, and their erosion potential.
   The Background Information Report (Technical Appendix) provides a
   complete description of the soil types, and their locations throughout
   the City and Planning Area.
   There are two primary soil groupings within the City's planning area
   divided approximately by Betteravia Road.       The southern soil group,
   Betteravia-Garey Association, are soils less suitable for agricultural
   use. The northern group, Sorrento-Mocho-Camarillo Association, are among
   the most productive in the Santa Maria Valley (refer to Figure RME-2).
6. Biological Resources (Vegetation and Wildlife)
   Biological resources include plant and animal species, their habitats,
   and ecosystems.
   Major plant associations in the Northern Santa Barbara County region have
   developed over time in response to influences of a variety of
   environmental factors, including climate and topography.         Major plant
   associations in the Santa Maria Valley include: Chapparal, Coastal scrub,
   Riparian scrub, Oak woodland, Annual grassland (including grazing lands),
   Sandyhill Chaparral and Agricultural.      The only significant wildlife
   habitat areas within the Planning Area are the fields surrounding the
   airport, riparian vegetation within the Santa Maria River and Orcutt
   Creek, and the Vernal Pool complex located southwest of the airport
   (Figure RME-3).
   Sensitive habitats known to occur within the Planning Area include the
   Central Coast Riparian Scrub and the Coastal and Valley Freshwater Marsh.
   The Background Information Report (Technical Appendix) identifies plant
   associations in the region. The variety of vegetation communities in the
   Santa Maria Valley provide for many diverse habitat types which enhance
   the regions biological value.
   The plant communities in the region provide suitable habitat for various
   species of animals, including populations of some wide ranging and mobile
   species of raptorial birds, waterfowl and deer.
   Wildlife corridors are generally defined as connections between habitat
   patches that allow for physical or genetic exchange between isolated
   animal populations. These connections may serve a local purpose, such as
   foraging, and nesting or denning areas, or they may be regional in
   nature.    There is limited information on the actual use of wildlife
   corridors in the region.    However, there is a potential that the Santa
   Maria River, Cuyama River and Sisquoc River are used by wildlife to
   access habitats in the Sierra Madre and San Rafael Mountains. Wildlife
   corridors form a network that is essential to the regional ecology of an
   area.

      Although wildlife are generally renewable resources, the rates of
regeneration are often slow and impeded by disruptive forces such as
urbanization, human harassment, predator control, and pollution. The species
and ecosystems in the region are considered to be of ecological, educational,
historic, scientific, and aesthetic value to the people of the Santa Maria
Valley.
7.    Mineral and Oil Resources
      Within the City's planning area, the primary resources suitable for
      mining and conservation are sand, rock, and oil.
      Minerals
      A mineral is any naturally occurring chemical element or compound, or
      groups of elements and compounds, formed from inorganic processes and
      organic substances, including but not limited to coal, peat, bituminous
      rock, but excluding geothermal resources, natural gas, and petroleum.
      The Santa Maria River channel is considered to be a valuable mineral
      resource.   The River contains the largest resources of Portland Cement
      Concrete-grade aggregate and almost 90 percent of the available alluvial
      sand and gravel resources in the Santa Barbara-San Luis Obispo County
      region. In addition, the State of California classifies portions of the
      Santa Maria River MRZ-2 (Figure RME-4). This classification means that
      there is adequate information to indicate that significant mineral
      deposits are present or where it is judged that a high likelihood for
      their presence exists.
      Mining has occurred along the Santa Maria and Sisquoc Rivers since the
      early 1900s. Presently, there are two companies mining sand and gravel
      from the river channel-Coast Rock Products, Inc. and Southern Pacific
      Milling Company.   In addition, the City is also mining sand from the
      river for use at the City landfill.      Coast Rock and Southern Pacific
      Milling are in the process to expand their commercial mining operations.
      The State Department of Conservation's Division of Mines and Geology
      (DMG) is the principal state agency involved in the administration of
      mining operations.    All surface mining operations in California must
      comply with the State Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975 (SMARA).
      SMARA requires cities and counties containing areas classified as Mineral
      Resource Zone 2 or 3 (MRZ-2 or MRZ-3), Scientific Zone (SZ), or
      designated as mineral deposits of regional or statewide significance to
      include information on mineral deposits and policies in their General
      Plans (Public Resources Code Section 2762 and 2763). SMARA also requires
      cities and counties to regulate specific mining operations by local
      ordinance.
      In accordance with State Law, the Santa Maria General Plan must develop
      policies that recognize, conserve and develop mineral resources; and
      provide for the reclamation of mined lands to prevent or minimize adverse
      impacts on the environment and to protect the public health and safety.
      The City of Santa Maria adopted Ordinance No. 93-23 establishing
      standards for mining and reclamation in compliance with the Surface
      Mining Act and Reclamation Act of 1975 (Chapter 47 of Title 12 of the
      Municipal Code). The Ordinance was revised in March of 1994 (Ordinance
      No. 94-4), and was certified by the State Mining and Geology Board in May
      1994.
      Oil Resources
      Beginning in the early 1900s, the oil industry has played a key role in
      shaping the Santa Maria Valley.       The search for oil led many oil
      prospectors to the Santa Maria-Orcutt Area.      Productive oil operations
      have had a direct effect on the economy of the Valley.
                                                                    ADOPTED MAY 7, 1996

   In order to sustain oil as a valuable resource, several issues must be
   considered in the development of general plan policies.         These issues
   include the preservation and conservation of active oil wells and the
   adverse impacts on the environment, including the safety and security of
   inactive wells and abandoned oil sumps.
   Over the years as the oil became more scarce and the price of oil
   declined, oil drilling and pumping operations were reduced significantly.
   A majority of the active oil drilling and pumping operations occur in the
   unincorporated areas surrounding the City, with only a few active wells
   within City limits. Although oil field production has decreased over the
   last ten years, active wells continue to produce more than one million
   barrels on an annual basis. Based on the current data, oil continues to
   be a valuable natural and economic resource for the Santa Maria Valley.
   As Santa Maria continues to grow, development will most likely occur in
   areas located within the former Santa Maria Oil Field. This oil field is
   the oldest and largest in Santa Barbara County encompassing land from the
   coast (adjacent to the southern boundary of the Guadalupe field) and
   extending inland across the Santa Maria Valley. The Santa Maria Oil Field
   has a high number of abandoned wells (approximately 400) many of which
   have been covered by urban expansion (Figure RME-4).
   A major concern for the City is the improper abandonment of oil wells and
   related oil sumps. Because of the timing of their abandonment, many of
   the inactive oil wells may not meet current State and County Standards
   for abandonment and cleanup. To insure compliance with these standards,
   the City follows Santa Barbara County Petroleum Ordinance No. 2795,
   Regulations for Drilling, Producing, Operating, and Abandoning Petroleum
   Wells.
   The State of California Department of Conservation Division of Oil, Gas,
   and Geothermal Resources (CDOGGR) is the principal state agency involved
   in the administration of onshore oil and gas development.         Pursuant to
   Section 3106 of Public Resources Code (PRC), CDOGGR oversees the
   drilling, operation, maintenance and abandonment of onshore oil and gas
   wells to prevent, as far as possible, damage to life, health, property
   and natural resources.    The City coordinates with the CDOGGR when a
   project involves an oil well and sump. CDOGGR provides information such
   as the location of oil wells and the status of a well (inactive, active,
   or abandoned). In addition, CDOGGR must be present when an oil well is
   abandoned.
   A complete description of safety impacts associated with oil related
   activities can be found in the City's Safety Element of the General Plan.
8. Urban Forest and Landscaping
   An urban forest can be defined as the planted environment within a city.
   It includes both public and private open space areas planted with trees,
   shrubs, lawns and other forms of vegetation.      Street trees, landscaped
   easements and medians, and parks are also part of the urban forest.
   The urban forest is part of what makes a quality living environment.          It
   enhances social, cultural, scenic, and economic dimensions of life.
   The urban forest also has an ecological value.             It modifies the
   environment in a positive manner by providing air filtering, shade, wind
   protection, noise, and soil protection.    Trees are known to absorb and
   intercept harmful pollutants such as Carbon Dioxide (CO2), the gas that
   is largely responsible for the "Greenhouse Effect" causing global
   warming. Well placed trees can prevent heat loss, provide wind breaks,
   and cool the environment by blocking solar radiation. Trees function as
   a buffer to stormwater runoff and reduce soil protection erosion
   problems. Trees also contribute to energy efficiency as discussed in the
   energy section.
                                                                 ADOPTED MAY 7, 1996
                                                 AS AMENDED THROUGH JANUARY 16, 2001
                                  RME-13
    The City of Santa Maria's urban forest is comprised primarily of
    introduced native and drought-tolerant plant materials. The actual tree
    pollution in Santa Maria can be characterized as fairly young when
    compared to most urban areas.     Based on inventory data from 1989, the
    average tree canopy diameter (in Santa Maria) is 14.6+ feet, while the
    average canopy diameter is 24 feet for a tree in a mature urban forest.
    The City's tree population is still growing, and will have a significant
    positive effect on the environment. While Santa Maria's urban forest is
    younger and less complex than other cities, the City has the potential to
    become a major urban forest area.
    To encourage development of the Santa Maria Urban Forest, the City
    adopted an "Urban Forest" component in the General Plan, adopted
    Landscape Standards (Chapter 44 of Title 12) for public and private
    development, and adopted a Street Tree Ordinance. The City also provides
    lists for drought tolerant plants and "non-polluting" trees and plants.
    To insure the future of the Santa Maria urban forest, this document
    proposes general plan policies that address: (1) the preservation of the
    existing plant environment in the community, including landscape
    easements and street medians; (2) improvement of degraded landscape
    areas; (3) expansion of the tree canopy area and other landscaped areas;
    (4) the potential negative impacts (water and energy demands) associated
    with the urban forest, (5) the management and maintenance of landscaped
    areas, and 6) preservation of existing tree windrows throughout the City.
    The Background Information Report (Technical Appendix) provides a full
    discussion of these issues.
9.  Historical and Cultural Resources
    Historical and cultural resources refer to the material and nonmaterial
    expressions of human adaptation which characterizes a historic period.
    These resources include historic events or activity sites, architecture,
    and documents and other sources of historical information.
    In 1955, the Santa Maria Valley Historical Society was established. The
    Historical Society plays a major role in documenting and preserving Santa
    Maria's history.      The Society's activities include gathering and
    preserving materials related to the history of the Santa Maria Valley.
    Historical resources in Santa Maria consist of several landmarks and
    structures. There are 10 structures and landmarks officially designated
    by the City and its landmark committee. Additional sites are designated
    by private organizations.     The City has also established a Historic
    Overlay Zone which allows for the designation of certain structures and
    areas for preservation.
10. Archaeological Resources
    Archaeological resources refer to the material remains (artifacts,
    structures, refuse) produced purposely or accidentally by human beings.
    Archaeological remains identify the type of activities, types of
    adaptation to the environment, and changes in activities and organization
    that were experienced by people in the past. Furthermore, these remains
    often have special significance to ethnic groups, special interest groups
    and the general public.
    The Santa Maria Valley is not considered to be a major archaeological or
    palaeontological resource area as only a few sites have been recorded or
    discovered. Archaeological Sensitivity Areas are defined in Figure RME-
    5.
    State and local procedures require occasional site surveys                   and
    sensitivity measures if or when a archaeological site is suspected.
                                                                  ADOPTED MAY 7, 1996

                    III. RECREATION AND PARKS ELEMENT
A.    INTRODUCTION
Park and recreation facilities and services are vital components of a city's
existence as they directly influence a community's quality of life.                The
development of a comprehensive park and recreation systems involves integrating
public open space, public recreation areas, private recreational installations,
and a wide variety of public, commercial, and industrial support facilities.
The Recreation and Parks Element addresses the existing conditions, and
resources affecting the delivery of park and recreation services, and sets
forth goals, policies, objectives, and programs to guide the planning,
development, and operation of the park and recreation systems serving residents
of the Santa Maria Area.
B.    FINDINGS AND PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS
1.    Public Park and Recreation Facilities
      The City of Santa Maria's recreation system is comprised of several local
      parks and recreational facilities. Figure RME-6 illustrates the City's
      Recreation System.    Facilities in the Orcutt area include four small
      parks and a regional facility (Waller Park). Both the City and County
      have been able to expand their park and recreational inventory through
      joint-use agreements with the school districts. In addition, there are
      several regional parks and recreation sites which include beaches, golf
      courses, and lakes located within 30 miles of the City.
      Over the past five years (1989-1994), the City of Santa Maria has opened
      three new recreation facilities -- Hagerman Softball Center, Robert
      Grogan Park, and Michael Maramonte Park.        The City also encourages
      private land developers to include open space areas, that can be used for
      picnic areas and playground equipment, within development projects.
      In June 1992, the City Council adopted the City of Santa Maria Bikeway
      Plan.   The Plan provides for an extensive network of bike lanes and
      multiple use (bicycle and pedestrian) trails throughout the City.            The
      primary multi-purpose trails are the Santa Maria/Guadalupe Dunes Bikeway,
      the Santa Maria Valley Railroad Trail (north-south), and the Battles Road
      (east-west) Bikeway (within the Unocal Oil Pipeline right-of-way). These
      trails along with the other planned bike facilities will increase
      recreational opportunities for the residents of Santa Maria.
      One of the City's primary concerns is providing sufficient facilities to
      meet the recreational demands of the community.      The City uses several
      standards to determine if there are adequate parks and recreation
      facilities to serve the City's residents.     These standards are usually
      based on the City's population, and the type of facility. According to
      the Background Information Report (Technical Appendix), there is a need
      for additional recreation facilities to support the City's existing and
      projected population. These major facilities include an aquatic center,
      a gymnasium in the northern portion of the City, several public
      racquetball and tennis courts, and soccer fields.
2.    Recreational Activities
      Recreation activities and programs are the other key component in
      producing an effective      recreational system.     As such, it is very
      important that a recreation system offer a wide range of recreational
      activities for all citizens.
      The Recreation and Parks Department (Recreation Division) provides a
      broad scope of programs and services to the community. Activities range
      from arts and crafts to softball. These activities are available for all
      ages.    Santa Maria also provides Orcutt residents with organized
      recreational activities through the City's Recreation and Parks

3.     Level of Service Standards
The number of park and recreational facilities needed are determined by
level of service standards. The City uses the standards listed in Table
RME-1.
A second standard in determining necessary          parks   is    the   City's
Subdivision Ordinance standard, as stated below:
"The dedication of land, or the payment of fees, or both, shall not
exceed the proportionate amount necessary to provide three (3) acres of
park area per one thousand (1,000) persons residing within a subdivision,
unless the amount of existing neighborhood and community park area, as
calculated pursuant to this Section, exceeds that limit, in which case
the City Council may adopt the calculated amount as a higher standard not
to exceed five (5) acres per one thousand (1,000) persons residing within
a subdivision." (Section 11-09.05(d))
The subdivision standard is used for new residential subdivisions and
based on the projected population of the project. The level of service
standard of one neighborhood park (4 to 6 acres in size) per 5,000
residents is a citywide standard or citywide goal.          The subdivision
requirement assists the city in meeting this goal.
Table RME-2 displays current and future recreational facility demands for
Santa Maria. They are based on the facility standards contained in Table
RME-1.    The figure of 69,000 is the estimated 1995 population.             The
100,000 figure is an arbitrary population and used as an example.
Park Acreage
The level of service standard, or Subdivision Ordinance standard, of
three to five acres per 1,000 residents would currently require 207 to
345 acres for the City's 1995 population of 69,000.         When the City's
population reaches 100,000 people, 300 to 500 acres of parkland would be
required to meet the standard.       The City's current acreage count of
154.70 would not meet current requirements.       At least 145 additional
acres would be needed to meet the minimal standards when the population
reaches 100,000.
The Sphere of Influence Specific Plans, the Santa Maria Airport Research
Park Specific Plan, and the Rivergate-Roemer Specific Plan propose a
total of 515 additional Recreational Open Space (ROS) acres.          If this
acreage is utilized for parks, combined with the existing 154.70 acres,
the total acreage of 669.70 would support 223,233 residents at minimal
standards (3 acres/1,000) and 133,940 residents at maximum standards (5
acres/1,000).

             IV.    PUBLIC FACILITIES AND SERVICES ELEMENT
A.    INTRODUCTION
Growth in Santa Maria will not only depend on environmental factors but also on
the availability of public facilities and services. As growth occurs, city
facilities and infrastructure reach a point where major expansion is necessary.
These public facilities include, but are not limited to, water transmission
mains, water reservoirs, drainage facilities, trunk sewer mains, the wastewater
treatment plant, and solid waste collection and treatment. In addition, there
would be an increase in the demand for municipal services such as police and
fire protection and libraries. If adequate public facilities and services are
not planned and constructed, the residents of Santa Maria will experience
reduced levels of service.
In 1992, the Community Development Department prepared a Growth Mitigation/
Management Report that looked at the potential impacts of growth on City
services and infrastructure.       The report also presented growth management
options (see Section VI - Growth Management, Goal 13). A biennial update to
the report was prepared in January 1996.
This section discusses the services available to the City and its residents.
Discussed are fire services, police protection, libraries, water services,
drainage, wastewater, and solid waste.
B.    FINDINGS AND PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS
1.    Fire Protection
      The City and its planning area is served by six fire stations--three City
      stations, two county stations, and the Orcutt Volunteer station. Primary
      service areas for the City and County are depicted in Figure RME-7.
      The City of Santa Maria also participates in mutual and automatic aid
      programs.    Mutual aid is requested by neighboring fire departments for
      immediate assistance.     Automatic aid is a program where the City Fire
      Department will respond to another jurisdiction, based on proximity to
      the emergency, as identified by the dispatcher. The City's automatic aid
      boundaries are Bonita School Road to the west, the Santa Maria Way area
      to the south, and Tefft Street in Nipomo to the north.            The eastern
      boundary is 29 miles to the east of Santa Maria.
      In addition to the actual firefighting, the City Fire Department spends a
      great deal of time on preventive measures and preparation for combating
      fires.     Fire prevention consists of making routine inspections of
      buildings, schools, and homes, making recommendations for fire safety,
      and enforcing the Uniform Fire Code (UFC).
      Paramedic services for the City are provided by American Medical Response
      (AMR), a private company. AMR provides two ambulances which provide 24-
      hour service, and one ambulance which provides 12-hour service.
      According to the City of Santa Maria Fire Department, the City of Santa
      Maria Fire Department serves a population of 69,000 persons with 29
      firefighting employees and 30 reserve personnel.              Based on the
      departmental standard of one full time fire employee per 1,820 persons
      and one reserve firefighter per 1,500 persons, a total of 38 full time
      fire employees and 46 reserve firefighters would be necessary to provide
      adequate fire protection services. Thus, the existing staff of 29 fire-
      fighters is short of meeting the department's staffing goals. There is
      also a need for additional fire facilities to serve developing areas of
      the City, and its sphere of influence (including recently annexed areas).
                                                                     ADOPTED MAY 7, 1996

2. Police Protection
   The City of Santa Maria Police Department provides law enforcement
   services for the City. Orcutt and the other unincorporated areas of the
   County are served by the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Department. The
   California Highway Patrol patrols State highways.
   The City Police Department provides three basic type of services: field
   services including patrolling and investigation, staff services including
   training, and auxiliary services including record keeping. The City is
   patrolled on a 24-hour basis.
   The City Police Department has a staff of 77 sworn officers and 25
   civilian full-time employees (a total of 102 employees).        Based on the
   departmental standard of 1.3 sworn employees per 1,000 residents, the
   existing police personnel is not adequately staffed to serve the City of
   Santa Maria with a current population of 69,000.         The City has also
   received funding for the hiring of additional officers. Based upon a
   projected City population of 100,000 people, the Santa Maria Police
   Department would need to employ 130 sworn officers to provide adequate
   police protection.
3. Library Services
   There are four libraries associated with the Santa Maria Public Library
   System.   The main library is located in the City of Santa Maria with
   branch libraries located in Orcutt, Cuyama and the City of Guadalupe.
   The Santa Maria cooperative library system has approximately 154,000
   volumes available for public use and reference. Specifically, the Santa
   Maria Library has approximately 116,000 volumes, the Orcutt branch has
   23,440 volumes, the Guadalupe branch has 7,600 volumes, and the Cuyama
   branch has 6,500 volumes.
   To determine the adequacy of the public library, the City uses the
   standard planning ratio of 0.5 square feet of library space per capita.
   Another measure of library service is volumes per capita (1.5 to 2.0
   books per capita). Based on these standards, it was determined that the
   main library facility does not meet the library space standard and
   requires expansion to accommodate the existing and projected populations.
   It was, however, determined that the Santa Maria Library does meet the
   volumes per capita standard.
4. Water Facilities and Services
   Water Supply (Production and Storage)
   The City of Santa Maria and the California-Cities Water Company (Cal-
   Cities) provide water services to the City and Planning Area. The City
   of Santa Maria operates its own municipal water system. Water production
   facilities consist of eight active production wells and three inactive
   wells.     The active wells have a combined pumping capacity of
   approximately 14,000 gallons per minute (GPM).            The City's water
   production in Fiscal Year 1993-1994 was 12,124 AFY.               Four water
   reservoirs in the City provide a water storage capacity of 15.5 million
   gallons.
   Cal-Cities water production was 7,662 AFY in 1993. Cal-Cities Water uses
   15 wells and has a 3.24 million gallon storage capacity.
   To meet future demands, the City plans to add three new wells and a new
   storage reservoir. The City has also contracted for delivery of 16,200
   AFY of water from the State Water project.           Delivery of water is
   scheduled to start in late 1996.      Cal-Cities is designing new water
   storage reservoir and had contracted for 500 AFY of State Water.
                                                                 ADOPTED MAY 7, 1996
                                                 AS AMENDED THROUGH JANUARY 16, 2001
                                  RME-43
   Water treatment in Santa Maria is minimal as groundwater pumped from
   wells is only disinfected. However, if overdrafting of the groundwater
   basin continues, additional treatment may be necessary due to increased
   total dissolved solids (TDS) levels in the water.         State Water will,
   however, receive chlorine and ammonia treatment.
   Water Distribution
   The City's water distribution system consists of approximately 244 miles
   of water line.   There are about 30 miles of transmission lines in the
   City, which range from 10 to 30 inches in diameter.           The system is
   designed to deliver water from the production point (Airport Well Field)
   to the storage units and to various points in the distribution system.
   Figure RME-8 depicts the City's water transmission system.
   In 1993, the Public Works Department began preparing a Water, Wastewater
   and Drainage (WWD) study for the City of Santa Maria.             This study
   projects demand on water distribution system, and identifies inadequacies
   in the system based on the anticipated growth in the General Plan.
   According to the WWD study, the current water distribution system is
   adequate for the existing City development. However, additional storage
   and distribution facilities will be required to accommodate planned
   development within the City's sphere of influence.              The planned
   improvements are shown on Figure RME-8.
   The delivery of State Water in 1996 will require the construction of a
   water treatment facility as well as distribution lines which are
   currently under construction.
5. Drainage Facilities
   Drainage facilities for the city consist of storm drains, storm drainage
   channels, and storm water retardation and detention basins. Many of the
   facilities interface with Santa Barbara County Flood Control and Water
   Conservation District maintained channels. The standard design criteria
   for storm drainage systems within the County are 25-year capacity for
   storm drain pipes and culverts and 100-year capacity for major channels.
   Major storm drains have been assumed to be pipes 36 inches in diameter
   and greater. Major basins have been assumed to be those 50 acre-feet and
   larger.
   The drainage information is summarized from the 1995 Drainage Report
   prepared by Penfield and Smith.
   Regional Hydrology
   The Santa Maria/Orcutt area is drained by four major watershed areas:
   Bradley/Blosser; West Main; Green Canyon; and Betteravia. Due to concern
   for the flooding of downstream agricultural lands and efforts to increase
   groundwater recharge, detention/recharge basins have been constructed,
   when possible, to capture storm water runoff from the watersheds.
   Storm Drainage Systems
   Roughly 5.3 miles of storm drain collector lines exist in the City.
   These lines range in size from 36 inches to 72 inches in diameter.              A
   number of smaller storm drain lines also exist and are not included in
   the 5.3 mile total.     Figure RME-9 shows the existing storm drainage
   system.
                                                                 ADOPTED MAY 7, 1996

   Major Drainage Channels
   Approximately 6.4 miles of major storm drainage channels exist within the
   City. Each of these extends westerly from the City Limits to discharge
   into either the Santa Maria River or a tributary of the Santa Maria
   River.   Typically, the channels are under the exclusive maintenance of
   the SBCFCWCD or shared maintenance between the City and SBCFCWCD.            The
   locations of major drainage channels are shown on Figure RME-9.
   Major Detention Basins
   Detention basins serving the City provide various beneficial functions.
   These include the reduction of peak storm flowrates, recharge of
   groundwater basins, and the reduction of stormwater pollutants.            Five
   major or regional detention basins receive storm waters from the Planning
   Area. The locations of major Detention Basins are shown on Figure RME-9.
   Minor Retardation Basins
   Smaller retardation basins are utilized throughout the City to retard the
   flow from storm events discharging to drainage facilities. This delay in
   flow allows a longer period of time for storm water to recharge into the
   groundwater basins. Figure RME-9 maps major City retardation basins.
   Planned Improvements
   In order to bring the City up to the current standard of 25-year capacity
   in the storm drain system and 100-year capacity in open channels, the
   improvements shown in Figure RME-9 are required.
6. Wastewater Facilities
   The City of Santa Maria operates its own wastewater collection and
   treatment system.    The City's wastewater collection system consists of
   eight wastewater basins with associated trunk sewers and one treatment
   plant. The basins generally drain east to west to trunk line facilities
   that run to the treatment plant.     There are some portions of the City
   that are serviced by the Laguna County Sanitation District (LCSD), which
   primarily serves the Orcutt area. The City also serves a portion of
   Orcutt. The existing and proposed wastewater collection system is shown
   in Figure RME-10.
   The Santa Maria Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) is located on Black
   Road, approximately 2.5 miles east of the City. The Treatment Plant has
   an existing capacity of 7.8 million gallons per day (mgd).         The Fiscal
   Year 1993-1994 average daily flow was 6.4 mgd, or 82 percent capacity.
   The plant is planned to be expanded to 10 mgd by 1996.               The LCSD
   treatment plant has a 3.2 mgd capacity with a 1991 average daily flow of
   2.2 mgd.    With the planned improvements, the Santa Maria Wastewater
   Treatment Plant will have the capacity to support existing and future
   growth in the City. Capacity of the City's wastewater treatment facility
   was also examined in the 1993 Water, Wastewater and Drainage Study.
   Another area of concern with wastewater collection and treatment is the
   type and concentration of chemicals discharged from a wastewater
   treatment plant.    The State Water Quality Control Board (SWQCB) has
   established limits on the concentrations of solids, sodium and chlorides
   that can be allowed to percolate into the soil. These limits vary with
   the nature of the existing soils and groundwater. The City's wastewater
   treatment plant currently meets discharge requirements for total
   dissolved solids and sodium. The City is also closer to meeting limits
   for chloride.    The Background Information Report (Technical Appendix)
   provides a more detailed discussion of wastewater threshold limits.
                                                                 ADOPTED MAY 7, 1996

7. Solid Waste Facilities and Services
   The Santa Maria Landfill is owned and operated by the City of Santa
   Maria. It serves the solid waste disposal needs of the Cities of Santa
   Maria and Guadalupe, and the surrounding unincorporated portions of Santa
   Barbara County (Orcutt, Sisquoc, Gary, Los Alamos, and Casmalia).
   Operated as a Class III solid waste disposal site, the Santa Maria
   Landfill accepts nonhazardous solid and inert wastes from residential,
   commercial, industrial, and agricultural uses in the planning area.
   Hazardous materials accepted are limited to household hazardous waste.
   Hazardous and designated waste must be disposed of outside of Santa
   Barbara County. Waste management programs conducted at the Santa Maria
   Landfill include the collection of recyclable materials, wood and yard
   waste grinding, non-friable asbestos disposal, and the operation of the
   household hazardous waste facility (opened in 1992).       The City is also
   currently considering locating a transfer station at the landfill.
   The Santa Maria Landfill consists of 290 acres which includes a 68-acre
   inactive area, a 134-acre active area, and an 88-acre future disposal
   area.   According to the City of Santa Maria Resource Availability and
   Limitations Report - July 1991 (RALR), the active landfill area has a
   disposal volume (capacity) of approximately 6.0 million cubic yards. The
   future area will have a capacity of about 7.9 cubic yards for an overall
   total capacity of about 13.9 million cubic yards.
   The landfill currently receives approximately 390 tons of waste per day.
   Solid waste projections have the wastestream increasing up to 740 tons
   per day (including recycling) by the year 2017. In order to accommodate
   the projected wastestream, the City's Site Facility permit will be
   amended to accept up to 740 tons of solid waste per day. Based on the
   landfill's estimated capacity and the solid waste projections, the Santa
   Maria Landfill could accommodate waste disposal area in 2018. Closure of
   the landfill disposal area will be accomplished in compliance with
   federal and state regulations.
   Landfill operations are governed by the Waste Discharge Requirements (WDR
   numbers 90-038 and 93-084) for Class III landfills as per the Regional
   Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB), Santa Barbara County Environmental
   Health Services, and the California Integrated Waste Management Board
   (CIWMB).   The City must comply with the California Integrated Waste
   Management Act of 1989, Assembly Bill 939 and Senate Bill 1322 (Chapters
   1095 and 1096, Statutes of 1989) which requires all cities and counties
   to reduce their solid waste stream 25% by January 1, 1995, and 50% by
   January 1, 2000.
   To comply with these solid waste diversion mandates, the City adopted a
   Source Reduction and Recycling Element (SRRE). The SRRE identifies how
   the City can meet the state mandated diversion requirements through
   curbside recycling, composting, and other waste reduction programs.
   Additionally, the enactment of Assembly Bill 2707 requires local
   jurisdictions to prepare, adopt, and submit a Household Hazardous Waste
   Element to the California Integrated Waste Management Board. The City of
   Santa Maria adopted the Countywide Household Hazardous Waste Element
   (HHWE) prepared for Santa Barbara County. The HHWE identifies programs
   to divert hazardous materials from landfills, safe collection programs,
   and educational programs.
   Implementation of solid waste management and reduction programs will
   insure that the City's existing and future solid waste demands are met
   until 2017. The Solid Waste Section of the Background Information Report
   (Technical Appendix) discusses landfill capacity and operation.
                                                                 ADOPTED MAY 7, 1996
                                                 AS AMENDED THROUGH JANUARY 16, 2001

                         V.  PRIVATE COMMUNITY SERVICES
A.    INTRODUCTION
The intent of this chapter of the Resources Management Element is to recognize
health care and education services as important resources in the development of
the community.   This chapter briefly discusses the education and health care
facilities serving the Santa Maria/Orcutt area.
It should be noted that education and health care facilities and services are
not directly provided by the City of Santa Maria, and are not defined as
municipal services (please see Section IV - Public Facilities and Services
Element).   Additionally, the City's role and responsibility in the direct
provision of these services are limited.     However, it is recognized that in
order to grow properly, adequate school sites must be planned for to allow the
school district(s) to build needed schools.
In accordance with Section 65300 et seq. of the Government Code, the General
Plan Land Use Element (LUE) contains discussion on the general location and
distribution of educational facilities. The LUE insures that adequate land is
reserved for schools to support future growth. This chapter of the RME serves
to reinforce the goals, policies, objectives, and implementation programs
identified in the Land Use Element.
B.    FINDINGS AND PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS
1.    School Facilities
      The Santa Maria/Orcutt Area is served by various public and private
      schools. Figure RME-11 shows the existing and proposed location of
      schools.
      Public Schools
      There are three public school districts and one community college serving
      the educational needs of the City of Santa Maria and surrounding
      unincorporated areas. These school districts are: the Santa Maria-Bonita
      School District (SMBSD), the Orcutt Union School District (OUSD), and the
      Santa Maria Joint Union High School District (SMJUHSD).        Allan Hancock
      College (AHC) provides college opportunities to the area's residents.
      The SMBSD operates 14 elementary and junior high schools in the City of
      Santa Maria.    The OUSD operates six elementary schools and two junior
      high schools in the Orcutt area.
      The SMJUHSD operates three public schools--Santa Maria High            School,
      Ernest Righetti High School and Delta Continuation High School.
      Allan Hancock College operates three campuses. The main college campus
      is located at 800 South College Drive, Santa Maria.          Two additional
      campuses are located in the City of Lompoc and Vandenberg Air Force Base.
      Private Schools
      The Santa Maria Valley has several private schools (including church
      operated). The largest are Valley Christian Academy, Saint Joseph High
      School, Saint Louis De Montfort, and Saint Mary of Assumption.
2.    Health Facilities
      The residents of the City of Santa Maria are served by Marian Medical
      Center, Valley Community Hospital, the County health care clinic, and
      dozens of private medical practices.
      These health care facilities provide area residents with a variety of
      emergency, inpatient, and outpatient health care services.           Hospital
      facilities adequately meet level of service standards and will meet these
      standards in the future.    Please see the Background Information Report
      (Technical Appendix) for more discussion on health facilities.
                                                                    ADOPTED MAY 7, 1996

                             VI.  GROWTH MANAGEMENT
A.    INTRODUCTION
Growth management can provide a community a steady growth rate to promote a
consistent and healthy local economy, rather than leaving the community
vulnerable to extreme boom and bust rates. In 1992, the Community Development
Department prepared the Santa Maria Growth Mitigation/Management Report to
address concerns with the growth of Santa Maria.       The report addresses the
potential impacts of growth on City infrastructure and services to the
community, and discusses growth management options. The report was updated in
January 1996.
B.    FINDINGS AND PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS
Based on the Growth Mitigation/Management Report (August 1992), the City
Council amended the Environment Resources Management Element to include a
growth management goal, policy, and implementation program which requires that
a status report of City resources and infrastructure capacity be prepared
biennially and presented to the City Council.     In addition, the City Council
adopted AB1600 Growth Mitigation fees to build City capital projects and
facilities. For a more detailed discussion on growth management, refer to the
Growth Mitigation/Management Report (August 1992), as amended in January 1996.
C.    GOALS, POLICIES, OBJECTIVES AND PROGRAMS
GOAL 13 - GROWTH MANAGEMENT
Provide sufficient resources and infrastructure to support existing population
and planned growth.
POLICY 13
Ensure that the capacity of resources and infrastructure are not overburdened
by growth.
Objective 13.1.a - Resource and Infrastructure Capacities
Establish and maintain resource and infrastructure standards and capacities
that are reviewed and updated biennially.
Objective 13.1.b - Sustainable Population
Establish the City's sustainable population and adjust resources                   and
infrastructure as the capacity changes based on the biennial report.
Implementation Programs
1.    Prepare a biennial report to City Council by January 1, 1998, on the
      status of resource and infrastructure capacity. The report shall examine
      water resources, wastewater collection and treatment, recreation, parks,
      landfill, and other city services.
      The report should show historical consumption,          existing    capacity,
      projected demand, and planned and funded expansion.
2.    Update report every 2 years after January 1, 1998.
Accomplishments to Date:
1.    In July 1991, the Public Works Department (Engineering Division) prepared
      the Resource Availability and Limitations Report for the City of Santa
      Maria.
                                                                    ADOPTED MAY 7, 1996
                                                    AS AMENDED THROUGH JANUARY 16, 2001
                                     RME-58
2.    In August 1992, the Community Development Department prepared the Growth
      Mitigation/Management Report (August 4, 1992) for a joint meeting between
      the City Council and Planning Commission.
3.    In November 1993, the City Council amended the Environmental Resources
      Management Element to include a growth management goal, policy, and
      implementation program.
4.    In January 1996, the City Council received and reviewed the biennial
      growth management report update.
Anticipated Results:
1.    A sustainable population of approximately 111,000 based on the
      availability of resources, the capacity of public infrastructure, and
      adequate level of public services.

 Proposed Amendments: (additions shaded and deletions are strikeouts)
 LAND USE ELEMENT
 C. Goal L.U. 3. -- URBAN DESIGN
 The City will promote quality urban design enhancing Santa Maria's character.
 POLICY L.U. 3 -- Rehabilitation of older structures and new development.
 Emphasize quality urban design features in rehabilitation and new development efforts
 (similar policies are in the Resources Management Element (RME).
        OBJECTIVE L.U. 3 a
                 Update and expand the Entrada Specific Plan to identify areas which can
                 benefit from a design theme and establish urban design standards for
                selected areas of the City.
                Add:        Amend the adopted Entrada Specific Plan to include provisions
                to encourage implementation of the City of Santa Maria's architecture
                                                                                              I
                tower program for commercial, industrial and residential projects adjacent
                to City entrances and located on major transportation corridors to include
                architecturally designed tower elements in the design of new buildings and
                additions to existing buildings.     Landscape medians should include
                 kiosk/tower block markers as special design/entry features.
        OBJECTIVE L.U.3 b
                Continue ongoing code enforcement efforts to ensure that property is
                safely maintained and attractive.
        OBJECTIVE L.U.3 c
                Deteriorating neighborhoods shall be identified and targeted for increased
                police patrols, public improvements (drainage, street lighting, traffic and
                road, parks, landscaping, etc.), zoning enforcement, and rezoning to
                encourage private sector redevelopment.
ANTICIPATED RESULT: The architecturally designed towers are intended to create a
focal point and help establish an identity for a given area or neighborhood. This
program will assist in instilling "pride of ownership" for persons working or residing in a
given area or neighborhood.

                   Core Policies
Goal: To create more jobs and create jobs that pay higher salaries
 or compensation, thereby raising the standard of living for the
                     citizens of Santa Maria.
                                                                   1
Core Policies
1. Effectively target the recruitment of commercial, industrial, and retail enterprises that
   best fit Santa Maria’s market and infrastructure. Continue to identify target industries.
2. Utilize a sophisticated and effective Strategic Workforce Action Team (SWAT) that best
   responds to commercial/industrial (job producing) prospect contacts, resulting in ultimate
   job creation.
3. Provide a cost-effective, operational Geographic Information System (GIS) with the
   ability to have integrated layered information, easily updated, in operation after
   occupancy of the new library.
4. Provide sufficient commercial/industrial sites that meet the size and location needs of
   prospects. To that end, unless the subject property clearly cannot be used for industrial
   purposes, suppress the rezoning of any sites from existing industrial zoning unless an
   equal or greater amount of land is zoned to an industrial classification prior to or during
   the zoning process.
   The above policy shall be applied on a case-by-case basis and shall consider some or
   all of the following factors:
            a)     The amount of industrially-zoned land (in acres) currently available at the
                   time of the rezoning request that is readily available for construction.
            b)     The land feasibility of the site for industrial development (due to such
                   factors as the size and configuration of the parcel or remaining site area).
            c)     Any county property approved by LAFCO for annexation which is
                   prezoned to industrial and feasible for development.
            d)     A Santa Maria Multiplier Impact rating at or above 2.11 and/or within one-
                   half point of the average of all industries within the California RIMS II jobs
                   multiplier.
            e)     Additional factors may be considered as appropriate for the site being
                   considered.
5. Create and utilize ordinance amendments to address problems that thwart business
   creativity.
6. Streamline development processes using proven methods, such as concurrent permit
   processing or Performance Evaluation Review Technology (PERT).
                                                                                                  2

7.      Turn the current state budget crisis and negative impact to businesses into a positive
        situation by contacting businesses threatening to leave the Tri-County regions by
        emphasizing the many assets common to Santa Maria including the relatively low cost of
        doing business.
8.      Adopt and implement an industrial preservation zone to protect scarce industrially-zoned
        properties to facilitate long-term job growth.
Note: Items 1, 2 and 7 are the primary responsibility of the Chamber of Commerce. Items 3, 4,
5, 6 and 8 are the primary responsibility of the City of Santa Maria.
                                                                                                 3

Introduction
Rationale
E    conomic Development means many things to many people. Historically, it meant only
     “industrial recruitment.” But, economic development is a process, not an event. It is where
public policy and free enterprise intersect. Economic Development is a program, a group of
policies, and/or an activity that seeks to improve the economic well-being and quality of life for a
community. Ideally, it will create and retain jobs and provide a stable tax base. It’s about
building better communities through three activities:
                    ♦ Attracting business
                    ♦ Expansion and retention of existing businesses
                    ♦ Creation of new businesses1
Economic development is the “process of creating wealth through the mobilization of human,
financial, capital, physical and natural resources to generate marketable goods and services.” In
order to optimize Santa Maria’s chances of “landing” job-generating businesses, it is important
to position Santa Maria in the most advantageous way; providing accurate, useful information as
quickly as possible, targeting businesses that best fit Santa Maria, making Santa Maria as
entrepreneurial and receptive to prospective business as possible, creating and having suitable
sites available and matching those sites with business prospects.
Santa Maria does not have a one-source document that spells out Santa Maria’s economic
development policies in a consistent, non-conflicting manner. This Economic Development
Element is intended to fulfill that purpose.
History / Community Profile
S     anta Maria, with a population of 88,793 (1/1/2005 State of California Department of
      Finance (DOF) estimate), sits at the northern end of the Santa Maria Valley, immediately
south of the Santa Barbara-San Luis Obispo County line and the Santa Maria River.
Historically, the river flooded the valley floor, depositing rich alluvial soils and making the valley
one of the most productive agricultural areas in the state. In 1882 the San Luis Obispo and
Santa Maria Valley Railroad reached the Santa Maria Valley. Four early settlers – Cook,
Thornburg, Miller and Fesler – each donated a quarter section of land, cornering on Main and
Broadway streets, to form a city. The city name was changed from Grangerville to Central City
and then to Santa Maria in 1882; the city incorporated as Santa Maria in 1905. The Main Street
and Broadway intersection is the center of Santa Maria. The aforementioned four-square miles
are now bounded by Donovan on the North, Highway 101 on the East, Stowell on the South and
Blosser on the West.

  CALED Bulletin, August 2003
                                                                                                       5

Since 1957, the local economy has been greatly influenced by the cycle of government
spending on programs at Vandenberg Air Force Base (previously Camp Cook), located 15 miles
southwest of Santa Maria. Throughout most of the 1960’s, program growth on Vandenberg Air
Force Base helped to account for significant economic growth in Santa Maria. The oil industry
also played a very significant economic role in the Santa Maria Valley from the early 1900’s to
the 1980’s. Oil remains an important employer in the Valley but not as significantly as it once
was.
In the 1970's, the City Council embarked on a redevelopment project to stabilize the local retail
employment picture and increase local government revenues. The Santa Maria Town Center
added over 400,000 square feet of shopping area within an enclosed shopping mall
environment. Subsequently, the City Council has acted aggressively to preserve Santa Maria's
position as a regional retail destination. Retail spending has increased sharply in the past two
years with Santa Maria leading all of Santa Barbara County in retail sales growth.
In the early 1980’s, the local economy experienced significant growth due to programs on
Vandenberg Air Force Base. After 1987, many jobs related to defense contracts were lost when
the Space Shuttle program ended, as a consequence of the Challenger disaster. Program
losses at Vandenberg carried into the early 1990’s. The base’s programs have since stabilized,
providing an economic benefit to the region.
Agriculture and agriculturally related businesses remain one of the region’s economic engines.
Primary crops are strawberries, wine grapes, celery, lettuce, peas, squash, cauliflower, spinach,
broccoli, and beans. These labor-intensive crops have historically attracted seasonal farm
workers and their families to the Santa Maria Valley.
Over the past four decades, Santa Maria has actively sought industrial growth and employment
to balance lower-paying agricultural and retail sector jobs.
                                                                                                  6

In 1995, the Santa Maria Airport District received approval for a Specific plan that consisted of a
golf course and over 3 million square feet of office industrial building space. In 2006, this plan
will be revisited to address environmental issues. Development of the site could commence
soon after the plan adoption to provide many opportunities for economic growth in the future.
The jobs / housing balance has been cyclical, experiencing either boom or bust. Yet, Santa
Maria remains vigilant in its efforts to ensure the economic success of its businesses.
Community Assets
S     anta Maria has an abundance of interrelated entities working in concert to further economic
      development efforts. The Santa Maria Valley Chamber of Commerce and Visitor and
Convention Bureau is a nonprofit organization of approximately 1000 members that works to
build a healthy, robust economy in the Santa Maria Valley. Established a century ago the
Chamber is one of the most prestigious business organizations on the central coast. Its mission
is to promote a favorable economic climate while making the region a better place to live and
work. By offering a myriad of programs and services including, but not limited to, business-to-
business referrals, advertising grants, networking opportunities, community events, government
advocacy and operation of the visitor and convention bureau, the Chamber remains an active
economic development partner.
                                                                                                    7
I n 1998, the Santa Maria Public Airport District received a Foreign Trade Zone (FTZ)
  designation. The entire Santa Maria Public Airport District – more than 2500 acres – lies
within a FTZ. A FTZ offers an opportunity for the manufacture, assembly and importation /
exportation of products, while deferring, reducing, or potentially eliminating custom duties.
SMPAD endeavors to activate the FTZ proved challenging over the ensuing years. In 2004,
SMPAD expanded its efforts, seeking a customs inspection facility to operate in concert with its
FTZ. SMPAD will have a User Fee Customs Program in place by the spring of 2006. This Agent
will serve as the FTZ coordinator and oversee the activities of the FTZ warehouse. SMPAD has
received general approval of its FTZ secured warehouse area. FTZ and customs status will
afford SMPAD and the Santa Maria Valley numerous economic development opportunities.
Allan Hancock Community College (AHC) is responsive to the workforce development needs of
local employers. AHC identifies the training needs of business, industry and local government
agencies and then facilitates the development of programs and classes to meet the identified
needs.
The City operates a Façade Rebate and Loan Program designed to assist property owners and
tenants of commercial buildings on West Main Street and North Broadway. Businesses are
eligible to apply for assistance to upgrade and renovate the exteriors of their buildings. The
program is available to neighborhood businesses that serve low- and moderate-income
persons.
The City operates a Community Development Block Grant Economic Development Program
Revolving Loan Fund (RLF) to help create employment opportunities for low-income residents.
New businesses looking to relocate in Santa Maria and those that are considering expanding
their operations are being targeted. The RLF may be used by businesses that may not qualify
for funding from conventional sources.
The Community Development Department initiated relaxed regulations concerning building
additions and intensification of commercial uses in the original four-square mile area from the
                                                                                                 8

Main and Broadway intersection. Historically, commercial buildings on Main and Broadway were
built on smaller lots many years ago. In most cases, zoning regulations that would have
required building setbacks, landscaping, and off-street parking did not exist. The Four-Square
Mile Ordinance allows buildings to be expanded provided the expansion area does not exceed
50% of the existing floor area and the area of expansion does not remove existing parking or
expand into an area where off-street parking could be provided. The ordinance applies to
buildings on lots of 15,000 square feet or less and requires that minor improvements such as:
planter areas, window boxes, awnings, security lighting, painting of buildings and/or outside
benches and tables be included as part of the expansion projects. Assembly Bill 1600 Mitigation
Fees for commercial projects within the four-square mile area have been eliminated.
The Santa Maria Public Airport District (SMPAD) is embarking on developing 740 acres
incorporating an industrial park, golf course and retail commercial property. This major
undertaking is viewed, from the community perspective, as the economic generator for the
continued growth of the Santa Maria Valley. It is expected that research and light industrial
businesses at the Santa Maria industrial park will create 6,400 jobs. The businesses that will be
attracted to the Santa Maria Research Park will include light manufacturing firms, technology
companies, back office operations and headquarters for small corporations. Light manufacturing
firms which compliment the existing agriculture industry include machines and equipment,
electronic equipment, plastic products, communications equipment and other miscellaneous
goods production. Technology firms will locate at the Santa Maria Airport Industrial Park in order
to attract graduates from the two premier universities in the region – California Polytechnic
University, San Luis Obispo to the North and University of California, Santa Barbara to the
South. The less than ten-mile proximity to Vandenberg Air Force Base affords the Santa Maria
Airport Business Park the opportunity to attract companies seeking to launch themselves into
the commercial space arena.

         Employment Characteristics
         A     ccording to Census 2000, 33,646 persons living in the City were at least 16 years of age and
               in the labor force and 5.2 percent of the labor force was unemployed. According to the Labor
         Market Information published by the State, the 2003 average unemployment rate in Santa
         Barbara County was 5.0 percent and the average unemployment rate of the City was 6.4 percent.
         The 2004 and 2005 unemployment rates in the City of Santa Maria were 6.0 percent in 2004 and
         estimated at 5.7 percent in 2005.
                                                                                                                    10
In 1990, over 70 percent of all employment in the City occurred in five industry sectors:
      1. Services – 25.6%
      2. Retail Trade – 17.9%
      3. Agriculture – 16.0%
      4. Manufacturing (durable goods) – 7.4%
      5. Construction – 7.1%
Census 2000 disaggregated the data, making direct comparisons difficult without knowing where
the data categories originated. Table 1-2A compares the 1990 and 2000 Census data, which
appears to indicate that the actual shifts and shares between different employment sectors have
been relatively small and that two-thirds of all the employed persons living in Santa Maria work in
Agriculture-Retail-Service sectors.

Travel Time to Work
     ♦ The average travel time to work increased from 15 minutes in 1980 to 18 minutes in 1990
        and 20 minutes in 2000.
     ♦ 24.2 percent of the workers had commute times over 30 minutes.
     ♦ 60 percent of the workers living in the City also work in Santa Maria.
     ♦ 11.9 percent of the City residents work outside Santa Barbara County.
The Census 2000 data supports the inference that 40 percent of workers living in Santa Maria
work in agriculture, work at Vandenberg Air Force Base or on the South Coast of Santa Barbara
County, or work in San Luis Obispo County.
Agricultural Employment
F    rom 1980 to 1990, farming, occupations grew in number from 1,637 to 3,896–a 140 percent
     increase. From 1990 to 2000, the number of agricultural workers living in the City grew an
additional 47 percent to 5,735. In 1980, agricultural employed 9.7% of the population in Santa
Maria. This percentage increased to 14.5 in 1990 and again to 18.7 in 2000. Increasing production
of labor-intensive row crop agriculture in the Santa Maria Valley is the primary factor attributed to
the expanding farm worker population. This becomes most evident when looking at changing crop
production and long-term increases in strawberry and wine grapes in Santa Barbara County
(source: http://www.countyofsb.org/agcomm/crops.asp).
                                                                                                      12

Farm Worker Wages
A     lthough the available Census data are not tabulated to show race/ethnicity (or citizenship) by
      occupation (or industry), using the available information for 2000, one can draw certain
inferences.
     ♦ Almost 32 percent of the City population is foreign born; over 24 percent of the City
         population does not hold U.S. citizenship.
     ♦ Over 86 percent of the foreign born population was born in Latin America.
     ♦ Median Hispanic/Latino family income is about 81 percent of the median family income in
         the City.
     ♦ Per capita income for Hispanic persons was 65 percent of the per capita income citywide.
The data imply that farm workers earn lower wages than the City population as a whole. The data
also suggest that the household size for farm workers is larger than for the City as a whole.
Agricultural laborers have lower incomes and larger families than other distinct groups of workers
in the City. Farm worker housing needs differ from the needs of most other groups in the
community. These needs include:
     ♦ larger, low cost apartments;
     ♦ seasonal and transitional housing for individuals and families;
     ♦ support services to ease the transition into the community (i.e. interpreter services, on-site
         ESL classes, transportation, etc.).
                                                                                                  13

Retail and Service Sector Needs
T    he retail and non-professional service sectors employ over one third of the working residents
     living in the City. The Workforce Investment Board of Santa Barbara County published the
2002-2003 State of the Workforce report for Santa Barbara County. That report lists the average
annual salary by industry sector paid in the County. In 2002, the average wages paid for the three
largest employment sectors in Santa Maria were: Services at $33,873; Retail at $19,415; and
Agriculture at $21,955 per year. Often, retail and service industry employment is part-time work,
which contributes to low annual wages.
Traditionally, employment in entry-level, low-wage jobs serve as training steps on the job skills
ladder and result in increasing responsibilities and increasing wages. The lack of “middle steps”
higher on the job ladder stifles employee motivation and productivity suffers. Workers may feel
trapped because the jobs “dead-end” right where they are today.
Jobs/Housing Balance
T    he ratio of number of jobs (employment) to number of dwelling units defines Jobs–Housing
     Balance. "Dwelling units" includes occupied and vacant housing units of all types and
tenures (e.g., owner occupied and renter occupied). A mathematically balanced jobs/housing
ratio is 1 job:1 housing unit, but an "ideal" ratio is considered to be about 1.6 jobs:1 housing unit
and a "balanced" ratio is considered to be within the range between 1:1 and 1.6:1 (source: City
of Santa Maria Sphere of Influence Boundary Expansion and Concurrent Annexation EIR).
With a higher jobs/housing ratio at 1.6:1, housing would be in shorter supply in relation to jobs.
A ratio nearer 1:1 generates more housing that would be in excessive supply in relation to jobs
and encourage more commuters–effectively creating a bedroom community. From 1990 to
2000Census data, the jobs/housing ratio fluctuated from about 1.38 to 1.47 in Santa Maria City.
The higher jobs/housing ratio (1.47) in 2000 reflects the vigorous economy of the late 1990s (i.e.
more jobs). In June 2003, the jobs/housing ratio declined to 1.25 in The City of Santa Maria, and
this reflects higher unemployment rates experienced in January 2003. According to 1991 data,
the jobs/housing balance had also fallen to about 1.22, which was also a period of declining
employment. Nevertheless, during all periods between 1990 and 2003, the jobs/housing ratio
fell within the "balanced" range according to the 1991 Sphere Study definition.
Household and Family Income
C     ensus 2000 data show that the median household income in Santa Maria rose 24 percent
      from $29,492 in 1990 to $36,541 in 2000. The median income for families, excluding single
person households, increased 22 percent from $32,170 to $39,277 during the same period.
Per Capita Income
T    he per capita income rose 13 percent between 1990 and 2000, from $12,118 to $13,780.
     The 11.8 percent increase in the average household population is believed to be a factor
contributing to low per capita income.
                                                                                                      14

Purpose and Performanc
Outline of Purpose and Performance
Proposed Policy
C    reate an Economic Development Element (EDE) consistent with, and made a part of, the
     City of Santa Maria adopted General Plan and have the Element certified as a
Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy (CEDS) by the Small Business
Administration. The Economic Development Element was originally adopted on February 17,
2004. Updates and revisions follow, as needed
There are few examples of useful Economic Development Elements. Community organizations
(Santa Maria Valley Chamber of Commerce, and North Broadway Improvement Group) have
similar aims to further economic development and their efforts may be magnified if using a
single-source document to focus these efforts. Additional challenges include limited staff, lack of
data retrieval systems (GIS), and lack of coordination.
Future Resources
    ♦ Staff and staff time
    ♦ GIS
    ♦ Strategic Workforce Action Team
    ♦ Refinement of data to and from target industries
    ♦ A close working relationship with local businesses, and schools.
    ♦ A comprehensive understanding of what currently exists, strengths and weaknesses.
Benchmark/Timeline/Targets
    ♦ Have GIS operational on or before January 1, 2008.
                                                                                                16

Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy
A     Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy (CEDS) is developed through a
      continuous planning process producing broad-based and diverse community participation
that addresses economic problems and potential of an area. The strategy should promote
sustainable economic development and opportunity, foster effective transportation systems,
enhance and protect the environment and balance resources through sound management of
development. A CEDS analyzes local conditions, identifies problems and opportunities, defines
the vision and goals of the community, designs strategies to accomplish goals, coordinates
activities to implement strategies and evaluates and updates the process.
The successful CEDS process leads to formulation and implementation of a program that
creates jobs, raises income levels, diversifies the economy and improves the quality of life,
while protecting the environment. The process adopts a logical approach to long-range
development while identifying and implementing short-term problem solutions to achieve early
results and maintain momentum and public support. A draft CEDS is then submitted to the
Small Business Administration (SBA) for certification. This process is expensive and time-
consuming. The County of Santa Barbara developed a countywide CEDS in 2003 at a cost of
$45,000 over an eighteen-month timeframe. The County SBA approved CEDS includes a
number of Santa Maria projects which by their inclusion become eligible for federal funding.
The Economic Development Element (EDE) of the Santa Maria General Plan is unique,
reflecting the specific challenges and opportunities of this area. The EDE assesses the state of
the regional economy, the opportunities and threats posed by external trends and forces and
the availability of partners and resources for economic development together with an appraisal
of the City’s competitive advantages and sets strategic directives. The EDE establishes
priorities for implementation, establishes criteria and performance measures for evaluation of
the process and for the periodic update of the document. None of the projects suggested for
implementation require federal funding.
While it may be prudent to have a City CEDS, it is neither cost nor time effective to accomplish
certification at this time. Sufficient projects necessitating federal funding are currently included
in the County CEDS and the EDE is a stand-alone document, which will stimulate economic
development on its own. No further action is to be taken on this item.
                                                                                                   17

             Target Industries
  Goal: Target recruitment of industries having the best fit
with Santa Maria in order to increase the number and pay level
                  of Santa Maria’s workforce.

Target Industries
Agriculture
B    y the time a consumer purchases produce or other agricultural products, it has been
     processed, packaged and transported. The product may have been treated with a
preservative or treated for appearance and refrigerated. All of the above steps add value to an
agricultural product and increases by a high percentage, its cost to the consumer from its value
at the time of picking by farm laborers. Employees involved in the above-described steps are
usually paid at higher levels than a farm laborer. For instance, an employee operating a
stamping or labeling machine normally is paid a salary above the average $18,000 commanded
by a farm laborer. Given Santa Maria's many actively farmed lands, it seems to make sense to
have the various industries that support the agricultural industry located in or very near Santa
Maria.
Industries to Target
         •   Trucking/Distribution
         •   Food processing
         •   Container Manufacturing and Distribution
         •   Cold Storage Plants
         •   Labeling/Advertising
         •   Agricultural Administrative Offices (public/private)
         •   Commercial Warehouse and Distribution
Aircraft/Aerospace
S    anta Maria Public Airport was initially constructed by the military in the 1940s on land
     purchased by the U.S. Government from area farmers and other landowners. Following
World War II, the airport was turned back over from the military to Santa Barbara County and
the City of Santa Maria. In 1964, the Santa Maria Public Airport District was formed to own and
operate the airport. Shortly thereafter, the District reached agreement with the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) to sell those portions of the Airport not needed for aviation with the
understanding proceeds would fund airport revenue generating projects. Just recently, an
agreement has been reached to sell the last three parcels. Now the Airport is proceeding with
development of an Airport Research Park using land sale proceeds and low interest loans to
create infrastructure to attract high tech companies to the Santa Maria Valley. The 156-acre
park and adjoining 200-acre golf course can accommodate over 2 million square feet of building
space creating nearly 10,000 new jobs. This project is projected to begin in 2004 and be ready
for new business ventures the following year. The golf course is included in the first phase of the
                                                                                                 19

project and will offer area residents an attractive, challenging course while providing aesthetic
landscaping for Research Park companies.
There are several features of this proposed Research Park that will create interest from a wide
variety of firms. The development is within a Foreign Trade Zone, potentially attracting
companies that import foreign goods. A Master Development Plan depicting concept buildings
allows businesses to bypass the formal planning approval process and receive administrative
approval if it desires to construct within the parameters created by that plan. Companies
complying with requirements of the Master Development Plan can immediately start on the
construction document approval process. Finally, having an adjoining full-service air carrier
airport capable of accommodating large jet aircraft offers great access for employees and rapid
shipment of goods and materials.
Thanks to the physical capabilities of the Santa Maria Airport, attracting jet aircraft service
centers and aircraft rehabilitation facilities are likely target industries. The airport’s 6,304-foot
runway accommodates aircraft such as the Boeing 727 and Boeing 737, as well as the largest
corporate jets. If an aviation user requires and even longer runway, the airport can extend its
main runway up to 8,000 feet and still have all pavement and clear zones within the airport’s
boundary. Another asset is having an upscale 150-room hotel and fine restaurant on site
affording direct access for corporate aircraft and commercial passengers flying into the airport.
This facility offers excellent opportunities for company executives, industrial site developers,
planners, engineers and financiers to meet in comfort with convenient access to aircraft, right
outside the meeting room doors.
The Airport’s close proximity to Vandenberg Air Force Base makes it a candidate for aerospace
firms needing development and light manufacturing facilities that are easily accessible by
employees, suppliers and contractors in the aviation and space industries.
Industries to Target
        ♦ Aircraft Service Centers
        ♦ Hanger/Aircraft Storage
        ♦ Aircraft/Aerospace Research Manufacturer
        ♦ Flight School
        ♦ Commuter/Feeder Airline
        ♦ Air Freight
        ♦ Aircraft Component Testing Laboratories
        ♦ Aircraft and Aircraft Component Testing
        ♦ Corporate Aircraft Storage and Flight Department Offices
                                                                                                      20

Specialty Manufacturing
T    here are a plethora of examples of how a city or region becomes known as the center of
     craftsmanship or a particular type of industry. Often these trades/industries group together
because of “economies of scale,” the ease of finding materials and the ability to refine the skills
of workers. Mike’s Garage in Oxford, England created MG sports cars in the 1950’s-60’s and
spurred on the sports car industry. Parocho, Mexico is a city within a woodworking region,
prized for its classical and flamenco guitars. Closer to home, Pennsylvania and North Carolina
are known as furniture-making states. In the Santa Maria Valley region we have several
examples of specialty manufacturing.
At least a dozen guitar makers (luthiers) make hand-made guitars and approximately seven
ukulele makers live and work in or near San Luis Obispo (SLO) and Santa Maria (SM). In
addition, many manufacturers of accessories reside in our region (LL Baggs – transducers).
National Guitar is a world-recognized leader in metal “resophonic” style guitars (SLO). Closer to
home, Baker Guitars (Betteravia) make some of the finest guitars in the industry (Lennie Kravitz
and Ronnie Montrose play Baker Guitars). Thus, like Parocho, the Central Coast cities of SLO
and SM form a specialty-manufacturing region for guitars and accessories.
An example of an industry with market potential is kite manufacturing. Several kite stores from
Pismo Beach to Santa Barbara call the Central Coast home. Individuals and groups can often
be seen stunt flying their kites at local beaches. While local retailers sell kites, few are made in
our area. While employment opportunities may seem small, these cottage industries can grow
over time and can result in “spillover” benefits such as aiding promotional events.
                                                                                                     21

Industries to Target
            ♦ Guitar Making and Accessories
            ♦ Ocean/Beach Gear (kayaks, surfboards)
            ♦ Kite Making
            ♦ Shipping of Specially Prepared Ag Products
            ♦ Automobile Racing/Customization (a tie into SM Raceway)
            ♦ Performing Arts (stage setting, props manufacturing, costumes)
            ♦ Warehousing and Distribution for Large Business
            ♦ Aerospace to Tier Off of Planned Aerospace Visitors’ Center
            ♦ Stealth Communication Towers (cell towers in the form of trees)
Market Driven Education
A    t times, a shortage of qualified labor may exist in specific markets. For instance,
     nationwide, there is a persistent shortage of qualified nurses. To fill this gap, recruitment
excursions to the Philippines have yielded large numbers willing and able to fill the shortage.
The Philippines utilize U.S. textbooks and generally meet U.S. standards of expertise. In the
computer field many positions have been filled by natives of India, a country that produces
numerous computer scientists and mathematicians. Microsoft is building a facility in India to
bridge the gap in employment need. Obviously, if these demands for skilled workers could be
met domestically it would aid our economies. A good place to start is improved matching of our
education opportunities with market driven need. Matching educational needs with Santa
Maria’s market is an important challenge that needs further exploration and is likely a key
ingredient to facilitate long-term job growth.
Education to Match Educational Need
            ♦ Nursing/Physician’s Assistant
            ♦ Computer Science
            ♦ Aircraft Construction or Service
            ♦ Agricultural Mechanization
                                                                                                   22

Resources to Work With
        ♦ Allan Hancock College (nursing, LVN, CAN and liaison with four-year colleges like
             CSU, Bakersfield, offering 4 year degrees and coursework)
        ♦ Santa Barbara Business College*
        ♦ Cal Poly*
        ♦ Police/Fire Academies*
        ♦ Other private or vocational trade schools.
             *Including vocational instruction
Diversified Industry & Manufacturing
S    anta Maria has a diverse base of industries that meets the area’s target needs of providing
     good paying jobs, but do not necessarily fit into a specific target industry.
        Examples include:
        ♦ Okonite Cable: Manufactures and produces wire and cable
        ♦ Water Wonders: Produces waterfalls and waterfall products
        ♦ Computer Café: Computer generated work for the movie industry
        ♦ Melfred Borzal: Manufactures directional drilling tools
These miscellaneous companies are ideally suited for Santa Maria, and when they show an
interest in our area, the Santa Maria Valley Chamber of Commerce responds to provide
information and begins the process of working with the company to relocate here.
                                                                                                 23

      Hospitality and Tourism
Goal: To enrich the quality of life and improve the economy
           of Santa Maria by generating travel
          and enhancing the image of the region.
Hospitality and Tourism
Background
T    he Santa Maria Valley Chamber of Commerce and Visitor & Convention Bureau (VCB) is
     the City of Santa Maria’s official destination marketing organization. Its primary mission is to
improve the area’s economy and increase its tax base by attracting visitors to the Santa Maria
Valley through sales and marketing efforts. The VCB has numerous marketing programs which:
    ♦ Attract new visitors to the Santa Maria Valley from its current markets
    ♦ Increase awareness of the Santa Maria Valley to multi-cultural audiences
    ♦ Send a compelling invitation to people of all cultures to enjoy the many attractions and
       recreational activities in the Santa Maria Valley.
    ♦ Encourage longer visits to the Santa Maria Valley through increased overnight stays,
       midweek promotions and extended weekend getaways.
    ♦ Promote venues including, but not limited to: golfing, fishing, agriculture tours, arts and
       culture, wine-tasting, and the beautiful natural areas of local beaches, lakes and the
       Dunes
    ♦ Identify the Santa Maria Valley as a location for feature film and video production,
       commercials and still shoots.
Challenges to Tourism Industry
    ♦ Lack of visibility of core downtown from Highway 101
    ♦ Under-utilization of airport
    ♦ Lack of a central meeting place or plaza.
    ♦ Limited non-auto transit.
    ♦ Lack of pedestrian-oriented destination points
    ♦ Competition for travelers is fierce among locations
    ♦ Lack of signage off of Highway 101 for lodging, airport and wineries
                                                                                                      25

Future Resources
T    he Chamber of Commerce and the City of Santa Maria have a partnership that provides
     uninterrupted funding for tourism promotion by sharing a portion of the transient occupancy
tax (bed tax). It is vital that the community partners continue to participate, thus bringing
together the interests of all local businesses, government and civic organizations.
Benchmarks / Timelines
         Ongoing.
Promotions/Entertainment
P    romotion of the City of Santa Maria and the beautiful Santa Maria Valley can do much to
     improve our local economy with emphasis on tourism, service and retail industries, in
particular. Promotional services continue to improve Santa Maria’s identity by keeping Santa
Maria “On the Map”.
Tourism Related Objectives
    ♦ Support and promote agri-tourism
    ♦ Offer viewing of space and missile operations and launches at Vandenberg Air Force Base
    ♦ Capitalize on the Elks Unocal Event Center as an interim facility for special events
    ♦ Promote partnerships between local hotels, wineries, restaurants, transportation providers,
      local businesses, attractions and the airport
    ♦ Support and promote the Santa Maria Public Airport which has a hotel within walking
      distance; restaurant on the premises; and several car rental agencies onsite
    ♦ Provide marketing support and promotion of the Santa Maria Fairpark as an interim facility
      for special events, conventions and meetings and as a possible film location
    ♦ Continue to promote and support live theatre performances at PCPA Theaterfest
    ♦ Build on existing recreational/entertainment facilities
    ♦ Support of cultural activities
    ♦ Capitalize on the Santa Maria Speedway/Raceway as an attraction and for use in feature
      films
                                                                                                 26

Build Wealth and Create an “Intelligent” Community
Background
E     ducation is widely believed to be a major factor in advancing one’s career and increasing
      one’s earning potential. Clearly define issues and problems through an education-related
visioning and planning process, then mobilize human, financial, physical and natural resources
to increase median and household income providing more discretionary funds to families.
“Place” is fundamentally more important now than it ever was. It is what draws creative people
to a city. Government and economic development professionals create a “people climate.”
Creative people gravitate to stimulating environments rich with differences, lively and open
character and distinctiveness.
Proposed Policy
D     etermine the best and most effective ways to increase the wealth of the residents of the
      Santa Maria Valley. Develop a framework for creativity and seek specific projects to put
that framework into action
Challenges
     ♦ Current economic base is agriculture, retail and service – three of the lowest paying
         employment sectors.
     ♦ Need to insure a constant workforce for the agriculture industry.
     ♦ Need a strategic plan inclusive of all stakeholders that is community-driven.
     ♦ There are few systematic offerings of incentives or inducements for companies to locate
         in City.
     ♦ Lack a stand-alone four-year college. Allan Hancock College offers the ability to obtain
         four-year degrees through liaison programs offered by four-year Universities, such as
         California State University Bakersfield, University of California Santa Barbara, and the
         Cal Poly Adult Degree Program.
     ♦ Few, if any, true live / work spaces
     ♦ Few strategies to attract and retain human and educational capital
     ♦ Few music venues or night life
     ♦ Few transit-oriented and/or mixed-use development strategies
     ♦ Attract additional fine dining establishments
                                                                                                  27

Future Resources
  ♦ Responsible Parties: Farm Bureau, Grower / Shipper Association, Santa Maria Valley
    Chamber of Commerce, City of Santa Maria.
  ♦ Responsible Parties: School Districts, Allan Hancock College, CSM, Chamber of
    Commerce.
Benchmarks / Timelines
  ♦ Public Forums with report and recommendation within 18 months
  ♦ Report and recommendations within 180 days following public forums
                                                                                       28

        Economic Development
               Rapid Response
Strategic Workforce Action Team
   Goal: Create a team of organized, trained professionals
 who can be quickly assembled and answer all of a prospect’s
  questions while portraying a positive image of Santa Maria.

Economic Development Strategic Workforce Action
Team
Background
E     conomic Development Prospects must gather a high volume of accurate, pertinent
      information that will lead to the decision of whether to locate in a city. Thus, the speed,
accuracy and relevance of “hard data” comprise a key determinant in the economic
development site selection process. Economic Development Prospects (hereinafter, prospects)
are faced with a bewildering array of contacts often at remote relocations and may receive
information that appears confusing or contradictory.
Proposed Policy
C     reate an economic development Strategic Workforce Action Team (SWAT) of key
      professionals, who are experts in their field of authority, that can be assembled within a
very short time (hours) to meet with prospects. Professionals would include the City Manager,
Community Development Director, the Chamber of Commerce Executive Director and
Membership Manager, and the Mayor. In each position, at least one alternate must be available
to cover the absence of any key member. The SWAT would periodically meet as necessary for
training and review any adjustments needed for meeting format, venue or participant role. The
“team” would be “on-call” to address Santa Maria’s strengths and answer questions by the
prospect. The team’s participation would be given priority over other tasks and the City Council
and City Manager would support this priority. A Strategic Workforce Action Team meeting would
be set by the Chamber of Commerce, which would serve as a hub of information. Prospect
requests for meetings would be communicated to and from the Chamber of Commerce.
Challenges
T    eam members must be given time to meet with prospects and, as a consequence, need a
     lowering of priorities that would otherwise take up the time of the team participants.
Accurate, pertinent information should be prepared, to the extent feasible, before the meeting. A
GIS system of data retrieval would assist the SWAT. Venue or conference room availability are,
on occasion, needed. However, it is anticipated that most meetings would be held in the field.
                                                                                                  30

Future Resources
  ♦ Availability of team members and alternates.
  ♦ GIS or equivalent data retrieval system.
  ♦ Suitable, available meeting locations.
  ♦ Preparation, in advance, of handout materials.
Benchmarks/Timelines
    ♦ The SWAT is operational with meetings and site visits coordinated by the Chamber
        of Commerce.
                                                                                       31

               Rapid Information
      Collection and Distribution
GOAL: Create and implement a Geographic Information System (GIS)
  in order to rapidly retrieve accurate, pertinent information.
Rapid, Thorough, and Accurate Information
Dissemination
Background
T    oday’s cutting-edge businesses require and expect a rapid response to requests for
     information from the jurisdictions in which they seek to locate. Any jurisdiction that requires
extended periods of time to provide basic property and zoning information to a prospective
client, or that requires excessive paperwork before the information can be obtained, cannot
compete to locate innovative, entrepreneurial industries within their boundaries. Additionally,
rapid, thorough, and accurate information dissemination is key for a successful economic
development Strategic Workforce Action Team.
The City of Santa Maria (City) is actively planning for the future implementation of a Geographic
Information System (GIS). The City will be hiring a staff GIS specialist to create a system that
will best serve the needs of the City. Funding has been set aside for this purpose.
Proposed Policy
P     rovide rapid, thorough, and accurate information to Economic Development prospects
      within one visit or phone call to the City or one visit to the City’s internet web site. This goal
is attained by implementing the following:
     ♦ Create a Geographic Information System for use by the Community Development
         Department and other City employees or end users (such as Chamber of Commerce)
         and make limited, internet-based building permit, zoning, and land use information
         available for viewing by outside customers.
     ♦ Inform customers if their proposed use is permitted or conditionally permitted and the
         options available to them.
     ♦ Make available the status of each project as it moves through the system.
     ♦ Provide means that allow inquiries of all departments’ databases by City employees and
         end users.
     ♦ Make all the above possible on-line, via the Internet.
Challenges
T    echnology, such as a Geographic Information System (GIS), to provide fast, accurate
     updated information to economic prospects, is vital. Staff must be available to collect,
create and develop means to distribute the documentation, and to continually update the
information in the GIS and on the Internet.
                                                                                                         35

Future Resources
  ♦ Additional staff may be needed to create and keep current a system.
  ♦ A Geographic Information System to organize and store property information and
    demographics.
  ♦ Downloading data (such as County resources) is important to reduce time and cost to
    input the data by staff resources.
Benchmarks/Timelines
  ♦ Have all standard handout material prepared to coincide with the economic development
    Strategic Workforce Action Team.
  ♦ Have basic information (zoning, address, assessor parcel numbers, etc.) in the GIS and
    available to customers.
  ♦ Have a full arsenal of thorough and accurate information available on the City’s web site
    and at the Planning Division front counter.
  ♦ Have GIS fully operational on or before January 1, 2008.
                                                                                              36

                Mixed Use Zoning
                 Goal: Remove obstacles to mixed uses
   (residential, commercial, office and light industries) for those
that wish to pursue such uses, and to facilitate start-up businesses.
Mixed-Use Ordinance
  ♦ The Mixed Use Ordinance was adopted by the City Council on November 2,
    2004, and went into effect 30 days thereafter.
  ♦ The Mixed Use Ordinance generally allows for mixed uses in most zoning
    ordinances except single-family residential and heavy industrial.
  ♦ The Mixed Use Ordinance allows for mixed uses subject to a Conditional Use
    Permit (CUP) in each case if the mixed use utilizes an existing structure or is
    subject to a Planned Development Permit (PDP) if the mixed use utilizes new
    construction.
  ♦ Within one year of the approval of the Mixed Use Ordinance, approximately ten
    projects are in various stages of planning and development.
  ♦ The Mixed Use Ordinance is expected to greatly improve the supply of affordable
    housing and opportunities for economic development.
                                                                                    38

                   Brownfields
Goal: To analyze and Consider Brownfield and Grayfield Sites
                 for Economic Development
Brownfields
A     brownfield is a property; the expansion, redevelopment or reuse of which may be
      complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or
contaminant. Since its inception in 1995, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
Brownfields Program has grown into a proven, results-oriented program that has changed the
way contaminated property is perceived, addressed, and managed. The EPA Brownfields
Program is designed so that stakeholders in economic redevelopment work in a timely manner
to prevent, assess, safely clean up and sustainably reuse brownfields. Through passage of the
Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act, effective polices that EPA had
developed over the years were passed into law. The Brownfields Law expanded EPA's
assistance by providing new tools for the public and private sectors to promote sustainable
brownfields cleanup and reuse.
Brownfields grants continue to serve as the foundation of EPA’s Brownfields Program. These
grants support revitalization efforts by funding environmental assessment, cleanup, and job
training activities. Brownfields Assessment Grants provide funding for brownfield inventories,
planning, environmental assessments, and community outreach. Brownfields Revolving Loan
Fund Grants provide funding to capitalize loans that are used to clean up brownfields.
Brownfields Job Training Grants provide environmental training for residents of brownfields
communities. Brownfields Cleanup Grants provide direct funding for cleanup activities at certain
properties with planned green space, recreational or other nonprofit uses.
A grayfield is a former vacant or underutilized commercial site. More than 200 vacant parcels
considered infill and/or grayfield/brownfield sites have been visually inspected with site
characteristics noted. Following some needed further evaluation, this data will be furnished to
the Chamber of Commerce, real estate agents/brokers and the public to facilitate development
of industrial infill sites. Use of available brownfield clean-up funding will be encouraged and no
further action will be required.
                                                                                                   40

              Refine Scope
    of Development Review
     Goal: Reduce the complexity and “red tape”
often associated with the development review process
          by focusing on what is relevant.

Refine Scope of Development Review
Background
A    pplication materials serve as the basis for conducting environmental review, writing staff
     reports, and checking plans for conditions and code compliance. Typical submission
requirements are identified by staff at the counter and vary from project to project. Providing
development checklists standardizes the submission requirements and puts everyone "on the
same page" with the types and number of documents required by the City to process different
applications.
Proposed Policy
   ♦ Project complexity (Administrative, Minor, and Major) should determine the level of detail
        required for project review. The requirements for each complexity class should be
        consistent.
   ♦ A minimal number of plans should be required for simple projects.
   ♦ Eliminate redundant requirements for application submittals and combine applications
        whenever possible.
   ♦ Foster concurrent processing.
Challenges
   •    Public understanding of work processes.
   •    Staff training and adherence to process.
Future Resources
        Time for training.
Benchmarks/Timelines
        Ongoing.
                                                                                                42

  Fast Tracking – Plan Processing
Goal: Aid new businesses seeking entry into Santa Mar reducing the
         time from application to occupancy of structure.

Fast Tracking
Background
F   ast tracking utilizes reserve development review capacity in order to move a project through
    the approval process faster than normal.
Proposed Policy
    ♦ Identify project thresholds that allow priorities to be established for planning and building
        projects.
    ♦ Set up fast track options.
    ♦ Establish fast-track procedures and desired timelines.
    ♦ Identify adjustments that may need to occur in viewing economic development
        processing versus non-economic development projects.
    ♦ Study alternatives to in-house project review and processing and implement the
        identified alternatives.
Challenges
L   acking available reserve capacity, fast tracking allows overtime compensation or shifts
    processing priorities. It reallocates existing staff to work on projects out of the order that the
projects are normally processed.
Future Resources
        Additional staff or available temporary staffing resources in multiple departments.
Benchmarks/Timelines
        Ongoing as staff resources permit.
                                                                                                       44

Outside Plans Examination
Background
D    uring periods of very high building activity, the City of Santa Maria has employed plan-
     checking services and utilized former City staff to review and comment on building plans.
Proposed Policy
   ♦ Investigate department organizational strategies to coordinate contract services and
       increase the contract service role during periods of high volume or low staffing.
   ♦ Maintain a list of approved plan-checkers to process single projects on a fee for service
       basis.
   ♦ Set up well-defined department procedures that move simple projects and rechecks to a
       point where these plan checks are not lost between high priority projects and new
       projects.
   ♦ Investigate "rover" positions that can shift from plan checking to building inspection on
       an as-needed basis.
   ♦ Establish criteria that warrant adding staff needed to perform planchecking and
       inspection services for economic development projects.
Challenges
T   hese services help expedite the speed of planchecking, but may sacrifice consistency of
    project review.
Future Resources
O    bjective workload measurement and projected workload measurement tools. Resources
     and tools to determine when and where workload diversion (management intervention)
should occur.
Benchmarks/Timelines
O    utside plan checking has become routine in the operation of the Building Division of the
     Community Development Department.
                                                                                               45

     Joint City/School Facilities
 Goal: to foster joint City of Santa Maria and School District
projects, such as school/park facilities to maximize efficiencies
                    of cost and utilization.
Joint City/School Facilities
R     ecognizing that budgetary factors exist in the City and school districts, there is no reserve
      capacity in our community to fully add new capacity to serve the expected public demand.
Thus, alternatives are being explored to raise service levels.
Efficient use of public facilities, like libraries, parks, City Hall, School District conference rooms,
assembly rooms, gymnasiums, swimming pool, and other public facilities serves the public well
by maximizing the community benefits of these facilities with little added capital expenditure.
    ♦ Establish a joint agency committee to identify opportunities for sharing public facilities.
    ♦ Create a Public Facilities and Open Space Plan that is incorporated into the Resources
        Management Element of the City General Plan.
    ♦ Encourage local school districts to incorporate a matching public facility and open space
        component in each district's Master Plan.
    ♦ Establish operational agreements between the City and school districts.
    ♦ Jointly seek funding for capital projects and community programs.
Challenges
    ♦ Organizational opposition.
    ♦ Control of scheduling, prioritization, and issues of cost and maintenance to allow full
        public use of the public facilities.
Future Resources
    Open communication links between agencies
    Formal and informal business processes between the city departments and schools
Benchmarks/Timelines
    Ongoing.
                                                                                                     47

                       Improving
     Relationships with Schools
     Goals: Work with area school districts in site location
 and acquisition in order to provide availability and appropriate
           locations for neighborhood school sites,
         placed equitably in all areas of the community;
                               and
Work with Santa Maria Joint Union High School District and Allan
Hancock College to provide curriculum to meet the job markets.
Build Closer Relationship with Educational
Institutions
W       ith the aim of improving City / School relationships, the All-America City Committee
        reviewed the Economic Development Element and held discussions with the
superintendents of both the Santa Maria-Bonita and Santa Maria High School districts. It was
determined that the relationships with these two districts are at an all-time high and are
expected to continue accordingly. As joint meetings and communications continue,
representatives of the respective entities will continue to discuss data-sharing procedures
between the school districts and City, project review for residential developments noting their
effects on Schools and school site development.
The City continues to build joint use facilities with the school districts. Of particular note are the
Westgate Park/Liberty School Multi-Purpose Building and gymnasiums at Fesler, El Camino
and Kunst Schools. Future actions will include creating a Public Facilities and Open Space Plan
that is incorporated into the Resources Management Element of the City General Plan. The
local school districts are encouraged to incorporate a matching public facility and open space
component in each district's Master Plan and perhaps consider a joint agency committee to
identify opportunities for sharing public facilities.
The City and Allan Hancock Community College have worked cooperatively in the successful
Atkinson Community Facility project and more projects of this type will be sought for funding for
capital projects and community programs. The College currently provides a four-year university
extension degree and is always at the ready to assist businesses with specialized training for
employees. No further action is required at this time.
Proposed Policy
    ♦ Create the possibility of multiple-functionality into school campus design to potentially
         increase the integration of City services while maintaining the history of shared athletic
         field space and other joint use projects. School/public (branch) libraries, community-
         meeting rooms, internet connectivity and other shared resources are examples of
         potential multi-use considerations to benefit both the City and Schools.
    ♦ Establish and maintain data-sharing procedures between the school districts and City.
    ♦ Notify and seek comment from school districts in the early application stage and project
         review for residential developments noting their effects on Schools and school site
         development.
    ♦ Expand school program funding with corporate sponsorships and mentoring.
    ♦ Seek mutually beneficial joint-use projects which will maximize local resources when
         combined with available state project funds.
                                                                                                       49

  ♦ Use professional resources at the College for specific industry job training to further
    economic development.
Future Resources
  ♦ Open communication links between agencies
  ♦ Formal and informal business processes between the city departments and schools
  ♦ A strong belief in the importance of City and School partnerships for the mutual benefit
    of each entity at the City Council, School Board, and leadership levels of each
    organization
  ♦ Mutual organizational opposition to giving up control of joint-use facilities is a potential
    barrier to increased use of shared facilities of all types
Benchmarks/Timelines
    Ongoing.
                                                                                                 50

Vocational/Educational Nexus
   Goal: To best match educational resources
             with vocational needs.
Vocational and Education Nexus to Business Needs
Background
A    skilled workforce is paramount to attracting higher paying jobs and clean, environmentally
     sensitive industries that will increase property taxes, sales tax and income tax revenue.
Proposed Policy
A   ttract educational institutions including, but not limited to, trade schools and private
    colleges, in order to raise the skills of Santa Maria’s labor force. Analyze what job training
opportunities are available and insure that what is available is meeting the needs of business
and, if voids exist, seek to fill them.
Challenges
   ♦ Schools often seek low cost sites
   ♦ Vacant office-type buildings are a good resource
   ♦ Some in the community may be dissuaded by students moving into the community
   ♦ Schools may create their own demand for housing.
   ♦ Few, if any, vocational training opportunities
   ♦ Underutilized School-to-Work opportunities
   ♦ Need to bridge primary and secondary education with higher education
   ♦ Determine if there are sufficient older worker re-training programs
Future Resources
   ♦ Cooperative effort involving the Workforce Resource Center, High School, City.
   ♦ Contact trade schools and colleges and provide pertinent information. Work with the
         Chamber of Commerce to do the same.
   ♦ Support efforts of Allan Hancock College to provide 4-year university extension
         programs.
   ♦ Private colleges, universities and other trade schools.
Benchmarks / Timelines
         Ongoing.                                                                                  52

      Electronic Permitting
Goal: Reduce time and complexity commonly associated
with the development application process by fostering
          an electronic permitting process.
Electronic Permitting
Background
M       any cities and counties, in an effort to be proactive in their economic growth potential,
        have invested in streamlining their permit filing, review, and approval processes. Santa
Maria’s current way of doing business does not effectively consider the customers’ needs or
time in the permitting process. One way to streamline permitting is providing options to the
applicants that are convenient to them. Specifically, many cities and counties offer applicants to
file for permits “on-line.” Currently, Santa Maria requires the applicant to file for Building and
Planning permits in person no matter how minor the permit request. In addition, applicants must
make additional trips to submit revisions and to eventually pick up their permit. This system is
inefficient, inconvenient, and time consuming to economic development prospects.
Proposed Policy
     ♦ Study the effectiveness of electronic permitting, including applications, payment of fees,
         and transmission of required materials. Additionally, identify business processes effected
         by electronic permitting and transitioning to a paper-less process.
     ♦ Create a system that allows applicants to file for and gain approval of Building and
         Community Development permits electronically in an internet-based system.
         Specifically, the system could accept specific applications, and issue specific permits
         without having the applicant ever visit the Community Development department.
     ♦ Implement policies and procedures to monitor the effectiveness of electronic permitting.
Challenges
     ♦ Front-end costs and expertise, such as securing payments over the Internet and
         enhancing the City’s computer systems to accommodate an internet-based permit
         system.
     ♦ Implementing a customer-oriented permitting process would encounter resistance from
         Staff not accustomed to change for the benefit of economic development prospects.
     ♦ The Development Code and other Building Codes require revisions to make the
         permitting process more streamline.
     ♦ Integrating all submittal mediums (Fed-Ex, Over-the-Counter, Mail, Facsimile, etc.) into a
         fair and uniform project/permit numbering system.
     ♦ The public customers or end users must utilize software that is compatible with the City
         of Santa Maria’s software.                                                                 54

  ♦ System implementation has the potential to overload staff with another way to submit a
    permit on top of an unknown number of other work that is submitted in other forms
    (phone, fax, e-mail, UPS/FedEx, walk-in, drive-thru, etc.).
Future Resources
  ♦ Additional funding for staff and computer hardware and software.
  ♦ “Buy-In” from City Council and other decision-makers.
  ♦ GIS or equivalent data retrieval system.
  ♦ Compatible City/Public customer software.
Benchmarks/Timelines
  ♦ Ongoing study and implementation.
  ♦ In years to come, the City will have a City-wide unified software program that will
    function as a basic internet-based permitting system, which would replace our current
    Trak-It program.
                                                                                           55

Measurements of Success
   Goal: To accurately measure the success of
Economic Development goals, policies and programs.
Measurements of Success
Background
P    rogram evaluation for economic development is difficult. No broadly accepted standard
     evaluation method for assessing program usefulness and effectiveness exists in this rapidly
changing economy. Competition for government funding is intense, and program evaluation
findings are an important factor in determining funding levels. Implementing the first evaluation
program could consume large amounts of time and resources.
Proposed Policy
I  mplement performance measures as statistical indicators that show the extent to which
   economic development is achieving its goals. Since goals can be broad and general,
performance measures express the goals as outcomes that can be described and measured.
The following list is intended to allow visualization of the various ways to measure economic
development activity.
Real Estate
    ♦ Industrial space used
    ♦ Office vacancy rate
    ♦ Number of building permits issued
    ♦ Tenant Improvement activities
    ♦ Value of industrial and commercial property
    ♦ Percent of new residential lots
Economic Measures
    ♦ Capital investments per job
    ♦ Commercial investment
    ♦ Per capita debt
    ♦ GDP per capita
    ♦ Retail sales per capita
    ♦ Tourism/bed tax revenues

Future Resources
L  ong term focus and strong commitments from the Chamber of Commerce and City to share
   information and data on a regular and consistent basis. Continued reporting by the
Workforce Resource Center, UCSB Economic Forecast Project, and State EDD in manners that
can segregate City and North County data from aggregated Santa Barbara County data.
Benchmarks / Timelines
       Initiate in 2008 in conjunction with a GIS program and determine frequency of review.

             Support Actions
Goal: Support and promote existing and planned programs
       that will aid economic development efforts.
Support for “Priority” Programs
S   ome programs may be vital to the economic development effort however, no municipal
    action plan is currently developed. In these cases, a separate organization has primary
responsibility for carrying out the program. The City may have a major role to play in the future.
For now, it is considered important to identify the program and the City’s support for it. Below
are programs listed that are considered important and have City support. The list is not
exhaustive and should be updated periodically.
    ♦ Resolve California Tiger Salamander (CTS) matter and develop airport research park.
    ♦ Establish high speed fiber optic cable communications link and seek to implement
       additional advances to insure technological competency for businesses.
    ♦ Improve and solidify economic health/vitality of Town Center East.
                                                                                                 61

Revolving Loan Fund
O     n January 4, 2005, the City Council adopted a resolution, which authorized staff to create a
      revolving loan fund for business retention and attraction with an allocation of $250,000 set-
aside each quarter, over a one-year period for a total of $1 million. The revolving loan fund is
financed through General Fund proceeds from the sale of surplus water and is to be
administered by the Santa Maria Valley Chamber of Commerce (SMVCC).
Eligible Business Retention and Attraction Loan Program (Loan Program) applicants will include
on-going and start up private-for-profit businesses, corporations, partnerships, sole
proprietorships, and cooperatives located in or expanding within the City. The Loan Program is
established to:
    •   Increase / create new sales tax revenue and retain top sales tax revenue generators;
    •   Increase / create jobs or retain top employers in specific industries;
    •   Redevelop under-utilized properties within the City limits;
    •   Increase/create new property tax increment and/or sales tax generating businesses; and
    •   Serve as a catalyst to stimulate additional private investment.
The Loan Program is part of the overall City economic development strategy that is coordinated
by the SMVCC to promote economic activity and revitalization. Eligible uses of loan proceeds
include:
    •   Business start-up and expansion;
    •   Interior and/or exterior leasehold improvements;
    •   Purchase of machinery and equipment, furniture and fixtures, and inventory; and
    •   Funding for work in progress and account receivables.
The SMVCC, in partnership with City staff, will market the Loan Program to local businesses
and banks. This is an excellent example of cooperative economic development and no further
action is required.
                                                                                                    62

The Creative Class
H     ow do you build a truly creative community – one that can survive and prosper in this
      emerging age? The rise of the creative economy has altered the rules of the economic
development game. The key can no longer be found in the usual strategies. Recruiting more
companies won't do it; neither will trying to be the next Silicon Valley. Companies were the force
behind the old game and cities measured their status by the number of corporate headquarters
they were home to. Even today many cities, states and regions continue to use financial
incentives – some of them obscenely extravagant – in their efforts to lure companies. While
companies remain important, they no longer call all the shots. As we have seen, companies
increasingly go and are started where talented and creative people are.
The bottom line is that cities need a people climate even more then they need a business
climate. This means supporting creativity across the board – in all of its various facets and
dimensions – and building a community that is attractive to creative people, not just to high-tech
companies. Instead of subsidizing companies, stadiums and retail centers, communities need to
be open to diversity and invest in the kinds of lifestyle options and amenities people really want.
In fact you cannot be a thriving high-tech center if you do not do this.
The key to success today lies in developing a world-class people climate. While it certainly
remains important to have a solid business climate, having an effective people climate is even
more essential. This entails remaining open to diversity and actively working to cultivate it and
investing in the lifestyle amenities that people really want and use often, as opposed to using
financial incentives to attract companies, build professional sports stadiums or develop retail
complexes. The benefits of this kind of strategy are obvious. Investments in amenities like urban
parks, bike lanes or off-road trails for running, cycling, rollerblading or just walking the dog –
benefit a wide swath of the population and last for generations.
As described by Dr. Richard Florida in his book “The Rise of the Creative Class” these types of
workers include scientists, engineers, artists, designers, architects and related “creative
professionals” in the high technology, financial services, and health care fields. People who
work in these wealth-generating occupations are attracted to interesting, diverse and accepting
communities. As summarized in the EDE, “place” is fundamentally more important now than it
ever was. It is what draws creative people to a city. Government and economic development
professionals create a “people climate.” Creative people gravitate to stimulating environments
rich with differences, lively and open character and distinctiveness.
To explore this concept of “place” – and to begin to develop a practical framework for the
implementation of economic development strategies in Santa Maria consistent with this notion –
the All-America City Committee hosted a series of public forums. In these forums, participants
explored the ideas advanced by Dr. Florida, compared and contrasted those ideas with the
economic development strategies currently being implemented by Santa Maria, and
                                                                                                    63

brainstormed possible actions this community could take to build on current efforts in a more
effective way.
The general conclusions of the forum participants are summarized as:
    1) Santa Maria has numerous challenges and opportunities. The challenges – low
        educational levels, language barriers, limited “career ladders” – are well known, as are
        many of our opportunities – motivated workforce, family-friendly neighborhoods and pro-
        growth environment.
    2) Santa Maria has several “hidden” strengths – its location on the central coast relatively
        close to two major research universities, near unique environmental resources and
        home to very interesting and diverse cultures.
    3) Santa Maria’s primary challenge in seeking to expand our wealth using Dr. Florida’s
        concepts is our lack of a sense of “place” that can retain, attract, and engage the
        creative class. We have all of the raw material – but no specific vision to build upon.
To provide a real-life test of the creative class concept, Café FX CEO Jeff Barnes informally
polled his staff and then shared his thoughts as to what Santa Maria might be able to do to grow
and expand creative, wealth generating businesses like his. Café FX is a Santa Maria based
technology firm whose employees fit the creative class description as outlined by Dr. Florida.
The Café FX Top Ten list is as follows:
    1. Improve the Downtown / Town Center Mall areas
    2. Get a big name bookstore like Barnes & Noble or Borders
    3. Promote more culture / arts
    4. Improve Santa Maria’s “image.” Create a more attractive City design with some kind of
        identity
    5. Generate more family-oriented activities / services
    6. Affordable homes
    7. Better restaurants
    8. Paved bike-paths and jogging trails connecting the major parks, neighborhoods and
        shopping centers
    9. Nicer nightlife and bars. Better music venues
    10. Improve all schools – especially those in the North quadrant
Many of these ideas are already reflected in current plans and initiatives. The point is not that
there is some magic bullet, but rather to validate what Dr. Florida argues in his book and what
many intuitively sense:
Active, interesting places attract and retain active, interesting people. And active, interesting
people create businesses, jobs, and social institutions.
There is no shortage of local opportunities to implement these ideas. Examples from the
brainstorming sessions include:

            ♦ Build on existing efforts to create a “destination” along McClelland Street
            ♦ Create an “Olivera Street” type Hispanic marketplace along or adjacent to West 64
               Main Street
            ♦ Stimulate Town Center Mall activity with more community events and create an
               entertainment hub downtown
            ♦ Build on and/or replicate Old Town Orcutt art events and institute a murals
               project
All of these complex questions certainly cannot be answered definitively in a few evening
workshops but the process was sufficient to draw the following three basic conclusions.
Santa Maria should continue to implement the strategies contained in the adopted
Economic Development Element:
            ♦ The current strategies are logical, build upon existing community strengths, and
               are compatible with a vision to attract and retain creative class residents.
Santa Maria should elevate the focus on the Downtown Specific Plan – with the intention
to use it as a driver for the other strategies – particularly those associated with
expanding target industries.
            ♦ An interesting, vibrant downtown can only help grow tourism, for example, and
               growing tourism can only help improve downtown.
            ♦ A vibrant downtown that helps retain and attract creative class residents – will
               both help aerospace/aircraft and/or value added agricultural firms retain and
               attract skilled employees as well as induce entrepreneurs in those fields to
               choose Santa Maria over other alternatives to grow their businesses.
            ♦ A bustling art and cultural scene can provide numerous “career ladder”
               opportunities for skilled, but under-employed immigrant community members.
Santa Maria should make a conscious choice to build on Santa Maria’s unique strengths
as a potential center of knowledge work and innovation.
            ♦ The right elements are in place – but it may require a shift in development
               priorities to better stimulate the kind of community improvement necessary to
               attract and retain knowledge workers. Additionally, local institutions to support
               and implement the vision must be created. Local government can build a policy
               framework – and perhaps even provide seed money or projects – but the heavy
               lifting is a private sector activity.
There is no one-size-fits-all model for a successful people climate. An effective people climate
needs to emphasize openness and diversity and to help reinforce low barriers to entry. Thus, it
cannot be restrictive or monolithic. Truly creative communities appeal to many different groups.
                                                                                                 65

Incubators
S     mall business is a critical component of the City’s economy and insuring their success has
      always been a priority. One of the approaches to facilitate success is to nurture fledgling
business in a small business incubator. Incubators are facilities in which a number of new and
growing businesses operate under one roof with affordable rents, sharing services and
equipment, and having equal access to a wide range of professional, technical, and financial
programs. Incubator facilities provide an environment where public and private resources
combine to meet the needs of small businesses during their critical stages of development. The
typical low cost of operating a new business in an incubator facility is conducive to a more rapid
growth and maturity into a viable business enterprise.
The Economic Development Element calls for a determination as to the feasibility of a small
business mixed-use incubator, and the evaluation of potential operators, sites, and funding
sources. Over the course of time, two consulting firms have validated the feasibility of a small
business mixed-use incubator in the Santa Maria Valley.
Inventors Workshop International (IWI) is a Santa Barbara based non-profit, educational
foundation with over thirty years of experience assisting inventors and entrepreneurs. Through
the efforts of IWI President, Alan Tratner and others dedicated to insuring a small business
mixed-use incubator in the Santa Maria Valley, an advisory committee has been formed and
arrangements made with the Town Center Mall East owners to secure rent-free space for
incubator operation. The Santa Maria Enterprise Center as the incubator is named has been
meeting to designate Board Members, focus on operational fundraising and formation of a non-
profit corporation have been undertaken. Subcommittees are working on tenants' criteria,
incubee mentoring, fundraising and other endeavors.
Because of the dedicated efforts of community members, no further action shall be required as
this time unless the Advisory Committee requests specific assistance.
                                                                                                  66

Concluding Remarks
                   1
Concluding Remarks
T     he Economic Development Element (EDE) is intended to be a one-source “policy”
      document that is anticipated to make Santa Maria’s economic development effort the most
effective it can be.
The EDE is considered a dynamic document that reflects the latest in ideas and policies. As a
“living” document, it is expected to change often; review will take place annually with a
comprehensive update every five years.
                                                                                              68

                            Budget and Marketing Plan
Mission Statement
T      he Mission of the Santa Maria Valley Visitor & Convention Bureau is to improve the area’s
       economy and increase its tax base by attracting visitors to the Santa Maria Valley through
sales and marketing efforts. Convention and visitor services are provided to encourage longer
stays and future returns. By attracting marketing partner participation and bringing together the
interests of local businesses, government, and civic organizations, the Bureau creates an
alliance that increases awareness and enhances the image of the Santa Maria Valley.
Marketing Overview
T      he goals and strategies presented in this marketing plan are designed to promote the Santa
       Maria Valley as a desirable destination for business and leisure travel, thereby increasing
convention and visitor activity. Consistent with our mission to promote the growth and
development of the visitor industry in the Santa Maria Valley, the Bureau will continue its core
programs of Sales, Public Relations and Advertising. It will routinely evaluate all program
elements from advertising, trade shows, familiarization tours, and sales missions to brochure
fulfillment, consumer traveling and coordination of promotional programs of special interest to
our growing hospitality industry partners.
Advertising assistance will be provided to industry partners through traditional co-ops and the
development of a partnership-advertising program. In addition, our sales department will
continue to increase sales efforts in areas that have the greatest potential for return, while
protecting those groups and events that remain strong supporters of the Santa Maria Valley.
Public Relations also yields invaluable coverage that the Bureau depends upon to reach
potential visitors. During the 2003/2004 fiscal year, the Bureau will focus on a campaign that will
address both domestic and international markets by conducting ongoing outreach to key
newspapers, magazines, television, radio and on-line editors. The Bureau will also host
journalists on an ongoing basis to allow face-to-face contact with key freelance syndicated and
staff writers.

Marketing Environment
L   eisure travel is expected to continue its steady but uneven recovery during the latter part of
    2003. According to a recent travel survey by Yesawich, Pepperdine & Brown, the nation’s
leisure travel industry is strained by a convergence of three forces: the prolonged impact of
terrorism; the languishing national economy; and increasing expectations from technology-
savvy travel consumers in search of deep discounts.
As a result, leisure travel will feature less exotic trips in favor of more car travel, intra-regional
and weekend trips emphasizing emotional connections such as visiting friends and family,
                                                                                                       70

active travel and cultural attractions. Travelers are less interested in gathering material
possessions; rather, they seek life experiences, family reconnection and authenticity. Lifestyle
explorations, multi-generational travel and knowledge-based tourism are rapidly emerging as
primary reasons for visiting a destination. This, more often than in the past, means bringing
children along when they travel for pleasure or work. Time is a more crucial currency than
money and travelers are working to maximize the time value of their vacations.
In addition, the travel buyer will increasingly expect travel discounts and utilize the Internet for
trip planning and purchasing.
Advertising & Promotions
T    o most effectively maximize the budget, the majority of our promotional efforts will focus on
     three proven primary markets: Los Angeles, Central Valley, and the Bay area.
Advertisements in regional magazines, as well as increased emphasis on direct marketing,
public relations and the Internet will allow us to cost effectively reach beyond these primary
markets to other domestic travelers.
Recent trends show that the drive market is becoming increasingly important as traveler
confidence in air travel has diminished. The traditional two-week vacation is disappearing and
travelers are opting for more weekend travel and shorter trips closer to home. Travel decisions
are also being made in the shorter term, with less long-term advance planning.
With this in mind, the Bureau will promote themes of relaxation, romance, extended family
bonding, exploration, the arts, and on the stunning natural beauty of the Santa Maria Valley. We
will also capitalize on the trend of closer-to-home family travel and the frequency of combining
family and business travel.
Throughout the year, advertising campaigns will run in monthly travel publications and
newspapers to further increase expenditures, encourage repeat visits and also to attract new
visitors.

Publications
T    he vast majority of customers seeking Santa Maria vacation planning information request
     printed publications. This includes visitors to the website, those who stop at our travel
information center and those who call our toll-free phone number.
During the 2003/2004 fiscal year, the Bureau will produce the following promotional materials:
Winter Escapes travel discount brochure, Visitor’s Planning Guide, Visitor Guide and Meeting
Planner, Hiking Guide, Golf Guide, Santa Maria Wine Trail rack card, Kids Just Want to Have
Fun brochure, AAA discount brochure, and the Historical Walking Tour.
To meet the needs of our customers, these publications seek to:
    ♦ Lure customers - with attractive images, articulate copy and superior graphic design;
    ♦ Inform customers - with timely and accurate information;
    ♦ Help customers - with customer-friendly publications that are easy to use;
    ♦ Prompt customers - with specific travel ideas in specific seasons;
    ♦ Maintain a high return on investment - with the practiced selection of information suitable
        for print presented in cost-effective formats.
E-mail Marketing
T    he goal of the e-mail marketing program is to use technology as a one-to-one
     communication tool with leisure travelers. This marketing program is able to simplify
travelers' lives by providing them with timely communications, discounts, and ideas for planning
their Santa Maria travels. Through this strategy, the leisure traveler will be encouraged to stay
longer, make more frequent trips, and try new things. The ultimate result is increased economic
impact in Santa Maria.
The objectives of this program are to create a list of e-mail addresses in a customer database
and maintain a high-quality e-mail list. Travelers who have opted to receive future promotions
from us and have provided their e-mail address will be the target markets for this program.
                                                                                                  72

Technology Marketing
I nternet marketing has become an established and cost effective tool for promoting and selling
  to leisure and business travelers alike. As more travel planners use the Internet to plan
vacations, the Bureau will continue to focus on updating santamaria.com content to ensure
easy, user-friendly navigation and comprehensive, up-to-date information. New in 2003 will be
the 360-degree panoramic photography.
We will also continue to expand and monitor vacation packages and the travel discount sections
of santamaria.com to focus on drawing more visitors during the “off peak” times, mid-week and
winter months.
Direct Mail
T    he goal of the direct mail campaign includes proactively mailing the visitor guide, special
     event packages, Santa Maria Valley Wine Trail rack card and other collateral material to
travelers who requested the information in the previous year. The objective of these mailings is
to get information in the hands of travelers to keep Santa Maria top-of-mind.
Other direct mail campaigns will be implemented to supplement our advertising efforts.
Direct Sales and Services
A    ctivities designed to reach the meeting and group tour markets include trade shows, on-site
     educational visits, industry meetings, sales calls and direct mail campaigns. Trade shows
are important for maintaining existing business and penetrating new markets while direct mail
campaigns assist in increasing destination awareness and bookings.
The sales staff also provides services to meeting and tour planners that ensure the success of
meetings and group tours booked through the Bureau. The department acts as a liaison for
meeting and tour planners who have selected Santa Maria as a destination by providing a
convenient and single source for reference, information and local supplier coordination.
Sales Missions
B    ureau staff will attend two sales missions during the 2003/2004 fiscal year. Each mission
     will include 2 days of targeted appointments with key tour operators, meeting planners,
travel writers and AAA offices in the Los Angeles and Central Valley area. The Bureau conducts
these trips with local cooperative partners to strengthen our visibility and further build our image
in key markets.
                                                                                                     73

Meetings and Convention Market
A      strong partnership with and involvement in the meetings and convention market is
      instrumental in promoting the Santa Maria Valley as a meeting destination. With
membership in the Hospitality Sales & Marketing Association International and the California
Society of Association Executives, the Bureau gains access to features such as attendance to
trade shows, mailing lists, and other benefits with membership that puts the Bureau in contact
with prospective clients.
During the fiscal year, the Bureau will attend the Affordable Meetings in the West trade show in
Long Beach which has an attendance of over 800 meeting professionals from a variety of
industry segments including Association, Corporate, SMERF (Social, Military, Education,
Religious, and Fraternal), Government and Independent. At this show, the Bureau will work to
attract attendees that are from a variety of organizations throughout the western United States,
including 22 states and Canada.
Located in Anaheim, the Meetings Quest travel show reaches a variety of qualified meeting
planners. The show includes a networking breakfast, educational sessions, exhibits and a
closing reception. This year, the Bureau will coordinate attendance with our local cooperative
partners to make personal contact and distribute printed material at this show.
Group Travel Market
T    he Bureau is responsible for the sales and marketing efforts in attracting group leisure
     visitors from both domestic and international markets. These markets not only bring in new
visitors at a higher per-person-spending ratio, but they are also a key source of business for our
low and shoulder seasons.
Activities designed to reach these markets include direct mail campaigns, trade shows, and
familiarization tours, which are conducted in response to tour operator requests.
The website is another marketing tool that continues to be a valuable channel for tour operators
to use when developing itineraries. Internet use for travel planning has increased, so keeping
the site current and fresh remains a priority as motorcoach and tour operators become more
reliant on it.
During the 2003/2004 fiscal year, the Bureau will continue to solidify relationships with tour
operators by partnering with the National Tour Association, California Tourism and the California
Travel Industry Association. These relationships provide avenues for trade show participation
and allow the Bureau to aggressively promote the City as an attractive group leisure destination.
Trade shows are very important for maintaining existing business and penetrating new markets
since they allow the sales staff to make contact with group tour representatives through pre-
schedules appointments.
                                                                                                   74
Media & Communications
P      ress release distribution, securing familiarization tours, solicitation, maintenance of the
       online press room, photo CD library and Grapevine quarterly newsletter provide the
foundation on which other Public Relation activities are coordinated.
Throughout the fiscal year the public relations program will disseminate positive news about our
destination and coordinate responses to incoming press requests; continuously developing and
promoting brand themes that will maximize destination coverage. The Bureau will also increase
positive editorial media coverage of the Santa Maria Valley and of program offerings,
specifically stimulating coverage of tour product, cultural attractions, hotels, excursions, off-
season, transportation and active travel.
Familiarization Tours
T     he Bureau and the local hospitality industry will continue to host individual familiarization
      tours for selected media so they may experience Santa Maria first-hand. Providing this
opportunity to explore the Santa Maria Valley is critical to the success of our public relations
campaign since millions of dollars worth of high-quality coverage is yielded each year.
Reaching out to the Community
I  nvolvement in various organizations allows the Bureau to participate in and support
   community events that directly contribute to tourism in the Santa Maria Valley. The Bureau
staff actively participates in the Santa Maria Arts Council, the Revitalize Our City Committee,
Santa Maria Valley Beautiful, the Central Coast Tourism Council, and the Santa Barbara County
Film Commission.
Filming
A      ctivities directed toward the film location and production audience include participation in
       the Santa Barbara County Film Commission familiarization tours, advertising in the Santa
Barbara County Film Production Guide, upgrading the film section of our website and on-line
photo library.
It is essential to highlight the convenience of Santa Maria as a location and the vast array of
unique sites within the valley.
                                                                                                    75
Special Projects Grant Program
T    he Special Projects Grant program provides partnership funding to help non-profit
     organization applicants promote tourism while maintaining a strong local tourism base in the
Santa Maria Valley. Under this program, the Bureau funds up to 50% of a project's promotional
operating budget and must be used to promote the event/activity outside of Santa Barbara and
San Luis Obispo Counties. To be funded, projects must complement or supplement the
Bureau's overall tourism marketing strategy.
The grant program offers non-profit tourism organizations a variety of options to assist in the
development of marketing initiatives, with grants in five different categories: Advertising, Public
Relations, Collateral Material, Video, and Special Events.
Throughout the past fiscal year, the Bureau’s Special Projects Grant Program allocated $50,000
to the following organizations: YMCA Tri For Fun, SMISO Soccerfest, PCPA Theaterfest, La
Purisima Audubon Society, Celebration of Harvest, Elks Rodeo and Parade, Santa Maria Swim
Club, Warbird Round-Up, State Fair Booth, Bent Axles Annual Cruise and BBQ Weekend,
Autumn Arts Grapes & Grains Festival, Central Coast Tennis, Vintners’ Festival, Santa Maria
Girls Softball Tournament, Chevy/GMC-Ford Showdown, Turkey Shoot Softball Tournament,
Memorial Day Invitation Long Course, Central Coast Spring Automotive Weekend, and the
Santa Maria Valley Strawberry Festival.
Promotions/Entertainment
T    he Santa Maria Valley Chamber of Commerce and Visitor & Convention Bureau (VCB) is
     Santa Maria’s official destination marketing organization. Its primary mission is to improve
the area’s economy and increase its tax base by attracting visitors to the Santa Maria Valley
though sales and marketing efforts, thereby diversifying the local economy and stimulating
development.
To accomplish this goal, the VCB is committed to the following core objectives:
    ♦ To be a destination management organization that stresses partnership, productivity and
        maximum return on investments.
    ♦ To compete aggressively with destinations throughout the region in attracting first time
        and repeat visitors.
    ♦ To market the region in a way that maximizes the visitor’s experience while respecting
        the quality of life and environment in which we live.
    ♦ To offer exceptional customer service in all aspects of the VCB.
    ♦ To share expertise on industry issues, trends and product development with tourism
        partners.
    ♦ To measure and report the effectiveness of the organization in generating economic
        benefits for the community.
                                                                                                    76

Cultural Tourism - Events, Agriculture, and the Arts
O     ne of the most successful ways to capitalize on a community’s assets is to form strategic
      alliances between the visitor industry and the cultural community. Successful cultural
tourism projects depend on collaboration, assessment, research, and marketing and visitor
service. Such an alliance plays a crucial role in determining the image and, ultimately, the reality
of a City’s character.
In order to expand upon cultural tourism opportunities, the VCB will partner with the Santa Maria
Fairpark, Unocal Event Center, PCPA Theaterfest, and other tourism partners to support
tourism development. The VCB will also work with the local agricultural community and with the
Central Coast Agri-tourism Council to assist with the development of sustainable attractions that
educate, elevate, and entertain the visitor and local community.
Over the next decade cultural tourism will become a significant travel trend that will dominate
the tourism market. A growing number of visitors are becoming special interest travelers who
rank the arts, heritage and/or other cultural activities as one of the top five reasons for traveling.
Broadening participation in the arts, increasing opportunities for artists, preserving and
promoting our cultural resources and investing in our city’s quality of life are among the reasons
for supporting and leading cultural tourism initiatives.
Cultural tourism and agri-tourism enterprises might include:
         ♦ Outdoor recreation (wildlife study, horseback riding).
         ♦ Educational experiences (agricultural tours, cooking classes, or wine tasting).
         ♦ Entertainment (harvest festivals, theme dances or a kite festival).
         ♦ Hospitality services (guided tours or outfitter services).
         ♦ On-farm direct sales (u-pick operations or roadside stands).
                                                                                                      77

Lodging, Dining and the Airport
L    ocal hotels, restaurants, retail stores, attractions, special events, restaurants, the airport and
     other organizations have an opportunity to join together to create co-operative marketing
efforts to promote the Santa Maria Valley as a premier destination on California’s Central Coast.
VCB advertising assistance is provided to industry partners through traditional co-ops and the
development of a partnership-advertising program. In addition, the VCB sales department works
to increase sales efforts in areas that have the greatest potential for return, while protecting
those groups and events that remain strong supporters of the Santa Maria Valley.
Marketing efforts not only establish a bond between the Chamber of Commerce and Visitor &
Convention Bureau and the hospitality industry, but also create alliances within the business
community as a whole. Support and participation from the various partners becomes an integral
part of every piece of collateral, advertisement, and special program. Each success is then
spread throughout the community, gaining support and momentum as each business works
together. Over the years, the public-private partnership that the local business community has
forged continues to reap rewards, increasing each participant’s marketing budget and
advertising impact.
Partnership opportunities might include:
     ♦ Tradeshows (consumer, group tour, meeting and convention markets)
     ♦ Advertising (annual travel guides, newspapers, periodicals, television, internet)
     ♦ Public relations (positive editorial media coverage)
     ♦ Discount offerings (internet and print)
     ♦ Familiarization tours (media, filming, group tour, and the meeting markets)
     ♦ Direct mail campaigns/E-newsletter (media, consumer, group tour, meeting and
         convention markets)
     ♦ Sales missions (out-of-town targeted appointments)
                                                                                                      78

PREFACE
The Santa Maria Circulation Element evaluates the transportation needs of the City and
presents a comprehensive transportation plan to accommodate those needs. The intent of
the Circulation Element is to guide the orderly improvement of the circulation system in
direct response to the Land Use Element of the General Plan.
The City of Santa Maria Circulation Element fulfills the State Planning Act and the
regulations in Section 65530 et. seq. of the Government Code of the State of California.
Section 65302(b) of the Government Code states that a circulation element must consist of
the general location and extent of existing and proposed major thoroughfares,
transportation routes, terminals, and other local public utilities and facilities, all correlated
with the Land Use Element of the plan.
The original Circulation Element was adopted by the City Council on April 17, 1979. The
text was reformatted in April 1987 and incorporates amendments made through
September 6, 2011. This text updates the current Circulation Element and provides new
information, appropriate goals, policies, and implementation programs to guide the City's
development.
                                             (i)
                                        I. INTRODUCTION
Transportation facilities, their location and accessibility, have been and continue at present
to exert a major influence upon the shaping of cities. These facilities influence the
development pattern of the environment by affecting the location of housing, employment,
recreation, and commercial activity.
By the nature of the function they serve, transportation facilities inevitably tend to cross
jurisdictional boundaries.        As a consequence, decision-making in the realm of
transportation may involve a multiplicity of agencies, many with conflicting interests.
Because of the need for coordination, critical decisions, if deferred, may not be effectively
implementable.
The intent of the Circulation Element is to preserve future road rights-of-way and to provide
for public mobility and access necessary to support the existing and anticipated population
of the City. Adoption of this Circulation Element complies with the requirements and
responsibilities set forth in the State of California Streets and Highways Code and the
Planning and Zoning Laws of the State of California Government Code.
The Circulation Element serves the following needs:
    *    coordinate the transportation and circulation system with planned land uses;
    *    promote the efficient transport of goods and the safe and effective movement of all
         segments of the population;
    *    make efficient use of existing transportation facilities; and,
    *    protect environmental quality and promote the wise and equitable use of economic
         and natural resources.
DEFINITIONS
In general, circulation systems are composed of a wide range of transportation facilities
that serve two basic functions--mobility and land access. Mobility means providing the
ability for motorists to travel between their points of interest. Land access means providing
access to properties at the final destination, which may include parking or driveway access.
 A circulation element is typically composed of facilities that emphasize either mobility or
access to different degrees. The following types of facilities are defined in the Circulation
Plan:
                                                C-1
ROADWAY CLASSIFICATION
       Facility Type                                  Emphasis (Mobility versus Land Access)
       Freeway                                        Mobility, with no land access and limited
                                                      access to primary arterial streets.
       Primary Arterial                               Mobility, with intermittent access to
                                                      arterials, other streets, and freeways and
                                                      with minimal direct land access.
       Secondary Arterial                             Mobility, with access to collectors, some
                                                      local streets, and major traffic-generating
                                                      land uses.
       Collector                                      Mixed, with access provided from local
                                                      streets to arterials, and access also
                                                      provided to some adjacent land uses.
       Local                                          Primary purpose is to provide access to
                                                      collector streets.
       Minor                                          Land access, with access to local and
                                                      collector streets.
BIKEWAYS (Resolution 2009-168)
"Bikeway" is used to define all facilities that explicitly provide for bicycle travel. It can mean
anything from fully grade separated facilities to streets with simply signage to designate the
route. There are three classes of bikeways which are defined as follows:
       Class I, Bike Lane: Provides completely separated right of way for the exclusive
       use of bicycles and pedestrians with crossflow by motorists minimized
       Class II, Bike Lane: Provides a striped lane for one-way bike travel on a street or
       highway.
       Class III, Bike Route:     Provides for shared use with pedestrians or motor vehicle
       traffic.
                                                C-2
Multi-Purpose Trails
In some instances, it is appropriate to develop multipurpose trails for hikers, joggers,
equestrians, and bicycles. Some of the trails will not be paved and will not meet the
standards for Class I bikeways. As such, these facilities should not be signed as bikeways.
Rather, they should be designated as multipurpose trails along with regulatory signing to
restrict motor vehicles, as appropriate. In the instances where the multipurpose trail is
paved, it can replace the traditional sidewalk and serve as both the sidewalk and
recreational trail.
                                            C-3
                       II. PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS AND FINDINGS
This section generally describes information that is correct as of January 1, 2011.
EXISTING STREET SYSTEM
North-South Streets
Regional access to the City of Santa Maria is provided by the U.S. 101 Freeway. This
highway provides the City with good access to neighboring population centers. U.S. 101
extends south of Santa Maria to the City of Santa Barbara and beyond to the Los Angeles
area. North of Santa Maria, U.S. 101 passes through San Luis Obispo County.
The major existing north-south streets serving Santa Maria are Broadway, Blosser/Skyway,
and Miller. Broadway (State Route 135) is a four and six lane facility, which is the primary
north-south route through the Santa Maria/Orcutt urban area. Broadway carries a
significant volume of traffic (26,000 to 39,500 average daily trips). It is also expected to
carry increasing volumes of traffic with future development of the City. This will require
roadway and intersection improvements to relieve projected congestion. Blosser Road is a
north-south arterial along the western boundary of the City Limits. Blosser Road becomes
Skyway Drive at Betteravia Road. Skyway provides the primary access to the Santa Maria
Public Airport. In order for Blosser Road to relieve congestion from Broadway, it must be
improved to arterial standards. Miller Street is located just east and parallel to Broadway.
As shown in Figure C-1, it extends from just south of Taylor Street (in the northern portion
of the City) to its intersection with Santa Maria Way and Orcutt Expressway.
College Drive, Depot Street, Railroad Avenue, Bradley Road, and Suey Road could be
developed as north-south arterials to help relieve traffic congestion on Broadway and Miller
Streets. Presently, College Drive extends from Donovan Road southward to Santa Maria
Way, at the City limits, and connects to Bradley Road in Orcutt. College is located
between Miller Street and U.S. 101 (Figure C-1). College could provide an alternative
route to Broadway for residents in the southern portion of the City and the Orcutt area.
Together, Depot Street and Railroad Avenue have the potential of being made a north-
south arterial serving the area between Broadway and Blosser Road. However, present
discontinuities preclude its effective use as an arterial. Depot runs intermittently from
Fesler Street south to Carmen Lane. Depot continues again south of Betteravia Road to
McCoy Lane. Railroad Avenue merges with Depot Street at Fesler, where it continues to
the northern City limits. Railroad Avenue parallels Depot Street and is classified as a local
street between Main and Liberty Streets.
East-West Streets
The major east-west streets serving Santa Maria are Donovan Road, Alvin Avenue, Main
Street, Stowell Road, Battles Road, McCoy Lane, and Betteravia Road.
Donovan is located at the northern end of the City. Between North Broadway and Carlotti
Drive, it has four lanes. West of Broadway and east of U.S. 101, Donovan has two lanes.
Donovan Road has an interchange with U.S. 101.
                                                C-4
Alvin runs continuously from Blosser Road to Suey Road, but it does not have an
interchange with U.S. 101. Main Street is designated State Route 166, west of U.S. 101,
and connects Santa Maria to Guadalupe to the west and unincorporated areas of Santa
Barbara County to the east. Main Street also has an interchange with U.S. 101.
Stowell Road is four lanes in width throughout the City as far west as Blosser Road.
Betteravia Road traverses the City one-mile south of Stowell Road. It provides access to
Casmalia to the west and Garey and Sisquoc to the east.
McCoy Lane and Battles Road are important with respect to their potential to be developed
as east-west arterials. McCoy Lane presently runs from “A” Street (west of Skyway Drive)
to the eastern boundary of the City limits where it terminates. Battles Road extends from
”A” Street eastward to Bradley Road.
Although the future expansion of Union Valley Parkway east of State Route 135 is to be
developed in the unincorporated area of Santa Barbara County, it is anticipated that it will
help reduce volumes of traffic on streets within the City. The planned roadway will extend
from U.S. 101 to South Blosser Road. (Resolution 2009-40; Resolution 2011-111)
Circulation Problems
Analyses of the existing roadways indicate that modifications and improvements are
required to adequately accommodate projected transportation demand associated with
build out of the Land Use Element of the General Plan. Based on these findings, present
and anticipated problems that this Circulation Element addresses are:
      Improvement of north/south street continuity to provide additional roadway
       alternatives to reduce traffic "bottlenecks" and provide adequate, uniform capacities
       on each street.
      Provision of alternative east/west roadway routes, and the improvement of the U.S.
       101 ramp intersections with Main Street, Broadway, McCoy Lane, and Union Valley
       Parkway.
      Extension of arterial and collector street system to serve anticipated development
       areas.
      Internal traffic circulation within and through new and existing subdivisions to
       provide for circulation continuity and prevent isolation of individual developments.
Existing Roadway Classification System (Resolution 2011-111)
The classification system establishes a hierarchy of streets in terms of their function in
carrying through traffic (i.e., providing mobility) versus accommodating access to fronting
properties via driveways. This classification system consists of the following facility types:
      Freeway - Reserved for limited access, uncontrolled, grade separated facilities, this
       classification includes U.S. 101. The Freeway provides a high degree of mobility
       with no direct land access.
                                               C-5

       Primary Arterial - Primary Arterials will continue to provide mobility with intermittent
        access to Secondary Arterials with minimal direct land access.
       Secondary Arterial - Secondary Arterials provide mobility via access to Collector
        Roads and some Local Streets and accommodate access to major traffic-
        generating land uses.
       Collector Road - The Collector Road connects Local Streets with Secondary
        Arterials and, occasionally, Primary Arterials, and also provides access to major
        land uses.
       Local Street - Local Streets provide access to adjacent land uses as well as access
        to Collector Roads.
       Minor Streets - Minor Streets provide access to adjacent land uses as well as to
        Local Streets and, occasionally, Collector Roads. Minor Streets occur only within
        and serve only residentially-zoned properties.
       Roundabouts - Roundabouts are circular intersections that feature, among other
        important geometric components, a central island, a circulatory roadway, and
        splitter islands on each approach. Key to the proper implementation of these
        facilities is the understanding that roundabouts rely upon two basic and important
        principles:
        1. Speed reduction through the facility, achieved through geometric design,
            which assures optimal operational benefits and safety enhancement; and,
        2. The yield-at-entry rule, which requires traffic entering the intersection to yield
            to traffic that is traveling in the circulatory roadway when conflicts occur
            between them.
Existing Transportation System and Service
Transportation technology and needs in California have changed greatly, with emphasis on
the development of a balanced multi-modal transportation system. This section discusses
the non-highway components of the City's Circulation System. This includes local and
intercity bus service, taxis, railroads (passenger and freight service), aviation,
pedestrian/equestrian facilities, and bike facilities.
Public Bus System
The City provides four types of public transportation services. Santa Maria Area Transit
(SMAT) is the local bus service that operates in Santa Maria and Orcutt. The Breeze is the
intercity service that operates between Santa Maria, Lompoc, and Vandenberg Air Force
Base. ADA Paratransit is the complementary paratransit for persons with disabilities. The
Clean Air Express (CAE) is the interregional service that operates between Santa Maria,
Lompoc, Goleta, and Santa Barbara. SMAT administers services through the Public
Works Department and a private transportation contractor provides drivers, mechanics,
dispatchers, and other personnel to operate the service. The City’s Finance Department
provides accounting services. The City’s Finance Department and Transit Division
coordinates regional, state, and federal reports.
                                               C-6

Intercity Service
Intercity bus service is provided by the Greyhound/Trailways Corporation. Buses run daily
in each direction, subject to seasonal variation, run along this north-south corridor and pass
through Santa Maria, utilizing Broadway and Main Street between the bus terminal and
US-101. These buses serve other communities at various frequencies. Daily service to
the following cities is available:
        Northbound                    Southbound
        Arroyo Grande                 Los Alamos
        Pismo Beach                   Vandenberg AFB
        Shell Beach                   Lompoc
        San Luis Obispo               Buellton
        Paso Robles                   Goleta
        Salinas                       Santa Barbara
        San Jose                      Oxnard
        San Francisco                 Los Angeles
                                      San Diego
Taxi Services
Taxi cabs operate within the City and are stationed at taxi stands, primarily within the
central business district, the bus terminal, and at the Santa Maria Airport.
RAIL SYSTEM (Resolution 2011-111)
Passenger Service
Amtrak service utilizes the coastal north-south corridor, but does not serve Santa Maria.
Northbound passengers generally utilize the San Luis Obispo terminal, whereas
southbound passengers use either the San Luis Obispo or Santa Barbara terminal. Trains
travel once a day in each direction and do not pass through the planning area. In addition,
curbside stops of Amtrak buses occur in the 100 block of South Nicholson Avenue. San
Diego service was extended to Santa Barbara in 1990 with one train in each direction daily.
Freight Service
The only local railroad within the planning area is the Santa Maria Valley Railroad
(SMVRR), which deals only with local freight operations. Its eight-mile line runs from the
Southern Pacific Line in Guadalupe to the west to the Santa Maria River near Garey to the
east. The tracks bisect the planning area, passing through the urban area along Jones
Street. There is one spur track to the Santa Maria Airport, along Railroad Avenue.
Freight trains operate along the SMVRR tracks up to six times daily, carrying shipments of
food and raw materials for use in manufacturing.
                                               C-7
PEDESTRIAN/EQUESTRIAN MOVEMENTS
Trails and Paths
The City of Santa Maria is generally well served by a system of sidewalks for everyday and
recreational uses. Most sidewalks contain ramps for handicapped access. In older areas
of the City, sidewalks and curb-cuts are being added as new developments are
constructed. The City has installed a pedestrian bridge across Broadway to provide easier
access between the Town Center Mall and the west side of the street. In addition to the
urban sidewalk, the City also offers a number of off-street pedestrian facilities for hiking and
recreational uses. Trails are planned along the Santa Maria Levee and parks, special use
areas, and specialized recreation areas throughout the City. Equestrian facilities are
currently available at Los Flores Ranch Park.
AVIATION (Resolution 2011-111)
Commercial Aviation
Scheduled passenger airline service is provided primarily by airlines of a commuter nature.
 Their schedule consist of multiple daily flights serving Santa Maria which stop at major hub
airports, such as Los Angeles International or San Francisco International, to "feed" other
domestic and international flights. This service is generally provided by twin-engine
turbo-prop or regional jet aircraft which seat between 30 and 50 passengers. In addition
airline service is provided on a less frequent basis by airlines serving leisure destinations
on a multiple flights per week basis on larger jet aircraft which seat 150 or more
passengers. Air cargo service is provided by Federal Express, and Ameriflight (UPS)
utilizing both single and twin engine turbo prop aircraft.
General Aviation
The airport offers facilities for general aviation pilots by providing tie-down spaces and
hangars for small aircraft. Approximately 200 aircraft are based at Santa Maria.
GOODS MOVEMENT
Motorized Transport
Due to Santa Maria's agricultural and industrial economic base, trucks comprise a
significant percentage of the City's traffic. Approximately eight percent of the average daily
traffic (on state routes) in Santa Maria involves the use of trucks for goods movement.
                                                C-8
Truck traffic may range higher on facilities that provide access to agricultural or industrial
areas near the airport and west of the City (i.e., Main Street, Stowell Road, Betteravia
Road and Clark Avenue). However, count data reflecting this information was not
available. Truck-related congestion was observed at several key intersections including
the Betteravia Road and U.S. 101 interchange (northbound and southbound ramps), the
Betteravia Road and Broadway intersection and vicinity, the Knudsen Way and Blosser
Road intersection and vicinity, the Betteravia Road and Blosser Road intersection and
vicinity, and the Hanson Way and Main Street intersection and vicinity. These facilities,
among others in the City, are either centrally located in industrial/agricultural areas or are
along access corridors to these areas. The City currently does not have a designated
truck-route system plan.
Non-Motorized Transport
A natural gas pipeline system in the City of Santa Maria runs north-south near Railroad
Avenue. The Union Oil Corporation (UNOCAL) operates an oil pipeline that runs east-west
along the Battles Road corridor. Transmission lines are distributed throughout the City, with
a major line running north-south near Railroad Avenue. Water and sewage distribution
systems criss-cross the City on a grid-like pattern serving residential, agricultural, industrial,
and commercial users.
PARKING
Downtown
On-street parking is generally permitted on all streets in downtown Santa Maria, with the
exception of the vicinity of the Town Center Mall. There is also two municipal off-street
parking lots downtown. One is at the Town Center East, the other at Town Center West.
A new three-story parking structure has been constructed at Town Center East
Commercial Center.
On-Street
Parking is permitted on most streets as regulated. There are no meters in any of the
commercial areas.
Off-Street
Off-street parking standards are established in the City's zoning ordinance. The amount of
parking required depends on the type and tenure of the land uses. Free off-street parking
is generally provided by all businesses in their own private lots.
                                              C-9
Park-and-Ride (Resolution 2011-111)
Three Caltrans park-and-ride lots with a total of 77 spaces have been constructed near the
interchange of Route 135 and Clark Avenue and Route 101 (east side) and Clark Avenue.
These lots are used almost exclusively by Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB) workers.
Park-and-ride lots in Arroyo Grande (75 spaces) and Pismo Beach (20 spaces) are
available for use by San Luis Obispo County residents who work in Santa Maria.
Presently, these lots are fully utilized.
BIKE ROUTE SYSTEM (Resolution 2009-168)
Figure C-2 shows the existing and proposed Bikeways Diagram. The City of Santa Maria
Bikeway Master Plan is designed to provide reasonable access from existing and proposed
residential areas to commercial centers, social centers, and public recreation lands. The
Plan is not intended to prohibit or inhibit bicycle riding on any public street, but to establish
purposeful bikeways, either by physical facilities or by traffic signs and pavement markings,
in those corridors of existing or potential demand.
                                                C-10
                                      III. CIRCULATION PLAN
The Santa Maria Circulation Plan provides for a comprehensive transportation system to
serve the travel needs of the community. It is a long-range plan which anticipates future
population growth of the City, and a plan for maintenance of existing streets, modifications
to roads, intersections, and interchanges, and the construction of new streets to keep pace
with future development. The Circulation Plan identifies goals, policies, and programs
applicable to roads and highways, transit, light rail service, airports, pipelines, and public
utilities and facilities.
Roads and Highway System
Streets constitute a City's primary transportation corridors. They allow cars, buses,
motorcycles, delivery vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians to move throughout the City.
Therefore, long-term maintenance and improvements to the street system benefit all forms
of transportation.
The Circulation Plan (Figure C-1) depicts the master plan for roads and highways in the
City of Santa Maria. It identifies improvements to streets, intersections, and interchanges;
and plans for the construction of new streets to provide adequate circulation in Santa
Maria. Goals, policies, and programs related to roads and highways are outlined in Section
IV.
Master Plan for Roads and Highways (Resolution 2011-111)
As shown on Figure C-1, the Master Plan classifies streets by type and travel direction.
While this Plan is comprehensive and generally accurate as of January 1, 2011, it is not an
exhaustive listing of every street segment shown on Figure C-1. Accordingly, the following
list identifies most of the streets shown in the Circulation Plan.

SANTA MARIA BIKEWAY MASTER PLAN (Bicycle/Pedestrian Transportation)
(Resolution 2007-157 amendments were superseded by Resolution 2009-168)
The Bikeway Master Plan establishes an extensive network of bikeways to serve a variety
of transportational and recreational uses in Santa Maria. The Plan also identifies goals,
policies, programs and standards for the implementation of safe, efficient and convenient
bikeways.
The Bikeway Master Plan Existing and Proposed Bikeways Plan (Figure C-2) identifies
bike routes, bike lanes and bike paths along several existing and planned streets within the
General Plan area. (Resolution 2011-111)
Rail Transportation (Resolution 2011-111)
As the population of the Santa Maria Valley grows, the City of Santa Maria will continue to
promote the use of alternative modes of transportation to relieve traffic congestion and
improve air quality. Trains (light rail) are among the most energy-efficient transportation
modes ever developed. Their environmental impact is far less than that of trucks and
buses, and they provide affordable transportation for people without cars.
Amtrak utilizes Southern Pacific Railroad's coastal north-south line but does not directly
serve the City of Santa Maria. Passengers from Santa Maria must travel north to the City
of San Luis Obispo (30 miles) or south to Santa Barbara (60 miles) to use the Amtrak
trains. However, curbside stops of Amtrak buses occur in the 100 block of South Nicholson
Avenue.
An Amtrak terminal was constructed in Guadalupe. The terminal consists of an 800-foot
platform, information kiosk with arrival and departure times, and parking.
The City of Santa Maria will continue to support the phased implementation of a light rail
transportation network as delineated in Figure C-3. The light rail transportation system will
serve the community in two ways. It will provide an alternative mode of transportation
linking the predominantly residential areas in the north to the employment and activity
centers surrounding the Santa Maria Public Airport District in the south. The routes include
connection to the downtown retail district from the main north/south route utilizing Church
Street to the mall and returning west on Cypress Street to the main north-south route. The
light rail station will also connect the City of Santa Maria to the Amtrak terminal in the City
of Guadalupe.
                                                 C-13
The light rail transportation network will utilize the Santa Maria Valley Railroad right-of-way
(ROW). The phased implementation may include the existing use of freight service, future
uses such as open space corridor, bicycle/jogging path, and fixed bus route within the
ROW, and ultimately a light rail. The existing and future uses are complimentary and
should be encouraged to remain in perpetuity.
The Land Use Element (LUE) is proposed to be amended to allow for high density mixed
use areas that are contiguous to the planned light rail system.
Air Transportation (Resolution 2011-111)
The Santa Maria Public Airport District (SMPAD) serves the aviation needs of the City of
Santa Maria public and nearby communities in both Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo
Counties. The Airport's district encompasses 400 square miles, extending from the Santa
Maria River to a point three miles south of Los Alamos; and from Point Sal at the Pacific
Ocean to 10 miles east of the dam at Twitchell Reservoir. The Airport is operated by the
Santa Maria Public Airport District. By 2012, the main runway (12/30) will be extended to
8,000 feet and all navigation electronics will be upgraded.
Principal activities at the airport consist of the passenger terminal, four primary fixed base
operators, general aviation sales and repair, and aviation and non-aviation storage.
Aircraft operations at the airport include scheduled airline flights, general aviation, and
limited military activity.
Santa Maria Public Airport typically handles less than 100,000 annual operations. This is
projected to increase proportionally with both economic and population growth within the
City and surrounding areas. The Santa Maria Airport has a capacity for up to 230,000
which is sufficient to accommodate future planned growth. The number of enplaned and
deplaned passengers (actual people onboard) increased from 76,218 in 1980 to 85,681 in
2009. This represents an annual rate increase of 8.4 percent during this period of time. To
accommodate the projected increase in commercial and general aviation activity, the
Master Plan identifies several improvements: (1) providing additional runway capacity
when actual traffic reaches the forecast volume of aircraft operations; (2) expanding the
passenger terminal and parking to keep up with the actual growth of passenger traffic; and
(3) increasing general aviation aircraft storage and service facilities. Implementation of
these improvements will allow the Santa Maria Public Airport to achieve its objectives of
accommodating the projected growth in all phases of aviation demand in the region;
providing optimum air transportation in terms of reliability, convenience and safety; and
protecting the opportunity to make the airport compatible with the community.
The Santa Maria Public Airport is also a primary focal point of the City's
commercial/industrial sector as a majority of the City's industrial land uses are located at or
near the airport. The SMPA comprises approximately 2,561 acres (excluding Skyway
Industrial Park). The SMPA has the potential to be developed as a major regional
employment center within the Central Coast.
                                                 C-14
At full buildout, the Santa Maria Airport Business Park Specific Plan is anticipated to
generate up to approximately three million square feet of industrial and commercial
development resulting in approximately 6,000 to 13,000 jobs. As part of the specific plan, a
circulation plan was prepared to analyze local and regional traffic constraints. The Santa
Maria Circulation Plan (Figure C-1) incorporates the circulation improvements identified in
the Santa Maria Airport Business Park Specific Plan. In conjunction with development of
airport property, the SMPAD will be responsible for roadway improvements to Foster Road,
Skyway Drive, Fairway and Union Valley Parkway. The District will also be responsible for
intersection improvements in the immediate area. These roadway and intersection
improvements will accommodate the projected traffic and maintain or improve roadway and
intersection operating conditions to acceptable levels.
Bus Transportation (Resolution 2011-111)
The City prepares a Short Range Transit Plans (or update) that evaluates the operating
and financial health of the City public transportation services. The SRTP will make
recommendations as to capital and service improvements that reflect the needs of the
community. The community has the opportunity to provide input on the draft SRTP prior to
adoption by the City Council.
The Short-Range Transit Plan outlines several things that can be done to accommodate
the anticipated increase in transit ridership demand. These include: (1) Increasing the
productivity of existing services; and (2) Increasing vehicle service hours by increasing the
service frequencies of existing and adding new routes.
The service plan in the Short-Range Transit Plan also identifies several new elements that
will be phased into the Santa Maria Area Transit system. They are as follows:
     1. Design and construction of a transit center at the southeast corner of Boone Street
        and Miller Street. The transit center will accommodate eighteen full-size buses.
        (Resolution 2008-163)
     2. Establishment of a new route to serve Hancock College, Costco, Toys R Us, the
        theater complex, new professional offices along Shepard Way, the developing area
        between Betteravia and Battles Road and the County Government Center.
     3. A new fixed-route service for the Orcutt area.
     4. Efforts to attract new commuter ridership. This includes the development of an inter-
        city bus service between San Luis Obispo and Santa Maria.
     5. A transition will be made from loop routes to two-way service for most routes.
                                               C-15
Transit Corridor (Resolution 2011-111)
Recent State legislation encourages coordination of land use planning and
transportation planning, by locating mixed-use development in proximity to transit
corridors. Under certain circumstances, such mixed-use projects may be found exempt
from State environmental review.
Anticipating the adoption of a Sustainable Communities Strategy by the Santa Barbara
County Association of Governments (Government Code Section 65080(b)(2)), Figure C-
4 presents a possible Transit Corridor for coordinating future land use/transportation
planning for the City. The California Environmental Quality Act (Section 21155 of the
Public Resources Act) authorizes the City to designate “High Quality Transit Corridors”
within the Circulation Element, and Figure C-4 may assist this effort. According to
Section 21155(b) of the Public Resources Code; a “high-quality transit corridor means a
corridor with fixed bus route service with service intervals no longer than 15 minutes
during peak commute hours.”
Under Section 21155.1 of the Public Resources Code, a mixed use project meeting
certain criteria and located within a “high-quality transit corridor” may be exempt from
environmental review under the California Environmental Quality Act.
                                            C-16

                         IV. GOALS, POLICIES AND PROGRAMS
As a means of implementing the Circulation Plan, goals, objectives, policies, and
implementation programs have been developed to assist the policy makers and City staff in
making future transportation decisions.
GOAL C.1 Comprehensive Transportation System
To provide and maintain a comprehensive transportation system that provides for the safe
and efficient transport of people and goods throughout the City.
POLICY C.1.a Acceptable Levels of Service
The City shall maintain an acceptable peak-hour level of service on all arterials and
collectors and at signalized intersections. Service Level "D" on all roadways and at all
signalized intersections shall be the levels maintained.
For long-range development plans, Level of Service D need not be strictly maintained if
other policies and action plans indicate that a lesser level of service may be acceptable on
a short-term basis providing there are sufficient over-riding considerations.
With regard to property within the boundaries of the Downtown Specific Plan, a project
which exceeds vehicle trip generation thresholds determined by the City of Santa Maria
shall complete a traffic study in accordance with the requirements of the Public Works
Director/City Engineer. The project shall implement the recommendations of the study so
that all intersections operate at a Level Of Service (LOS) D or better. If the Director of the
Community Development Department and the Director of the Public Works
Department/City Engineer determine that the recommendations of the study are not

SECTION I
INTRODUCTION
A.      PREFACE
The Land Use Element (LUE) designates the placement and distribution of future
development and allows orderly growth to occur in the City. The LUE establishes future
land use patterns and specifies the appropriate residential 1 density and development
2
  intensity. Basic policies that relate to land use are identified and serve as a guide for
decision-makers (City Council and Planning Commission) to direct the development of the
City. In addition, the Land Use Element provides an overall design framework for the City
to administer and implement the General Plan.
The Santa Maria Land Use Element fulfills the requirements of the State Planning Act and
the regulations in Section 65300 et seq. of the Government Code of the State of
California. Section 65302(a) of the Government Code states that the Land Use Element
must contain the following:
      A design of the proposed general location, distribution, and extent of land uses,
        including land for housing, business, industry, open space, agriculture, natural
        resources, recreation, and enjoyment of scenic beauty, education, public buildings
        and grounds, solid and liquid waste disposal facilities, and other categories of
        public and private 3 land use.
      A statement concerning the standards of population density and building intensity
        recommended in those areas covered by this plan.
      The identification and annual review of land uses in those areas subject to flooding.
Additionally, the Land Use Element must conform with (or adopt) the Santa Barbara
County Hazardous Waste Management Plan and implement the provisions of the Surface
Mining and Reclamation Act. Each of these state laws requires the City to include specific
goals and policies in the General Plan as they relate to the topics of concern.
The existing Land Use Element was adopted by the City Council on February 21, 1978.
The text was reformatted in April 1987, and incorporated amendments made through April
21, 1987. This text updates the current Land Use Element and provides new, appropriate
4
  goals, 5 policies, and 6 implementation programs guiding the City's development.

B.      INTRODUCTION
The Land Use Element for the City of Santa Maria represents the efforts of the City staff,
the Planning Commission, the City Council, and the local citizens to plan the physical
development of the Santa Maria 7 Planning Area. The Planning Area encompasses the
City, the 8 Sphere of Influence, and areas outside the Sphere of Influence but where
decisions made within the area could affect City interests. In general, the Planning Area
encompasses the City of Santa Maria and the urbanized areas of Orcutt and Tanglewood,
as well as the land between and immediately adjacent to these developed areas. The
Sphere of Influence is the probable 20-year boundary of the City as approved by the Local
Agency Formation Commission ( 9 LAFCO). Decisions made by the City will affect the
residents and businesses within the sphere area.
The Land Use Element presents a plan that reflects Santa Maria's social and economic
needs and promotes maximum livability as the community continues to develop. In
addition, the LUE, in conjunction with other elements of the General Plan, strives to
minimize the community's exposure to the adverse influences associated with urban
development such as flood hazard, seismic activity, air quality impacts, traffic and
circulation hazards, and land use conflicts. Specifically, the LUE serves to:
        a.)    Set forth, in general but meaningful terms, the goals of the City for future
               development.
        b.)    Promote a balanced and functional mix of land uses consistent with
               community values.
        c.)    Guide public and private investments.
        d.)    Reflect the opportunities and constraints affecting land use identified in
               other elements of the General Plan.
        e.)    Reduce the loss of life, injury, damage to property, and economic and social
               dislocation resulting from flooding.
        f.)    Inform the public regarding the land use policies of the City.
        g.)    Set forth the basic policies for dealing with land use problems and
               responding to the opportunities for positive growth and development. These
               policies are a statement of how the City intends to approach development
               questions as they present themselves.
        h.)    Establish the different land use classifications for lands within the City's
               Sphere of Influence and provide desired land use activities.
        i.)    Apply land use classifications to specific geographic locations, thus
               providing a basis for appropriate specific zoning.
                                              LU-2
C.      PLANNING PERIOD
The Land Use Element is intended to serve as the community's basic land use strategy
for the next 20 years. The planning period should not be viewed as the time span in
which ultimate development, as addressed in the Land Use Policy Map, will occur.
Further, the 20 year planning period is not the time span in which all the goals and
10
   objectives of the element will be achieved.
D.      ASSUMPTIONS
The Land Use Element makes certain assumptions which have great bearing on the
development of the land use goals and policies of the City. The assumptions about the
planning area are those factors or influences on the Planning Area that are in a sense
"givens" over which the community has little control or which reflect long-standing
attitudes about Santa Maria and its physical development. The assumptions also reflect
the evaluation of present and future trends, as well as the availability of information
relevant to the 11 planning process.
The assumptions that form the basis for the Land Use Element are:
1.      The quality of life in Santa Maria can be improved by the maximum participation of
        citizens and public officials in a concerted planning effort.
2.      The City and County will work with increased coordination toward common goals in
        guiding future development in the Sphere of Influence and Planning Area. Both
        entities exercise substantial influence over development decisions, but individual
        actions taken must be in concert with mutually established goals.
3.      The City will pursue a policy of accommodating growth compatible with adopted
        social, economic, and environmental objectives.
4.      The State Water Project may be constructed to provide water to the valley within
        the planning period.
5.      Development will pay its own way for infrastructure.
6.      The 12 capital improvement programming necessitated by the community's
        development can be undertaken in accordance with this LUE.
7.      The basic procedures and tools to accommodate the community's growth and
        development will be substantially the same as they are now and will include the
        13
           Specific Plan process.

8. The most significant focus of the 1992 General Plan was the proposed
   annexation of Sphere of Influence Target Areas 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, and Alternative
   Areas A, B, and C. The majority of these identified areas have been
   subsequently annexed into the City limits. Alternative Areas B and C, and the
   remaining portions of Sphere of Influence Target Areas 7 and 9, shown on
   Exhibits LU-2 and LU-3, remain as potential annexation areas. (Resolution 2011-
   111)

SECTION II
PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS AND FINDINGS
As development occurs, provision of adequate infrastructure capacity is essential for
assisting growth in Santa Maria. Future development in the City, Sphere of Influence, and
Planning Area will depend on the availability of vacant land and urban services in order to
meet development needs. This section of the Land Use Element addresses these issues,
as well as growth management.
A.      FINDINGS
The City's ability to sustain growth depends on the capacity of resources, municipal
services, and the availability of land.
1.      LAND AVAILABILITY/ANNEXATION HISTORY (Resolution 2011-111)
        The most significant focus of the 1992 General Plan was the proposed
        annexation of unincorporated land adjacent to the City. The majority of areas
        identified for annexation by the 1992 General Plan have been subsequently
        annexed into the City limits. Furthermore, the majority of those annexed areas
        have been approved for development through the Specific Plan process; many of
        these plans have been implemented through development. The following Table
        presents the 1992 Sphere of Influence Target and Alternative Areas, and the
        corresponding Specific Plan approved since 1993.

                                     Adopted
For the remainder of the area that has not been annexed, Exhibits LU-2 and LU-3
provide direction for the future land uses. For those areas, the City will continue to
process annexation requests from individual property owners, in a manner consistent
with State annexation laws, and these Policies.
2.      WATER SUPPLY (Resolution 2011-111)
        The City obtains its water from the following sources: groundwater from the Santa
        Maria Groundwater Basin; purchased imported water from the State Water Project;
        and the associated return flows that are recaptured by the Basin and assigned
        rights to augmented yield from the Twitchell Reservoir. The imported water
        supplies for the City are obtained from the State Water Project via a contract with
        the Central Coast Water Authority. Groundwater is pumped from a total of eight
        wells in the Santa Maria Groundwater basin. The City’s wells have a current total
        normal year active capacity of approximately 24,900 acre-feet per year. The City’s
        rights to rely on Basin water resources are governed by a Stipulation approved by
        the Santa Clara County Superior Court.
                                             LU-6

   City’s water resources are 49,710 acre-feet in both normal and dry water years.
   This quantity of water greatly exceeds the City’s present usage of approximately
   14,700 acre-feet annually. It also exceeds the projected City water use of
   approximately 19,000 acre-feet to support the built out population of approximately
   120,000. Agriculture consumes 80 percent of the water used in the Santa Maria
   Valley. It is expected that agriculture's share of water use will remain constant or
   decline slightly in the future, while urban use will expand.
   The current Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) present in the water delivered to the
   customer is approximately 500 parts per million (ppm). The maximum federal limit
   for municipal water TDS is 500 ppm, and the state limit is 1,000 ppm. The high
   TDS originates with the groundwater in the Santa Maria Basin, which is high in
   TDS.
   High-quality water delivery is a high priority goal of the City. The City is
   implementing conservation measures to conserve high-quality State water for
   delivery to our customers and investigating new sources of high-quality water. The
   City is implementing the ”Leakwatch” Real-Time Radio Metering Program to
   conserve water and provide cost savings to the ratepayers. The City’s Secondary
   Water System Project involves the construction of a water system that delivers only
   groundwater to irrigation systems with large amounts of landscaping such as parks
   and schools. By watering plants with lower quality groundwater, the City is able to
   preserve high-quality State water for our customers. The City has and will continue
   to purchase more high-quality State water to blend with our groundwater. State
   water deliveries can fluctuate due to climate and environmental issues. The City is
   investigating groundwater treatment (reverse osmosis) as a method to maintain the
   high quality of our water supply during years of low delivery of State Water.
3. SEWAGE SYSTEM (Resolution 2011-111)
   The City of Santa Maria provides wastewater collection, treatment and disposal
   services for most of the City. The Laguna Sanitation District serves the southerly
   areas within the City and most unincorporated areas south of Santa Maria. The
   City’s Waste Water Treatment Plant is located on the west side of Santa Maria on
   Black Road. The treatment capacity of the Waste Water Treatment Plant was
   expanded to 13.5 million gallons a day in 2010.
   Wastewater treatment processes include bar screens, grit removal, primary
   clarification, roughing filters, trickling filters (biological secondary treatment) and
   secondary clarification. All treated wastewater is discharged to 17 disposal ponds
   located on approximately 120 acres adjacent to the treatment facility. The City has
   acquired 150 acres of additional disposal area in anticipation of future expansion.
   Wastewater solids are anaerobically digested and dried onsite. Some of the treated
   solids, referred to as biosolids, are transported to a privately operated composting
   facility (adjacent to the treatment plant) where they are mixed with green waste and
   converted to soil amendment. The remainder of the biosolids is used for soil
   amendment in the vegetative cover at the Santa Maria Regional Landfill.
                                            LU-7

4. SOLID WASTE (Resolution 2011-111)
   The City of Santa Maria owns and operates a non-hazardous Class III Regional
   Landfill located on the east side of Santa Maria. The City operates a fleet of solid
   waste collection vehicles that collect a majority of solid waste generated in the City
   and brought to the Santa Maria Regional Landfill. Curbside recycling is also
   collected by the City fleet. The recyclables are brought to a privately owned
   Material Recovery Facility for separation and processing by the contractor. The
   City does not currently offer curbside green waste collection but is studying the
   feasibility of implementing such a program Citywide.
   About 100,000 tons of solid waste is buried at the Landfill annually. This amount
   has been decreasing in recent years due to increased diversion activities and as a
   result of waste collection services offered by other competitors. Some of the City’s
   landfill diversion and environmental programs include:
     a.)    Use of non-hazardous Hydrocarbon Impacted Soils for alternative Final
            Cover Foundation layer;
     b.)    Concrete and Asphalt Recycling Program which takes the waste
            concrete/asphalt to be ground up to create a marketable aggregate
            products;
     c.)    Agricultural Plastic Recycling Program which involves separating and baling
            agricultural plastic products for overseas markets;
     d.)    The collection and use of landfill gas to create electricity for the Marian
            Medical Hospital and to sell back to the electrical grid;
     e.)    Household Hazardous Waste Facility which provides residents the
            opportunity for proper disposal of their paints, oils, pesticides, electronic
            waste and other household chemicals; and
     f.)    The Recycling Park which allows the customers to divert wood, metals,
            white goods (appliances), green waste, textiles, inert material (concrete, tile,
            porcelain, brick and masonry), cardboard, tires and other recyclable material
            from being landfilled.
   As of January 1, 2011, the landfill had approximately 8 more years of permitted
   capacity, however only 5 more years exist in the currently utilized portion of the
   landfill. The City is in the process of obtaining approval and permits for a new
   landfill on a City owned property called Los Flores Ranch, south of Santa Maria.
   This landfill will receive solid waste only from commercial size vehicles including
   City Solid Waste collection vehicles, transfer trucks, roll-offs and other commercial
   haulers. All residential sized solid waste loads will continue to be brought to the
   existing landfill site, which will become a future solid waste transfer station for the
   Los Flores landfill.
                                           LU-8

5. STORM WATER (Resolution 2011-111)
   The City of Santa Maria collaborates with the Santa Barbara County Flood Control
   District to manage storm water facilities for the city. Storm water is collected in the
   City and transmitted via storm drain systems to basins west of Santa Maria and the
   Santa Maria River.
   The City also administers the Storm Water Management Plan (SWMP). The
   purpose of the SWMP is to reduce the discharge of pollutants and protect
   downstream water quality. This effort will include implementing low impact
   development standards and hydromodification control on new and redevelopment
   projects.
6. GROWTH MANAGEMENT
   The purpose of this Land Use Element is to assure that the City's goals and
   objectives are achieved, and that the programs outlined in this element can be
   implemented. Therefore, in a sense, the Land Use Element is a form of "growth
   management" by directing growth, in terms of (1) type, (2) location, and (3)
   phasing, to occur in a pattern desired by the City. There are several ways in which
   this LUE can be seen as a growth management program, including the following:
     a.)   Major 14 regional retail commercial uses will continue to be concentrated in
           the central business district so that the downtown remains the urban center
           of the City.
     b.)   Setting service availability standards (i.e. setting specific threshold levels for
           water consumption, sewage discharge, or traffic levels) which are not to be
           exceeded by new development.
     c.)   The adoption of capital improvement programs governing the extension of
           services to assure that all development takes place within areas where
           adequate services are available.
     d.)   Establishing agricultural and industrial 15 reserve lines, which recognize the
           basic economic values in the community, to set aside areas considered
           inappropriate for residential development.
     e.)   Increased coordination between the County and City regarding land use
           decisions to promote balanced and supportive land uses within the Santa
           Maria Valley.
     f.)   Increased coordination between LAFCO and the City. As the need for
           developable land increases, the City will need to amend its Sphere of
           Influence boundary and annex 16 unincorporated land; LAFCO must
           approve all such annexations.
                                          LU-9
        This LUE projects a 3.1 percent annual population growth rate over the next 10-
        year period. If the City's growth rate significantly exceeds 3.1 percent or appears to
        be approaching levels which cannot be supported by existing and planned
        infrastructure, the LUE growth projections will need to be adjusted and other
        elements of the General Plan will also need to be reviewed to assure consistency
        with the LUE. The City may also find it necessary to adopt a growth management
        program. Such a program would be subject to legal requirements and might
        include:
          a.)   Short-term limits on the amount of construction.
          b.)   Increasing new development fees to cover all costs of public improvements.
          c.)   Phase annexations to allow the City infrastructure to "grow into" the next
                phase of annexations.
B.      ADDITIONAL PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS
There are other factors, besides the ability of the City to provide vacant land and urban
services, which are considered in the Land Use Element. These considerations include
the following:
        a.)     Citizen input as a result of public involvement in the development and
                implementation of this LUE.
        b.)     Analysis by the Planning Commission and City Council focusing on their
                special concerns for the planning area.
                                                             17
        c.)     Evaluation of existing and potential            land use conflicts within the
                community.
                              18
        d.)     Evaluation of    development capacity.
        e.)     Application of accepted land use practices. Included in this process is an
                on-going evaluation of the economic determinants which influence the types
                of uses that can be practically developed in a particular location.
C.      DEVELOPMENT CONSTRAINTS
The ability of certain areas to successfully sustain certain types of development is an
important consideration in how land uses are designated within the planning area. The
capability of the land to sustain one use over another is dependent upon physical
suitability of the development types. Considerations for the Santa Maria Planning Area
are mapped in Exhibit LU-4 and include:
1.      Flood Hazard. The planning area has historically experienced flooding and
        drainage problems. Major flooding has been associated with the Santa Maria
        River. The flooding caused by high flows in the Santa Maria River, however, has
        been greatly mitigated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE) levee project
        and Twitchell Reservoir. Exhibit LU-4 presents areas subject to flooding, in
        accordance with Government Code Section 65302(a). (Resolution 2011-111)
                                              LU-10
   Localized flooding has been mitigated, to a major extent, through the joint efforts of
   the City of Santa Maria and the County Flood Control District. Minor localized
   drainage problems exist in the southern portion of the planning area. As
   development takes place in these areas, the drainage problems will be mitigated.
   Lastly, recent Santa Maria subdivision developments have incorporated basins
   serving three purposes: (1) a retardation area reducing the short flow flooding
   problem, (2) surface water recharging to the Orcutt aquifer, and (3) landscaped
   recreational open space.
2. Prime Agricultural Land. Agriculture and its related industry represent a significant
   segment of the Santa Maria Valley’s economic base. The continued availability of
   19
      prime agricultural land is important for the continued prosperity of the area.
   Historically, the Santa Maria planning area had developed without considering the
   importance of agricultural lands. Development incompatible with agricultural
   operations had been permitted to take place on and adjacent to agricultural lands.
   This process not only acted to take the land being developed out of production but
   the process impacted adjoining agricultural land as well, due to the difficulties
   associated with fertilizer and pesticide application close to urban development.
   In 1994 the City Council resolved these impacts by directing certain specific areas
   outside the City’s Sphere of Influence to be “retained as agricultural and open
   space uses” (City Council Resolution 94-9).
   Future development should take place so as to minimize the intrusive effects of the
   development on the agricultural lands. These effects can be minimized by
   providing a 20 buffer between residential and agricultural uses. Deep lots and
   fencing can also help mitigate the encroachment. (Resolution 2011-111)
3. Noise Impact Areas. Areas have been identified in the City's adopted Noise
   Element (1987) and updated in the 1989 adopted noise contours for the Santa
   Maria Public Airport (2005) as experiencing noise problems or having the potential
   for future problems. This indication limits the desirable uses or indicates the need
   for mitigation measures in these areas.
   The City should not permit residential uses in close proximity to the airport,
   allowing the airport to exist and expand as a strong economic factor in the region's
   economic growth.
4. Air Traffic Impact Areas. These areas, due to their proximity to the Santa Maria
   Public Airport, should be developed with uses not susceptible to aircraft noise and
   so as not to create a safety hazard. If these areas are improperly developed, the
   operations of the airport would be adversely impacted. Developments should be
   consistent with the Santa Barbara County Airport Land Use Commission Areas I, II,
   and III where applicable.
                                         LU-11

5.      Soil Hazard. The soils found in the Planning Area do not generally present a
        development constraint. There are, however, localized pockets of expansive and
        compressible-collapsible soils in the southern portion of the Planning Area.
        Development in these areas may require special building designs. (A more
        thorough discussion of soils can be found in the Safety Element of this General
        Plan.)
        A portion of the planning area is underlain by soils extremely susceptible to soil
        blowing. Development in these areas may cause excessive soil blowing unless
        mitigation measures are taken.
6.      Air Quality. The climatological conditions found in the Santa Maria Air Basin are
        conducive to the formation of inversion layers which trap pollutants and prevent
        dispersal.
        The Santa Maria area exceeded the state ozone standards (10 parts per million)
        on three occasions since 1987. The more serious air quality problem involves
        airborne particulate (PM10). Most of Santa Maria's airborne particulate are
        generated by local agricultural uses. Santa Maria's annual PM10 average hovers
        near the California state standard of 50 micrograms per cubic meter, with the
        average annual level of PM10 exceeding state standards on twelve days in the
        three years surveyed (1987 - 1989). The ozone monitor is located at 500 South
        Broadway, while the PM10 monitor is on the library roof at 420 South Broadway.
        In order to reduce large-scale degradation of the local air quality, it will remain
        necessary to place controls and constraints on certain types of development to limit
        the generation of both ozone and PM10 pollutants.
D.      CHARACTERISTICS OF EXISTING LAND USES (Resolution 2011-111)
As of January 1, 2011, the City of Santa Maria encompasses approximately 15,094 acres
or 23.5 square miles. Approximately 37 percent (5,563 acres) of the total land area of the
City is designated for residential use. Commercial and office uses account for about 10
percent (1,533 acres); industrial/airport service designations account for 23 percent (3,438
acres) of the total land area in the City. The distribution of existing land uses is provided
in Table LU-1.
                                            LU-12

1.      Residential. Approximately 36.8 percent of the City's total land area is designated
        for residential uses. Of these lands, about 542 acres of vacant residential land
        remains in the City. There are five residential classifications established in the
        LUE. These categories include Residential Agricultural (up to 2 dwelling units per
        acre), Low Density Residential (up to 5 dwelling units per acre), Low Medium
        Density Residential (5 to 8 dwelling units per acre), Medium Density Residential
        (up to 12 dwelling units per acre), and High Density Residential (12 to 22 dwelling
        units with senior housing allowed at up to 30 dwelling units per acre). Senior
        housing is allowed in Commercial Professional Office.
2.      Commercial and Office. Commercial and office land uses account for 10.1 percent
        of the City's total land area; about 37.7 percent of these designations totaling about
        579 acres are vacant. Commercial and office activities are scattered across the
        City. Broadway from the northern boundary of the City to Santa Maria Way
        provides the longest strip of commercial activity in the City. Often, office uses are
        used to buffer the commercial uses from nearby residential areas. Other streets
        include Betteravia Road, Donovan Road, Main Street, and Stowell Road with other
        commercial sites scattered throughout the City.
3.      Industrial and Airport Service. Developed industrial and airport service land uses
        occupy approximately 1,620 acres in the City. This is about 10.7 percent of the
        City's total land area; about 1,818 acres remain vacant and undeveloped. A large
        percentage of the vacant industrial land is controlled by the Santa Maria Public
        Airport. Industrial activities are not concentrated in one area; rather, they are
        scattered throughout the City. Airport service land uses are located in and around
        the airport. Major industrial areas are located west of Broadway to the western
        City limit between Carmen Lane and McCoy Lane; south of the airport near the
        Foster Road and Blosser Road intersection; and along Skyway Drive near the
        airport. Other areas are small and located near residential districts.
                                              LU-13
4.      Public. Public facilities include government building sites, public hospitals, schools,
        and government maintenance yards. These uses account for 8.1 percent of the
        City's total land area.
5.      Open Space. The City currently operates community and neighborhood parks.
        These facilities include Preisker, Oakley, Atkinson, Rice, Tunnel, Armstrong,
        Russell, Simas, Buena Vista, Adam, and Memorial parks. Additionally, there are a
        few large areas designated open space for the purpose of public health and safety.
        These areas include parts of the Santa Maria Public Airport and the City owned
        sanitary landfill. At this time, open space accounts for 21.7 percent of the City's
        total land area.
        The City adopted the portion of the Santa Barbara County bikeway plan as it
        relates to the City and its Sphere of Influence. Santa Maria's bikeway plan, as
        adopted, calls for an extensive network of routes; however, very few have been
        constructed.
E.   LAND USE CLASSIFICATIONS
Land use classifications have been designed to reflect the range of uses necessary for
the future development of the planning area. The classifications provide for:
1.      The distribution of varying uses throughout the Planning Area as indicated on the
        proposed Land Use Policy Map.
                  21
2.      Specific     zoning which guides development and is used to implement the General
        Plan.
The classifications suggest specific development 22 standards, which are more
appropriately contained in the Zoning Ordinance. As a point of clarification, the Zoning
Ordinance specifies minimum lot sizes allowed in each zoning category, but does not
define allowable residential densities. The General Plan classifications specify the
maximum density allowed per gross acre of land.
The following text defines the 19 land use categories of the General Plan's Land Use
Element.
       OPEN SPACE (OS)
        Purpose. To preserve certain areas for present and future agricultural production,
        protect natural resources, provide for recreation and scenic protection, provide
        scenic areas along railroad rights-of-way, act as an urban agriculture buffer, allow
        mineral extraction, and act as a safety buffer between the urban land uses and the
        levee. It also provides for limited residential uses.
        Types of Uses. There are four types of land uses permitted within this land use
        designation:
                                              LU-14

   AOS I (Primary Agricultural Open Space). Intensive crop agricultural uses. All
      land classified as prime agricultural (Class I and II soils).
   AOS II (Secondary Agricultural Open Space). Less intensive agricultural uses,
      including grazing. Includes some lands that are not prime agricultural, but are
      an agricultural buffer and are not now considered suitable for urban expansion.
   ROS (Recreational Open Space). Includes existing and proposed recreational
      facilities, including neighborhood, community, and regional parks; bikeways;
      equestrian trails; jogging paths; selected public utility and railroad right-of-ways
      and associated uses where the right-of-way corresponds to the adopted
      Bikeways Plan; and publicly owned and operated sanitary landfill operations
      that have the potential for reclamation and development into the
      aforementioned recreational facilities.
   COS (Conservation Open Space). Includes areas subject to flood hazard,
      significant groundwater recharge areas, well farms, areas adjacent to
      creekbeds, areas of surface and sub-surface mineral extraction, levee buffer,
      airport safety areas, and publicly owned landscaped areas.
  Corresponding Zoning. OS, PD overlay.
 COMMUNITY FACILITIES (CF)
  Purpose. To provide for necessary facilities for use by the public.
  Types of Uses. Range of public facilities, including schools and government
  buildings. Open space facilities, such as parks, are classified under "Open Space".
  Corresponding Zoning. PF, PD overlay.
 RESIDENTIAL AGRICULTURAL (RA) (Resolution 2011-111)
  Purpose. To create a transition area between agricultural and strictly urban uses,
  as well as provide for a particular residential lifestyle.
  Types of Uses. Low-density dwelling units with overall (average) density not to
  exceed two du/acre, noncommercial agricultural activities, the keeping of horses
  and certain commercial agricultural activities on larger (suggested minimum of 5- to
  10-acre) parcels.
  Corresponding Zones. R-A, PD (Planned Development) overlay.
                                        LU-15

 LOWER-DENSITY RESIDENTIAL (LWDR-4)
  Purpose. To encourage high quality single-family residential development on
  larger lots.
  Types of Use. Single-family detached dwelling units with overall (average) density
  not to exceed four dwelling units per acre with variable lot sizes for single family
  detached units up to one acre in size.
  Corresponding Zones.           R-A-5, R-1-40,000 to R-1-10,000, PD (Planned
  Development) overlay.
 LOW DENSITY RESIDENTIAL (LDR-5)
  Purpose. To encourage new areas with overall densities responsive to the
  economic considerations of providing new housing, on a wide range of standard
  sized lots, providing the amenities and open spaces associated with traditional
  single-family areas, and stabilizing existing areas by discouraging intensification of
  density.
  Types of Uses. Single-family detached dwelling units with overall (average)
  density not to exceed five 23 dwelling units per acre with variable lot sizes for single-
  family detached units up to one-fourth acre in size.
  Corresponding Zones. R-1, R-1-6,000 to R-1-10,000, RMH, PD overlay.
 LOW MEDIUM DENSITY RESIDENTIAL (LMDR-8)
  Purpose. To encourage densities that are responsive to the economic
  considerations of providing affordable single-family housing on small lots while at
  the same time maintaining adequate individual private open space, design
  flexibility, and the character of a single-family neighborhood.
  Types of Uses. Single-family detached dwelling units with an overall (average)
  density not to exceed eight dwelling units per acre, with variable lot sizes for single-
  family detached units. This development type would usually require zero side yard
  development to maximize private, usable yards. Developments without zero side
  yards may require the larger lots and setbacks typically found in the R-1 zones.
  Corresponding Zoning. RSL-1, RMH, R-1, R-2, PD overlay. (Resolution 94-147)
                                         LU-16

 MEDIUM DENSITY RESIDENTIAL (MDR-12)
  Purpose. To encourage new development while stabilizing existing development.
  Allows a mixture of unit types, while maintaining the feeling of a single-family
  neighborhood. To encourage reinvestment in older areas, and provide a land
  conservation measure by inducing development away from yet undeveloped areas.
  Types of Uses. Single-family, detached and attached, duplexes; triplexes; and
  larger multi-family complexes, with an average density not to exceed 12 dwelling
  units per acre.
  Corresponding Zoning. R-2, PD overlay.
 HIGH DENSITY RESIDENTIAL (HDR-22)
  Purpose. To provide for an urban residential environment, preferably close to
  shopping facilities and existing activity centers, as well as provide an incentive for
  reinvestment in older established areas.
  Types of Uses. Duplexes, triplexes, and larger multi-family complexes, with overall
  density not to exceed 22 dwelling units per acre. Senior Citizen Housing may also
  be permitted to a maximum density of 30 dwelling units per acre.
  Corresponding Zoning. R-3, PD overlay.
 CENTRAL DISTRICT I (CD-I) (Resolution 2011-111)
  Purpose. To accommodate retail, office, and cultural and government activities.
  Pedestrian activity and amenities are encouraged with uses that focus on cultural
  and youth activities, as well as event uses and commercial uses that will service
  government offices while emphasizing markets of local and regional significance.
  Corresponds to area generally thought of as encompassing the Central Business
  District.
  Types of Uses. Office, retail, cultural and government activities.
  Corresponding Zoning. C-1, PD overlay, SP. (Resolution 2008-163)
 CENTRAL DISTRICT II (CD-II) (Resolution 2011-111)
  Purpose. To encourage pedestrian activities and amenities while revitalizing the
  downtown core. A variety of mixed uses within multi-storied buildings with
  residences and office uses located on the upper floors and retail uses located on
  the first floor. An enhanced street environment would create a pleasant walking
  environment.
                                       LU-17

 SPECIFIC PLAN (SP) (Resolution 2011-111)
  Purpose. To encourage comprehensive planning and urban design flexibility for
  large land areas (over 60 acres) through the adoption of a Specific Plan. Such
  flexibility allows the City to adopt a set of land use specifications and
  implementation programs tailored to the unique characteristics of each area. All
  zoning districts may be made a part of the specific plan, however, the
  implementation of each zone must be consistent with the adopted Specific Plan.
  Simultaneous with the application of this Classification to the Land Use Policy Map,
  a specific plan shall be adopted, in accordance with Section 65450 et. seq. of
  California Government Code.
  Types of Uses. The Specific Plan designates all land uses, and the geographic
  boundaries of each use, allowed in the specific plan area. Each use must be
  consistent with the adopted Specific Plan and the corresponding zoning noted in
  the plan.
  Corresponding Zoning. SP and all other zoning districts.
                                        LU-20

F.   LAND USE POLICY MAP (Resolution 2011-111)
The 26 Land Use Policy Map indicates the distribution of the land use classifications
geographically throughout the City, the City's Sphere of Influence, and potential
annexation areas. These recommendations should not be considered as being tied to a
specific time in the future. The specific recommendation in one area may relate to
currently developed uses, while others are oriented to development at an indefinite date in
the future. The City is concerned with next year as well as 10 and 20 years from now.
Thus, if an area is slated for new uses, the City is as concerned about the period of
transition as with establishing ultimate uses. Designations calling for new uses do not
necessarily constitute an abandonment of existing uses.
The Land Use Policy Map depicts the location and extent of land use designations
described in the land use classification section of the Land Use Element. The Land Use
Policy Map reflects the projected anticipated growth which will occur in portions of the
planning and the sphere study areas.
G. SPECIFIC PLANS (Resolution 2011-111)
California Government Code Section 65450 authorizes the City to adopt and maintain
specific plans "for the systematic implementation of the general plan for all or part of the
area covered by the general plan." Following are the fourteen Specific Plans adopted by
the City of Santa Maria, as of January 1, 2010:

                                            LU-21
H.  EXCEPTIONS
There are some exceptions to the General Plan Land Use Policy in regards to residential
density. These exceptions are described briefly in the following paragraphs.
1.     Density in residential General Plan categories may be increased to a maximum of
       25 percent under the provisions of the Government Code of the State of California,
       Chapter 4.3, Density Bonuses and Other Incentives, Sections 65915 through
       65918, or other 27 density bonus programs implemented by the City specifically for
       the provision of low and moderate income housing.
2.     When the City considers a General Plan amendment increasing the allowable
       residential density, the Planning Commission and City Council may specify
       approval of the General Plan amendment, increasing the density subject to the
       provisions of Government Code Sections 65915 through 65918. The intent of this
       provision is to prevent the future request for a 25 percent increase in density in
       accordance with said Government Code sections. The General Plan amendment
       may be conditional to provide a minimum of 25 percent low/moderate income
       housing. This provision would allow the City to adequately plan for future demand
       for required infrastructure.
3.     When the parcel being developed is a parcel less than one acre in size, the density
       may be established by dividing the minimum area specified by the Zoning
       Ordinance per unit into the net parcel size. Net parcel size in this case would be
       the original parcel minus any street, alley, or dedications.
4.     When figuring density, fractional units of 0.8 or greater may be rounded up to the
       next whole number when 5 or more units are permitted on the parcel without using
       the round-up provision.
5.     When a parcel developed with an existing multi-family apartment complex is
       proposed for a condominium conversion, a density bonus of up to 10 percent may
       be provided if the parcel meets the following standards:
        Parcel is designated in the Land Use Element as MDR (Medium Density
           Residential).
        Parcel is located in one of the City's four Special Study areas as shown in the
           Land Use Element of the General Plan.
        Parcel is non-conforming to the General Plan density requirements.
        Parcel is over one acre in size.
        Parcel meets all condominium development standards stated in Chapter 46 of
           Title 12 of the Santa Maria Municipal Code or will be conditioned to meet these
           standards before conversion is approved.
        Parcel was fully constructed prior to January 1, 1994.
                                           LU-22

        If this exception is granted, no additional dwelling units will be allowed on the parcel
        and the density bonus must bring the parcel into conformance with the General
        Plan density requirements.
6.      Medium Density Residential (MDR) land that is presently developed with rental
        assisted, affordable housing for senior or handicapped individuals, or Medium
        Density Residential (MDR) land that is contiguous to and developed in conjunction
        with property with existing affordable senior or handicapped housing, may be
        developed at a density not to exceed 22 dwelling units per acre. This is provided
        that the unit size of proposed dwellings does not exceed 600 square feet, and the
        project is properly conditioned to provide rental assisted, affordable housing for
        both senior and handicapped individuals. (Resolution 94-87)
7.      All Mobile home parks, regardless of general plan classifications or zoning districts,
        shall be allowed a maximum density of ten (10) units per acre. (Resolution 2003-
        142)
I.   REDEVELOPMENT PLANS
The Redevelopment Agency administers the downtown redevelopment program (Town
Center) as well as several programs funded under the Federal Community Development
Block Grant (CDBG) Program. The Santa Maria Town Center involves the commercial
revitalization and redevelopment of the downtown. Improvements on Phases I and II of
the current master plan have been completed.
The next phase of the Town Center involved construction of a covered pedestrian bridge
over Broadway between the east and west sides of the Town Center. Ultimately, the
bridge will serve as a connector to a fifth major department store. (Resolution 2011-111)
In addition to the Santa Maria Town Center, the Redevelopment Agency also administers
the following programs which are primarily financed with Federal CDBG funds.
     Housing Incentives Program. Offers developers a variety of incentives to build
        affordable housing for low and moderate income persons.
     Residential Rehabilitation Loan Program. Subsidizes loans to low income qualified
        homeowners for the repair and improvement of single family dwellings.
     Commercial Facade Rebate Program. Assists commercial property owners with
        financing improvements to building exteriors adjacent to Heritage Walk.
     Non-Profit Facilities Loan Program. Assists non-profit agencies, which primarily
        target low and moderate income persons, to fund rehabilitation, acquisition, or
        construction of public facilities and improvements.
     Public Services Program.           Provides funding to eligible non-profit agencies for
        general operating costs.
                                               LU-23

     Neighborhood Conservation Program. Targets low income neighborhoods (i.e.
        neighborhoods with high crime rates, public improvement deficiencies, significant
        code violations, and generally deteriorating conditions) for concentrated efforts in
        existing City programs.
J.   ZONING ORDINANCE
The City of Santa Maria Zoning Ordinance is a primary mechanism for implementing the
General Plan land use policy. For this reason, state planning law requires the zoning
ordinance to be consistent with General Plan land use policy.
The City of Santa Maria Zoning Ordinance consists of 22 zoning districts, plus three
overlay districts covering six basic zoning categories--residential, commercial, industrial,
public facilities, open space, and airport service.
K.   HISTORIC PRESERVATION
The Land Use Element recognizes the value of preserving older and unusual buildings.
Architectural features that are no longer commonly used in design practice are considered
important to the social fabric of the community and should be encouraged to be preserved
whenever possible. The Land Use Element should not prevent the reasonable economic
use of structures with local historic values which could lead to the replacement of these
historic buildings with modern buildings.
L.   LAND USE CONFLICTS
Land use conflicts arise when development causes undesirable environmental
consequences that affect the surrounding neighborhood such as:
     Noise
     Dust
     Traffic congestion and related parking conflicts
     Lighting
     Visual or aesthetic impacts
     Odor
     Drainage problems
More specific examples of the significant land use conflicts within the planning area which
may occur are:
        a.)     Industrial operations or trucking facilities interspersed with or immediately
                adjacent to residential neighborhoods.
                                             LU-24

        b.)   Heavy commercial activities interspersed with or immediately adjacent to
              residential neighborhoods.
        c.)   Heavy traffic impacting heretofore stable residential neighborhoods.
        d.)   Airport noise impacts.
        e.)   Agricultural related uses impacting adjacent residential development.
M. METHODS OF MITIGATING LAND USE CONFLICTS
There are several ways to mitigate land use conflicts, but most often these methods can
only be practically applied in situations where new development or redevelopment is
occurring. The following describes some common methods to reduce potential land use
conflicts.
        a.)   Use site planning and development standards to minimize any adverse
              effects of the adjacent properties, or its susceptibility to existing adverse
              influences.
        b.)   Separate potentially conflicting uses.
        c.)   Adopt a program to remove uses which cause extreme conflicts.
        d.)   Buffer conflicting uses with other uses which are compatible with both uses.
               In general, such uses are less sensitive to the adverse influences and yet
              do not themselves generate significant adverse impacts.
        Examples of such buffering uses are:
  Conflicting Use                   Buffer                               Conflicting Use
  Commercial                        Office                               Residential
  Low-Density Residential           Large lot Residential                Agricultural
  Commercial                        Institutional                        Residential
  Manufacturing                     Industrial Park                      Residential
  Airport Approach Zone             Agricultural/Open Space              Residential
  Heavy Industrial                  Industrial Park/Open Space           Residential
                                             LU-25

 IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAMS
      1.    Zoning Ordinance. The Zoning Ordinance provides the major means of
            implementing the goals and ordinances of the Land Use Element. State law now
            requires the Zoning Ordinance to be consistent with the objectives, policies, and
            general land uses called out in the General Plan, of which the Land Use Element
            is a primary component.
                                              LU-27
2. Subdivision Ordinance. The Subdivision Ordinance serves to assure workable
   and convenient land use patterns in developing areas. One primary function of
   the ordinance is to assure that potential problems are mitigated at the time land is
   divided for development. Another consideration is the need to encourage unique
   and positive urban design features, such as variable setbacks. Equally
   important, the Subdivision Ordinance allows for the inclusion of areas for any
   needed public facilities at the time of development.
3. Determination of Sphere of Influence. The amendment of a formal Sphere of
   Influence by LAFCO is an important step in the implementation of the Land Use
   Element. This action should:
   a.    Officially sanction the City's involvement in influencing the appropriate
         development of the total planning area, including unincorporated areas of
         the Santa Maria Valley.
   b.    Continue our efforts for closer County-City coordination on planning matters.
   c.    Form a logical basis for the extension of urban services consistent with the
         20-year annexation program.
4. Capital Improvement Program. The Capital Improvement Program should be
   more consistent with the General Plan. Beyond budgeted items, the projects
   specified should be evaluated on the basis of the goals and policies and service
   requirements of all land use designations set out in the Land Use Element.
5. Special Study Areas. The areas designated as special study areas need
   particular attention during the planning period. The designation should signify a
   commitment to specific public and private actions which will improve the quality of
   land uses these areas and land use compatibility. Specific Plans primarily
   addressing land use, infrastructure, circulation, phasing, and funding
   mechanisms should be prepared for these areas.
6. General Plan Review Program. As the General Plan, in response to changes in
   state law, become less of a "guideline" and more nearly a definitive and
   meaningful statement of a public policy, the process of maintaining the Land Use
   Element as a viable document becomes more significant. Section 65400(b) of
   the Government Code directs the Planning Commission to take the following
   additional steps not already specified in the program section:
   a.    Submit an annual report to the Planning Commission and City Council on
         the status and implementation of the General Plan. This report should be
         consistent with the City's annual report submitted to the California Office of
         Planning and Research.
   b.    Promote public interest in the understanding of the plan and the regulations
         relating to it.
   c.    Consult and advise with other agencies, groups, and the public on ways of
         carrying out the plan.
   d.    Review for conformity with the General Plan referrals by public agencies
                                       LU-28
              regarding real property acquisitions and disposition, and construction of
              public works and buildings.
   7.   Reassessment of Land Use Element. At the close of the five (5) year planning
        period, it is expected that a major reassessment of the element would be
        appropriate. Such reassessment would evaluate assumptions, goals, objectives,
        and policies and the application of the land use classifications in the planning
        area.
   8.   Mixed-Use Projects. (Resolution 2011-111) Encourage projects that provide for
        a diverse yet compatible mixture of residential, commercial, industrial, public, and
        recreational uses, not found in a single established Zoning District. An
        appropriate mixed-use project is:
        a.    Diverse and contains a representative mix of residents, workers, and uses;
        b.    Complete in that it is sustainable for the residents, workers, and patrons;
        c.    Compact in that it contains the highest and best use for the land it occupies;
        d.    Connected by safe streets, sidewalks, and multi-purpose trails; and
        e.    Walkable/Transit Accessible so it is easily accessible without benefit of an
              automobile.
IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES
      The City of Santa Maria, Community Development Department will implement the
      zoning and subdivision ordinances, designate and study the special study areas,
      and will develop and implement the General Plan Review Program. The City of
      Santa Maria Public Works Department will develop and implement the Capital
      Improvement Program. The City will work together with the LAFCO to establish
      Santa Maria's Sphere of Influence and the annexation phasing plan.
B.    GOAL L.U.2 -- URBAN SERVICES
      Provide all necessary urban services and facilities for present and future City
      residents, which include providing sufficient land for community facilities (i.e., fire
      station, police station, library, cultural center).

  developer fees and improvement districts assuring adequate community
  facilities are provided as development occurs.
OBJECTIVE L.U.2h
  Assure that adequate land is provided for those institutional and public
  activities which will serve new development consistent with the established
  standards of the General Plan.
OBJECTIVE L.U.2i (Resolution 2011-111)
  Encourage the expanded use of retardation basins for the preservation of
  water quality in association with applicable new development proposals.
  Wherever feasible, storm water basins should be designed to incorporate
  flood protection and increased infiltration and recharge capability with flow
  duration control to meet the purpose and intent of hydro-modification
  management and in support of the City’s Low Impact Development (LID)
  requirements.
OBJECTIVE L.U.2j

        measures as conditions to those lands being annexed to "buy in" to and to allow
        for future infrastructure expansion of the City's existing infrastructure and
        community facilities deemed necessary to support the new development.
   10. Study and propose possible hazardous waste transfer sites as necessary,
        consistent with the county's adopted hazardous materials management plan, and
        forward recommendations to Santa Barbara County.
                                            LU-31
   11. Amend the zoning ordinance(s) to require that large commercial centers be
        primarily retail oriented to preserve and maintain the City's existing community
        oriented shopping centers that contain grocery stores as major attractors
        "anchors" to the center.
      (Resolution 97-117)
IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES
      The City of Santa Maria's Public Works Department will monitor local and regional
      facilities usage and capacity utilization, identify key infrastructure and development,
      and implement rehabilitation programs. The City Council will direct the Public
      Works Department and the Community Development Department when
      annexation will be required as a precursor to the extension of utilities and public
      services. The Public Works Department will assist the Community Development
      Department with the land banking and exaction programs and the hazardous
      waste transfer site study.
      The Santa Maria Community Development Department will coordinate regional
      services with regional agencies; develop, review, and set conditions of
      development for specific and master plans; develop and implement annexation
      plans; and approve and implement agriculture preservation measures.
      The Finance Department will assist the Community Development Department to
      determine appropriate fees to cover costs and allow implementation of adopted
      programs. The City Council will establish appropriate fee structures.
      Other City departments will review plans and advise the Community Development
      Department's Current and Advance Planning Divisions to enable Community
      Development to condition development to assure General Plan, ordinance, and
      standards compliance and consistency.
C.    GOAL L.U.3 -- URBAN DESIGN
      The City will promote quality urban design enhancing Santa Maria's character.
      POLICY L.U.3 -- Rehabilitation of Older Structures and New Development
      Emphasize quality urban design features in rehabilitation and new development
      efforts (similar policies are in the Resources Management Element [RME]).
          OBJECTIVE L.U.3a
               Update and expand the Entrada Specific Plan to identify areas which can
               benefit from a design theme, and establish urban design standards for
               selected areas of the City.
                                             LU-32
              Amend the adopted Entrada Specific Plan to include provisions to
              encourage implementation of the City of Santa Maria’s architecture tower
              program for commercial, industrial and residential projects adjacent to City
              entrances and located on major transportation corridors to include
              architecturally designed tower elements in the design of new buildings and
              additions to existing buildings. Landscape medians should include
              kiosk/tower block markers as special design/entry features.
         OBJECTIVE L.U.3b
              Continue ongoing code enforcement efforts so that property is safely
              maintained and attractive.
         OBJECTIVE L.U.3c
              Deteriorating neighborhoods shall be identified and targeted for increased
              police patrols, public improvements (drainage, street lighting, traffic and
              road, parks, landscaping, etc.), zoning enforcement, and rezoning to
              encourage private sector redevelopment.
ANTICIPATED RESULT
     The anticipated results would be the implementation of urban design standards,
     Specific Plans, and overlay districts.
     The architecturally designed towers are intended to create a focal point and help
     establish an identity for a given area or neighborhood. This program will assist in
     instilling “pride of ownership” for persons working or residing in a given area or
     neighborhood.
     (Resolution 2001-06)
IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAM
     Undertake Specific Plan overlay studies to determine which neighborhoods and
     districts would benefit from a design theme. Potential overlay neighborhoods are
     North and South Broadway, Main Street, Stowell Road, Betteravia Road east of
     Thornburg to U. S. 101, and Santa Maria Way north of U.S. 101 to College Drive
     as shown in Exhibit LU-5 . Based on the determination, establish Specific Plan
     overlay districts which would include guidelines for setbacks, building heights,
     building mass, landscaping, building materials, signage, and other design
     standards as provided in the updated Entrada Specific Plan. New development, as
     well as rehabilitation projects, shall comply with the overlay district standards.
     Implement point of entry design overlays at all freeway and highway entrances to
     the City as shown in Exhibit LU-5.
                                          LU-33

IMPLEMENTING AGENCY
      The City of Santa Maria Community Development Department will perform
      neighborhood studies, propose district standards, and establish overlay districts to
      be presented to the City's Planning Commission and City Council for adoption.
      This department will also enforce zoning and building codes.
D.    GOAL L.U.4 -- INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL USES
      New employment generating clean and low water demand industry and
      commercial uses will be encouraged to locate in Santa Maria and activities of this
      type presently located in the City will be encouraged to remain.
      POLICY L.U.4 -- Inducements to Attract Industry and Commerce
      The City should utilize a variety of techniques and tools to induce clean,
      employment-generating commerce and industry. Such techniques could include:
      (1) long-range strategic plans focusing on commercial and industrial types,
      location, and the costs/benefits to the City, (2) a City liaison acting between local
      employers, and the community college to encourage continued job training for
      those skills important to local employers, (3) Specific Plan development enabling
      the City to meet industrial and commercial needs, (4) maintain close coordination
      with the Chamber of Commerce and the Economic Development Association, and
      (5) creation and preservation of affordable housing.
        OBJECTIVE L.U.4
             Determine the commercial and industrial needs of the City, and determine
             the methods to induce their location and operation in Santa Maria.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS
      Development of new industries, and revitalization of older commercial and
      industrial areas; including higher employment within the City.
IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAMS
   1.   Designate areas within the City to be developed as commercial centers which
        would continue to provide employment and a strong fiscal base such as U.S.
        101/Santa Maria Way, Main Street/U.S. 101 to western corporate boundary,
        Santa Maria Way from U.S. 101 to College Drive, Broadway from Miller Road
        north to U.S. 101, Bradley south of Stowell to McCoy Lane, Betteravia Road east
        of Broadway to Miller Road, Betteravia Road west of U.S. 101, and the Orcutt
        Road/Skyway Drive intersection.
   2.   The U.S. 101 corridor shall continue to provide for "Big-Box" retail regional type
                                           LU-34
        commercial uses and provide for regional auto sales.
   3.   Designate Main Street and Broadway as planned development overlay areas and
        require specific or master plans for new development.
   4.   Evaluate and improve access and design standards for new commercial centers,
        as well as existing centers and commercial strips.
   5.   Encourage private and public redevelopment and revitalization of older
        commercial areas to serve the entire community, utilizing good urban design
        techniques and standards.
   6.   Coordinate ongoing urban programs with organized business activities, including
        the Chamber of Commerce, Economic Development Association, and other
        service organizations.
IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES
      The City of Santa Maria Community Development and Public Works Departments
      will evaluate and adopt access and design standards for regional commercial
      centers.
      The City of Santa Maria Redevelopment Agency will prepare and implement
      redevelopment and revitalization plans and standards.
      The City's Community Development Department will coordinate City services and
      programs with community groups and service organizations as a part of public
      participation associated with planning program adoption and implementation. The
      Community Development Department will also oversee specific and master plan
      implementation for the Main Street and Broadway planned development corridors.
E.    GOAL L.U.5 -- DEVELOPMENT CONTINUITY
      Discourage sprawl and "leap-frog" development.
      POLICY L.U.5 -- Sphere of Influence
      Amend the present Sphere of Influence line to indicate the ultimate boundary for
      urban development.
          OBJECTIVE L.U.5a
              Determine the nature and extent of development desired in the
              unincorporated areas located within the urban limit line and within the
              sphere study areas and prezone accordingly.
          OBJECTIVE L.U.5b
                                           LU-35
              Implement an annexation program which would encourage the phased
              annexation of those areas within the urban limit line.
         OBJECTIVE L.U.5c
              Undertake an infill program which will promote new development within the
              City on undeveloped or underdeveloped parcels (related policies and
              objectives are in the RME and Housing Element).
         OBJECTIVE L.U.5d
              Locate new development contiguous to compatible existing development.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS
      The anticipated results include:
       a.)    Establishment of a Sphere of Influence boundary based on planned
              infrastructure, existing land use patterns, and location of primary agricultural
              land.
       b.)    Development and implementation of a phased annexation plan coordinating
              urban services, zoning, and development based on available resources.
       c.)    Development and implementation of programs which will encourage infill,
              such as innovative urban design standards and streamlined processing.
IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAMS
   1.  Encourage industrial development in areas with appropriate urban services and
       characteristics; such services and characteristics are truck route access, railroad
       facilities access, relatively level terrain, available utilities, and adjacent high
       intensity commercial area. Plan for residential land uses, from which do not
       encroach on industrial districts.
   2.  Encourage office use near the Civic Center by expanding the Central Business II
       district.
   3.  Encourage residential and commercial infill projects prior to developing outlying
       areas. Inducements may include innovative urban design and streamlined
       processing.
   4.  Determine desired land uses for the Sphere of Influence area and development
       densities based on adjacent land use and General Plan policy.
   5.  Develop an annexation program that provides for an integrated system of zoning,
       infrastructure provision, and timely phased development approval.
                                            LU-36
IMPLEMENTING AGENCY
     The City's Community Development and Public Works Departments will be
     responsible for implementing these five programs.

     considerations.
     GOAL L.U.6b -- PRESERVE AGRICULTURAL RESOURCES
     Accommodate growth while making every effort to preserve agricultural resources
     in the surrounding region.
     GOAL L.U.6c -- URBAN/AGRICULTURE EQUILIBRIUM
     Achieve a balance between increased developments and the maintenance,
     management, and/or preservation of local resources.
     POLICY L.U.6a -- Land Use Conflicts
     Resolve conflicts between existing and proposed land uses, particularly residential
     and industrial uses, and prevent such conflicts in the future (related policies are in
     the Housing Element).
     POLICY L.U.6b -- Inter-Governmental Coordination
     Work with Santa Barbara County and LAFCO to support mutually reinforcing goals
     of locating urban development within municipalities and urban areas of the county
     in order to protect agricultural land and to efficiently utilize public infrastructure.
         OBJECTIVE L.U.6a
             Promote the development of compatible uses in areas surrounding the
             Santa Maria Public Airport. Prohibit residential land uses in the airport
             vicinity not in accordance with the Noise and Safety Elements of the
             General Plan.
         OBJECTIVE L.U.6b
             Encourage retail commercial and office land uses of high quality along the
             approach corridors to downtown Santa Maria as specified in the Entrada
             Specific Plan and proposed in goals L.U.3 and L.U.4.
         OBJECTIVE L.U.6c
             Establish a Sphere of Influence line, as proposed in Goal L.U.5, that will be
             an effective tool in reducing development pressures on the outlying
             agricultural areas (refer to the RME for related policies).
                                            LU-37
OBJECTIVE L.U.6d
  Encourage agricultural activities within the planning area to remain in
  operation by discouraging land uses that conflict with adjacent farming
  activities.
OBJECTIVE L.U.6e
  The City should continue to study and implement a system of greenbelts to
  provide transitions between different land uses and to protect agricultural
  land.
OBJECTIVE L.U.6f
  Encourage Santa Barbara County to maintain an agricultural land use
  designation for those areas where agricultural production remains
  economically viable.
OBJECTIVE L.U.6g
  Develop programs balancing development location; type of urban growth
  within the available supply of natural resources, preserving water, air, and
  open space resources; and the development rate, with the ability to provide
  infrastructure and services and assure a job/housing balance.
OBJECTIVE L.U.6h
  Promote the use of alternate modes of transit to reduce traffic, improve air
  quality and reduce noise impacts (refer to the Circulation Element for similar
  policies).
OBJECTIVE L.U.6i
  Evaluate and plan for additional park and recreational facilities convenient to
  existing and future residential areas consistent with the RME.
OBJECTIVE L.U.6j
  Plan for employee child care facilities, and employee recreational facilities
  (showers, lockers, bike racks, etc.); to be incorporated into major
  developments.
OBJECTIVE L.U.6k
  Use drainage retention facilities for recreational purposes.
OBJECTIVE L.U.6l
  Protect significant archaeological and ecological resources and require that
  new development in these areas be sensitive to the presence of these
  resources, as identified in the RME.
OBJECTIVE L.U.6m
  Preserve open space areas surrounding the Sphere of Influence. Utilize
  greenbelts, bikeways, pedestrian paths, and roadways between agricultural
  and residential land use (see the RME).
                                LU-38
          OBJECTIVE L.U.6n
             Connect alternative modes of transit to transit routes located in San Luis
             Obispo County.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS
      Anticipated results include the development of master plans for smaller parcels and
      Specific Plans for larger new development. These plans will evaluate economic
      and environmental impacts and benefits to the community and the City. The
      approved plans will be implemented, revising the Land Use Element map and
      zoning where necessary, thus reducing or eliminating undesirable and
      incompatible land uses. Another anticipated result is the preservation of agriculture
      by encouraging commitment to the Williamson Act, and discouraging development
      and annexation in those areas outside the City Sphere of Influence. Lastly, an
      anticipated result will be the continuing development of Santa Maria in a manner
      which is sensitive to agricultural, archaeological, and ecological resources.
IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAMS
   1.   The preceding implementation programs for goals L.U.1, L.U.3, and L.U.4 will
        provide the means to implement the above policies and objectives. They are:
             Zoning Ordinance
             Subdivision Ordinance
             Commercial Areas Design Standards
             Older Commercial Areas
             Reassessment of Land Use Element
             Specific Plans
             Main Street and Broadway Planned Development Overlay
             Determination of Sphere of Influence
             Capital Improvement Program
             General Plan Review Program Revitalization and Rehabilitation
             Urban Programs Coordination with Other Service Organizations
             Commercial Corridor Development
   2.   Adopt Zoning Ordinance requirements and standards as necessary to prohibit or
        control land uses which pose potential environmental hazards.
   3.   Encourage specific and master plans, including economic and environmental
        cost/benefit discussions for all new major projects.
   4.   Encourage the commitment of agricultural lands to the Williamson Act.
                                            LU-39

   5.   Encourage development patterns which emphasize that land furthest removed
        from an urban character be the last to urbanize.
   6.   Wherever possible, new urban land uses should not be permitted on prime
        agricultural land. The exception of this policy would be in cases where the new
        development constitutes infilling between existing development nodes where
        agricultural activity is no longer desirable because of the surrounding of urban
        uses.
   7.   Develop and encourage public transportation, including municipal buses, light
        rail, shuttle services, and bike paths. Develop and encourage ridesharing
        programs, including park and ride lots.
   8.   Implement archaeological guidelines as established by the State Native
        American Heritage Commission.
   9.   Encourage site planning sensitive to ecological resources through building
        clustering, planned unit development, and zoning code modifications where
        appropriate.
IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES
      The City's Community Development and Public Works Departments will be
      responsible for implementing these programs. The Department of Recreation and
      Parks will assist the Community Development Department with evaluation and
      implementation of park space requirements. Department of Recreation and Parks
      will operate related public services.
G.    GOAL L.U.7 -- LAND USE CONFLICT REDUCTION
      Reduce existing and potential land use conflicts.
      POLICY L.U.7 -- Site Design
      Avoid land use problems before they arise and create maximum harmony through
      innovative urban design between various land uses.
           OBJECTIVE L.U.7a
              Require the use of buffers between incompatible land uses by using berms,
              walls, open space, landscaping, bike paths, and arterial streets where
              appropriate (related policies are in the RME).
                                            LU-40
OBJECTIVE L.U.7b
  Protect residential neighborhoods from encroachment by incompatible
  nonresidential uses and the impacts associated with adjacent nonresidential
  activities.
OBJECTIVE L.U.7c
  Where areas classified as industrial border residential areas, the industrial
  area will be developed in light industrial uses with appropriate buffers
  (shown in Exhibit LU-6) which do not adversely impact the residential
  activities. In this way, the lighter industrial activities will act as a buffer
  between the general industrial and residential development. The Planning
  Commission and staff should evaluate the establishment of a zoning
  category that would permit "clean, quiet" industry. this land use would
  permit the processing of information rather than the manufacture or
  assembly of a product. This land use would be compatible with residential,
  could be used as infill, and would establish employment in close proximity to
  housing.
OBJECTIVE L.U.7d
  Where industrial and intense retail development borders residential
  development, the circulation pattern should be designed to avoid direct
  conflicts so that industrial and commercial traffic does not enter residential
  neighborhoods. Create cul-de-sacs and locate industrial districts along
  major arterial streets (refer to the Circulation Element).
OBJECTIVE L.U.7e
  Industrial commercial and office uses shall provide sufficient on-site parking
  facilities to accommodate their equipment and parking needs.
OBJECTIVE L.U.7f
  Where residential development takes place along arterials and collectors,
  every effort should be made to mitigate the negative impacts of traffic on the
  residential uses. Mitigation measures include set backs, landscaped
  buffers, walls, and limited or no driveway access into individual dwelling
  units.
OBJECTIVE L.U.7g
  In commercial areas, encourage pedestrian walkways to be located away
  from traffic areas, and set apart, where possible, providing a separate
  pedestrian and bicycle circulation system (refer to the Circulation Element).
OBJECTIVE L.U.7h (Resolution 2011-111)
  The area generally bounded on the west by Blosser Road, on the north by
  Fesler Street, the Santa Maria Valley Railroad on the south and on the west
  by Depot Street is considered to be a “special study area”. This special
  study area offers the possibility of particularly beneficial land use patterns
  which may enhance community objectives.
                                 LU-41

ANTICIPATED RESULT
      The anticipated result is the reduction or elimination of land use conflicts, including
      industrial-residential conflict. This involves street design, pedestrian design
      standards, and site planning.
IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAMS
   1.   Before significant new development occurs, it may be appropriate to prepare
        master and specific plans for areas emphasizing:
             Solutions to existing, or potential infrastructure problems.
             Specific land use requirements--more detailed than the basic zoning
                classifications offer.
             Solutions to the problems, outlining detailed commitments to capital
                improvements, and recommending special development standards for the
                area.
             Establish transition areas so that new development densities are
                consistent with land use policies and existing adjacent uses.
   2.   Create cul-de-sacs, blocking off streets which were once through streets, and
        locate industrial activities along major arterials.
   3.   Residential collector streets should link           residential areas  rather    than
        concentrating residential traffic onto arterials.
   4.   Increase setbacks between arterial roadways and structures, using landscaped
        berms and walls serving to mitigate the undesirable effects of traffic, see Exhibit
        LU-6.
   5.   Design control should be used where deemed appropriate to promote
        compatibility with adjoining treatment, sign control, setbacks, and landscaping.
   6.   Regulate and intersperse hours of operation for major employment generating
        commercial and industrial uses.
   7.   Wherever possible, new development should be planned so as to minimize the
        cost of providing additional service.
   8.   Continue to implement residential density patterns which do not over-burden the
        sewage, drainage, transportation, and utility systems, or the school and
        recreational facilities of the community.
   9.   Continue to support and encourage "mixed use" developments to reduce vehicle
        trips.
                                            LU-42

      agencies.
                                             LU-43
I.    GOAL L.U.9 -- PROMOTE ADEQUATE HOUSING SUPPLY
      The City will continue to promote an adequate supply of quality residential
      development within Santa Maria.
      POLICY L.U.9 -- Housing for All Economic Segments of Society
      Assure that adequate housing is provided for all economic segments of the
      population through a diversity of housing types, sizes, and density (similar policies
      are in the Housing Element).
          OBJECTIVE L.U.9a
              Encourage infill development in those areas of the City that are designated
              for residential development which are presently undeveloped or
              underutilized (refer to the Housing Element for related policies).
          OBJECTIVE L.U.9b
              Enhance the character of existing residential neighborhoods through the
              use of high quality land use and development standards, street trees,
              neighborhood parks, other amenities, and code enforcement.
          OBJECTIVE L.U.9c
              Encourage creative site design in new residential developments and
              encourage the development of a unique identity for each neighborhood.
          OBJECTIVE L.U.9d
              Provide a balance of areas for all housing types and sizes which are
              compatible with the surrounding land uses.
          OBJECTIVE L.U.9e
              Encourage the establishment and operation of homeowner associations to
              facilitate residential maintenance and upkeep, and to facilitate neighborhood
              identity.
ANTICIPATED RESULT
      The anticipated result of these objectives and programs is the development of an
      estimated 6,000 single-family and multiple-family dwelling units within the existing
      corporate limits. This includes affordable and market rate units and special user
      units (such as disabled).
IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAMS
   1.   Where additional dwelling units are added to existing housing stock, the
        architecture and building materials should be compatible to help blend the newer
        stock with the older's aesthetic qualities.
                                            LU-44
   2.   Continue to protect existing mobile home parks.
   3.   Continue to implement the housing rehabilitation program; continue to target
        specific neighborhoods for rehabilitation.
   4.   Enforce housing, health, and safety codes, as well as zoning enforcement to
        enhance and maintain quality neighborhoods.
   5.   Continue to inform the public about fair housing laws.
   6.   Establish and implement design criteria and standards which promote innovative
        urban design such as varied setbacks, clustering of dwelling units, and
        encouraging building material variation.
   7.   Encourage the establishment of homeowner associations to maintain the
        neighborhood's facilities and to allow the neighborhood to control the character
        and upkeep within the association.
   8.   Work towards achieving a land use balance to provide equal supplies of
        residential, commercial, and industrial.
   9.   Mobile home parks should not exclude children.
   10. Encourage residential developments with alleys to allow apartments and/or
        second units to be built.
   11. Streamline the development process to efficiently process the addition of second
        units where presently permitted.
   12. Continue to evaluate the applicability of "granny flats."
IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES
      The Community Development Department will, where appropriate, enforce codes,
      and develop and implement innovative design criteria and standards. The City
      Attorney's office will pursue legal actions to enforce fair housing laws or will notify
      other offices such as the District Attorney or Attorney General to enforce applicable
      fair housing laws. The Redevelopment Agency will continue to target rehabilitation
      areas and implement the rehabilitation programs. The Police Department will
      administer the neighborhood watch program.
J.    GOAL L.U.10 -- PROMOTE HIGH QUALITY COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL
      DEVELOPMENT
      Continue to promote quality commercial and industrial development in Santa Maria
                                           LU-45
and encourage the upgrading and revitalization of the existing commercial and
industrial areas.
POLICY L.U.10a -- Regional Commercial Center
The downtown mall shall continue to be the regional commercial center for the City
(related policies are in the RME).
    OBJECTIVE L.U.10a
       Encourage the development of community commercial activities and
       centers along the major arterials serving the City such as Broadway and
       Main.
    OBJECTIVE L.U.10b
       Continue to review land use designations for undeveloped parcels presently
       designated for industrial or commercial development to assure that the
       goals and objectives of the City will be met.
    OBJECTIVE L.U.10c
       Continue to maintain the Stowell/Bradley wholesale regional commercial
       center as a regional center to avoid residential neighborhood and
       community retail conflicts.
POLICY 10b -- Neighborhood Commercial Centers
Design neighborhood commercial centers so they serve the needs of surrounding
residents.
    OBJECTIVE L.U.10d
       Allow retail and office uses to use shared parking arrangements to meet
       parking requirements where appropriate and encourage common access
       between centers to reduce the number of ingress and egress points along
       Broadway, Main, and other major arterials.
    OBJECTIVE L.U.10e
       Encourage the use of clean and low-water demanding industrial activities
       which provide the City with the greatest employment generation.
    OBJECTIVE L.U.10f
       Encourage nonconforming industrial and commercial uses to relocate to
       more appropriate areas of the City.
    OBJECTIVE L.U.10g
       Continue to promote industrial park, and recreational, development in the
       vicinity of Santa Maria Airport. Within the industrial parks, prohibit intensive
       retail commercial, general offices, medical offices, and consumer oriented
       general business.
                                    LU-46
          OBJECTIVE L.U.10h
               Encourage government offices to be located in and around the Civic Center.
          OBJECTIVE L.U.10i
               Encourage higher intensity mixed land uses adjacent to railroad rights-
               of-way which are designated for future rapid transit corridors.
ANTICIPATED RESULT
      The anticipated result is the development of high quality industrial and commercial
      facilities within Santa Maria. Parking and site design standards will be evaluated to
      most efficiently utilize urbanized land and to minimize impacts on adjacent land
      uses.
IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAMS
   1.   Develop and implement a commercial and industrial infill program.
   2.   Encourage commercial use along major routes.
   3.   Evaluate retail and office parking needs. Based on evaluation results, modify
        current parking requirements and promote designs which induce sharing of
        parking.
   4.   Evaluate industrial employment generators; encourage those with the highest
        yield to locate in Santa Maria. Possible inducements include streamline
        processing.
   5.   Evaluate local rail facilities, designate those appropriate for future light rail transit
        use, and zone adjacent areas with higher intensity development.
   6.   In order to maintain a constant supply of residential land throughout the planning
        period, the Planning Commission and City Council may explore implementation
        programs which allow a set number of dwelling units or acres of residentially
        designated land to become available for development each year.
        The purpose of this provision is to allow, should the need arise, the placement of
        a percent limitation to more evenly distribute residential absorption over the
        planning period. This would avoid complete residential build-out in three to four
        years due to extensive demand from major urban areas.
IMPLEMENTING AGENCY
      The City's Community Development Department will implement the six programs
      as directed by the City Council.
                                             LU-47
K.   GOAL L.U.11 -- BALANCE LAND USE SUPPLIES
     The City will address the present imbalance between the land area designated for
     residential development and for those areas designated industrial and commercial
     development.
     POLICY L.U.11 -- Jobs and Housing
     Assure that a balance of land use between the employment generating commercial
     and industrial uses, and residential development is achieved.
         OBJECTIVE L.U.11a
             Maintain the current program of using existing land use and zoning maps to
             determine whether residential development is appropriate for those areas
             designated as industrial.
         OBJECTIVE L.U.11b
             On an ongoing basis, determine if the redesignation of some industrial
             areas to nonindustrial uses is necessary, consistent with goals and policies
             of L.U.7 and good planning practice.
         OBJECTIVE L.U.11c
             Review the areas designated for residential areas to assure that a variety
             and balance of housing types and densities are provided for.
ANTICIPATED RESULTS
     The anticipated results associated with the implementation of this set of goals,
     policies, objectives, and programs are the continued evaluation of existing
     residential and industrial use, residential and industrial demand, and the
     implementation of residential and industrial land use balancing measures.
IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAM
     Continue to review City land use and zoning maps, determine the industrial and
     residential development potential, and evaluate the industrial and residential
     demand in light of potential. Based on the findings, continue to rezone and
     redesignate as appropriate consistent with goals and policies of L.U.1 and L.U.7.
IMPLEMENTING AGENCY
     The Community Development Department will implement this program.
L.   GOAL L.U.12 -- WATER SUPPLY
     Participate in and implement programs and measures which effectively conserve
                                          LU-48

      POLICY L.U.12 -- Conservation
      Implement programs and measures which will be effective in conserving water
      resources.
          OBJECTIVE L.U.12a
              Discourage construction of large impervious surfaces in groundwater
              recharge areas wherever possible.
          OBJECTIVE L.U.12b
              The Land Use Element shall protect groundwater recharge areas.
          OBJECTIVE L.U.12c
              Protect those land areas that are essential to the maintenance of water
              quality, including groundwater recharge areas and domestic water well
              sites. This should include setbacks that minimize potential contamination
              per the Santa Barbara Hazardous Material Plan.
          OBJECTIVE L.U.12d
              Participate in the California Water Project.
IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAMS
   1.   Establish residential, commercial, and industrial retrofit programs for water-saving
        devices.
   2.   Encourage site design and landscaping plans which feature low water utilization
        materials.
   3.   Examine all water sources, rezone, and redesignate those critical to water
        accumulation as open space.
   4.   Participate in the California Water Project.
   5.   Examine water sources and water accumulation areas; develop and implement a
        plan which prioritizes areas which are to be developed before others.

                                     PREFACE
The Safety Element was last revised by the Santa Maria City Council on April 21,
1987. This document updates the Safety Element adopted in 1987 and provides new
information, and develops new goals, policies, objectives and implementation
programs.
The goals, policies, objectives and implementation programs in the Safety Element
Update are based on the findings contained in the Background Information Report
(SIR) .  The SIR is included as the technical appendix to the Safety Element
Update.
The previous Safety Element addressed safety hazards associated with Geology,
Wildland/Urban Fires, Flooding and Emergency Services. The Safety Element Update
addresses these hazards along with the following: Electromagnetic Fields, Oil
Wells and Oil Sumps, Landfill Gas Migration, Safe Drinking Water Standards,
Aircraft Safety, and Hazardous Materials.
The Safety Element Update fulfills the requirements of State Planning and Zoning
Law (Government Code Section 65302 (g»    which mandates that a local agency's

A.      INTRODUCTION
The Safety Element is a comprehensive long range planning document which sets
forth goals, policies, objectives, and implementation programs to protect the
community from unreasonable risks associated with the following : seismically and
geologically induced hazards, flooding, wildland and urban fires, electromagnetic
fields, oil wells/sumps, landfill gas migration, safe drinking water, aircraft
safety, and hazardous materials . The Safety Element also describes the emergency
response capabilities of the various disaster service agencies in the Planning
Area .
The Safety Element will assist in the allocation of public resources in the
Planning Area to develop information regarding safety hazards and thereby provide
a systematic approach to protecting the public health, safety, and welfare from
such hazards.
B.     ASSUMPTIONS
The Safety Element is based on certain information, considerations, and
assumptions which will allow .t he City of Santa Maria to introduce safety
considerations into the planning process in order to reduce loss of life,
injuries, damage to property, and economic dislocations resulting from hazards
within the Planning Area. These are:
       I}     Existing and future safety hazards and associated risks are based on
              the latest scientific and technical data available at the time of
              preparation of this report.
       2}     Hazards such as earthquakes, flooding, or wildland fires do not
              occur with any regularity and the goals, policies, Objectives, and
              programs of the Safety Element are based on the probability that a
              particular hazard event may occur.
       3)     The Safety Element is consistent with, and takes into account, the
              goals, policies, objectives, and programs contained in the other
              Elements of the City's General Plan.
       4)     Based on the growth rate assumptions from the Land Use Element of
              the General Plan and the Sphere of Influence Study, the City's
              population is expected to be about 82,400 in the year 2000 and
              100,000 by the year 2010.       According to the 1994 Growth Forecast
              prepared by the Santa Barbara county Association of Governments,
             Orcutt is expected to have a population of about 37,600 by the year
              2010 . The population of the Santa Maria/Orcutt area is therefore
             projected to be 137,600 by the year 2010.

A.     INTRODUCTION
California Planning and Zoning Law (Gov ernment Code Section 65302 (g)) states that
local jurisdictions must have a safety element for the protection of the
community from unreasonable risks associated with the effects of seismically
induced surface rupture, ground shaking, ground failure, tsunami , seiche, and dam
failure; slope instability leading to mudslides and landslides; subsidence,
liquefaction, and other seismic hazards, and other geologic hazards known to the
City; flooding; and wildland and urban fires . The mapping of known seismic and
other geologic hazards must also be included.         The safety element shall also
address evacuation routes, peakload water supply requirements, and minimum road
widths and clearances around structures, as those items relate to identified fire
and geologic hazards .
The Safety Element Update includes the above mentioned topics and also includes
an analysis of the hazards associated with electromagnetic fields, oil
wells/sumps, landfill gas migration, safe drinking water levels, aircraft safety,
and hazardous materials. A description of emergency procedures during a disaster
is also provided.
B.     P"IHDINOS AND PLAHHINO CONSIDERATIONS
This Bection provides a summary of findings and planni ng considerations for each
identified safety hazard.       Please refer to the technical appendix' for a
complete discuBsion of these top i cs.
1.     Geology/Seismology
       The Santa Maria Valley is an east-west trending alluvial' valley bounded
       to the north by the San Rafael Range and to the south by the Casmalia
       Range and the Solomon Hills.
       The Santa Maria River traverses the valley from east to west, emptying
       into the Pacific Ocean just west of the town of Guadalupe.         The Santa
       Maria River is formed by the convergence of the Cuyama and the Sisquoc
       Rivers at Fugler Point near Garey.
       The Santa Maria basin is a significant hydrocarbon (i.e. oil and gas)
       producing coastal (and off-shore) basin in California . The basin lies at
       the juncture between the northwest-trending southern Coast Range province
       and the east-west-trending Transverse Range province. The basin contains
       a relatively thick Miocene through Holocene age sequence of sedimentary
       rocks, some of which are prolific petroleum producing formations , and
       others that are high.ly productive ground water aquifers .
       The Santa Maria Valley is within a structural fold' and thrust fault area;
       the axes of most of the structural elements in the region run northwest-
       southeast, parallel to the valley.      The Santa Maria basin and adjacent
       southern Coast Ranges have been subjected to considerable uplift' during
       the last 2 to 5 million years, and are considered to be seismically
       active.    Relatively little direct evidence of active faulting (such as
       offset of bedding or structures observed at a surface fault) has been
       observed in the region; however, broad bands of seismicity unrelated to
       surface faults and other evidence indicate the region is seismically

   seismic activity may be associated with "blind" thrust faults. 7 These are
   the type of faults that caused the Coalinga and Northridge earthquakes.
   Several active, potentially active and inactive faults exist within the
   basin and region.   An active fault is defined as a fault which is or has
   been active during the last 11,000 years. A potentially active fault is
   a fault that was active between 11,000 to 500,000 years ago. An inactive
   fault is a fault which has not moved in the last 500,000 years.       Table
   SE-l lists the active and potentially active faults in the region.

  Within the Planning Area, faults generally trend northwest.        The major
  faults include the Santa Karia Fault, the Santa Karia River Fault, and the
  Casmalia Fault (Figures SE-l and SE-2). None of these faults qualify for
  Earthquake Fault Zone status as identified by the State Geologist under
  the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zones Act.
  Groundshaking
  Available geologic information indicates that the potential for strong
  ground shaking in coastal southern California is high. The potential for
  severe ground shaking would occur as a result of movement along one of the
  major California faults (e.g. San Andreas) and such movement could
  generate significant damage throughout the City. Hore recently, however,
  scientists theorize that unmapped "blind" thrust faults may have a greater
  potential for movement than major, known faults.       santa Karia has a 40
  percent chance of experiencing peak ground accelerations at least 20
  percent of gravity.    That is enough shaking to cause structural damage.'

   Santa Haria can be divided into two distinct seismic zones (Figure SE-2):
         Zone A - All areas underlain by Holocene age alluvium.
         Zone B - All areas underlain by Pleistocene age non-marine terrace
         deposits .
   Zone A is considered the most hazardous zone with respect to groundshaking
   potential.
   Landslides
   Landslides and mudslides could potentially occur in areas with steep
   slopes or in areas containing escarpments (Figure SE-2).          The only
   potential area within the City Limits is the escarpment that runs in an
   east-west direction in the southern portion of the City .
   Liquefaction
   Liquefaction' potential from groundshaking is generally low in the Planning
   Area due to the relatively deep groundwater levels that are ordinarily
   over 10 feet below the ground surface. However, several areas of perc~ed
   groundwater in the vicinity of the Santa Maria Public Airport could cause
   liquefaction during an earthquake (Figure SE-2).
   Subsidence
   The Santa Haria area has not had significant subsidence 'o problems despite
   historical oil drilling in the area. Although subsidence could occur, it
   is perceived to be an insignificant risk due the absence of reported
   problems .   Since both oil drilling by private parties and groundwater
   extraction largely by private parties have occurred in the southern
   portion of the city, pumping activities will be considered in the event
   subsidence problems occur.
   Expansive soi1s'1
   Based on the wSoil Survey of Northern Santa Barbara Area, California w,
   United States Department of Agriculture, July 1972, the following soils in
   the planning area have a moderate to high potential for expansiveness:
         Narlon sand (NvC), hardpan variant - Low to high potential.
         Pleasanton Bandy loam (PnA, PnC) - Low to moderate potential .
         Sorrento loam (SvA, SvC) - Moderate potential.
   Figure SE-2 shows the general location of these Boils.
   Unrein forced Masonry
   On December 5, 1989, the Santa Maria City Council adopted an unreinforced
   masonry implementation ordinance '2 • The ordinance adopted standards and

     Radon Gas
     Santa Barbara County has been designated as Zone 1 which is the zone with
     the highest potential for radon concentrations.                The EPA and the State
    Department of Health Services decided to designate Santa Barbara County as
     Zone 1 based on the elevated radon levels that are associated with the
    Rincon Shale geologic formation.            This rock unit is widely scattered
     across southern Santa Barbara County, but is not present in the Santa
    Karia area.
    Although the above information appears quite specific, it cannot be
    applied to determine radon levels of a neighborhood, housing tract, or
    individual house.        The only way to determine if a house has elevated
    indoor radon levels is to test. Testing consists of gathering a sample of
    air and having it analyzed for radon gas.
    Damage Scenario
    Based on the City's proximity to the southern San Andreas Fault (40 miles)
    and other unmapped underground faults, and considering the soil structure
    of the area, the Planning Area could receive a shaking intensity that
    could cause the overthrow of movable objects, the falling of plaster,
    general panic,     and damage to buildings.           For most of Santa Karia,     the
    intensity of this anticipated earthquake could cause disruption beyond
    anything    recently    experienced     in  the    area    and   would require   total
    integrated planning and response from both the public and private sectors
    in order to minimize possible deaths, injuries and property destruction .
    u.s.   Highway 101. Considerable damage to road surfaces, overpasses and
    bridges    would    be  expected    in   all    areas    of   liquefaction,   possibly
    restricting east-west access to and from the Marian Medical Center.
    Airport. The Santa Maria Airport would be seriously affected due to its
    location in an area that is subject to liquefaction because of the sandy
    lIoil and high     (perched) water table .         It is questionable whether the
    airport could      be used for any major logistical resupply except by
    helicopter.
    Santa Maria Valley Railroad/Southern Pacific Railroad. Southern Pacific
    mainline railroad service would be disrupted by surface ruptures,
    landslides, rockfalls, failures of overpasses and slides at the ends of
    tunnels.     It is doubtful that rail service to Santa Maria could be
    restored in less than 8 to 10 days.
    Electrical Power. A short term, and potentially long term effect, would be
    major power outages and power reductions in most areas of the Central
    Coast. Those lines that remain intact might be rendered temporarily out
                                           5.7

   of service after each aftershock . The major long-term impact would be on
   distant power sources, both due to the reduction in transmission
   capacities and the probable shortage of generator fuel.       Transmission
   lines in santa Karia would stand a good chance of being one of the earlier
   facilities restored.
   Natural Gas . Major pipelines leading to the area as well as those in the
   area could be ruptured.     It is uncertain how long the areas could be
   supported by underground storage.
   Petroleum Fuels. The processing of petroleum fuels in the area is
   uncertain. If this source of fuels became unavailable, extremely serious
   consequences could result due to the inability to resupply fuels by land
   transport.
   Telephone Systems. Any surviving telephone service would be overloaded by
   calls from both inside and outside the area .
   Radio Systems.   Public safety radio systems would continue to function
   within the Planning .Area. Microwave channels would be disrupted.
   Commercial Broadcasters. Lack of emergency power would restrict the
   operation of some television and radio stations.    The scarcity of fuels
   and the unavailability of resupply would limit the operational time of
   emergency generators.
   Water Supply and waste Disposal. A major earthquake would seriously
   disrupt the water distribution system .    The Wastewater Treatment Plant
   would probably suffer some damage and could be inoperative.        Lack of
   electrical power also would cause the plant to shut down.       Collection
   lines throughout the area could be impaired causing significant contamina-
   tion problems.
2. Flooding/Dam Inundation
   Flooding hazards within the Planning Area consist of localized and
   widespread flooding due to storms, failure of the santa Karia Levee, and
   from dam inundation caused by the failure of Twitchell Dam. The potential
   for flooding and dam inundation comes from storm water that is collected
   in the 260 square mile Santa Maria Valley watershed that is located in
   both Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo Counties.    The Sisquoc River and
   Cuyama River watersheds combine to form the Santa Karia Valley watershed.
   FlOOding
   The flooding associated with the 100-year storm is of primary consider-
   ation.   The 100-year flood determination is the accepted standard for
   flood protection by agencies involved in the assessment of flood risks.
   The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), in their issuance
   of flood insurance as part of the Flood Protection Disaster Act of 1974,
   has adopted the 100-year flood level as the determinant of the floodplain
   area having a hazard potential requiring specific or protective measures .
   The City has also adopted the 100-year flood plain through its participa-
   tion in the Flood Insurance Rate Program administered by the Federal
   Emergency Management Agency.
   Flood prone areas in the Planning Area are noted in Figure SE-3. The 100-
   year flood plain is generally in the areas of the Santa Maria River and
   the Orcutt Creek.    The Santa Maria River Levee, built by the U.S. Army
   Corp of Engineers, is designed to protect the City from the 100-year
   flood.   The Flood Control District patrols the levee any time there is
   more than a few hundred cubic feet per second flowing in the river. Levee
   erosion has been experienced and if the levee was allowed to rupture,
   would create major flooding problems east of u.S. Highway 101. However,
   the levee does not prevent localized flooding from the various flood
   control facilities in the Planning Area. These local facilities include
   a series of storm drains, open channels, and retardation basins.
   Localized flooding cannot be accurately mapped as it depends on the
   magnitude and location of the causative storm.

A.      INTRODUCTION
The Safety Element is a comprehensive long range planning document which sets
forth goals, policies, objectives, and implementation programs to protect the
community from unreasonable risks associated with the following : seismically and
geologically induced hazards, flooding, wildland and urban fires, electromagnetic
fields, oil wells/sumps, landfill gas migration, safe drinking water, aircraft
safety, and hazardous materials . The Safety Element also describes the emergency
response capabilities of the various disaster service agencies in the Planning
Area .
The Safety Element will assist in the allocation of public resources in the
Planning Area to develop information regarding safety hazards and thereby provide
a systematic approach to protecting the public health, safety, and welfare from
such hazards.
B.     ASSUMPTIONS
The Safety Element is based on certain information, considerations, and
assumptions which will allow .t he City of Santa Maria to introduce safety
considerations into the planning process in order to reduce loss of life,
injuries, damage to property, and economic dislocations resulting from hazards
within the Planning Area. These are:
       I}     Existing and future safety hazards and associated risks are based on
              the latest scientific and technical data available at the time of
              preparation of this report.
       2}     Hazards such as earthquakes, flooding, or wildland fires do not
              occur with any regularity and the goals, policies, Objectives, and
              programs of the Safety Element are based on the probability that a
              particular hazard event may occur.
       3)     The Safety Element is consistent with, and takes into account, the
              goals, policies, objectives, and programs contained in the other
              Elements of the City's General Plan.
       4)     Based on the growth rate assumptions from the Land Use Element of
              the General Plan and the Sphere of Influence Study, the City's
              population is expected to be about 82,400 in the year 2000 and
              100,000 by the year 2010.       According to the 1994 Growth Forecast
              prepared by the Santa Barbara county Association of Governments,
             Orcutt is expected to have a population of about 37,600 by the year
              2010 . The population of the Santa Maria/Orcutt area is therefore
             projected to be 137,600 by the year 2010.

A.     INTRODUCTION
California Planning and Zoning Law (Gov ernment Code Section 65302 (g)) states that
local jurisdictions must have a safety element for the protection of the
community from unreasonable risks associated with the effects of seismically
induced surface rupture, ground shaking, ground failure, tsunami , seiche, and dam
failure; slope instability leading to mudslides and landslides; subsidence,
liquefaction, and other seismic hazards, and other geologic hazards known to the
City; flooding; and wildland and urban fires . The mapping of known seismic and
other geologic hazards must also be included.         The safety element shall also
address evacuation routes, peakload water supply requirements, and minimum road
widths and clearances around structures, as those items relate to identified fire
and geologic hazards .
The Safety Element Update includes the above mentioned topics and also includes
an analysis of the hazards associated with electromagnetic fields, oil
wells/sumps, landfill gas migration, safe drinking water levels, aircraft safety,
and hazardous materials. A description of emergency procedures during a disaster
is also provided.
B.     P"IHDINOS AND PLAHHINO CONSIDERATIONS
This Bection provides a summary of findings and planni ng considerations for each
identified safety hazard.       Please refer to the technical appendix' for a
complete discuBsion of these top i cs.
1.     Geology/Seismology
       The Santa Maria Valley is an east-west trending alluvial' valley bounded
       to the north by the San Rafael Range and to the south by the Casmalia
       Range and the Solomon Hills.
       The Santa Maria River traverses the valley from east to west, emptying
       into the Pacific Ocean just west of the town of Guadalupe.         The Santa
       Maria River is formed by the convergence of the Cuyama and the Sisquoc
       Rivers at Fugler Point near Garey.
       The Santa Maria basin is a significant hydrocarbon (i.e. oil and gas)
       producing coastal (and off-shore) basin in California . The basin lies at
       the juncture between the northwest-trending southern Coast Range province
       and the east-west-trending Transverse Range province. The basin contains
       a relatively thick Miocene through Holocene age sequence of sedimentary
       rocks, some of which are prolific petroleum producing formations , and
       others that are high.ly productive ground water aquifers .
       The Santa Maria Valley is within a structural fold' and thrust fault area;
       the axes of most of the structural elements in the region run northwest-
       southeast, parallel to the valley.      The Santa Maria basin and adjacent
       southern Coast Ranges have been subjected to considerable uplift' during
       the last 2 to 5 million years, and are considered to be seismically
       active.    Relatively little direct evidence of active faulting (such as
       offset of bedding or structures observed at a surface fault) has been
       observed in the region; however, broad bands of seismicity unrelated to
       surface faults and other evidence indicate the region is seismically

   cally active, basement-involved fold and thrust be1t 6 , where the main
   seismic activity may be associated with "blind" thrust faults. 7 These are
   the type of faults that caused the Coalinga and Northridge earthquakes.
   Several active, potentially active and inactive faults exist within the
   basin and region.   An active fault is defined as a fault which is or has
   been active during the last 11,000 years. A potentially active fault is
   a fault that was active between 11,000 to 500,000 years ago. An inactive
   fault is a fault which has not moved in the last 500,000 years.       Table
   SE-l lists the active and potentially active faults in the region.

  Within the Planning Area, faults generally trend northwest.        The major
  faults include the Santa Karia Fault, the Santa Karia River Fault, and the
  Casmalia Fault (Figures SE-l and SE-2). None of these faults qualify for
  Earthquake Fault Zone status as identified by the State Geologist under
  the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zones Act.
  Groundshaking
  Available geologic information indicates that the potential for strong
  ground shaking in coastal southern California is high. The potential for
  severe ground shaking would occur as a result of movement along one of the
  major California faults (e.g. San Andreas) and such movement could
  generate significant damage throughout the City. Hore recently, however,
  scientists theorize that unmapped "blind" thrust faults may have a greater
  potential for movement than major, known faults.       santa Karia has a 40
  percent chance of experiencing peak ground accelerations at least 20
  percent of gravity.    That is enough shaking to cause structural damage.'

   Santa Haria can be divided into two distinct seismic zones (Figure SE-2):
         Zone A - All areas underlain by Holocene age alluvium.
         Zone B - All areas underlain by Pleistocene age non-marine terrace
         deposits .
   Zone A is considered the most hazardous zone with respect to groundshaking
   potential.
   Landslides
   Landslides and mudslides could potentially occur in areas with steep
   slopes or in areas containing escarpments (Figure SE-2).          The only
   potential area within the City Limits is the escarpment that runs in an
   east-west direction in the southern portion of the City .
   Liquefaction
   Liquefaction' potential from groundshaking is generally low in the Planning
   Area due to the relatively deep groundwater levels that are ordinarily
   over 10 feet below the ground surface. However, several areas of perc~ed
   groundwater in the vicinity of the Santa Maria Public Airport could cause
   liquefaction during an earthquake (Figure SE-2).
   Subsidence
   The Santa Haria area has not had significant subsidence 'o problems despite
   historical oil drilling in the area. Although subsidence could occur, it
   is perceived to be an insignificant risk due the absence of reported
   problems .   Since both oil drilling by private parties and groundwater
   extraction largely by private parties have occurred in the southern
   portion of the city, pumping activities will be considered in the event
   subsidence problems occur.
   Expansive soi1s'1
   Based on the wSoil Survey of Northern Santa Barbara Area, California w,
   United States Department of Agriculture, July 1972, the following soils in
   the planning area have a moderate to high potential for expansiveness:
         Narlon sand (NvC), hardpan variant - Low to high potential.
         Pleasanton Bandy loam (PnA, PnC) - Low to moderate potential .
         Sorrento loam (SvA, SvC) - Moderate potential.
   Figure SE-2 shows the general location of these Boils.

   On December 5, 1989, the Santa Maria City Council adopted an unreinforced
   masonry implementation ordinance '2 • The ordinance adopted standards and

     Radon Gas
     Santa Barbara County has been designated as Zone 1 which is the zone with
     the highest potential for radon concentrations.                The EPA and the State
    Department of Health Services decided to designate Santa Barbara County as
     Zone 1 based on the elevated radon levels that are associated with the
    Rincon Shale geologic formation.            This rock unit is widely scattered
     across southern Santa Barbara County, but is not present in the Santa
    Karia area.
    Although the above information appears quite specific, it cannot be
    applied to determine radon levels of a neighborhood, housing tract, or
    individual house.        The only way to determine if a house has elevated
    indoor radon levels is to test. Testing consists of gathering a sample of
    air and having it analyzed for radon gas.
    Damage Scenario
    Based on the City's proximity to the southern San Andreas Fault (40 miles)
    and other unmapped underground faults, and considering the soil structure
    of the area, the Planning Area could receive a shaking intensity that
    could cause the overthrow of movable objects, the falling of plaster,
    general panic,     and damage to buildings.           For most of Santa Karia,     the
    intensity of this anticipated earthquake could cause disruption beyond
    anything    recently    experienced     in  the    area    and   would require   total
    integrated planning and response from both the public and private sectors
    in order to minimize possible deaths, injuries and property destruction .
    u.s.   Highway 101. Considerable damage to road surfaces, overpasses and
    bridges    would    be  expected    in   all    areas    of   liquefaction,   possibly
    restricting east-west access to and from the Marian Medical Center.
    Airport. The Santa Maria Airport would be seriously affected due to its
    location in an area that is subject to liquefaction because of the sandy
    lIoil and high     (perched) water table .         It is questionable whether the
    airport could      be used for any major logistical resupply except by
    helicopter.
    Santa Maria Valley Railroad/Southern Pacific Railroad. Southern Pacific
    mainline railroad service would be disrupted by surface ruptures,
    landslides, rockfalls, failures of overpasses and slides at the ends of
    tunnels.     It is doubtful that rail service to Santa Maria could be
    restored in less than 8 to 10 days.
    Electrical Power. A short term, and potentially long term effect, would be
    major power outages and power reductions in most areas of the Central
    Coast. Those lines that remain intact might be rendered temporarily out
                                           5.7

   of service after each aftershock . The major long-term impact would be on
   distant power sources, both due to the reduction in transmission
   capacities and the probable shortage of generator fuel.       Transmission
   lines in santa Karia would stand a good chance of being one of the earlier
   facilities restored.
   Natural Gas . Major pipelines leading to the area as well as those in the
   area could be ruptured.     It is uncertain how long the areas could be
   supported by underground storage.
   Petroleum Fuels. The processing of petroleum fuels in the area is
   uncertain. If this source of fuels became unavailable, extremely serious
   consequences could result due to the inability to resupply fuels by land
   transport.
   Telephone Systems. Any surviving telephone service would be overloaded by
   calls from both inside and outside the area .
   Radio Systems.   Public safety radio systems would continue to function
   within the Planning .Area. Microwave channels would be disrupted.
   Commercial Broadcasters. Lack of emergency power would restrict the
   operation of some television and radio stations.    The scarcity of fuels
   and the unavailability of resupply would limit the operational time of
   emergency generators.
   Water Supply and waste Disposal. A major earthquake would seriously
   disrupt the water distribution system .    The Wastewater Treatment Plant
   would probably suffer some damage and could be inoperative.        Lack of
   electrical power also would cause the plant to shut down.       Collection
   lines throughout the area could be impaired causing significant contamina-
   tion problems.
2. Flooding/Dam Inundation
   Flooding hazards within the Planning Area consist of localized and
   widespread flooding due to storms, failure of the santa Karia Levee, and
   from dam inundation caused by the failure of Twitchell Dam. The potential
   for flooding and dam inundation comes from storm water that is collected
   in the 260 square mile Santa Maria Valley watershed that is located in
   both Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo Counties.    The Sisquoc River and
   Cuyama River watersheds combine to form the Santa Karia Valley watershed.
   FlOOding
   The flooding associated with the 100-year storm is of primary consider-
   ation.   The 100-year flood determination is the accepted standard for
   flood protection by agencies involved in the assessment of flood risks.
   The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), in their issuance
   of flood insurance as part of the Flood Protection Disaster Act of 1974,
   has adopted the 100-year flood level as the determinant of the floodplain
   area having a hazard potential requiring specific or protective measures .
   The City has also adopted the 100-year flood plain through its participa-
   tion in the Flood Insurance Rate Program administered by the Federal
   Emergency Management Agency.
   Flood prone areas in the Planning Area are noted in Figure SE-3. The 100-
   year flood plain is generally in the areas of the Santa Maria River and
   the Orcutt Creek.    The Santa Maria River Levee, built by the U.S. Army
   Corp of Engineers, is designed to protect the City from the 100-year
   flood.   The Flood Control District patrols the levee any time there is
   more than a few hundred cubic feet per second flowing in the river. Levee
   erosion has been experienced and if the levee was allowed to rupture,
   would create major flooding problems east of u.S. Highway 101. However,
   the levee does not prevent localized flooding from the various flood
   control facilities in the Planning Area. These local facilities include
   a series of storm drains, open channels, and retardation basins.
   Localized flooding cannot be accurately mapped as it depends on the
   magnitude and location of the causative storm.

   Dam Inundation
   Twitchell Dam is the closest potential source of dam inundation in the
   Planning Area.    However, Twitchell Dam is not used for perennial water
   storage.   The dam was constructed by the Bureau of Reclamation in 1958,
   and is primarily used for groundwater recharge and flood control.     It is
   an earthfill darn, 216 feet in height, with a storage capacity of over
   240,000 acre-feet. If Twitchell Darn is filled to capacity and the darn and
   the Santa Maria Levee fail, a significant portion of the City would be
   inundated by flood waters.'3     However, the probability of total dam
   failure and levee failure is remote.     In addition, the dam holds water
   only periodically and is not a reservoir.
3. Wildland and Urban Fires
   Fires in undeveloped areas usually result from the ignition of grasses and
   brush material, and are often referred to as wildland fires.      Wildland
   fires in the santa Maria Planning Area are characterized as limited
   grassland and brush fires due to the absence of extensive tracts of
   mountainous, brush covered terrain. Factors influencing wildland fires in
   the Planning area are climate, vegetation, slope and human proximity.
   The most significant wildland fire hazards in the Planning Area         are
   associated with the coastal sage scrub and grass covered slopes in      the
   Casmalia and Solomon Hills to the south of the City.     In this area,  the
   factors of vegetation, slope, and human proximity interact to create    the
   most significant relative level of risk.
   The oak savannah hillsides to the east of U. S. 101 and north of Clark
   Avenue represent another wildland fire hazard area. The native vegetation
   which remains in this general location could ignite and create a localized
   hazard~   A fire in this vicinity would not be as vigorous as a similar
   outbreak in the Casmalia or Solomon Hills.
   The Santa Maria Valley Oil Field represents another type of fire risk.
   The presence of flammable liquids and spark producing machinery create the
   possibility of fire initially fueled by residual petroleum that could
   spread to grasses and weeds growing near wells and pipelines.
   The remaining areas of Santa Maria are generally protected from most
   aspects of grassland and brush fires. However, accumulating weeds along
   roadsides and in vacant lots make even urban locations potentially
   hazardous from a wildland fire standpoint.         For these reasons, an
   enforceable weed abatement program is necessary to reduce these risks
   whenever structures are present.
   The risk of urban fires is no greater than any other area. Fire codes and
   building setback restrictions are enforced along with the previously
   mentioned weed abatement program.
4. Electromagnetic Fields
   Electromagnetic energy occurs over a broad range of frequencies.        The
   frequencies, or Hertz (Hz), within the planning area range from 60 Hz
   associated with power transmission and electrical appliances to 3 x 10'0
   Hz associated with microwaves.     In between these frequencies are EMFs
   generated by radio, television, and radar transmissions. In recent years,
   electric and magnetic fields (EMF) from these uses have come under
   scientific scrutiny regarding possible effects on human health.
   EMF fields are found whenever electricity is used. This includes not only
   utility transmission and distribution lines, but also in the building
   wires in homes, offices and schools and in the appliances and machinery
   used in these locations. While concerns about EMF originally focused on
!3

                                   S.lO
 electric fields,   much of the recent research has focused on magnetic
 fields.
 The medical and scientific communities have been unable to determine that
 EMF causes adverse health effects or to establish any standard or level of
 exposure that is known to be either safe or harmful.     Some studies have
 suggested an association between magnetic fields and certain cancers,
 while others have not.    Laboratory experLments have shown that magnetic
 fields can cause biologic changes in living cells, but scientists are not
 sure whether this poses a risk to human health.
 Numerous reports were released in 1992,    1993, and 1994, regarding EMFs .
 None of these reports have concluded      that EMFs cause adverse health
 effects nor did they feel standards were appropriate or reasonable at this
 time.   However, these reports have not   ruled out that EMFs could cause
 adverse health effects.
 No national, international or state long term exposure health-based EMF
 standards or regulations have been developed. Both the State Department
 of Health Services (DHS) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
 have stated that standards are not recommended at this time.
On January 15, 1991, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC)
 opened an investigation to consider its role in mitigating health effects,
 if any, of EMFs from utility facilities and power lines. A working group
of interested parties, called the California EMF Consensus Group, was
created by the CPUC to advise it on this issue.
Based on the work of the Consensus Group, written testimony, and
evidentiary hearings, the CPUC in November 1993, issued an interim
decision (93-11-01) to address public concern about possible EMF health
effects from electric utility facilities. Among the findings:
1)     We find that the body of scientific evidence continues to evolve.
       However, it is recognized that public concern and scientific
       uncertainty remain regarding the potential health effects of EMF
       exposure.
2)     We do not find it appropriate to adopt any specific numerical
       standard in association with EMF until we have a firm scientific
       basis for adopting any particular value.
Pacific, Gas and Electric (PG&E) is the local utility company that
provides electrical power in the Planning Area. Since 1987, PG&E has had
written company policies regarding EMF.      PG&E has supported and funded
medical, scientific and industry research on EMF for several years, and is
continuing to do so.
Planning Area EMFs
Sources of EMF radiation in the Planning Area include electrical
transmission lines, above and below ground electrical distribution lines,
electric appliances, electric wiring in buildings, and electric industrial
and office equipment.     Any item associated with electricity gives off
EMFs .
PG&E electrical transmission lines in the Planning Area are shown in
Figure 5E-4.     Thes~ overhead lines basically follow Railroad Avenue,
Blosser Road, and Battles Road. These lines have a frequency of 60 Hz and
a voltage of 115 kilovolts.     Figure SE-S depicts the magnetic field at
various distances from an electrical transmission line.
PG&E electrical distribution lines form a grid throughout the Planning
Area. These lines also have a frequency of 60 Hz but have a voltage of 12
kilovolts. Both underground and aboveground lines generate EKFs. Figure
SE-5 shows the magnetic field at various distances from an overhead
distribution line.

5. Oil Wells and Oil Sumps
   Oil production was one of the founding industries of the Santa Maria
   Valley . Two oil fields are located in the Planning Area: the Santa Maria
   Valley Field, and the Orcutt Field.    TheBe two fields contain over 1400
   active and abandoned oil and injection wells.         Generally, the oil
   producing area is located south of Stowell Road.               .
   The source for local oil regulations is the Santa Barbara County Petroleum
   Ordinance No. 2795 (adopted in 1976, as amended), Regulations for
   Drillino, Producing. Operating. and Abandoning Petroleum Wells. Chapter
   11 of Title 9 of the City's Municipal Code adopts the County ordinance as
   the "petroleum ordinance" of the City of Santa Maria.     Chapter 11 also
   amends certain portions of the County's ordinance to apply specifically to
   the City of Santa Maria. The City has contracted with the County so that
   the County Petroleum Engineer acts in that capacity for the City.
   New facilities (wells, tanks, etc.) must follow applicable -regulations,
   including the Uniform Fire Code, and require permits from the County
   Petroleum Department and/or the California Division of Oil, Gas, and
   Geothermal Resources (CDOGGR).    In addition, new facilities cannot be
   located within certain distances from roadways and existing buildings.
   Abandonment of existing oil wells follow the applicable regulations of the
   County Petroleum Department and the CDOGGR.
   In the event that the County Petroleum Department and/or the State
   Supervisor of Oil , Gas, and Geothermal Resources determines at any time
   that any well, or other operations covered by the ordinances, is
   endangering any fresh water body or strata, or that any oil field
   construction, improvement, or operation constitutes a safety hazard, or a
   substantial nuisance to the public, the County Petroleum Department or the
   State Supervisor of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources shall have the
   right to compel the operator to make such modifications as may be required
   to correct such condition.
   All oil field waste derived or resulting from, or connected with, the
   drilling or producing of any well, shall be discharged into a sump
   impervious to fluids. Such discharges shall be removed from the drill site
   to authorized locations upon completion of the drilling.
   Prior to enactment of County Petroleum Ordinance No. 2795, oil wells and
   associated facilities and Bumps were not abandoned in accordance with
   current regulations.    Improperly abandoned wells, improperly abandoned
   facilities, and abandoned oil sumps are all potential sources of safety
   hazards.
   Prior to current abandonment procedures, oil wells were cut off below
   ground and capped.     However, this procedure may not comply with the
   current abandonment standards. Improperly capped wells have the potential
   to leak methane gas which poses an explosion hazard,     Section 3208.1 of
   the Public Resources Code authorizes the State Oil and Gas Supervisor to
   order the reabandonment of any previously abandoned well when construction
   of any structure over or near the well could result in a hazard.    If the
   well is not reabandoned, sufficient clearance should be maintained between
   permanent structures and the well to allow future access.
   The City's policy regarding abandoned oil wells depends on whether the
   well has been abandoned properly.        If the well has been abandoned
   properly, or will be reabandoned, as determined by the CDOGGR, a ten .foot
   wide radius "no build" easement measured from the well head shall be
   recorded when the well is on residentially zoned property.        For non-
    residential property, the property owner has the choice of recording the
    10 wide "no build" easement around the well, or installing a CDOGGR
   approved venting system over the well in which case a structure may be
   built over the well.
                                   S.14
    If the well will not be reabandoned, then a 10 foot wide radius "no build"
    easement is required to be recorded around the well for all properties,
    and the distance requirements of the CDOGGR must also be followed (see
    Figure 17 of the technical appendix) .
    In many cases, associated oil well facilities like pipes, concrete slabs,
    and equipment were abandoned in place and covered over with soil.     This
    has led to subsidence problems when structures are built over these sites.
    These areas, when discovered, are required to be removed and the soil
    recompacted.
   Most oil wells had associated oil sump areas where waste fluids and oil
   were deposited. In the past, these oil sumps were buried and not removed.
   Placement of structures over these areas could force the oil and waste
    fluids to the surface and will also contaminate the soil.
   As part of the discretionary review process, the City requires a Phase I
   Environmental Assessment (EA) for all properties that have an existing or
    abandoned oil well, or are known to have oil drilling operations as shown
    in the Resource Management Element of the General Plan.
   However,   if a clearance letter from the State Division of Oil, Gas,    and
   Geothermal Resources and/or the State Regional Water Quality Control Board
   is provided, a Phase I EA will not be required unless evidence of further
   soil contamination is discovered.
   The City requires that all oil sumps or contaminated soil be remediated in
   accordance with State and county procedures.     The state Regional Water
   Quality Control Board has the ·p rimary responsibility for overseeing the
   remediation process.
6. Landfill Gas Migration
   The City of Santa Maria owns and operates a sanitary landfill located in
   the northeast portion of the City. In addition, abandoned landfill areas
   are located underneath Preisker Park and around the Santa Maria Public
   Airport.    A hazard associated with existing and abandoned landfills is
   underground methane gas migration.
   Landfill gas (LFG) results from the anaerobic'· decomposition of organic
   materials" within a landfill.       LFG is typically composed of 50 to
   60 percent methane, 40 to 50 percent carbon dioxide and small percentages
   of other gases including nitrogen, propane, butane, ethane and chlorinated
   hydrocarbons and other organic gases.
   The methane gas component of LFG can be explosive when concentrations
   reach a range of S to lS percent by volume in air and are confined in an
   enclosed space with sufficient oxygen to Bustain ignition.         Ignition
   sources may include a spark from a standard light switch.    In confined or
   semi-confined enclosures, methane and carbon dioxide may accumulate and
   create an asphyxiation hazard through oxygen displacement.
   California Code of Regulations (CCR) under Title 14, Chapter 3, Article 7
   apply to LFG production,   containment, control, and utilization at Class
   III sanitary landfill sites. The CCR "Minimum Standards" are enforced by
   the California Integrated Waste Management Board (CIWKB) and the Local
   Enforcement Agency (LEA) .   For the City of Santa Maria, the LEA is the
   Santa Barbara County Environmental Health Division.
"  Living and reproducing in the absence of atmospheric oxygen
IS
   In the case of a landfill, "organic materials" refers to food waste,
   garden clippings, and other waste containing carbon-based compounds
                                    S.15

   LFG subsurface migration can be controlled through the natural containment
   properties of surrounding soils, a low permeability liner and by an LFG recovery
   system.
   The Santa Maria Sani tary Landfill consists of an active and inactive area. T -
   i nactive area has a low LFG generation potential since a low volume of refuse ".
   deposited here , the refuse was burned, and the burned refuse is very old . The
   highest potential for LFG migration occurs at the active portion of the landfill.
   The santa Maria sanitary Landfill currently relies on natural Boil containment
   of LFG.    As part of an Air Solid Waste Assessment Test' · (SWAT) conducted for
   the landfill, elevated levels of methane ranging from 9.1 to 40.7 percent parts
   per million by volume (ppbv) were detected in four out of 20 perimeter soil gas
   monitoring probes. Two of the probes were located adjacent to the Santa Maria
   River levee, where the gas poses no significant threat to health and safety. The
   other two probes were located near the southeastern boundary of the active
   portion of the landfill, near some existing farm structures.
   A subsequent landfill gas study conducted in 1992 detected methane in 11 of the
   33 sample locations on the active portion of the landfill. Methane concentra-
   tions at these sites ranged from 29 to 62 percent ppbv.        Most of the higher
   methane concentrations were located in the current disposal area of the landfill.
   The highest LFG concentration on the landfill property was recorded near the
   southwestern boundary, which indicates that LFG mi gration may have occurred off-
   site. The city has assumed for investigation purposes that landfill gas has
   migrated across the facility boundary.    The level and extent of this migration
   is being studied.    The city is taking appropriate steps to protect the public
   health and safety and to comply with regulations governing landfills.
   Potential safety impacts from LFG generation and migration include explosive
   hazards to on-site and off-site structures, toxic gas emissions, ground water
   contamination, and damage to vegetation.
   Continued and expanded waste disposal operations at the Santa Karia Sanita-
   Landfill will increase the amount of refuse placed in the landfill and t .
   subsequent volume of LFG that is produced. Any LFG that does manage to migrate
   from the existing landfill or future expansion areas has the potential to
   concentrate in structures on or near the landfill. If either on-site or off-site
   structures overlie the path of methane gas migration, a potential for methane
   accumulations beneath or with i n such structures may result in explosive
   concentration levels (between 5 and 15 percent by volume) . Such concentrations
   in combination with ignition sources (electrical outlets, space heaters) could
   result in a significant safety hazard .
   The nearest off-site structure is a building located approximately 200 feet to
   the west of the active portion of the landfill.        The nearest residences are
   located within a mobile home park and the Sierra Vista Estates project located
   approximately 200 feet to the southwest of the inactive portion of the landfill .
   The proximity of these structures to the landfill could result in potential gas
   migration impacts.     However, the gas migration potential in this area of the
    inactive landfill is considered extremely low .
7. Saf e Drinking Water Levels
    In 1974, the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act (Act) was passed to establish
    standards for public drinking water .   In 1986, the Act was amended to further
    safegua.rd the sources and treatment of water.      The Environmental Protection
   Agency (EPA) and the State Department of Health Services (SDHS) set quality
    standards which require water suppliers to monitor and treat public drinking
   water for potentially harmful contaminants .
   Drinking water standards in California are placed in two categories: pr~ary and
    secondary.   Safe levels are established for each contaminant in each categor~
    Primary standards specifically relate      to your health and are generali
,.  Anthrosphere, Inc ., 1988
                                     S.16

    based on health effects which may occur if a person were to drink two liters  0 :
    water each day for 70 years .
    Secondary standards relate to aesthetic qualities of water,     including taste
    odor, and color.
    These standards, which are referred to as Maximum Contaminant Levels (NeLs), arl
    continually reviewed and lowered, as lower detection lev els become possibl l
    through innovations in laboratory technology.
    Drinking water is provided to the Planning Area by the City of Santa Maria an,
    the California-Cities Water company. The City of Santa Maria serves the majorit :
    of users within the City Limits along with areas outside the City Limits subjec1
    to City Council approval through an OUtside Users Utility Agreement.         Th,
    California-Cities Water company primarily serves the orcutt area and soml
    southern portions within the City Limits.      The source of drinking water i l
    groundwater beneath the Planning Area . Both water purveyors have numerous weIl l
    drilled into the groundwater basin.    Please refer to the Resources Managemen1
    Element of the General Plan for a complete description of water supply an'
    groundwater resources.
    The treatment of groundwater is currently minimal. Both the City and California-
    Cities Water Company only disinfect the water. The drinking water supply of bot]
   water purveyors does not violate any water quality standard set by the State 0 :
    California or the Environmental Protection Agency.
    If overdrafting of the groundwater basin continues, additional treatment of Cit ~
   water may be needed because of increased total dissolved solid (TOS) levels iJ
   the groundwater . Additional treatment will also be needed when the State Wate:
   Project water becomes available. The additional treatment will occur at a wate:
   treatment plant to be built in San Luis Obispo county.
8. Aircraft Safety
   The Santa Maria Public Airport is located within the southern portion of the Cit:
   of Santa Maria.    The airport provides facilities for commuter airlines whicl
   serve Santa Maria with propeller driven aircraft.      Four fixed base operator I
   exist that offer flight instruction, aircraft rental and repair, and refuelinl
   services.   The airport is served by an Federal Aviation Administration (FAA
   control tower . In 1990, 178 general aviation aircraft were based at the airport
   The airport has two runways: Runway 12-30 (primary runway); and Runway 2-21
    (secondary runway).   Runway 12-30 is used by air carrier aircraft and heav:
   general aviation aircraft. The precision instrument approach is to Runway 12
   from the northwest . Runway 2-20 is primarily used by general aviation aircraf'
   and during cross wind conditions .
   Hazard Zones
   The Airport Area of Influence is divided into three areas of major concern
   height restrictions, safety, and noise. These concerns are grouped into threl
   hazard zones around an airport. Haz.ard Zone I deals with height restrictions an
   is also the boundary of the Airport Area of Influence. Hazard Zone II contain
   policies regarding safety as well as height. Policies regarding height, safety
   and noise apply in Hazard Zone III.     These zones are defined in the followin·
   text, and are shown on Figure SE-6.
   Hazard Zone I defines the airspace requirement of an airport. Height limitatio:
   of structures within this zone is defined by an Lroaginary conical surface an,
   horizontal plane extending out from the end of the runway. The outer margin 0
   the horizontal surface 150 feet above the established airport elevation define
   the boundary of this zone.

    Safety restrictions, as well as height restrictions, apply in Hazard Zone
    II. Hazard Zone II is divided into three safety areas which are based on
    degree of hazard. These safety areas are shown on Figure SE-7.
          Safety Area 1 (Clear Zonel. This is the most restrictive area as it
          is subject to the greatest danger. Clear zones are fan-shaped areas
          just beyond each runway end that are to be kept clear of any
          nonessential objects. They provide an additional margin of safety
          for aircraft landing on or departing from the runway.
          In order to comply with Safety Area 1 (clear zone) requirements and
          minimize conflicting land uses near the airport runways, the City
          has a Clear Zone zoning designation that is located at the ends of
          both airport runways (Figure SE-7).
          Safety Area 2 (Airport Approach) . This area is an extension of the
          clear zone in which uses that do not result in the concentration of
          people or a particular fire hazard are generally allowed.
          In order to comply with Safety Area 2 requirements, the City has
          developed the Airport Approach overlay designation (Figure SE-7).
          This overlay establishes regulations to minLmize the hazard to safe
          landing and take-off of aircraft by limiting the height of buildings
          and uses within these areas. Allowed land uses within this zone are
          described in the Land Use Element of the General Plan. These uses
          include airport services,      light industrial,   heavy commercial
          manufacturing, and lower density residential.
          Safety Area 3 (Generall. This area encompasses the remainder of
          Hazard Zone II and is the least restrictive.     This is the area in
          which airport traffic patterns occur (Figures SE-6 and SE-7).
   Within Hazard Zone III, land uses will be influenced by aircra'f t noise as
   well as height restrictions and safety.      The boundary of this zone is
   determined by using the California Airport Noise Standard which sets forth
   the boundary as the 65 dB Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) contour.
   Generally, residential uses, schools, hospitals, institutional uses and
   other uses that support a large concentration of people are prohibited in
   this zone.
   Aircraft Safety
   Nationwide, approxLmately 50 percent of civilian aircraft accidents occur
   within airport boundaries. Approximately 15 percent occur outside airport
   boundaries but within one mile of airports.        Of these near airport
   accidents, approximately 60 percent are concentrated within narrow strips
   of land at both ends of the runway. 17
   Santa Barbara County has experienced no crashes involving public or
   scheduled air carriers in recent years.       From 1960-1985, six forced
   landings have occurred at the Santa Maria Public Airport, all on airport
   property" (Figure SE-6).     Information from the National Transportation
   Safety Board indicates that since 1985, only one nonfatal incident
   occurred on airport property (the exact location is not known). ,.

     The runway clear zones (Safety Area 1) are all within airport property and
     are free from obstructions.   The airport approach overlay areas (Safety
    Area 2) are also considered safe. Operational flexibility, however, has
    been compromised by urban encroachment to the north, east, and south of
    the airport.    Runway 12 is rarely used for takeoffs due to the need of
    departing aircraft to climb out over urbanized areas. Commercial carriers
    typically do not land in the opposite direction on the same runway to
    avoid final approaches over the same urbanized area.      Thus, safety has
    been achieved through operational limits which do not allow the best use
    of airport facilities.
    Any aircraft incident could potentially be disastrous, resulting in injury
    or deaths. As noted previously, the potential for an aircraft incident is
    higher during the approach or departure portion of a flight than while an
    aircraft is at cruising altitude. This is due to aircraft being closer to
    the ground and to potential obstructions, heavier concentration of other
    aircraft in the vicinity of airports, and additional pilot workload at
    these times.
    Although it is impossible to predict precisely how many and where future
    incidents will occur, it can be assumed that approximately 65 percent of
    all aircraft accidents will occur within 1 mile of the airport as noted
    earlier. Of these accidents, a vast majority will occur on or within 200
    feet of the runway or taxiway, along the primary approach and departure
    flight tracks, or beneath a traffic pattern.     Nonetheless, the risk of
    incident at any particular location cannot be predicted with complete
    certainty.
9.  Hazardous Materials
   Hazardous materials are found throughout the Planning Area.        Used for
   various purposes, these materials can become dangerous if spilled,
    inappropriately used or disposed, or otherwise exposed to the public or
   the environment improperly.     Federal, state, and local laws require the
   proper use,     transportation,   treatment,  and disposal of hazardous
   materials.
   The use and storage of hazardous materials is primarily regulated by the
   Uniform Fire Code. Transport of hazardous materials and waste on public
   streets is primarily regulated by the California Vehicle Code and the
   Cityl s Municipal Code .    Storage and disposal of hazardous wastes is
   primarily regulated by the santa Barbara County Environmental Health
   Services Division through their Hazardous Waste Generator Program as
   authorized by the State Health and Safety Code.
   Hazardous materials are used by numerous businesses in the Planning Area.
   Typical businesses include, but are not limited to, hospitals , dry
   cleaners, auto repair facilities, exterminators, medical labs, photograph-
   ic studies, and gas stations.         On a smaller scale, single family
   residences also use and store hazardous materials (pesticides, fertiliz-
   ers, drain cleaners, etc.).
   Any business that stores hazardous materials in accordance with Article 80
   of the Uniform Fire Code must provide either a haz.ardous materials
   inventory statement (HMIS) or a hazardous materials management plan (HKMP)
   to the Fire Chief of the City of Santa Maria and the County of santa
   Barbara.    In addition, the City of Santa Haria Fire Department and the
   County of Santa Barbara Environmental Heal.th Services (EHS) require a
   Business Plan in accordance with State Regulations for businesses that
   store and use hazardous waste.
   Santa Barbara County's Site Mitigation Program administered by the EHS is
   responsible for the supervision of cleanup at contaminated sites
   throughout the County, including sites within the City Limits.          The
   objective of the program is to identify contaminated sites, and to find a
   permanent remedy that is technologically feasible and reliable that
   effectively reduces the danger of contamination, and that adequately
                                    S.21
   protects public health, welfare, and the environment. A large percentage
   of the contaminated sites within the County are discovered by hazardous
   materials specialists while overseeing the abandonment of underground
   storage tanks . Site mitigation activities are also initiated as a result
   of complaints, inspections, tank tightness tests, and emergency respo nses.
   The Planning Area has approximately 27 active underground tank cleanup
   sites and 29 active site mitigation cleanup sites according to the EHS's
   -Listing of Underground Tank Cleanup Sites" and "Listing of Site
   Mitigation Cleanup Sites," both reports as of August 9, 1995.
   Once a potential contaminated site has been discovered, an evaluation to
   determine the extent of contamination at the site is . conducted and
   information sufficient to identify the moat appropriate response are
   developed.      A typical evaluation consists of six phases:         initial
   investigation; site assessment and characterization; remedial action;
   evaluation; public notification; and remediation.
   The santa Maria sanitary Landfill currently operates a household hazardous
   waste transfer and storage facility. This facility is open to the public
   two days per month. In addition to collecting household hazardous waste,
   the facility conducts random, solid waste load checks for hazardous
   materials.
   The landfill does not service ha~ardous waste generated by commerc i al and
   industrial uses.     Businesses must hire a haz ardous waste transporter to
   dispose of their hazardous wastes.      This waste is either transported to
   the Chemical Waste Management/Kettleman Hills facility (north), or to a
   transfer stat i on in Southern California, where it is Shipped out of state4
   Hazardous materials transported into or through the Planning Area include
   such commodities as the hypergolic fuel trucked to Vandenberg Air Force
   Baae, anhydrous ammonia, gasoline, explosives, and aviation fue1 4 Natural
   gas liquids and liquid petroleum gases (e.g . propane, butane) are also
   transported through the Planning Area to Bakersfield, Los Angeles, and the
   Bay Area.
   Hazardous materials that are radioactive, poisonous, or explosive are
   limited to using State Highway 101 through the Planning Area . ~      Within
   the City Limits, transport of any hazardous waste is prohibited on Donovan
   Road, Stowell Road, Main Street-State Highway 166, and Broadway-State
   Highway 135. 21   However, these streets may be used for the transport of
   hazardous waste subject to the following exceptions :
   1)    They provide reasonable access to fuel, repair, rest, or food
         facilities designed and intended to accommodate commercial vehicle
         parking when access ia consistent with safe vehicle operation and
         the facility is within one-half road mile of points of entry from a
         state or interstate highway being used.
   2)    Hazardou8 wastes which have a point of origin within the City
         Limits.     Partially loaded waste vehicles may drive upon these
         streets when the vehicles have a destination within the City Limits.
   Several steps are taken to ensure public safety when a hazardous materials
   spill occurs.     If the spill is severe, or an ilIInediate threat to the
   public, City Fire Department personnel will respond to the situation. The
   City Fire Department responds to several hazardous spill calls each year .
   California Vehicle Code and California Code of Regulations

   Chapter 13 of Title 7 of the Santa Maria Municipal Code
                                    5 .2 2
     If contamination of a site is discovered during the City ' B review of a
     project, either during plancheck or inspection, the City will notify t he
     EHS.     The City then requires a clearance letter from the EHS before
     permits will be issued or a project is finaled.        The EHS is the lead
     agency involved and the City defers to them regarding hazardous material
     discoveries.
     Hazardous Materials Emergencies
     The increasing volume and variety of hazardous materials that are
     generated, stored or transported through the Planning Area have created
     potential threats to human health and the environment.             Hazardous
    materials incidents differ from other emergency situations because of the
     unpredictable nature and the possibility of long range toxic effects.
     Incidents may occur at fixed facilities where the opportunity for the
     development of site-specific contingency plans is great.       They may also
     occur at any place along any land, water or air transportation route and
    may occur in remote or treacherous areas, relatively inaccessible by
    ground transportation.
    Although incidents may occur anywhere at any time, certain portions of the
    Planning Area are more likely to be the site of an accident involving
    hazardous materials.
    u.s. Highway 101. u.s. Highway 101 is the primary truck route from Los
    Angeles to coastal central California. Materials shipped include rocket
    fuel, explosives, compressed and liquified gasses, petroleum products,
    agricultural chemicals, industrial chemicals and hazardous waste.
    Betteravia Road. Betteravia Road is the main link from u.s. Highway 101 to
    the western portion of the Planning Area, the Casmalia hazardous waste
    facility, and the area ' s agricultural industries. This route passes very
    few residential areas at this time but does traverse several blocks of
    commercial establishments and several miles of industrial and agricultural
    land uses.
    Railroads. The main north-south Southern Pacific line is located nine
    miles west of the City. The industrial core of the City is served by the
    Santa Maria valley Railroad which carries agricultural products out of the
    area . Some petroleum products are transported to the main line from the
    east side of town through a mixture of reSidential, industrial , and
    commercial land uses.
    Airport Industrial Zones. The airport area contains electronic component
    manufacturers, aircraft repair shops and specialized research facilities .
    Solvents, etching agents, stored fuel a~d radioactive material may be
    encountered.
10. Emergency Services
    The City of Santa Haria's role and responsibilities in an emergency are
    described in Chapter 17 of Title 2 of the Municipal Code (Emergency
    Services) .    Detailed procedures and tactics are provided in the Multi-
    hazard Functional Plan (Plan). as adopted by City Council Resolution No.
    89-25 .    This manual was revised by the City in October 1993 .     The Plan
    conforms to the State's emergency preparedness plans and is an extension
    of those plans. The City has alao adopted the California Master Mutual
    Aid Agreement by Resolution No. 79-4845.
    The City's emergency     procedures    will be activated  under  any  of  the
    following conditions:
    1)      On the order of the City's Director of Emergency Services, provided
            that the existence or threatened existence of a Local Emergency has
            been proclaimed in accordance with the City's Emergency Services
            Ordinance.
    2)      When the Governor has proclaimed a State of Emergency in an area
            that includes the City of Santa Maria.
    3)      By a presidential declaration of a National Emergency .
                                      S .2 3
4)     Automatically on receipt of an attack warning or the observation of
       a nuclear detonation.
For planning purposes, the State Office of Emergency Services (OES) has
established three levels of emergency response to peacetime emergencies
which are based on the severity of the situation and the availability of
local resources (these levels do not directly correlate with the four
classifications of nuclear power emergencies).
Leve 1 I.    A minor to   moderate incident wherein local resources are
adequate and available.   A Local Emergency mayor may not be proclaimed.
Level II. A moderate to severe emergency wherein local resources are not
adequate and mutual aid may be required on a regional or statewide basis.
A Local Emergency will be proclaimed and a State of Emergency might be
proclaimed.
Level III.    A major disaster wherein resources in or near the impacted
area are overwhelmed and extensive state and/or federal resources are
required. A Local Emergency and a State Emergency will be proclaimed and
a Presidential declaration of an Emergency or Kajor Disaster will be
requested.
Local emergency operations in the City of Santa Maria will be managed in
one of three modes, depending on the magnitude of the emergency:
Decentralized Coordination and Direction; Centralized Coordination
Decentralized Direction; and Centralized Coordination and Direction
(Please see the technical appendix for a definition of these terms).
The standardized Emergency Management System (EMS) consists of the
emergency management staffs of all local jurisdictions, Operational Areas
(Countywide), OES Mutual Aid Regions (two or more counties) and State
Government. Local jurisdictions would be responsible for directing and/or
coordinating emergency operations, with the other levels being responsible
for coordinating and/or providing support to the local jurisdictions.
Under the standardized Emergency Management System, the City' s Local
Emergency Management Staff will be directed by the Emergency Services
Director (City Manager), who will be responsive to the City Council. The
Director will be supported by the Emergency Services Coordinator, section
Chiefs and functional Operations Coordinators.
The Santa Maria Emergency Management        Staff  will  have  the  overall
responsibility for the following:
1)     Organizing, staffing, and operating the EOC.
2)     Operating communications and warning systems.
3)     Providing information and guidance to the public.
4)     Maintaining information on the status of resources, services, and
       operations.
5)     Directing overall operations.
6)     Obtaining support for the jurisdiction, and providing support to
       other jurisdictions as required.
7)     Analyzing contamination and other hazards and recommending appropri-
       ate countermeasures.
8)     Collecting, evaluating, and disseminating damage assessment and
       other essential information.
9)     Providing status and other reports to the Operational Area Emergency
       Management Staff (if activated) or the OES Mutual Aid Regional
       Office.
Overall management and coordination of the City's response to emergency
situations is handled by the Emergency Services Director.          The City
Manager acts as the Emergency Services Director under authority from the
City council.
                                 S.24
  The Emergency Services Director is assisted in managing and coordinating
 emergency response efforts by the Emergency Services Coordinator.       The
 Emergency Services Coordinator position is filled by the Administrative
 Analyst .
 Incident Command System
 Emergency procedures in the City of Santa Maria follow the Incident
 Command System (ICS).    ICS is a management system des igned to appoint
 personnel to specific emergency operational activities .
 Santa Maria's ICS Command Staff is made up of the following personnel:
 Incident Commander (City Manager)
 Public Information Officer (City Librarian)
 Liaison Officer (City Clerk)
 Legal Officer (City Attorney)
 Immediately under the Command Staff is the General Staff .  This is made up
 of the following personnel:
Operations Section Chief (Police/Fire Chief)
 Planning Section Chief (Community Development Director)
Logistics Section Chief (Recreation and Parks Director)
 Finance Section Chief (Finance Director)
The Incident Commander (IC) has overall management responsibility for the
 incident, including the development and implementation of strategic
decisions and approving the ordering and releasing of resources.         The
Command Staff element is provided to support the IC in handling such
matters as public inforxnation, safety, and interagency liaison. Under the
direction of the IC, Command and General Staff are responsible for the
activation and release of emergency resPonse personnel and providing for
24 hour staffing during emergency conditions.       In incidents involving
other agencies, a unified command element will evolve which will bring
together multiple jurisdiction ICs to develop a common and consistent
action plan to make the best use of all available resources.
General Staff
The Operations Section i8 headed by the Operations Section Chief
(Police/Fire Chief) who is responsible for the management of all incident
tactical activities.
The Planning Section is headed by the Planning Section Chief (Community
Development Director) who is responsible for the collection, evaluation,
dissemination and use of information about the development of the incident
and status of resources.
The Logistics Section is headed by the Logistics Section Chief (Recreation
and Parks Director) who is responsible for meeting the logistical needs of
the Operations Section. This includes providing equipment and supplies ,
food and medical support to incident personnel, meeting communications
requirements of the incident and, in conjunction with the American Red
Cross, care and shelter operations.
The Finance Section is beaded by the Finance Section Chief (Finance
Director) who is responsible for participation in development and
implementation of the incident action plan.         This section will be
activated at an incident when required for purposes of maintaining records
on personnel and equipment time, for obtaining supplies and equipment from
and providing payments to vendors, and for determining cost considerations
or various alternative strategies associated with incident planning.
                                 S.25

Emergency Operating Center eEOC)
The primary EOC is in the publ ic safety classroom located at 314 West Cook
Street. The alternate EOC is Santa Maria Fire Station #2 located at 416
West Carmen Lane. Operations activities are conducted from the respective
Departments as outlined in pertinent Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).
                                  S.26

  Logistics operates from     its  space    within  the  Recreation  and  Parks
 Department building.
 The EOC is activated under the following conditions under a request by the
 City Manager or the Police/Fire Chief:
 1)     An event with no warning creates widespread damage to buildings,
        utilities, and streets.
 2)     An incident in progress threatens the majority of the City.
 3)     An incident is in progress in Santa Maria and EOC activation is
        requested by the IC at the field command post .
 Each Department within the City also has Standard Operating Procedures
  (SOPs) that each Department will follow in the event of an emergency
 situation.   These SOPs detail staffing requirements and locations where
 staff should report in the event of an emergency.
 Specific Emergencies
 Hazards that pose a threat to the Planning Area include earthquakes,
 landslides,    hazardous material       incidents,   wildfires,  flooding/dam
 failures, war emergencies, the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant, and
transportation incidents (aircraft/motor vehicles).         Santa Maria is not
 impacted by such hazards as volcanoes,             avalanches,  or tsunamis.
Earthquake, landslide, hazardous material incidents, wildfires, and
 flooding/dam failures are described in previous sections of this report .
Nuclear War Emergencies. Current state and Federal guidance assumes that
a nuclear attack on the United States would be preceded by a period of
 increasing international tension .         This guidance also assumes that
sufficient time would be available for protective actions to be taken such
as the construction of shelters and the temporary relocation of residents
of possible target areas.
A lesser threat that has a greater probability of occurrence comes from
terrorist organizations.      These organizations could transport a small
nuclear device to any part of the United States and detonate the weapon at
the time and place of their choosing with little or no warning.
The City of Santa Maria is a potential target area because the airport is
capable of supporting military aircraft . Although the airport is located
at the southwest edge of the City, the City is within the blast and
thermal effects zone of an accurately placed 1 megaton weapon.
Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB), located 10 miles southwest of the City,
is a potential target because of the launching facilities and the long
runway at the base.     Santa Maria would be in the blast and thermal zone
for any air burst at VAFB. With a ground burst at VAFB, Santa Maria may
be shielded to a degree by the mountains to the south of the City .         An
error in targeting could easily shift a burst directly over the City.
Because no blast shelters have been identified, the probability of an
individual surviving a 1 megaton airburst over the City is low (90\ or
more casualties). Among the survivors, thermal and blast injuries would
be predominant and radiation injuries would be absent. Residual radiation
should not be significant if the explosion occurs at the optimum altitude
for maximum blast and thermal damage.
A low yield terrorist device would produce a zone of injuries or lethal
radiation that would extend beyond its more limited blast and thermal
effects zone.    Burns and radiation injuries would be predominant if the
device were placed at an elevated location .        If it were detonated near
ground level, the thermal and radiation effects would be restricted by the
shielding properties of buildings. Residual radioactivity would remain at
dangerous levele for an extended period of time at the explosion site .
                                  S . 27
Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant Emergencies. Emergency response action
plans are not required for the subject hazard since all of Santa Barbara
County is beyond the Diablo Canyon Emergency Planning Zone.       However,
given the basically north-south transportation grid within the areas
involved, in the event of an emergency in San Luis Obispo county involving
the Diablo Canyon facility, the santa Barbara County Operational Area
would by default become a support/host area for evacuees.       As a sup-
port/host area, a relocation center for school children has been
designated at Allan Hancock College, and a reception center has been
designated at the County Fairgrounds.
The federal government defines a lO-mile radius for the plume exposure
pathway Emergency Planning Zone (EPZ) and a 50-mile radius limit for the
Ingestion Pathway Zone (IPZ). The City is well beyond the lO-mile radius
EPZ for plume exposure. However, the 50-mile radius IPZ does include the
City's Planning Area.   The principal exposure in the IPZ would be from
ingestion of contaminated water or foods such as milk, fresh vegetables,
or aquatic foodstuffs.
The State has defined two planning zones to facilitate emergency planning.
The zones are the Basic Emergency Planning Zone (BEPZ) and the Public
Education Zone (PEZ).
The BEPZ covers an area of about 15 miles to the north and east and 16
miles to the southeast of the plant .    The BEPZ lies entirely within San
Luis Obispo County.
The PEZ extends across the San Luis Obispo County boundary to include the
santa Maria Planning Area.    Residents living within this zone receive
information on nuclear power plant emergency planning zones.    Protective
actions for the public in the PEZ are not necessary.
Because of the distance of the power plant from the Planning Area,
protective actions during the plume phase are not anticipated to be
necessary in Santa Barbara county.    However, the Planning Area could be
directly affected by protective actions taken in San Luis Obispo County as
noted below.
Evacuation is a major countermeasure to prevent or reduce exposure or
contamination of the general public. The Planning Area could be affected
by a directed or non-directed evacuation of the public from San Luis
Obispo COunty, if evacuees are recommended to leave the area southbound on
U.S. Highway 101 or State Route 1. Evacuees will affect traffic flow and
some will need temporary lodging and board.        The area could also be
affected if individuals and/or automobiles leaving areas near the plant
are contaminated with radioactive materials following an atmospheric
release.
The u.e of protective clothing to prevent contamination of the skin would
not be necessary in the Planning Area in a routine emergency response.
However, protective clothing would be used in the decontamination of
personnel and equipment transported into the Planning Area.
As an ingestion pathway consideration, the State may recommend covering
stored livestock feed to limit or avoid contamination from airborne
radioactive materials. As an ingestion pathway consideration, the State
haa the authority to prevent the sale, distribution, or consumption of
contaminated water or foodstuffs.     The Planning Area could be affected
since the County lies within the Ingestion Pathway Zone.
Decontamination is the reduction or removal of radioactive material from
a Rtructure, area, Object, or person. Decontamination may be required in
the Planning Area for personnel and equipment that have been contaminated
in areas close to the plant and transported into Santa Barbara County.
The predetermined evacuation routes leading from San Luis Obispo County
into Santa Barbara County are U. S . Highway 101 and State Highway 1.

 Transportation Emergencies4 Transportation emergencies, other than those
  involving hazardous materials, can cause great 10B8 of property or life4
 The greatest loss of life can occur when commercial passenger carriers
 such as trains, airliners, or buses are involved .       However, multiple
 vehicle automobile accidents also can result in a large number of injuries
 and fatalities . Mass casualty incidents quickly exhaust local resources
 and require mutual aid in order to transport and give emergency care to
 victims
 Highway accidents can have an impact on the corrvnunity beyond those
 problems caused by the inunediate casualties.      Commerce and personal
 business depends on functioning transportation routes.      Restoration of
 traffic flow by bypassing the incident site should be accomplished as soon
 as feasible.
 Santa Maria lies within a transportation corridor.       u.s. Highway 101
 carries a large volume of traffic every day of the year.     This route is
the primary route from Los Angles to coastal Central California.         It
carries truck freight , private cars and passenger buses.
The Santa Maria Public Airport can accommodate aircraft as large as a DC-
10 in an emergency.   The airport is used by scheduled airlines', private
airplanes, and helicopters. In addition to the locally generated flights,
through commercial and private air traffic passes over Santa Maria.
Spacecraft using Edwards Air Force Base can fly over the area during '
landings, as well as military aircraft en route to Vandenberg Air Force
Base.
other Emergencies . Although the Planning Area would not be impacted
directly by volcanic eruptions or tsunamis, a request for mutual aid may

APPENDICES
                                     Introduction
The Housing Element is one of seven mandated elements of the General Plan. It provides
a written framework for meeting the housing goals of the City. The Santa Maria Community
Development Department drafted the Housing Element to produce an effective policy
document for the decision-makers of the City. The Housing Element also serves as an
informational document to the residents of the community, prospective residents,
businesses, and developers. It includes written goals, policies, objectives, and
implementation programs to show the housing needs and opportunities of the City of Santa
Maria.
Housing must be treated as a commodity. As a framework for discussion, housing units
include specific traits, like size, shape, location, age, condition, amenities, demand, and
supply. Together, these housing traits create the value of housing in the free market. The
affordable housing standard used throughout this Housing Element is the Housing and
Urban Development Department (HUD) median household income for a family of four.
In Santa Maria, individual circumstances often differ from HUD standards. For example,
the concept of a family of four living in one economic unit, or household, which in turn lives
in one housing unit which has been planned and constructed with City oversight is often
not the reality for at least 5% of Santa Maria households. In Santa Maria, nuclear families
with limited income will often join together with extended family or unrelated families to
purchase single-family houses. The owners will then remodel the house to create additional
space in which to house additional individuals.
The concept of habitable space is crucial to a community that is committed to housing its
people. State law (Uniform Housing Code §503.2) requires cities to accept “overcrowded”
conditions in their housing spaces unless the individual city can prove it has distinctive local
climatic, topographic or geographic conditions that make the state standard inapplicable
[Briseno v. City of Santa Ana (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1378]. Specifically, the Uniform Housing
Code requires cities to allow up to two people in a room containing as little habitable space
as 70 square feet. In a “single-family” house of the size typically now built in Santa Maria,
there is sufficient habitable space to hold considerably more than 4 people, even without
remodels. Experience also shows that people in Santa Maria want to own their own houses,
regardless of their income. If they cannot own them individually, they will buy or rent a
house together.
Government, church/community-based organizations and non-profit housing agencies
provide a housing safety net assisting the low-moderate income households. The role of
government is to coordinate housing assistance efforts. Mostly, through assistance to the
very low- and low-income households and non-profit social-service agencies, the public
sector helps fulfill the housing goals of the community. Government may also mandate that
housing efforts by the private sector, be made to assist with providing affordable housing.
We are proud of the housing and housing services that the City provides, and seek
affirmation of our innovative efforts in the form of State certification of the element.

Community Snapshot
The City of Santa Maria is located in the central coast area of California in the northern
portion of Santa Barbara County, roughly 250 miles south of San Francisco and 170 miles
north of Los Angeles. The City lies within the Santa Maria River Valley in a fertile plain,
surrounded by rolling hills on three sides and the Pacific Ocean to the west. Historically,
the river flooded the valley floor, depositing rich alluvial soils and making the valley one of
the most productive agricultural areas in the state. Crops include celery, lettuce, peas,
squash, cauliflower, spinach, broccoli, and beans. Production of labor-intensive
strawberries, increased dramatically in Santa Barbara County from 750 acres in 1981 to
over 10,000 acres in 2000. While strawberry acreage has since declined to approximately
6,657 acres harvested in 2012, strawberries remain the single most valued of crops in
Santa Barbara County, with broccoli and lettuce also extensively grown in the Santa Maria
Valley.

Since 1990, Santa Maria has experienced a 32% population increase which includes a
large number of migrants coming from Mexico and other countries. Among some people,
prejudice still exists toward the immigrant populations, and even between the various ethnic
groups. Many are shunned because they are perceived as being in a different
socioeconomic class. Another challenge is communication; there are many languages, with
many dialects, and some with no written language. Many of the immigrants have entered
the United States illegally, remain isolated and do not assimilate – not only because of
language and cultural barriers, but also from fear that their status will be detected and they
will be returned to their country of origin.
While agriculture has always played an important role in the City’s economic and
industrial base, other important growing sectors of the local economy are the aerospace
industry, communications, high-technology research and development, energy
production, military operations and various manufacturing industries. The business
climate in the City is one of diversity, interdependency and cooperation. Santa Maria
prides itself on being a business - friendly City and actively strives to attract jobs in all
income sectors.
                                                                  i -2

The City has an unincorporated area immediately adjacent to its boundaries of
approximately 35,000 population. Santa Maria consistently has been the fastest growing
city in Santa Barbara County over the last two decades. From Census 2000 to Census
2010, 90% of the county’s population growth occurred in the City of Santa Maria. It is
anticipated that this trend will continue throughout the current decade as Santa Maria
continues to be the hub for Northern Santa Barbara County. [Source: SBCAG, Regional Growth
Forecast 2012]
Santa Maria very aggressively works toward increasing the supply of housing to meet local
demands. Because Santa Maria sits within commuting distances of Santa Barbara and San
Luis Obispo, two areas with higher housing costs, the City became positioned as an
affordable location for first time home buyers and others looking for good housing values.
From 1990 to 2000, homeownership increased from 52% to almost 56% driven in part by
Santa Maria’s more affordable housing. By 2010, ownership rates declined to 51.6%, most
likely due to the bursting of housing price bubble and resulting home foreclosures. [Source:
2010 Census]
A balance between jobs and housing in a region can be defined as the provision of an
adequate supply of housing to house workers employed in a defined area. Alternatively, a
jobs/housing balance can be defined as an adequate provision of employment in a defined
area that generates enough local workers to fill the housing supply. The Economic
Development Element outlines the issues related to jobs/housing balance and offers clear,
concise conclusions and recommendations for action items to address the concerns.
Santa Maria housing policies and programs encourage growth and development more so
than the neighboring jurisdictions of Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo (cities and
counties). Establishing a jobs/housing balance in Santa Maria will in part require a regional
approach to the current growth and development patterns of the area.
The 2040 Regional Transportation Plan and Sustainable Communities Strategy (RTP-
SCS) was adopted by the Santa Barbara County Association of Governments in 2013.
               “…the RTP-SCS for the first time contains a “Sustainable
               Communities Strategy” that considers both land use and
               transportation together in a single, integrated planning process
               that accommodates regional housing needs and projected
               growth.
The City of Santa Maria encourages a variety and mix of housing types to provide
adequate housing choices for persons of all income levels. For housing projects proposed
within the Downtown Specific Plan area, the City further requires use of the design
principles identified in that Plan to assure superior results that will enhance and revitalize
the Downtown area in the short and long term.

                 CHAPTER I - PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
A.      OVERVIEW
The California Government Code expressly requires that diligent efforts be made to
engage the public in the process of preparing and adopting Housing Elements. As part of
drafting this updated document, a series of public meetings and public hearings were
conducted with City staff, the Planning Commission and the City Council regarding the
2010 Housing Element. The City has employed many methods to encourage public
participation. Throughout the process, notices for all meetings were mailed to the Master
Contact List for the Housing Element Update, published in the local newspaper, and
posted on the City’s web site, http://www.ci.santa-maria.ca.us, in order to inform people
that the City will be updating the Housing Element and advising them of the upcoming
meeting dates. The Community Development Department has also worked with the
Special Projects Division to encourage comment on the City housing policies.
This updated Housing Element has been drafted in consideration of this early outreach,
along with direction furnished by the Planning Commission and City Council.
Community Development and Administrative Services/Special Projects staff worked
closely to provide outreach to the public, including:
  Community Development Department staff announced the upcoming Housing
   Element update at the April 22, 2014, Landlord and Tenant Rights Workshop, held at
   the Santa Maria Public Library. A brief presentation was made regarding the Housing
   Element Update Process with an invitation for comments regarding the current
   Housing Element, informational handouts and staff contact information was provided.
  On April 28, 2014, the Housing Element Update 2015 – 2023 web page was
   established on the City web site. This page provides general information regarding the
   update, and links to the City’s current Housing Element, the adopted Regional
   Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) plan, and the Policy Development page on the
   State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) web site. The
   Housing Element Update page has been updated throughout the process to announce
   upcoming meetings.
  On May 9, 2014, a news release regarding the Housing Element update was posted
   on the City web site. This news release included information regarding the update
   process, and announced the May 21, 2014, public meeting.
  The May 2014, edition of the monthly City of Santa Maria Special Projects Division
   News & Notes newsletter included an article regarding the Housing Element update,
   and an invitation for the public and stakeholders to participate in the Housing Element
   update process.
                                             I-1

B.       PUBLIC MEETINGS
A Public Workshop was conducted by the Community Development Department to further
solicit public comments.
         1.     Public Workshop: On May 21, 2014, Community Development staff hosted
                a noticed public workshop meeting at Santa Maria City Hall as part of the
                Planning Commission’s regular meeting to provide an understanding of the
                Housing Element Update Process including State Deadlines, an
                understanding of the structure of the Housing Element document, and to
                invite and encourage public comments on the present (2010) Housing
                Element. At this meeting, staff presented the new Regional Housing Needs
                Allocation (RHNA), new state laws enacted since the previous Housing
                Element adoption, and reviewed the objectives, programs, and policies
                contained in the present element.
C.       PLANNING COMMISSION MEETINGS
         1.     Study Sessions: The City Planning Commission was briefed regarding this
                Housing Element update at a study session on April 3, 2014, with a
                presentation introducing the initiation of the process and a tentative schedule.
                At the May 8, 2014, study session, the entire process was explained, from
                development of the Regional Housing Needs Assessment, through HCD
                Certification. A third study session was held on September 18, 2014, at which
                the Community Development staff explained the structure and content of the
                Preliminary Draft Housing Element, including the change to the presentation
                of Census and the American Community Survey demographic data.
         2.     Public Hearing: The Planning Commission considered the Draft Housing
                Element in a public hearing on October 15, 2014. The Planning Commission
                made a recommendation to the City Council to send the Draft Housing
                Element to the State Department of Housing and Community Development
                for their review and approval.
         3.     Public Hearing: The Planning Commission considered the recommendation
                to City Council regarding the Final Housing Element in a public hearing on
                February 18, 2015.
D.       CITY COUNCIL HEARINGS
         1.     First Public Hearing: On November 18, 2014, the City Council considered
                the recommendation of the Planning Commission and directed Staff to send
                the Draft Housing Element to the State Department of Housing and
                Community Development (HCD) for review. In accordance with Section
                                                I-2

              65585(b) of the Government Code, HCD has 60 days to comment on the
              compliance of the City’s Draft Housing Element with the requirements of
              State Housing Element law.
        2.    Second Public Hearing: At this hearing, the City Council adopted the
              updated Housing Element, and directed staff to submit a copy of the
              adopted Element to the State Department of Housing and Community
              Development, in accordance with Section 65585(g) of the Government
              Code.
E.      ONGOING PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
Many of the affordable housing programs presented in this Housing Element involve
significant public participation, most notably through the City’s Block Grant Advisory
Committee.
The City of Santa Maria actively looks for the public’s assistance in the assessment of the
services and programs and the determination of the unmet needs in the community as
demonstrated by the Special Project Division’s recent Community Needs Assessment
Survey. The survey results will be used to develop the Consolidated Plan for Fiscal Years
2015-2020: the Consolidated Plan and related Annual Action Plans implement many of the
Housing Element policies and objectives.

                   CHAPTER II—REVIEW AND REVISION
This chapter responds to Section 65588 of the State Government Code. A thorough review
facilitates a comprehensive update and ensures the element can be effectively
implemented in the next planning period. By comparing the number of units added,
rehabilitated, and conserved during the years 2007 through 2013, against the City’s
Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) housing targets, the resulting differences
provide insight into any possible revisions to the policies of the previous Housing Element
Update.
A.       EFFECTIVENESS OF THE ELEMENT
         1.     Regional Housing Needs Allocation Targets by Income Levels: Table II-
                1, quantifies the new housing production targets under the CONSTRUCTION
                column. Respectively, the REHABILITATION targets set the expected
                efforts needed to physically extend the useful life of the existing housing
                stock; and the CONSERVATION targets set the number of units with
                contractual requirements for providing housing affordability, which needed to
                be kept or replaced.
                The 2010 Housing Element quantified its progress toward achieving the
                target numbers for New Construction through 2009. Santa Maria’s initial
                target allocation of 3,200 new dwelling units was set by the Santa Barbara
                County Association of Governments (SBCAG) in the 2007 – 2014 Regional
                Housing Needs Allocation Plan. Of the 3,200 target allocation in the previous
                Housing Element, 763 units were built, which means that 2,437 were targeted
                but not yet constructed. Similar to the new housing construction, the City set
                quantified target numbers for rehabilitation (45 dwelling units targeted, 6 were
                completed) and conservation (122 dwelling units targeted, but not
                completed).
                After quantifying the units (by income) constructed, rehabilitated, and
                conserved in the planning period, the remaining allocations represent the
                unmet housing needs identified in the previous Housing Element. Table II-1
                shows the City’s targets (by income), which established housing targets
                quantified by the Housing Element Update (2010).

       To implement the new construction, rehabilitation and conservation goals of
       the 2010 Housing Element, the following programs were identified for
       implementation:
          Economic Development Program
          Annexation Program
          Mixed-Use Development/Adaptive Re-use
          Density Bonus
          Land Banking
          Housing Incentives Program
          Code Compliance Program Expansion
          Prioritization of Services
          Permit Processing
          Conditional Use Permit Process Monitoring
          Accommodations for Persons with Special Needs
          Facilitation of Projects for Homeless Individuals
          Neighborhood Conservation Program
          Code Compliance Program
          Single Room Occupancy
          Project-Based Tenant Assistance Programs
          Tenant-Based Tenant Assistance Payments Programs
          Supportive Housing For Homeless Persons
          Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Re-Housing Program
          Fair Housing Program
          Energy Compliance and Conservation
B. PROGRESS IN IMPLEMENTATION
   1.  Background: For each program listed above, the analysis compare
       differences between what was projected or planned in the previous Housing
       Element and what was achieved, during that element’s planning period.
       a.      New      Construction:        Programs  used  to  implement    the
               CONSTRUCTION targets of the 2010 Housing Element were:
                  Annexation Program
                  Mixed-Use Development/Adaptive Re-use
                  Density Bonuses
                  Housing Incentives Program
                  Prioritization of Services
                                        II - 2

      Permit Processing
      Facilitation of Projects for Homeless Individuals
      Project-Based Tenant Assistance
      Energy Compliance and Conservation
   In the review of the 2010 Housing Element, the remaining production
   numbers were counted for period from January 2007 through
   December 2013. By income groups, Table II-2 identifies permited new
   construction for the period covered by the 2010 Housing Element. A
   total of 87 units were permited in the Very Low (73 units) and Low (14
   units) income groups.
 i.    Very Low and Low Income Households: Twenty-four of the units
       were constructed by the Housing Authority for the Ted Zenich
       Gardens project, which was supported under the Housing
       Incentives Program. Ten of those units are affordable to qualified
       Very Low income households and 14 units are affordable to
       qualified Low income households.
       The City’s efforts to facilitate Projects for Homeless Individuals
       (Program 11) were not always successful in production of new
       housing. During the first round of applications for 2008 California
       Tax Credit Allocation Committee (CTCAC) 9% funding, the
       Rancho Hermosa application was not ranked high enough to
       qualify for a tax credit reservation; the tax credit financing process
       is extremely competitive. However, lack of success does not
       indicate a program failure. In support of the project, the City
       Council adopted a TEFRA (Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility
       Act) Resolution and reserved City HOME funds for the project. The
       Housing Authority recently completed development of Rancho
       Hermosa providing 47 units of affordable housing for very low-
       income homeless households and households at risk of
       homelessness, who are diagnosed with substance abuse and/or
       severe mental illness.
ii.    Moderate Income Households: The General Plan Annual
       Reports, for the years 2007 through 2013, categorically
       classified various types of “infill-housing” as being built for
       moderate income household units. Such units consist of rental
       houses converted into multi-family units, new multi-family
       housing, mixed-use apartments or caretaker employee housing,
       and houses added to property with existing residential uses.
       Table II-2 shows that 313 moderate income units were permitted
       during the period.
                            II - 3

     iii.   Above Moderate Income Households: The previously cited
            annual reports categorically classified all ownership housing
            construction (e.g., single-family residential, condominium,
            townhouse, etc.) as above moderate income units. Table II-2
            shows that 363 Above Moderate income units were permited
            during the period.
   The resulting remainder targets for (663) very low- and (530) low-
   income housing units (Table II-3) could still be achieved in the City of
   Santa Maria without rezoning sites for affordable housing.
b. Housing Rehabilitation: Programs used to implement the
   REHABILITATION targets of the 2010 Housing Element were:
        Mixed-Use Development / Adaptive Re-use
        Housing Incentives Program
        Code Compliance Program Expansion
        Facilitation of Projects for Homeless Individuals
        Code Compliance Program
        Single Room Occupancy
        Energy Compliance and Conservation
   Housing rehabilitation seeks to extend the useful life of the City
   existing housing stock. As with all permitted construction, the City
   enforces building codes including those regarding energy efficiency
   standards. Residential rehabilitation loans require energy and water
   conservation. Depending on the age and condition of a structure, the
   code compliance and housing rehabilitation programs of the City of
   Santa Maria effectively ensure that housing is improved for the
   residents. When an older unit remains viable, more opportunity is
   afforded to the low-income residents of the City.
   With tax credit and HOME assistance through the Housing Incentives
   Program, the Central Plaza Apartments were rehabilitated by the
   Housing Authority of Santa Barbara County, which previously
   acquired the site under the land-banking program. In addition to the
   rehabilitation, the Housing Authority constructed a new community
   room and offices for onsite management. As targeted, the useful life
   of the 112 apartments has been extended and will be maintained by
   the Housing Authority.
c. Affordable Housing Conservation: Programs used to implement the
   CONSERVATION targets of the 2010 Housing Element were:
        Land Banking
        Tenant-Based Rental Assistance
        Supportive Housing for Homeless Persons
                              II - 4

                    Fair Housing Program
                    Energy Compliance and Conservation
                 The 112-unit Central Plaza Apartment project acquisition by the
                 Housing Authority removes the Central Plaza Apartments from the at-
                 risk category. In 2012 the Housing Authority of the County of Santa
                 Barbara completed the Rancho Hermosa proposed a transitional
                 shelter with 45, three-bedroom, residential units. The City Council had
                 adopted a TEFRA (Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act)
                 Resolution and reserved City HOME funds for the project. The Good
                 Samaritan Shelter’s Casa de Familia project was completed in 2014
                 and consists of two three-bedroom units, five one-bedroom units and
                 nine two-bedroom units (16 units total) to provide additional affordable
                 housing for low-income families.
                 The Annual Action Plan, reports that Fair Housing Program
                 contractors receive CDBG funding each year. The Consolidated
                 Annual Performance and Evaluation Report (CAPER), which is filed
                 with HUD annually, reports the levels of service received by the low-
                 income clients of each agency that received block grant funding
                 through the City.

2. Implementation Review Summary: Table II-4, which was formatted
   consistent with the State Housing and Community Development Department
   publication, Building Blocks for Effective Housing Elements, provides a
   summary of critical information pertaining to housing element
   implementation. This Table summarizes the Goals and Policies of the 2010
   Housing Element. To the degree that such Programs are recommended to
   be continued into the present Housing Element, these Programs are
   reorganized and presented in Chapter VII.

change is discussed below that change.
      1.      Change to Action Step H-1C: This Action Step, Action steps to encourage
              mixed-use development was updated.
              Reason for the change: The update reflects the new RHNA and the
              methods used to communicate the provisions of the Mixed-Use Ordinance
              to the public and development community.
      2.      Change to Action Step H-1D: An addition was made to Action steps to
              encourage infill.
              Reason for the change: The Circulation Element amendment now depicts
              high quality transit corridors within the City, which coordinate with the 2040

D.     SUMMARY/CONCLUSIONS
In November 2010, the City’s Housing Element was last updated, with approximately forty
Programs and/or Action Steps. Approximately four years later, only eight Action Steps
have been modified or deleted. The primary reason for these minor changes is to remove
out-of-date information and to reflect newly funded activities. The analysis presented in
this Chapter reinforces the overall validity and currency of the policies of the previous
Housing Element, which are now carried forward into the present Housing Element
Update.

          CHAPTER III—HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
A.     OVERVIEW
In accordance with Government Code Sections 65583(a)(1) and (2), this chapter discusses
the current conditions and projected trends related to population characteristics and
employment within the City of Santa Maria. The data presented characterizes the City of
Santa Maria’s local demographics, incomes, overcrowding and overpayment conditions,
housing affordability, assisted housing developments, special needs populations, and
housing stock conditions.
Where new data are available, these data have been inserted into the Housing Needs
Assessment. Where appropriate, historical data may have been inserted to give better
context to the data as the Housing Element transitions from decennial census based data to
the current American Community Survey (ACS).
B.     POPULATION AND HOUSING DATA FOR SANTA MARIA
As of 2010, the City of Santa Maria contained all or part of twenty-one census tracts identified
by the Bureau of the Census. Of these census tracts, nine cross City and County boundaries,
and twelve are wholly contained within the City limits. The data generated through the
Census differentiate City from County populations. Within each census tract, demographic
information is further subdivided and much data is available at the block group level. There
are 63 block groups within the 21 census tracts of the City. Figure III-2 is a picture of the 11”
by 17” map (Appendix III-1) that shows the Census Tracts and Block Groups for the 2010
Census. Table III-2 shows the City population and housing unit estimates by census tract.
       1.     Population and Housing Estimates:
              The California Department of Finance E-5 Report for 2014 was released in
              May 2014. This is the most current report available with population and
              housing estimates. These population estimates incorporate 2010 census
              counts and use building permit occupancy data to adjust the unit counts,
              which are the basis for the population estimates.
              Data Analysis and Discussion: The City of Santa Maria is one of eight
              incorporated cities in Santa Barbara County. The City of Santa Maria has the
              largest population in the County, which constitutes 23% of the total population
              of Santa Barbara County. The most notable differential from the County
              occurs in the Persons per Household column. At 3.69, Santa Maria is the
              second highest in the County (behind Guadalupe) and is 128% of the
              County’s 2.88 average persons per household.
              Santa Maria is a working class community that mostly has been influenced
              by housing of field workers and their families. The location of the City within
              a fertile agricultural valley differentiates the City from the scenic coastal
              communities.

                      Table 1 was extracted from the Santa Barbara County dataset provided by the
                      California Housing and Community Development Department (HCD). It is a
                      comparison of 2000 and 2010 Census populations and includes State Department of
                      Finance (DOF) population estimates for 2011-2013.
                                                                         III-3

Data Analysis and Discussion: Notable population changes occurred between the
2000 and 2010 decennial census counts when the City population count increased
4.1% relative to the County as a whole.
The long-term impact of population growth in Santa Maria does not appear in the
three-years of DOF population estimates, above. HCD Table 1a, however, shows
that Santa Maria added 22,130 persons, accounting for 90.15% of the total County
population growth over the ten-year period. Without Santa Maria’s population
growth, Santa Barbara County grew by only 2,418 persons in ten years.
HCD Table 1a is a comparison of 2000 and 2010 Census populations in the State
Department of Finance (DOF) population estimates format for population and
housing. It includes greater population and housing details than Table1.
Data Analysis and Discussion: The notable 2000 to 2010 differences occurring in
Santa Maria were:
   Group quarters population decreased by 1,155 persons (-53%)
   The persons per household number increased 7.8%, from 3.40 to 3.66
The “loss” of group quarters population from 2000 to 2010 Census may reflect
changes in definitions, probably placing those same persons in households rather
than group quarters.
The increasing population per household reflects a continuing trend, which may
have been exacerbated by the addition 1,155 persons from the 2000 Census group
quarters housing number.

         1.      Needs of Extremely Low Income Households: Extremely low-income is
                 defined as households with income less than 30% of area median income.
                 The 2014 median income for a family of four in Santa Barbara County is
                 $73,300. For extremely low-income households, this results in an income
                 of $23,900 or less for a four-person household. Households with an
                 extremely low-income have a variety of housing situations and needs.

                    EMPLOYMENT BY INDUSTRY ESTIMATES
          Table 2 is from the HCD dataset and estimates employment by Civilian
          employed population 16 years of age and over, (a standard metric) that shows
          the industries where residents work.

III-1
   Data Analysis and Discussion: Overall, the City of Santa Maria houses 21.1%
   of the County labor force. The notable differentials between the City and
   County are:
      Agriculture – Santa Maria houses 64% of agricultural workers in Santa
       Barbara County
      Wholesale trade (28%) and Transportation (32%)                  are   also
       proportionately higher in Santa Maria than the County
      Conversely, Finance (14%), Professional (12%), and Educational
       services (14%) are proportionately lower in Santa Maria than for Santa
       Barbara County
   The proportionately higher employment industries for Santa Maria are
   “basic” industries–tied around agriculture, processing, and distribution.
   Typically, these are low-wage sectors with the lowest employment
   multipliers. Conversely, the higher employment multipliers mostly occur
   where Santa Maria’s share is lowest relative to the County as a whole.
2. Overcrowding: Overcrowding most often involves economic, legal and
   cultural factors. The trend of escalating housing prices and rents indicates
   increasing economic needs to share space because fewer choices exist for
   many households and families. The regional impact of increasing housing
   demand affects all residents who are in the housing market to rent or
   purchase a home. Often both renters and buyers reach out to the City for
   assistance in meeting the challenges of cultural and economic changes in
   the community.
   Overcrowding is defined by the Census and HUD as having more than one
   person per room living in a single housing unit. Generally, a room is defined
   as a living room, dining room, kitchen, bedroom, or finished recreation room.
   The City does not endorse illegal garage conversions as a method to create
   additional dwelling units. However, garage conversions are permitted as a
   method to increase habitable living space within a single-family residence
   subject to building permits to avoid potentially significant health and safety
   impacts. The additional living space cannot contain a kitchen.
   Table III-6 shows that 5,117 households (19% of all households) are
   overcrowded. 3,785 (14%) renter-occupied households are overcrowded,
   nearly three times the overcrowding as found in 1,332 (4.9%) owner-
   occupied households. Of the 5,117 overcrowded households, 2,198 (43%)
   are severely overcrowded.

Total severely overcrowded                  1.5 or more     2,198        8.1%
        The issues of overcrowding may be affected by wages, cultures with
        extended or multi-generational family size, and by households saving to
        achieve home-ownership.
 3.     Overpayment: Overpayment is an important measure of the affordability of
        housing within a city. Specifically, overpayment is defined as a household
        paying more than 30% of their gross household income for shelter–also
        called housing cost burden. According to the US Census, shelter cost is the
        monthly owner costs (mortgages, deeds of trust, contracts to purchase or
        similar debts on the property, taxes, and insurance) or the gross rent
        (contract rent plus the estimated average monthly cost of utilities).

                  Overall, 42.7% of the households in the City have some housing cost
                  burden. The most notable data differences occurs in the two income
                  extremes. The Moderate-income category percentage (red annotation in
                  HCD Table 4) is unexpectedly higher than the low-income percentage.
                  However, similarly high percentages occurs Countywide, so it is not an
                  isolated data phenomenon.

                  Data Analysis and Discussion: Generally, we expect cost burdens to be
                  highest for the lowest income households and lowest for the highest income
                  households. However, it appears that 65.7% of the Moderate households are
                  experiencing cost burdens, but the Low households have only 23.7%
                  experiencing cost burden. While the Moderate number seems too high and/or
                  the Low number seems too low, this situation similarly occurs for 90% of the
                  County.
                  This data anomaly may be reflective of 40-50 years of Federal efforts to
                  provide affordable-housing subsidies to lower (0-80% of median household)
                  income groups and the shrinking middle-class, which is a nationwide trend.
D.      AFFORDABLE HOUSING FINANCING
        1.        Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC): The primary objective of the
                  Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program is to use income tax credits to
                  build affordable housing units in the State of California. The projects are
                  competitively ranked on the objective criteria of the LIHTC program.
                  Applications are submitted to the California Tax Credit Allocation
                  Committee (CTAC) by developers and their associates for funds.
                  Apartments built with LIHTC financing must provide at least half their units
                                                      III-15
                  for renters earning 50% (or less) of the HUD County median income based
                  on household size. Typically, all the apartments must be rented to
                  households earning less than 60% or less of the median.
                  Data Analysis and Discussion: Table III-8 lists the complete inventory of
                  affordable units and then sub-tables III-8a, III-8b, and III-8c are intended to
                  clarify and correct the inventory and show only active affordable units. Sub-
                  table A summarizes how the net (active) affordable unit count (1,406) is
                  broken-down. Similarly, sub-table B breaks-down the (207) At-risk units and
                  sub-table C breaks-down the (1,199) units that are not at-risk of market-rate
                  conversion

For the most part, homeownership (HO) program unit counts have decreased because
more loans have been repaid and new loans are not issued. Currently, 76 houses out of
the original 318 homeownership units have been removed from the active inventory.

       2.     Locally Subsidized Low Income Units: According to the 2010-2015 City
              of Santa Maria Consolidated Plan, Pepperwood; Oak Valley Homes;
              Valentine Court I, II, and III; Meridian Apartments; and Los Adobes de Maria
              I and II received local assistance. In addition to these projects, the City
              participated in a joint venture with the County to create a Mortgage Revenue
              Bond Program to assist housing development through Below Market
              Interest Rate (BMIR) financing.
                                              III-17
               Increasingly, the density bonus is applied to add affordable units to the
               housing inventory [SMMC Chapter 12-48].
        3.     Federally Subsidized Low Income Units At Risk of Conversion: No loss
               to the rental housing inventory is expected due to the prepayment of HUD
               mortgages.
               Three projects in the City of Santa Maria are included in the Inventory of
               Federally Subsidized Low-Income Rental Units at Risk of Conversion (HCD
               Table 20a), which was prepared for California Housing Partnership
               Corporation.
                Two are currently “past due” and are analyzed in the at-risk discussion,
                   below
                One is approaching a conversion date in 2015 and is also discussed
                   below
                There are no other projects in the Moderate risk categories
        4.     Locally Subsidized Low Income Units at Risk of Conversion: Unless
               noted, the locally subsidized units at risk of conversion is presumed to be
               30 years past the completion date. During this Housing Element period, or
               the subsequent five-years, the following homeownership properties:
                  Pepperwood (22 units) 1984 (+30 years is 2014)
                  Oak Valley I (34 units) 1990 (+30 years is 2020)
                  Oak Valley II (16 units) 1992 (+30 years is 2022)
                  Oak Valley III (4 units) 2001 (+30 years is 2031)
E.      INVENTORY OF AT-RISK UNITS
HCD Table 20a is HUD Assisted Units that (potentially) are within ten years of being
removed from the roll of assisted rental housing. HCD Table 20b is similar to Table 20a,
except for being “tax credit” financing through the Federal Low-Income Housing Tax
Credit (LIHTC) program that is locally administered through the State of California. The
risk levels assigned to HCD Table 20 are identified in the following order:
        Risk Level       Definition
        5-Very High      Section 8 Contract Expiring or Mortgage maturing in next year
        4-High           Section 8 Contract Expiring or Mortgage maturing in 1-5 years
        3-Moderate       Section 8 Contract Expiring or Mortgage maturing in 5-10 years
        2-Low            Section 8 Contract Expiring or Mortgage maturing in more than 10
        1-none           no Section 8 contract or subsidized mortgage in place
                                              III-18

Data Analysis and Discussion: HCD Table 20a addresses HUD (U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development) programmed housing units at risk of conversion to
market rates.
    Three projects are highlighted as being less than 10 years from conversion
    Addresses not in the City Limits have been excluded from HCD Table 20

              with Developmental Disabilities licensed by the State Dept of Public Health
              to house and care for six developmentally disabled adults.
              That home at 1106 N. School Street was acquired originally with HUD
              Section 202 funds and rehabilitated with CDBG funding. According to
              Debbie Bertrando, CEO, SMILE/OPTIONS has no intention of selling any
              of their homes or converting to market rate housing.
     ii.      Union Plaza (122 units) – According to the State Department of Housing
              and Community Development, housing entities are interested in a "first right
              of refusal" program for preserving affordable units in Santa Barbara County.
              A first right of refusal program cannot be imposed on the ownership
              component already in place and could be applied to rental and new
              ownership programs.
              The City’s understanding is that the Housing Authority of Santa Barbara
              County has contacted the property owner, Teamsters Local #381, regarding
              possible purchase of Union Plaza. The City is not a party to these
              negotiations, or the potential extension of affordability programs on this
              property.
                                                   III-19

      iii.     Valentine Court I (34 units) – Recent zoning verification request for the
               property indicates that the Valentine Court I site will be applying for tax
               credit financing to rehabilitate the 35 units and renew the 34 site specific
               Section 8 rental assistance units. If the competitive tax credit (LIHTC)
               financing is awarded, the 34 Section 8 units could be renewed and the at-
               risk status of this property would be changed to low– effectively conserving
               those units for the minimum period specified in the LIHTC financing
               program.
               On October 7, 2014, the City Council conducted a TEFRA hearing and
               adopted Resolution No. 2014-117 approving the issuance of multi-family
               housing revenue bonds in the amount of $5,000,000 for the purpose of
               financing or refinancing the acquisition and rehabilitation of the project.
               Additional CDBG or HOME funding will not be needed for the project.
Data Analysis and Discussion: HCD Table 20b addresses newer “tax credit” financed
housing units at risk of conversion to market rates. No actions is required because there
are no at risk units in the City of Santa Maria
               HCD Table 20b: LIHTC Assisted Housing Units
                   There were no Santa Maria City Projects in Table 20.b

F.         CONSERVATION OF AT-RISK HOUSING
HCD maintains a list of Qualified Entities who are interested in purchasing government-
subsidized multifamily housing projects. The current (October 2014) list of Qualified
Entities for Santa Barbara County is in Appendix III-4, but the list is maintained by HCD
and is periodically updated. Further, it is advisable that owners contemplating
prepayment, termination, or restructuring under applicable federal or State programs, or
selling affected properties, contact HCD prior to taking any action.
           1.  Changes in Locally Subsidized Low Income Units:
               o Pepperwood – Completed in 1984, the 22 Pepperwood subdivision
                   homebuyers received from $10,000 to $20,000 in second trust deeds at
                   Below Market Interest Rates (BMIR). The loans have all been repaid and
                   the units are no longer restricted.
               o Oak Valley Homes I – In 1990, 67 units were built through the
                   Community Housing Corporation of Santa Barbara. 51% (34) of the
                   homes were required to be affordable for households earning 80%, or
                   less, of the Santa Barbara County median income. 30-year affordability
                   is regulated through the CHFA financing of the project, but the 34 homes
                   are currently at-risk to 2020.
                                              III-20

              o Oak Valley Homes II – In 1991 and 1992, the City contracted with
                  Peoples' Self-Help Housing Corporation to build 70 homes for first time,
                  low-income home buyers (earning 80%, or less, of the Santa Barbara
                  County median income). CDBG funds were used for Phase II on-site
                  improvements. Additionally, the City provided deferred, 30-year, interest
                  free, and third trust deeds that average $25,000 per unit. The loans are
                  due on sale or may be assumed by another qualified low-income buyer,
                  but only 16 loans (22.8%) remain active and are currently at-risk to 2022.
G.     POPULATIONS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS
The community profile contained in City’s Consolidated Plan, which is incorporated by
reference, provides detailed information about existing housing and services available to
special needs groups. It is noted that there may exist multiple special needs groups in
one household or individuals within more than one special needs category, which
accounts for the seemingly high numbers in some groups. This one-to-many
categorization is difficult to quantify.
       1.     Persons with Disabilities: Persons with a disability (physically, emotionally
              and/or developmentally) lack an adequate supply of housing suitable for
              their needs. The need to eliminate physical barriers to housing is being
              addressed in new construction. Very few existing housing units are
              designed to accommodate persons with a physical disability, so retrofits are
              done as needed specifically for accommodating the disability or disabilities.
              HCD Table 11 identifies persons with disabilities. This table calculates the
              percentage of total population (Civilian, non-institutional) estimated to have
              a disability.
              Data Analysis and Discussion: Overall, Santa Maria has an 8% disability
              rate, which is slightly higher than the 6.8% disability rate of the County.
              Relative to the County of Santa Barbara, Santa Maria has a higher
              proportion of unemployed persons, aged 5 to 64 with a disability and slightly
              fewer disabled persons aged 65 and above. HCD Table 11a provides detail
              in the types of disabilities by employment status.

*Employment data for all disabilities not considered physical is not available for all jurisdictions.
             HCD Table 11a is consistent with Table 11, but it does include detail about
             disabilities in the workforce (population ages 16 to 64). Relative to Santa
             Barbara County, the City of Santa Maria numbers are consistently higher in
             hearing and vision disabilities for all employment categories–Employed,
             Unemployed, and not in the Labor Force.

              Data Analysis and Discussion: Of the 60,073 persons in HCD Table 12,
              10.6% had a disability, which is slightly higher than the 8% estimate in HCD
              Table 11a. In 2000, the residents of Santa Maria had 25% of all the
              disabilities reported in Santa Barbara County. Disability reporting increased
              from 40% of the age five and above population in Census 2000 up to 60%
              in HCD Tables 11 and 11a. With the transition of data from the decennial
              census to three to five-year American Community Survey data. It will not be
              known if this change is a new trend or a by-product of the new data source.
                 SB812 Disability
                  HCD Table 13 identifies persons with disabilities based on California
                  Department of Developmental Services (DDS) dataset that counts
                  persons in the DDS system, by zip code, age of resident, and type of
                  housing facility or service facility serving the disabled population.
                                             III-24

In an e-mail received September 25, 2014, from Eulalia Apolinar, Assistant
Director of Services & Supports, San Luis Obispo & Santa Barbara Counties
Tri-Counties Regional Center, she states that:
a.     Total of persons served by the regional center that are over the age
       of 18 and living in Santa Maria, 688 – This group is then made up of
       those living at home with family and those living in community care
       facilities, or group homes.
b.     Persons with developmental disabilities living independently 110 –
       These are persons living in their own homes, not with family. These
       individuals may have some basic support from the regional center.
c.     Persons with developmental disabilities living with supported living
       services 121 – These are persons also living in their own home but
       they have additional supports called "supported Living" funded by the
       regional center.
In a September 24, 2014, phone conversation, Eulalia Apolinar indicated that
the City of Santa Maria housing resources available to serve the
developmentally disabled appeared to be adequately satisfying the housing
need.
Note that the DDS data table has been filtered to include only Santa Maria
zip codes. In addition, definitions and subtotals were added to help describe
the abbreviated housing/facility terminology and the relative population in
each facility type.
Data Analysis and Discussion: Santa Maria and unincorporated Orcutt have
1,264 persons in the DDS database. Without a precise geographic
assignment by place, reference Table 15 for why 70/30 splits were used.
The City estimates that 885 clients in the DDS system and Orcutt has 379.
For the City’s 70% – Hm is 632; CCF is 75; IL/SL is 161; ICF is 12; and
other is 5.

      HCD Table 15 is the same DDS data as Table 13, but this presentation
      groups the population by zip code and residence type.
                                    III-26

Data Analysis and Discussion: This table helps further to explain the 70/30
assumption, with 93454, 93456, and 93458 (891 persons wholly in Santa
Maria), that leaves the 93455 and 93457 zip codes in the unincorporated
Orcutt community.
                            III-27
2. Elderly: Different ages apply to age restricted housing projects depending
   on the total number of housing units in the project. The cutoff value is 35
   units. For the age restrictions to apply to 55 year olds, a housing project
   must have at least 35 units, or more. With less than 35 units, age 62 and
   above allows a project to be age restricted.
   Many community services exist to provide support to a frail elderly person
   who wants to live at home. These services range from transportation or
   house maintenance programs to routine services, such as weekly
   housekeeping or daily home meal delivery, to the most intense kinds of
   support, such as home nursing or live-in attendant care.
   Persons aged 65 and over in the City of Santa Maria comprised between
   9.5% (2010 Census) and 12% (1990 Census). HCD Table 6 addresses the
   issue of tenure by age of the householder (owner–renter).
   Data Analysis and Discussion: Overall, Santa Maria has 19% of all the
   households in Santa Barbara County, but 33% of all households have a
   householder aged 55 or above. Because Table 6 is counting the total
   population in households, the oldest person living in the household thereby
   establishes the age cohort. This is different from TABLE III-13, which
   identifies persons by age groups.

3. Large Families: According to the ACS, large families (five or more persons)
   comprised 26% of all households in the City. 3.67 persons per household is
   the current average household size.
                                 III-28

   HCD Table 7 addresses the issue of household size by tenure of the
   householder. This table estimates the persons per room ranges, which
   calculates the ratio of the household size and number of rooms in the
   dwelling unit; large households have 5 or more persons.
   Analysis: Little difference occurs between owner and renter households.
   However, a notable data difference occurs in Large HH with five or more
   persons: Santa Maria is higher (26%) relative to the County (14%)–nearly
   twice the County amount.

     Source ACS B25009
   Discussion: The proportionately higher household size may be due to low-
   wage employment sector issues and overcrowding in the City. However,
   large households may have a cultural (i.e., large families) or an
   economically driven purpose.
4. Agricultural Employment/Farmworkers: Santa Maria is an agriculturally
   based community growing many labor-intensive crops.
   Increased farming production means a greater need for fieldworkers, a low
   wage and low skill job.
   Also, United States changing immigration policies have worked to both
   increase and decrease the number of farmworkers living in the community.
                                 III-29

The number of housing units needed to house farmworkers is estimated to
be 3,099 units, comprised of 774 (25%) owner units and 2,345 (75%) rental
units. The City of Santa Maria does not restrict the development of
farmworker housing to any particular residential zoning district.
Farming occupations grew in number from 1,637 to 11,047 from 1980-2012.
Over the same period the City population employed in this sector grew from
9.7% to 26.9%.
HCD Table 16 identifies the number of farms, number of workers, and
payroll in Santa Barbara County. HCD Table 17 identifies the number of
farms by number of workers by days worked–an indication of seasonal
employment, versus permanent employment in the agriculture industry.
These tables are presented without analysis or discussion.

From 1980 to 1990, farming, occupations grew in number from 1,637 to 3,896–a 140% increase. From 1990 to
2000, the number of agricultural workers living in the City grew an additional 47% to 5,735. Over the same 20-
year period (1980-2000), the City population employed in this sector grew from 9.7 to 14.5 to 18.7%. Increasing
production of labor-intensive row crop agriculture in the Santa Maria Valley is the primary factor attributed to the
expanding farm worker population.
Based on the UC Davis Farmworker Data and the Census 2000 data, Santa Maria houses 55% of the Santa
Barbara County farmworker population. The resident baseline population is 10,600 farmworkers workers in the
County and the maximum population peaks in June, adding 9,700 more workers (UC Davis, 1999-2000). The
calculated demand generated by farmworkers in Santa Maria ranges between 3,100 and 4,600 dwelling units.
–Santa Maria Housing Element 2010, page III-22.
Data Analysis and Discussion: Based on HCD Tables 2, 16 and 17, Table
III-9 shows that Santa Maria houses 64% of agricultural workers in Santa
Barbara County. The resident baseline population is 13,932 farmworkers
workers in the County; the maximum population peaks in June, adding
6,714 more workers, for a peak of 20,646 resident farmworkers

        National immigration policies greatly effect seasonal employment and are
        beyond State and local control. Further, it should be noted that these
        numbers only represent sample snapshots of a constantly changing
        environment. By nature, agricultural labor is migratory. While the isolated
        data are variable, the trend farmworker housing needs continue to increase.
5.      Families with Female Head: In 2011, a single female parent headed 20.8%
        of the family households in the City.
        HCD Table 8 provides data about female headed households–a measure
        of single parent, non-traditional families. This table estimates the female
        head-of-household rates and includes percentages of households under the
        poverty level.
        Data Analysis and Discussion: When compared to the entire County, the
        Santa Maria female-headed households with children (15%) is higher than
        the same group in the County (11.5%). Female-headed households under
        the poverty level constitute fewer than 10% of the total families in the City.

        Relative to the County of Santa Barbara, the higher percentage of
        households under the poverty level further correlates to low-wage
        employment sector issues in the City.
                                       III-31

   6.      Homeless: The Department of Housing and Urban Development defines
           homeless as “people not living in households (house, apartment, mobile
           home, group of rooms or single room occupied as separate living quarters)
           or group quarters.” Based on this definition, people who camp outdoors, live
           in vehicles, or stay in emergency or transitional shelters are homeless. In
           addition, people who live in bootlegged additions to residential structures or
           as multiple families in single-family residences may also be considered
           homeless.
           A Report on Homeless Services [the Report] describes a continuum of
           homeless situations: persons at risk of becoming homeless, people who are
           episodically homeless, and people who are chronically homeless. The
           Report places people who live with multiple families or in substandard
           housing in the at risk category. People who become homeless in times of
           economic hardship are considered episodically or transitionally homeless.
           It includes individuals and some families, and tends to be a younger
           population. Chronic is used to describe a homeless situation that has
           persisted for more than a year, and that includes sleeping outside of a
           residence as well as a disabling condition.
           HCD Table 18 identifies homeless facilities available countywide and is from
           the HCD dataset that counts beds by type of facility; Emergency,
           Transitional, or Permanent Supportive. Note that the data table does not
           segment the population by place, so these facilities are aggregated for the
           entire County.
           Data Analysis and Discussion: Countywide, there are 1,558 beds available.
           88% are permanent shelter beds and 12% are seasonal (winter) emergency
           shelter beds.

           Data Analysis and Discussion: 2010 Housing Element identified 390 of the
           year-round beds in Santa Maria. If the number in the City is unchanged,
           then 28.5% of the county total year-round beds are in the City.
                                         III-32

       The National Coalition for the Homeless estimates that, on
       average, 1.5% of the nation’s people are homeless. In 2005, the
       Santa Barbara County Public Health Department treated 4,082
       different individuals who identified themselves as being homeless.
       Because many people who are homeless do not use government
       services, it is reasonable to assume that 1.5% of the County’s total
       population, or 6,150 individuals, are homeless. The State
       Department of Finance estimated Santa Maria’s population at
       92,542 as of January 2009. If 1.5% of Santa Maria’s population is
       homeless, then 1,433 of Santa Maria’s people are homeless. Of
       these people, the Report states the episodic and chronic
       categories describe 80% and 10-15% of people who are
       homeless, respectively.
               –Santa Maria Housing Element 2010, page III-24.
Using 2014 DOF population (101,300) estimate for Santa Maria and the
1.5% estimate from 2005, then 1,433 the Santa Maria homeless estimate is
expected to have increased to 1,520.
HCD Table 19 identifies homeless needs countywide. This table counts
individuals and persons in families, but does not provide the types of
families (e.g., couples, parents with dependent children). Note that the data
table does not segment the population by place.
Data Analysis and Discussion: From 2012 to 2013, total homelessness
increased 30%. The unsheltered homeless population grew by 13% beyond
the (40%) increases that occurred in the additional sheltered population. For
the chronically homeless, from 2012 to 2013, demand for shelter increased
by 285 beds, but the number of shelter beds increased by 121, meaning
the number of “unsheltered” outgrew the increased supply by 164 beds.

Data Analysis and Discussion: There is a trend of continuously increasing
homelessness in all population groups. In recent years, increased demands
out pace the supply of beds for this special needs population.

H.         QUANTIFIED VALUE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING CONSERVATION
While the current costs and values may be subject to market fluctuations, the overall
conclusion that, when compared with new construction, conservation of affordable units
is the more cost-effective method of providing affordable housing. There is very little new
data on multi-family construction costs and construction costs for affordable housing.
What is known starts from the last analysis and adds information that still supports the
overall conclusion.
        i.     According to the 2005 Housing Element analysis, preservation of affordable
               units (at $117,600 each) was more cost-effective than building new affordable
               housing (at $205,000 each).
       ii.     The most current market rate housing is based on 2014-15 building permit and
               property tax valuations for the 8.72 acre, 268 unit Hancock Terrace Apartment
               project that will be under construction in 2015. The total value per unit is
               approximately $138,300. [Total costs are $35,000,000 for construction and
               $1,725,000 for land. The per-unit costs are approximately $131,800 for
               construction and $6,500 for land.]
      iii.     Ranch Hermosa is a mixed use site in the R-3 zoning district, which was built
               in 2011. The 2.89 acre site property tax valuation changed from $146,000 in
               2004 to $1,000,000 in 2005 and before development was approximately
               $380,000 per acre in 2010. After development, the site became property tax
               exempt and the present market value is unavailable. However, prior to the
               exemption, the Assessor valuations were $3,430,000 for land and $13,770,000
               for improvements ($17,200,000 total value) for 47 units and 8,800 square feet
               of office.
               After filtering out the non-residential space from the development valuation, the
               total residential cost per unit is estimated to be $330,000 per unit ($63,000 for
               land and $267,000 for new construction).
I.         LOCAL HOUSING NEEDS
Households with "housing problems" include those that occupy units meeting the
definition of: (1) having physical defects; (2) being overcrowded; and/or (3) a cost burden
greater than 30%.
          A housing unit with "physical defects" lacks a complete kitchen or bathroom.
          An "overcrowded" unit contains more than one person per room.
          "Cost burden greater than 30%" is the extent to which gross housing costs,
           including utility costs, exceed 30% of gross income, and "cost burden greater than
           50%," or "severe cost burden" is the extent to which gross housing costs exceed
           50% of gross income.
Income categories used in this document are based on the MFI for the Metropolitan
Statistical Area (MSA), which includes all of Santa Barbara County.

    2.       Local Homeownership:
             Table III-11 identifies five housing scenarios with modest homes priced
             between $100,000 and $300,000. After applying the various factors (e.g.,
             down payment, property taxes, etc.) and assuming a fixed 5% interest rate
             amortized over 30 years, each scenario calculates a minimum annual
             income to potentially qualify for financing. The last line of the table is an

        payment financing–adding higher monthly payments (more interest and
        private mortgage insurance).

4.     Local Housing Conditions:
       Table III-13 shows that the median age of all dwelling units in the City is 40
       years as of the 2010 Census; 1,307 dwelling units were located in structures
       built before 1940. Table III-14 identifies the units built before 1940 by Census
       Tract. According to the 1992 Housing Conditions Survey, about 7.3% of the
       city housing stock was in need of some maintenance to preserve the useful
       life of the structure.

                      The overall housing vacancy rates were 5.9% (1990) and 3.1% (2000) and
                      4.9% in 2010. It indicates that housing demand is variable, but the Santa
                                                               III-38
           Maria vacancy appears to be near 5%. The units lacking complete plumbing
           or kitchen in 2010 represent less than 1% of homes in the City. The changes
           from 2000 to 2010 may reflect the statistical accuracy of the Census/ACS
           data, or it may indicates changes in permitted improvements.
           The numbers of rehabilitation unit needs are assumed to be unchanged.
           Because of a greater than average occurrence of fair and poor housing
           conditions, Census Tracts 23.03, 23.04, 24.03, and 24.04 have
           neighborhoods targeted for housing rehabilitation programs. The conclusions
           indicate that 29 (poor) dwelling units need substantial rehabilitation or
           replacement and 445 (fair) dwelling units need relatively minor improvements
           to conserve the integrity of the housing stock.

           When looking at State EDD data for Santa Barbara County unemployment
           rates that are published on a regular basis, Santa Maria consistently has
           2.5% higher unemployment rate than the County as a whole.
           Employment sectors for the City of Santa Maria are shown in HCD Table 2,
           which estimates employment by “Civilian employed population 16 years of
           age and over,” (a standard metric) that shows the industries where residents
           work.
           Analysis: The notable employment characteristics of the City:
                Agriculture – Santa Maria houses 64.3% of agricultural workers in Santa
                 Barbara County
                Wholesale trade (28.5%) and Transportation (31.8)                                              are     also
                 proportionately higher in Santa Maria than the County

                  Discussion: The proportionately higher employment industries for Santa
                  Maria are basic industries kindred around agriculture, processing, and
                  distribution. Typically, these are low-wage sectors with the lowest
                  employment multipliers. Conversely, the higher employment multipliers
                  mostly occur where Santa Maria’s share is lowest relative to the County as
                  a whole.

         CHAPTER IV - INVENTORY OF AVAILABLE SITES
Chapter IV describes the available sites for affordable housing within the City of Santa
Maria. This chapter also includes discussion of the Regional Housing Needs Allocation
Plan and an analysis of the ability of the sites to accommodate the fair share allocation
for the City. Government Code Section 65583(a)(3) requires that the Housing Element
include an inventory of land suitable for residential development, including vacant sites
and sites having potential for redevelopment, and an analysis of the relationship of zoning
and public facilities and services to these sites. Government Code Section 65583.2(a)
requires that the inventory identify sites “...that are sufficient to provide for the jurisdiction's
share of the regional housing need for all income levels...” within the planning period. This
chapter documents that the City has sufficient available sites to provide its Regional
Housing Needs Allocation for each income category.
A.      REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATION PLAN
The Regional Housing Needs Allocation Plan, adopted by the Santa Barbara County
Association of Governments on July 18, 2013, ensures equal participation by all
jurisdictions in the region towards meeting the state affordable housing goals. The Plan
uses a "fair share" allocation methodology to assign each jurisdiction in the County with
housing production goals. In this way, countywide disparities between regions can be
directed towards the County percentages for each income group. Over time, no one area
of the County will bear excessive burdens of housing mostly very low- and low-income
households. Similarly, no community will reap the benefits of mostly above moderate-
income households.
        1.     Relationship of Regional Housing Needs Allocation to the Housing
               Element: In its Housing Element the City of Santa Maria is required to show
               that adequate housing sites are available to meet the projected housing
               needs for all income categories determined in the Regional Housing Needs
               Allocation. The Housing Element must show 40% of the housing units
               produced are affordable to U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
               Development defined standards.
               Allocations for regional housing needs (new construction) are derived from
               Santa Barbara County Association of Governments population and
               household growth projections. The income group proportions are then
               applied to the construction need allocation, which results in a goal for the
               number of housing units by income group within the City of Santa Maria.
               The Housing Element adopted in 2010 documented that City of Santa Maria
               had adequate sites to accommodate the City’s housing need allocation for
               the prior planning period; there is no carryover obligation for additional sites.
               The City of Santa Maria’s Regional Housing Needs Allocation for the current
               planning period (February 15, 2015 to February 15, 2023) is summarized
               by income group in Table IV -1, below.
                                               IV - 1

               Santa Barbara County Association of Governments’ Regional Housing
               Needs Allocation for the City does not specify the City’s allocation of
               Extremely Low Income units. Following Section 65583(a)(1) of the
               Government Code, the City will presume that 50% of the very low income
               households qualify as extremely low income households. The total number
               of extremely low and very low income households noted in Table IV–1 equal
               the City’s original 985 very low income units (24% of the total City’s

               Governments.

               Final Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) Plan 2014-2022, SBCAG, July 2013
        2.     Conclusion: Table IV-1 presents the projected housing needs for all income
               categories as determined in the Regional Housing Needs Allocation. The
               Adequate Sites section that follows demonstrates that the City of Santa Maria
               has more than a sufficient number of adequate housing sites available to
               meet the housing needs allocation for all income categories.
B.      ADEQUATE SITES
The amount of land required to accommodate the Regional Housing Needs Allocation
(RHNA) for new construction is dependent upon zoning, density, and adequacy of parcels
to accommodate residential development. Higher densities can result in economies of
scale and the spreading of certain fixed costs that will yield a lower per unit cost to build.
The City of Santa Maria has prepared an Available Land Inventory Summary in
conformance with Government Code Section 65583(a)(3). The Inventory includes a table
listing the identified sites and a master location map of the sites, as required by State
Government Code Section 65583.2.(b), are provided in Appendix IV-1. The Map and
Tables are connected by the reference numbers/letters. With the exception of the
Downtown Specific Plan, each site reference is one or more parcels or portions of parcels
that quantify the development potential in the specified income ranges.
                                                        IV - 2

Generally, the following housing types and densities are:
     Above Moderate [>120% Median Family Income (MFI)] consists of single-family
      detached sites with densities up to 8 du/acre.
     Moderate (80-120% MFI) consists of single-family attached sites with densities
      more than 8 du/acre and less than 20 du/acre.
     Low (50-80% MFI) consists of multi-family zoned sites with densities more than
      20 du/acre.
     Very Low (0-50% MFI) consists of most other sites with realistic densities greater
      than 30 du/acre or mixed use projects that would not otherwise have any
      residential uses.
     1.       Site Inventory for Lower Income Affordable Units (Low, Very Low, and
              Extremely Income Levels):
              The Lower Income households include Low, Very Low, and Extremely Low
              levels.
              Based on the Santa Barbara County Income Limits, previously cited, the
              Low Income level is set between 50% and 80% of the median income (i.e.,
              between $39,800 and $63,700, for a family of four) to occupy this housing.
              Generally, the Low Income housing type is high density multi-family
              apartments (MFA) or approved projects with long-term affordability
              commitments associated with density bonuses or State and Federal
              affordable housing/financing programs. These sites have met the requisite
              density greater than 20 units per acre and/or are under long-term
              commitments to provide affordable housing, but are not currently permitted
              for construction.
              The Very Low Income level is set at less than 50% of the median income
              (i.e., less than $39,800, for a family of four) to occupy this housing. A subset
              of the Very Low Income group is the Extremely Low income level is set at
              less than 30% of the median income (i.e., less than $23,900, for a family of
              four).
              This update assumes that roughly “half” the 985 Very Low total are
              Extremely Low units (493 Very Low and 492 Extremely Low).
              Generally, the Very Low Income housing type is on sites or in projects that
              realistically exceed 22 dwelling units per acre. Exceeding 22 du/acre may
              be achieved in the following ways:
                 Density bonus projects in the R-3 zoning district may achieve up to 29.7
                  du/acre for standard Multi-family apartment projects or up to 36 du/acre
                  for senior housing projects.
                                             IV - 3

  Senior housing projects, at up to 30 du/acre for standard senior housing
   or 36 du/acre with a density bonus, may be permitted in commercial
   zoning districts on a case-by-case approval basis.
  In the Town Center District, Bungalow District, or Railroad-Loft District
   of the Downtown Specific Plan, residential densities are not specifically
   limited.
  Both Efficiency Unit Projects and Mixed Use Projects do not apply
   residential density limitations.
This Housing Element assumes that Mixed Use sites with multiple base
zoning districts and Efficiency Unit Project sites that are within the original
four-square mile area of the City are capable of the highest densities (i.e.,
greater than 30 units per acre without financial subsidy or density bonus).
The City’s expectation for future development of high density projects is
based on recent past approval of similar projects, including the following:

The housing sites identified for lower income households were selected for
their high level of suitability for high density residential development. Except
for the Efficiency Unit conversion sites, the criteria used to select these
suitable sites include that the site is: vacant; over one acre in size; lacking
environmental or infrastructure constraints that would prevent development
or limit the site’s unit capacity; and capable to be developed for affordable
housing within the planning period.
a.      Availability of Infrastructure: According to the City Public Works
        Department, the City can supply water and sewer services to all areas
        within the City limits, including all of the parcels identified for the lower
        income households. Infrastructure can easily be extended to these
        parcels, all of which are adequately planned for service consistent with
        the 2010 Stormwater Management Plan, 2009 Sewer System
        Management Plan (recertified 2014) and the 2011 Urban Water
        Management Plan. According to these plans, the City’s water and
        sewer treatment plants, together with anticipated expansions, have
        enough existing capacity to accommodate the City’s regional housing
        needs allocation.
        Sufficient infrastructure and other services are in place to serve the
        lower income sites identified in Available Land Inventory Summary.
        Private developers currently finance infrastructure necessary to
        serve their proposed projects. The City has previously examined
        other options for financing infrastructure extensions, possibly
        through the use of general obligation bonds, but the preferred
        method is to have developers pay to extend services to their projects.
b.      Environmental Constraints: According to the Resources Management
        Element of the General Plan there are no environmental constraints
        such as wetlands, cultural resources, or hazardous waste that would
        inhibit developers from building on the parcels identified in the land
        inventory. The City is characterized by flat land. As a result, no major
        grading would be required on these parcels. The Community
        Development Department has reviewed all affordable housing sites
        presented in Chapter IV with regard to the currently adopted flood
        plain maps prepared by the Federal Emergency Management
        Agency.
                                 IV - 5

          For the remainder of the available sites, the Community Development
          Department has concluded that none of the lower income housing
          sites are inappropriate for development due to potential flooding
          problems.
          None of the identified parcels fall under the provisions of the
          Williamson Act, which would otherwise pose a constraint to
          development.
          Although some seismic faults exist in and near the City, the area has
          not experienced major seismic activity as a result of these faults. In
          addition, none of the identified parcels are known to be directly over
          fault lines. Faults in the general vicinity are the following: Santa Maria
          Fault, Santa Maria River Fault, and Casmalia Fault (refer to Table SE-
          1 and Figure SE-2 of the Safety Element of the General Plan).
   c.     Affordability of Identified Vacant Lower Income Sites: City of Santa
          Maria’s R-3 zoning designation allows 22 dwelling units per acre. For
          the Lower Income Sites, this density enables the City to utilize the
          default density standard established by Government Code Section
          65583.2(c)(3)(B) for determining the appropriate City zone for the
          facilitation of affordable housing. Utilizing a realistic unit capacity the
          Available Land Inventory Summary document’s that these sites have
          the realistic capacity to provide the City with 1,716 affordable units,
          which completely addresses the City’s Very Low and Low income
          RHNA allocation.
   d.      Realistic Development Capacity: The Available Land Inventory
          Summary identifies vacant R-3 designated sites, one acre or larger in
          size, Mixed Use sites, and Efficiency Unit sites. On the larger R-3
          designated sites the development standards applicable to the R-3
          zone will not adversely affect the potential to reach the density
          capacity identified in the inventory. Likewise, the readily available
          infrastructure and the lack of environmental constraints on these
          vacant sites will allow projects to achieve at or near maximum density.
   In summary, the Available Land Inventory Summary and analysis of the R-
   3 designated sites demonstrates that the City has sufficient land to provide
   at least 1,716 affordable units, which completely addresses the City’s
   allocation of 1,641 units designated for Very Low Income households and
   Low Income households.
2. Site Inventory for Affordable Units (Moderate Income Levels): The City
   has identified approximately 205 acres of vacant medium and high-density
   zoned land, at densities up to 20 dwelling units per acre. The Moderate
   Income sites have a development potential of more than 1,661 new dwelling
   units. The medium and high-density designated lands within the Mahoney
   Ranch South Specific Plan and the Blosser Southeast Specific Plan alone
   can accommodate 600 additional units allocated to Moderate Income level.
                                   IV - 6

In addition to meeting the RHNA goals for Moderate Income units, there are
numerous areas throughout the community where R-2 zoned properties are
underutilized (i.e. developed with single family homes or other residential
structures). Duplexes and two detached homes on one parcel are permitted
land uses within the R-2 zone. Clearly, there is sufficient vacant area
available for the development of additional units, without the need to remove
existing structures. A sample of such sites includes:
   215 East Newlove Drive - 1.6 acres
   681 East Newlove Drive - 1.1 acres
   413 West Dal Porto Lane - 0.93 acres
   901-905 West Cook Street - 0.56 acres
   331 South Oakley Ave. – 0.54 acres
   607 West Fesler Street - 0.52 acres
   425 West Dal Porto Lane - 0.5 acres
a.     Availability of Infrastructure: As stated earlier, sufficient infrastructure
       and other services are in place to serve the Lower Income sites. The
       same conclusion is made for the vacant sites allocated to Moderate
       Income households. Private developers currently finance
       infrastructure necessary to serve their proposed projects. The City has
       previously examined other options for financing infrastructure
       extensions, possibly through the use of general obligation bonds, but
       the preferred method is to have developers pay to extend services to
       their projects.
b.     Environmental Constraints: As stated earlier, according to the
       Resources Management Element of the General Plan there are no
       environmental constraints such as wetlands, cultural resources, or
       hazardous waste that would restrict developers from building on the
       parcels identified in the Available Land Inventory Summary. Similarly,
       none of the vacant parcels contains environmental constraints, as
       these parcels are predominantly adjacent to developed land and can
       be considered infill.
c.     Affordability of Identified Vacant Moderate Income Sites: Based on the
       Santa Barbara County Income Limits, the Moderate Income level is
       set between 80% and 120% of the median income (i.e., between
       $63,700 and $87,950, for a family of four) to occupy this housing.
       Generally, multi-family apartments or single-family attached unit types
       typically associated with the low-medium to medium-high densities–
       more than 8 units per acre and less than 20 units per acre.
                                IV - 7

   d.     Realistic Development Capacity: The lack of environmental
          constraints and full availability of infrastructure to all of the sites
          designated for Moderate Income households ensures that new
          construction for this income level can be achieved during the planning
          period for this Housing Element.
    In summary, the Available Land Inventory Summary and analysis of the
    Moderate Income sites demonstrates that the City has sufficient land to
    provide more than the 730 units designated for Moderate Income
    households, as directed in the adopted RHNA.
3. Site Inventory for Affordable Units (Above Moderate Income Levels):
   Since available land has been identified for Low Income and Moderate
   Income households, the remaining income category to address is for Above
   Moderate Income households. The Regional Housing Needs Assessment
   projected a need for 1,731 dwelling units to be constructed for Above
   Moderate Income households. The City expects this need to be
   accommodated through new construction of market rate, single-family
   housing. Four key projects, with a combined total development capacity of
   1,932 single family homes which readily address this need are: Area 9
   Specific Plan with 275 of the 550 approved vertical mixed-use residential
   units expected at an Above Moderate Income level; Heritage at Westgate
   Ranch with 296 single-family homes; Mahoney Ranch South Specific Plan,
   with 787 single-family homes; and Blosser Southeast Specific Plan, with 574
   single-family homes. In each case, their respective Specific Plan or project
   entitlement has been approved, with full CEQA clearance and the projects
   are anticipating submitting development plans and subdivisions, subject to
   favorable market conditions.
   a.     Availability of Infrastructure: The above projects can be served
          through extensions of existing public facilities. Private developers
          currently finance infrastructure necessary to serve their proposed
          projects. The City has previously examined other options for financing
          infrastructure extensions, possibly through the use of general
          obligation bonds, but the preferred method is to have developers pay
          to extend services to their projects.
   b.     Environmental Constraints: The majority of Above Moderate Income
          units are located within areas addressed by adopted Specific Plans.
          The Area 9 Specific Plan was adopted on April 3, 2012; the Mahoney
          Ranch South Specific Plan was adopted on October 7, 2008; the
          Blosser Southeast Specific Plan was adopted on July 14, 1994;
          Heritage at Westgate Ranch Planned Development Permit was
          approved On October 20, 2010. An Environmental Impact Report was
          prepared for these projects, such that no further CEQA review will be
          required for subsequent residential development plans, as long as
          such development is consistent with the Specific Plan (reference
          Government Code Section 65457).
                                  IV - 8
   c.      Affordability of Identified Vacant Above Moderate Sites: The City
           expects Above Moderate Income housing to be provided through new
           construction of single-family market rate housing. Timing of
           construction and sales prices of homes are completely dependent on
           market conditions. According to the 2014 State of California Housing
           Income Limits for Santa Barbara County, the median income for a
           family of four is $73,300; therefore, the Above Moderate income level
           is set at (greater than) 120% of the median income, which would be
           $87,950 and above to occupy this housing.
   d.      Realistic Development Capacity: The full mitigation of environmental
           constraints and planned availability of infrastructure to both identified
           and approved projects designated for Above Moderate Income levels,
           ensures that new construction for this income level can be achieved
           during the planning period for the City’s Housing Element.
   In summary, through analysis of the approved specific plans and projects
   (2,508 single-family homes), the City has demonstrated the availability of
   sufficient vacant land to allow construction of more than the 1,731 units
   designated for Above Moderate Income households, as directed in the
   adopted RHNA.
4. Site Inventory – Additional Opportunities for Affordable Housing: The
   affordable housing unit targets, specified in the adopted (2013) RHNA, have
   been met through the analysis presented above. Further, three additional
   opportunities to provide affordable housing deserve mention: The City’s
   Mixed Use Projects ordinance, the Efficiency Unit Ordinance, and the
   Downtown Specific Plan.
   a.      Mixed-Use Projects Ordinance: The City adopted a Mixed-Use
           Projects ordinance on March 21, 2006. (Santa Maria Municipal Code
           Chapter 12-49). The ordinance significantly expands the City’s
           potential housing opportunities in two major ways. First, the ordinance
           allows approval of housing projects in connection with a primary non-
           residential use on land in Commercial-Professional Office, Community
           Commercial, Light Manufacturing and Commercial Manufacturing
           zones where the City’s Municipal Code had previously prohibited
           residential uses. In addition, the ordinance provides increasing levels
           of flexibility to the Zoning Administrator, Planning Commission and
           City Council to allow reduced development standards to well-designed
           projects. Santa Maria developers have eagerly embraced the new
           opportunities to mix residential uses with others, and several mixed-
           use projects have been approved and constructed to date.
                                   IV - 9

       Second, the ordinance provides the opportunity to add residential
       uses to sites already developed with other uses. The City has already
       received and approved applications for several small-scale mixed re-
       use projects. One project proposes to add a residential unit above a
       convenience market at a gasoline/service station facility; another
       proposes to add a caretaker unit next to a sheet-metal shop.
       Several projects have been approved since the adoption of the
       Mixed-Use Projects Ordinance. One example is the McClelland-
       Inger Project approved in 2007. The now completed project is
       located at the northwest corner of South McClelland Street and Inger
       Drive in a PD/R-3 (Planned Development/High Density Residential)
       district. The project includes 47 condominium units and nearly 9,000
       square feet of commercial space. As of July 2014, 339 Mixed Use
       residential units have been approved; of those, 63 have been
       constructed.
b.     Downtown Specific Plan: The City adopted the Downtown Specific
       Plan on November 4. 2008. Throughout a large area within the City’s
       core, this Plan provides for residential uses above commercial uses in
       multi-storied buildings. Since all City services are currently in place for
       these properties and since development constraints (especially
       parking standards) are removed or mitigated in these areas, the
       potential exists for development during the planning period. Many of
       the housing units contemplated could be constructed at densities of
       20 dwelling units per acre or more, thereby qualifying them to be
       counted toward meeting the City’s fair share of housing for persons
       with low and very-low incomes.
       The Final Environmental Impact Report certified for the Downtown
       Specific Plan addresses the potential impacts of new residential
       development capacity that could accommodate up to 2,500
       downtown units.
In summary, while the Housing Element anticipates that each of the City’s
residential zoning designations will play a part in satisfying the Regional
Housing Needs allocation, the City will continue to rely on the Mixed Use
Ordinance and the Downtown Specific Plan to provide additional affordable
housing units, particularly in the Low, Moderate and Above Moderate
Income level categories.
c.     Efficiency Unit Projects: Efficiency Unit Projects are allowed in the C-
       1 and C-2 commercial zoning districts, districts which make up most
       of the City’s major transit corridors. A maximum development potential
       assessment of a 0.87 acre redevelopment site was conducted by the
       Planning Division and it was theoretically possible to achieve 100
       dwelling units per acre. Staff concluded that the more realistic
       maximum density would be 80% (i.e., 80 dwelling units per acre) and
       further, that the likely densities proposed would be between 50% and
                                IV - 10

                      80% of the realistic density (i.e., between 40 and 65 dwelling units per
                      acre). These regulations offer a feasible option for conversion of old
                      motels along the Broadway corridor.
C.      Zoning for a Variety of Housing Types:
Government Code Section 65583 requires that “…the housing element shall identify
adequate sites for housing, including rental housing, factory-built housing, mobile homes,
and emergency shelters.” The following narrative describes the zoning districts that permit
those various housing types.
  Multi-family Rental Housing: Duplexes, two detached dwelling units are permitted
   uses in the R-2 Medium-Density Residential District. Dwelling Groups, Triplexes and
   fourplexes are permitted subject to the approval of a Conditional Use Permit.
   Dwelling Groups, Duplexes, and Triplexes are permitted in the R-3 High-Density
   Residential District. Boardinghouses, Student Housing, and residential developments
   with four or more units are subject to use permit approval.
  Mobile Homes and Factory Built Housing: Mobile Homes and Factory Built Housing
   are treated the same as single family homes by the land use provisions of the Zoning
   Code, except that the City also has the Residential Mobile Home Park (RMH) District
   which is exclusively for mobile homes. The RMH district permits a maximum of 10
   dwelling units per acre. Mobile Homes and Factory Built Homes are permitted in the
   following Zoning Districts:
                                          TABLE IV-2
            Zoning Districts Which Allow Mobile Homes and Factory Built

          R-3 High-Density Residential                          By Right
          R-2 Medium-Density Residential District               By Right
          RSL-1 Single-Family Small Lot Residential District    By Right
          R-1 Single-Family Residential District                By Right
          RA Residential Agricultural District                  By Right
          OS - Open Space District                              Conditional Use Permit
   The 1,548 mobile home units within the City’s mobile home parks provide a fairly
   significant part (5.4%) of the City’s housing stock. Mobile homes can provide a more
   affordable housing option to traditional (Above Moderate) single-family detached
   living.
   In 1993, the City adopted a mobile home park closure conversion ordinance (SMMC
   Chapter 12-9A.) that provides residents with ample payment and relocation assistance
   if a park is closed. This conversion ordinance also addresses change of ownership of
   mobile home parks and requires filing a Conversion Impact Report with any
   application for conversion to resident ownership of a park.
                                               IV - 11

  In 1999, the Santa Maria City Council expressed their support for a voluntary model
  lease program, which could assist in obtaining favorable leases for mobile home parks
  within the City.
 Housing for Agricultural Employees (Farmworkers): The City of Santa Maria does
  not restrict the development of housing for farmworkers to any particular residential
  zoning district. As evidenced by the Los Adobes de Maria I and II projects, farmworker
  housing projects are permitted as multi-family or single-family.
 Efficiency Unit Projects Ordinance: As noted in Subsection IV-B.c, the City adopted
  the Efficiency Unit Projects Ordinance. The Ordinance will facilitate both the new
  construction of efficiency dwelling unit projects and the structural conversion of transient
  occupancy uses into single-room occupancy projects, which adds another type of
  potential housing.
 Emergency Shelters: California Government Code Section 65582(d) defines
  Emergency Shelter as follows:
      Emergency shelter means housing with minimal supportive services for
      homeless persons that is limited to occupancy of six months or less by a
      homeless person. No individual or household may be denied emergency
      shelter because of an inability to pay.”
  Government Code Section 65583(a)(4) requires cities with an unmet need for
  emergency shelters to identify a zone in which shelters may be located as a matter of
  right. The zone must also identify objective standards for the use which facilitate
  emergency centers, whether as original development or converted uses.
  The Emergency Shelter code permits by right an emergency shelter project in the
  CPO (Commercial Office and Professional Office) and PF (Public Facilities) zoning
  districts. The code also allows Emergency Shelter Projects within the C-1 (Central
  Business) and C-2 (General Commercial) zones of the City subject to the approval of
  a Conditional Use Permit. Chapter 12-53 includes definitions, development standards,
  and procedures relating to the approval of emergency shelter projects.
 Transitional/Supportive Housing: California Government Code Section 65582(g)
  defines Transitional Housing as follows:
      (h) Transitional housing and transitional housing development means buildings
      configured as rental housing developments, but operated under program
      requirements that call for the termination of assistance and recirculation of the
      assisted unit to another eligible program recipient at some predetermined future
      point in time, which shall be no less than six months.
  The California Government Code Section 65582(f) defines Supportive Housing as
  follows:
      (1) Supportive housing means housing with no limit on length of stay, that is
      occupied by the target population, and that is linked to onsite or offsite services
      that assist the supportive housing resident in retaining the housing, improving
      his or her health status, and maximizing his or her ability to live and, when
      possible, work in the community.
                                            IV - 12

    The same State law requirements concerning Emergency Shelters also addressed
    Transitional and Supportive housing. Government Code Section 65583(a)(5) requires
    that:
       Transitional housing and supportive housing shall be considered a residential
       use of property, and shall be subject only to those restrictions that apply to
       other residential dwellings of the same type in the same zone.
    Since the adoption of the 2010 Housing Element, the City of Santa Maria has
    amended the Municipal Code Title 12 zoning ordinance definitions to include
    Supportive Housing and Transitional Housing, and establish these housing types as
    a residential use, subject only to those restrictions that apply to other residential
    dwellings of the same type in the same zone.
   Conclusion:
       The City of Santa Maria Zoning Districts provide for a variety of housing types,
       including emergency shelters, transitional and supportive housing, rental
       housing, efficiency unit projects, factory-built housing, and mobilehomes.
D.     ADEQUATE SITES ALTERNATIVE
The Adequate Sites Alternative (Government Code 65583.1) allows jurisdictions to satisfy
up to 25% of their affordable unit need through the rehabilitation, conversion, and/or
preservation of existing units. As demonstrated by the Adequate Sites discussion
presented in Section IV-B above, the City has satisfied its Regional Housing Needs
Allocation. While it is not necessary for the City to provide the Adequate Sites Alternative
analysis, the City is committed to the facilitation of affordable residential units through
various housing programs and removing constraints as described in Chapter V –
Constraints on Housing and Chapter VI – Housing Programs.
E.     SUMMARY/CONCLUSIONS
In accordance with State law, the City of Santa Maria has demonstrated sufficient
capacity for new construction of dwelling units to meet the City’s assigned Regional
Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA allocation). In fact, the City has exceeded the RHNA
allocation in all four of the income levels.
For the Low Income and Very Low Income RHNA allocation categories, the City has
provided capacity for 1,716 units through vacant land zoned R-3, the Downtown Specific
Plan, the Mixed Use Ordinance, and the Efficiency Unit Ordinance. Since the City expects
this vacant land to develop at a density of 20 dwelling units per acre or greater, State law
(Government Code Section 65583.2) allows the City to designate these units as
affordable for Low and Very Low Income categories. In effect, the City provides for 75
more lower-income units than the 1,641 units required by the RHNA allocation.
                                             IV - 13

Likewise, the City has identified more than a sufficient amount of land to provide for the
assigned Moderate Income RHNA allocation of 730 units. The City plans to address the
Moderate Income allocation through implementation of Specific Plans, approved Medium
and High Density discretionary projects, and the additional dwelling units that could be
developed on the Moderate Income Level sites identified the Available Land Inventory.
Collectively, the 1,661 unit capacity of the land identified exceeds the Moderate Income
RHNA allocation by 931 units.
Finally, the City has sufficient capacity for new Above Moderate Income units through
land designated for market rate single-family housing. The combined development
capacity for market rate single-family units of the Mahoney Ranch South Specific Plan
and Blosser Southeast Specific Plan (1,361 units) satisfies the majority of the City’s
assigned Above Moderate Income allocation (1,731 units).
In conclusion, since there is no shortfall of sites or zoning available to encourage a variety
of housing types, there is no need to add or revise programs to address this issue. The
City of Santa Maria has concluded that the Sites Inventory presented in Section IV of the
Housing Element is adequate to meet the RHNA new construction goals assigned to the
City.

            CHAPTER V — CONSTRAINTS ON HOUSING
This Chapter was structured in accordance with the format delineated in the BUILDING
BLOCKS FOR EFFECTIVE HOUSING ELEMENTS document published by the State
Department of Housing and Community Development. The topics described below are
presented in the order presented in that publication.
According to the State Government Code, the Housing Element must identify and analyze
potential and actual governmental constraints to the maintenance, improvement, or
development of housing for all income levels, including housing for persons with
disabilities. The analysis should identify the specific standards and processes and
evaluate their impact, including cumulatively, on the supply and affordability of housing.
The analysis should determine whether local regulatory standards pose an actual
constraint and must also demonstrate local efforts to remove constraints that hinder a
jurisdiction from meeting its housing needs.
Chapter IV presents that the City of Santa Maria has successfully demonstrated adequate
capacity to meet its fair share of affordable housing, as allocated by the Regional Housing
Needs Assessment. The City does not anticipate any governmental constraints toward
construction of that housing, as these constraints have been adequately addressed
through implementation of the previous Housing Element. Nevertheless, the information
presented in this Chapter corresponds to the requirements of State Government Code
Section 65583. Of particular note is the discussion of non-governmental constraints,
about which the City of Santa Maria has no direct influence.
A.      LAND-USE CONTROLS
Government Code Section 65583(a) requires “An analysis of potential and actual
governmental constraints upon the maintenance, improvement, or development of
housing for all income levels, including land use controls, building codes and their
enforcement, site improvements, fees and other exactions required of developers, and
local processing and permit procedures”. (emphasis added)
According to the BUILDING BLOCKS publication, the constraint analysis must identify all
relevant land-use controls such as zoning, development standards, and any growth
controls and analyze impacts on the cost and supply of housing. An adequate evaluation
must assess the cumulative impacts of standards, including whether such requirements
impede the ability to achieve maximum allowable densities.
The City of Santa Maria has addressed land use constraints, in the manner presented as
follows:
        1.      Zoning Regulations: Dwellings with accessory apartments are not allowed
                in single family residential zones. The City Council adopted Ordinance 83-
                1066, precluding the development of second units in single family zones, in
                                               V-1

   1984. Therefore, the City is not subject to the regulations adopted with CGC
   Section 65852.2 (second-unit law). Due to increased traffic, infrastructure
   sizing, and land use compatibility issues, it is unlikely that this policy will be
   changed.
   Manufactured housing is allowed in all residential zones. The manufactured
   home must be placed on a permanent foundation and be compatible with
   surrounding units. The cost of construction is less than that of a standard
   stick-built unit.
   Significantly reduced single family lot sizes have been allowed throughout
   the City. RSL-1 zoning allows lots of 4,500 square feet (normal R-1, R-2
   and R-3 zoning call for lots of at least 6,000 square feet). Through a
   subdivision map, the City Council may approve lot sizes smaller than noted
   in each zone and lot sizes as low as 2,500 square feet have been approved
   in the R-2 zoning district.
   On April 17, 2012, the City adopted the Efficiency Unit Projects Ordinance,
   adding Chapter 12- 52 to the Santa Maria Municipal Code. The Ordinance
   will facilitate both the structural conversion of existing transient occupancy
   uses and the new construction of efficiency dwelling unit projects within the
   Central Business District (C-1) zone and the General Commercial District
   (C-2) zone, through the issuance of a planned development (PD) permit.
   The City permits the expansion of residential living space to the full extent
   allowable by standards of the zoning district or applicable specific plan.
   However, the single-family residential zoning districts permit only one
   dwelling unit per parcel. Garage conversions to expand living space do not
   change that restriction.
   It has been the City's policy to encourage a moderate amount of
   architectural interest and detail on all new structures in the City. However,
   design and development criteria, which add considerably to the cost without
   being essential to providing basic housing, are considered on a project
   basis through the planned development (PD) or conditional use permit
   (CUP) process.
   The adopted specific plan areas include the design standards, which seek
   to recreate traditional neighborhood designs, and include front porches
   close to the street, recessed garages, decorative street lighting, and
   landscaped parkways.
2. Development Standards: Table V-1 summarizes City zoning standards for
   residential developments. Note that this table generally indicates the
   applicable standards. Pertinent zoning code sections should be consulted
   to identify any exceptions to the regulations outlined in this Housing
   Element.
                                    V-2
It is recognized that certain standards can be relaxed through use of a
planned development permit or alternative standards stated in a specific
plan, and depending on the needs of the consumer for which the
development is targeted. The City's parking standards are commonly
accepted, and where covered parking is required, the City does not require
garages but accepts carports for this requirement.
Design and development criteria will continue to be considered on a case-
by-case basis, and standards will be relaxed when appropriate.
Consideration of more flexible standards in mixed-use applications
increases the potential for the urban core areas to increase housing density.
Reduced prices and rents within each development will provide affordability.

      FOOTNOTES FROM THE RESIDENTIAL ZONING STANDARDS MATRIX:
  1.  A Planned Development (PD) designation combined with the zone district designation is intended to permit a flexible design approach to the development of a total community
      environment equal to or better than that resulting from traditional lot by lot development. Approval of the design of the project is subject to Planning Commission review.
  2.  Refers to gross acre which is the total land area of a parcel or parcels exclusive of existing public right-of-way (streets, sidewalks, alleys, etc.). ; any density bonus provisions applicable
      under SMMC Section 12-48.
  3.  Maximum density depending on land use designation (LWDR-4, LDR-5, LMDR-8, or MDR-12).
  4.  Senior citizen housing may be allowed at a maximum density of 30 dwelling units per acre subject to a conditional use permit and the development standards specified in SMMC Section
      12-8.18.
  5.  In the case where a number follows the zoning designation, that number specifies the minimum lot size (e.g., R-1 6,000 specifies a 6,000 sq. ft. minimum lot size).

     c. A bay window, fireplace, and minor projection of floor area, each not exceeding 8 feet in width, may extend a maximum of 30 inches into any required yard provided that combustible
           material is located away from the property line as specified in the Uniform Building Code.
  8.  Patio covers and trellises:
      a. Patio covers open on 3 sides, and trellises shall have a minimum setback of 5 feet from the side property line in residential developments with zero side yards, provided the structure
             is not higher than 10 feet or longer than 20 feet.

    b.    A reduction in required setback for mixed use projects may be permitted pursuant to Section 12-49.09(c).
20. In the R-2 zoning district, any lot of 6,000 square feet or less of net land area may have two dwelling units provided all setback, open space, landscaping, and parking requirements of
    the R-2 zone can be met. (SMMC Section 12-7.08(d))
21. Density is exclusive of additional density allowed through a development agreement for the provision of affordable housing, as provided under SMMC Section 12-48.

       3.     Growth Management: Growth management policies may indirectly
              increase housing prices in the short term and inhibit new employers from
              moving into the area. Development of fewer housing units results from
              increasing costs and limiting housing supplies.
              The City of Santa Maria does not impose any ordinances or policies which
              serve to limit residential growth, such as prohibitions against multi-family
              housing, urban growth boundaries, moratoria or any process to limit the
              number of units approved or built. In 1996, the City adopted a growth
              management policy (Policy 13 of the Resources Management Element of
              the General Plan) to provide sufficient resources and infrastructure to
              support existing population and planned growth. Over time, Policy 13 has
              served to accommodate and support residential growth, in accordance with
              the City’s General Plan.
B.     FEES AND EXACTIONS
Government Code Section 65583(a) requires “An analysis of potential and actual
governmental constraints upon the maintenance, improvement, or development of
housing for all income levels including fees and other exactions required of developers
and local processing and permit procedures”. (emphasis added)
According to the BUILDING BLOCKS publication, the Housing Element must identify
permit processing and planning fees and development and impact fees and exactions for
impacts on the cost, feasibility, and affordability of housing. The analysis should include
an estimate of the average fees for typical multi-family and single-family developments.
The City of Santa Maria has addressed this constraint, in the manner presented below.
Housing development is typically subject to two types of fees or exactions: infrastructure
financing/growth mitigation fees; and permit processing fees.
       1.     Infrastructure Financing/Growth Mitigation Fees: Since voter-approval
              of Proposition 13 in 1978, the financing of urban infrastructure evolved from
              using the general obligation bond into a financing system of user fees. This
              evolution shifted infrastructure financing from the City to the developer.
              Before passage of Proposition 13, cities could fairly easily pass bond issues
              to finance infrastructure. Costs were spread throughout the community.
              Because of voter sentiments against taxation and the public sentiment that
              growth and development should pay for the necessary infrastructure and
              improvements, bond issues require two-thirds majority voter approval and
              are not given much of a chance for passage. The present system requires
              development to pay user fees for financing urban infrastructure. It requires
              the developer to install and dedicate infrastructure, or pay in fees in lieu of
              dedication, to the City for the privilege (the courts have ruled that
              development is a privilege and not a right) to build a project. Most of these
              costs transfer to the end users of the project. If it is a housing project, the
              costs can translate into several thousand dollars per unit.
                                             V-7

   The City's existing growth mitigation fees include buildings, city hall, park
   acquisition, park development, residential development tax, police, fire,
   library, traffic mitigation, state water, water, wastewater connection,
   wastewater impact fees. Table V-2 summarizes this information. Growth
   mitigation fees represent an alternative for financing the capital
   improvements needed to accommodate growth.
   The City of Santa Maria collects fees from developers to help pay for capital
   improvements and facilities needed due to growth. Development pays only
   for its share of the facilities needed due to growth. Affordable housing
   projects receive a traffic fee reduction and may request reductions for senior
   housing projects or fee payment deferrals over a 5-year period.
   In addition to City-imposed development fees, the local school districts
   collect school impact fees for new construction projects in the City. School
   fees are established by S.B. 50 and are adopted by the local school districts.
   The Santa Maria Bonita School District and Santa Maria Joint Union High
   School District adopted Level II fees; the Orcutt Union School District
   collects Level I fees. Even if increased enrollment requires a physical
   change in the environment, such as school construction, state law does not
   allow cities to mitigate the impact through the CEQA process. Government
   Code Section 65996 (fees set by school districts are the exclusive methods
   of mitigating impacts on school facilities).
2. Permit Processing Fees: The various planning review and processing
   fees, development impact fees, and utility service connection fees
   collectively can add certain costs on housing. For example, recent
   calculations from the Community Development Department have indicated
   that, for a typical 45-unit multi-family project, development fees are
   approximately 17.4% of the total estimated sales price of that project.
   Similarly, for a 25-lot single family subdivision, development fees comprise
   approximately 12.4% of total aggregated sales prices for the subdivision.
   Obviously, these amounts and percentages are subject to change as
   housing product sizes, sales prices and construction costs rise and fall in
   various business cycles experienced by the State and local economies.
   Table V-3 provides a summary of all typical development processing fees
   currently imposed by the City on residential projects. Table V-3(a) indicates
   the minimal effect of overall development fees on housing by presenting the
   fees as a percentage of median sales prices. For propose of the analysis,
   the estimated per-unit fee for the typical residential development includes
   impact fees, plan check, permit and inspection fees, and the following
   typical development processing fees: Planned Unit Development, map fees,
   and environmental assessment/negative declaration fee. To provide a
   perspective of the cumulative impacts of fees on the cost and supply of
                                    V-8
                         housing, Table V-3(b) compares Santa Maria Planning Division fees with
                         the planning agency fees of neighboring jurisdictions in Santa Barbara and
                         San Luis Obispo Counties. The fees to develop in Santa Maria are
                         considerably less than other jurisdictions.

C.     PROCESSING AND PERMIT PROCEDURES
Government Code Section 65583(a) requires “An analysis of potential and actual
governmental constraints upon the maintenance, improvement, or development of
housing for all income levels, including land use controls, building codes and their
enforcement, site improvements, fees and other exactions required of developers, and
local processing and permit procedures”. (emphasis added)
Processing and permit procedures can pose a considerable constraint to the production
and improvement of housing. Common constraints include lengthy processing time,
unclear permitting procedures, layered reviews, multiple discretionary review
requirements, and costly conditions of approval. These constraints increase the final cost
of housing, uncertainty in the development of the project, and overall financial risk
assumed by the developer. The City of Santa Maria has addressed these constraints, in
the manner presented below.
       1.      Discretionary Processing: Santa Maria seeks to maintain the expeditious
               processing of development within the City. During the years 2000 to 2009
               the City approved over 4,500 residential units.
               While the Zoning Ordinance requires most units to receive some form of
               discretionary review, the process can sometimes be completed at an
               administrative level through a Zoning Administrator use permit. A majority
               of the 4,500 units (78%) required a Tract Map and Planned Development
               Permit. The City works with the developers throughout the process to inform
               the applicant of development standards and code provisions that will apply
               to the project. Appendix V-1 presents a detailed list of each of these
               projects; processing times are summarized in the following Table:

                                             V-12

   Santa Maria is a development-friendly community. The City’s Mission
   Statement in part says, “We are committed to providing excellent service to
   the public in the most responsive, efficient and effective manner.” The
   projects noted above were processed in an average of 68 days despite the
   fact that many of the permits required multiple discretionary permits.
2. Conditional Use Permits: The Municipal Code requires a conditional use
   permit approval for four or more units in the R-3 zone district, and for three
   or more units in the R-2 zone district. The purpose of the Conditional Use
   Permit process is to ensure that the project is physically compatible, from a
   site design and urban design perspective, with its surrounding
   neighborhood, and that adequate infrastructure is provided for the project’s
   residents. To further add certainty to the development process, the
   conditional use permit (CUP) process also provides builders with advance
   notice of City Code requirements applicable to all new development.
   The City of Santa Maria believes that the CUP requirement for multiple-
   family projects has little impact on either the time it takes to process an
   application or the cost to the developer. Large multi-family projects are
   typically handled as planned development (PD) permits that take about the
   same amount of time to process as a CUP for a similarly sized project. Multi-
   family projects draw public concern and, whether or not hearings are
   required, the city needs to provide time for public comment on such projects.
   In addition, environmental review is usually required for such projects; this
   review process dictates the timing of decisions.
   CUPs for smaller multi-family projects (12 or fewer units, not in a Planned
   Development Overlay) may be processed at an administrative level through
   a Zoning Administrator. The approval process through the Zoning
   Administrator is much faster than the CUP involving a Planning Commission
   Public Hearing.
3. Effective Process: Developers state that Santa Maria’s permit
   requirements and processing have not significantly affected housing
   development feasibility. For example, in building the Good Samaritan
   facility, Good Samaritan Executive Director, Sylvia Barnard reported: “…the
   process was efficient and cost effective. The CUP process remained
   consistent with the original development projection.” Further, Ms. Barnard
   reported that “…the City of Santa Maria does compare favorably with the
   affordable housing development process in other cities in the Central Coast.
   Good Samaritan has developed an affordable housing project in the City of
   Lompoc, and the City of Santa Maria compares favorably in regards to that
   experience.”
                                 V-13

One of the most significant affordable housing projects in Santa Maria is the
award-winning Ted Zenich Gardens project, developed by the Santa
Barbara County Housing Authority. John Polanskey, from the Housing
Authority reported certain timelines inherent in the approval of his project,
but he has made it clear that the City’s process did not hinder its progress.
In Mr. Polanskey’s words: “…although the City’s permit process compares
favorably to other Santa Barbara County jurisdictions, you will recall that we
needed numerous PC Workshops, PC Public Hearings and even City
Council meetings to overcome some opponents’ objections to the
development of affordable housing. We eventually were able to overcome
our opponents’ appeal of the PC approval by the narrowest of margins. Now
that our development is complete, occupied, operating and has received
National awards, the public officials who voted against approval, and most
of our opponents, have publically expressed regret for their opposition.”
The City’s project approval process was complimented by the developer of
another significant affordable housing project, Los Adobes de Maria. Ken
Triguerio of Peoples’ Self Help Housing “…found the process to move
relatively quickly, and absent of any administratively burdensome and costly
bottlenecks in the process. We appreciated the pre-meetings offered by
planning and related staff which gave an early accurate read of most
important project issues up front, along with good guidance to us as
applicants, so that we could better predict how to respond in terms for our
submittals.” Mr. Triguerio further stated: “…we have developed over 2300
affordable housing units in 25 jurisdictions within the Central Coast region
and find the City of Santa Maria among the most favorable compared to
other cities in terms of a cost effective and predictable process.”
Project specific conditions may be applied to multi-family housing projects
approved through a discretionary process by the City. These conditions and
standards do not impose tangible impediments to the development of the
specific multi-family housing projects, and are applied to certain individual
projects, based on the unique site characteristics of these projects.
Examples of these conditions, presented in the table below, were applied
to ensure “livability” for the future residents of those projects.

obtained until the land-use permitting process is completed. Planning permit
processing adds time and costs to the project. The average processing time
from submittal of a complete application to Planning Commission action on
a project ranges from six to ten weeks. This includes the issuance of
conditional use permits and planned development permits.
A typical tentative subdivision map can be processed within six months of
the original submittal. Incomplete or inadequate responses to City
comments may extend the subdivision process with additional meetings.
In accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), the
City conducts environmental review. If a project is not exempted, the City
prepares an initial study and determines if a negative declaration, (ND)
mitigated negative declaration (MND) or environmental impact report (EIR)
is required.
The review and comment of other relevant departments is solicited promptly
by the Community Development Department, which functions as a central
clearinghouse for any development application, thereby shortening the
overall processing time for projects.

 Note: Timeframes indicated above are based on the date an application is deemed complete.
                A building permit application may be filed for plan check review prior to
                completion of the planning review, which also shortens processing time.
                The City employs plans examiners, and the work load and the
                completeness of the plans submitted determine the time needed for plan
                check. For a single-family residence, the first plan check is completed within
                ten working days of submittal. For larger projects, the first plan check may
                take two to four weeks. During periods of heavy plan check application
                volume, the City may contract with outside plan checking consultants for
                services to speed plan check review response time.
                                                 V - 20

              The City has established an available “fast track” building permit process,
              which if selected can reduce the time involved. The Community
              Development Department coordinates the review and decision-making on
              required permits as well as providing information regarding the status of all
              applications and permits for residential developments.
              The City policy is to process permits as quickly as possible. Pre-application
              meetings and procedural handouts help assure that applications will be
              complete, thereby reducing processing time. The City continues to accept
              and process building permit applications prior to completion of Planning
              Commission approval of a project, but at the risk of the developer if the
              required plan revisions causing additional time to be spent on the project.
              The Community Development Department coordinates the review and
              decision making on required permits as well as providing information
              regarding the status of all applications and permits for residential
              developments.
D.     CODES AND            ENFORCEMENT          AND    ON/OFF-SITE       IMPROVEMENT
       STANDARDS
Government Code Section 65583(a) requires “An analysis of potential and actual
governmental constraints upon the maintenance, improvement, or development of
housing for all income levels, including land-use controls, building codes and their
enforcement, site improvements, fees and other exactions required of developers, and
local processing and permit procedures.” (emphasis added)
According to the BUILDING BLOCKS publication, the Housing Element must describe
the building code adoption and enforcement process, including identification of any local
amendments to the Uniform Building Code (UBC) and how building code enforcement is
carried out by the jurisdiction. The Housing Element must also describe and analyze the
impact of on- and off-site improvement standards including street widths, curb, gutter, and
sidewalk requirements, landscaping, circulation improvement requirements and any
generally applicable level of service standards or mitigation thresholds.
The City of Santa Maria has addressed this constraint, in the manner presented below.
       1.     Building Codes and Their Enforcement: The code compliance function
              operates in the City Attorney department. Enforcement investigations are
              being made in largely in response to written complaints received, unless a
              health and safety concern is identified or a neighborhood is targeted for
              blight remediation. For the years 2011-2013 reported violations include 347
              conversion of dwelling units or garages, 283 substandard housing
              conditions, 62 living in recreational vehicles, and 144 boardinghouse or
              overcrowding complaints.
                                           V - 21

2. Site Improvements:
   a.     On-Site Improvements: Typical on-site project improvements include
          water lines, sanitary sewer lines, other utilities, streets, curbs,
          gutters, sidewalks, storm water retardation and drainage
          infrastructure, and perimeter fencing. Public utility lines are
          engineered to meet the needs of the project. Unless a project is
          planned to support adjacent vacant land, designs of public utilities do
          not include excess capacities. Drainage and retardation standards,
          designed to hold historic flows plus flows from new development, are
          designed to reduce flooding impacts on other residents of the City.
   b.     Off-Site Improvements: Until recently road width requirements were
          sometimes a barrier to affordability and private roads were the only
          solution. Unfortunately, private roads require homeowners’
          associations for upkeep and thus include a hidden cost passed
          through to the homeowner. Depending on the scale of the project,
          off-site improvements (or in-lieu fees) may be required. In all cases,
          the improvements required (or the proportionate share of fees
          charged), have been determined through a nexus study. Typically,
          major improvements concern park acquisition and development,
          regional groundwater recharge facilities, or traffic and circulation
          impacts, where the project causes a degradation of existing
          operating conditions elsewhere (i.e. not on the project site) in the
          system. An example might be the payment of fees for installation of
          a traffic signal at a nearby street intersection. During project and
          environmental review, the City evaluates the project related and
          cumulative impacts to determine the level of improvement(s)
          necessary to keep the system at acceptable levels of service.
          Due to decreasing fees and subventions from the County and State,
          City revenues decreased substantially over recent years. The City
          may need to seek ways to reduce long term service and maintenance
          costs resulting from new development. Such methods may include,
          but are not limited to: requiring assessment districts and/or
          improvement districts; and imposing development fees on remodels
          that result in an increase in habitable space.
   c.     Stormwater and Development: Under the direction of the Central
          Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board, the City of Santa Maria
          is required to implement Post-Construction Stormwater Management
          Requirements for Development Projects in the Central Coast Region
          1 for all new and redevelopment projects in the City. These
          regulations require that most projects must include design measures
          to retain and infiltrate the storm water collected on the project site.
          Storm water control measures must meet the Central Coast Regional
          Water Quality Control Board requirements prior to approval of the
          project by the City.
                                  V - 22

                       The City has created many methods to inform property owners and
                       developers of these requirements, including flyers, informational
                       brochures, and an entire webpage on the topic with links to
                       resources. The City advises applicants that the stormwater
                       improvements and calculations are to be addressed with the first
                       stages of the project design and be included with the initial
                       (discretionary or ministerial) project application so that late and costly
                       project revisions can be avoided.
E.      CONSTRAINTS-HOUSING FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES
Government Code Section 65583(a)(5) requires: “an analysis of potential and actual
government constraints upon the maintenance, improvement or development of housing
for persons with disabilities as identified in the analysis pursuant to paragraph (7),
including land use controls, building codes and their enforcement, site improvements,
fees and other exactions required of developers, and local processing and permit
procedures. The analysis shall also demonstrate local efforts to remove governmental
constraints that hinder the locality from meeting the need for housing for persons with
disabilities”. (emphasis added)
According to the BUILDING BLOCKS publication, the Housing Element must identify
governmental constraints to the development, improvement and maintenance of housing
for persons with disabilities including identifying local efforts to remove any such
constraints and identifying procedures for reasonable accommodations for persons with
disabilities in zoning. The City of Santa Maria has addressed this constraint, in the manner
presented below.
Persons with disabilities may be more likely to have lower incomes since their disability
may affect their ability to work. Thus, persons with physical disabilities require affordable
housing as well as housing with special design features and other accommodations, such
as wheelchair ramps or grab bars, etc. The Americans with Disabilities Act requires that
multi-family developments provide adaptable ground floor units on accessible routes.
Traditional standards of the zoning ordinance also place constraints on housing for people
with disabilities. This constraint has been partially addressed during the planning period
through implementation of the mixed use ordinance in a project proposed by a local
nonprofit housing agency. The proposed project involves the rehabilitation of three
properties already owned by TMHA, two single-family homes and one five-unit apartment
building. In order to make the properties habitable and energy efficient, basic
improvements, such as roofing, window replacement, heating system installation, and
major sewer and plumbing repair, are needed. TMHA manages these properties as part
of the Santa Maria Supportive Housing Program. The supportive housing program
addresses two of the most pervasive problems in mental health services: the
overwhelming need for comprehensive care and support, and the almost insurmountable
                                             V - 23

difficulties that clients encounter when trying to house themselves. The proposed project
will provide permanent housing for eleven clients as well as on-site supportive services.
The City has allocated CDBG funds to this project.
According to the 2000 census, 8.9% of the City’s residents aged 5-20, 21.7% of those
aged 21-64 and 44.9% of those above age 65 report some type of disability. As the City’s
disabled population needs change, there may be more requests for modifications to
housing or requests for reasonable accommodations. In order to address these needs,
City staff conducted a review of its policies and procedures to identify and address any
existing or potential constraints to the development or modification of housing for persons
with disabilities in accordance with Senate Bill 520.
Under Senate Bill 520, which became effective January 1, 2002, every jurisdiction during
its Housing Element update is required to analyze potential and actual constraints upon
the development, maintenance and improvement of housing for persons with disabilities
and to demonstrate local efforts to remove governmental constraints that hinder the
locality from meeting the need for housing for persons with disabilities (California
Government Code Section 65583(a)(5)).
In accordance with Senate Bill 520, City staff conducted a review of zoning and land use,
development procedures, policies, and practices, and building codes in order to identify
any potential constraints to the provision of housing accessible to persons with
disabilities. The results of this analysis are summarized below in the three general
categories of potential constraints: zoning and land use, permits and processing
procedures, and building codes.
         1.     Zoning and Land Use: The Zoning Ordinance explicitly identifies
                residential care facilities for six or fewer as a permitted use.
                The City’s Zoning Ordinance does allow reduced off-street parking space
                requirements for seniors. The Ordinance also contains a provision allowing
                unspecified uses to receive a parking requirement reduction as determined
                by the Zoning Administrator. This section could be used to provide a
                reduced parking standard for housing for persons with disabilities. These
                provisions may help reduce the costs for affordable housing developments
                for these groups. A program has been added to the City’s Housing Program
                in order to address this issue.
         2.     Permits and Processing Procedures: There are no discretionary permit
                requirements for residential care facilities serving six or fewer persons.
                Furthermore, there are no special designs or permitting standards that have
                been established for residential care facilities. The City has no occupancy
                standards pertaining to unrelated adults.
                                                V - 24

              Requests to retrofit homes for disabled accessibility or for reasonable
              accommodation are handled as any other building permit or variance
              application. Therefore, the City has sought to reduce or eliminate
              constraints to housing for disabled persons in regards to its permitting
              procedures.
       3.     Building Codes: As noted above, the City has adopted the Uniform
              Building Code and the most recent California Amendments to it. This Code
              contains Chapter 11, which incorporates provisions of the Americans with
              Disabilities Act. One provision is that a number of the residential units in
              new multi-family construction of three or more apartments, or four or more
              condominiums, must be accessible or adaptable. The City has added no
              amendments to the Building Code that would place constraints on
              accommodation of persons with disabilities.
              Based on a review of City development procedures and policies, the
              following constraints were identified: parking requirements, restrictions on
              second units and a lack of clear procedures for reasonable accommodation
              requests.
       4.     Summary: In order to address these issues, the City has included Program
              10 in Chapter VI. Implementation of this program by the City is expected to
              successfully address and remove existing and potential constraints to
              housing for persons with disabilities. Program 10 includes:
                 Allowing reduced parking standards for senior and/or housing for
                  persons with disabilities;
                 Facilitating permitted remodels of single-family residences and permited
                  garage conversions;
                 Regularly reviewing City policies and procedures to ensure that there
                  are no constraints to housing for persons with disabilities; and
                 Responding to requests for reasonable accommodation through the
                  procedures adopted in December, 2007.
F.     NON-GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
Government Code Section 65583(a)(6) requires “An analysis of potential and actual
nongovernmental constraints upon the maintenance, improvement, or development of
housing for all income levels, including the availability of financing, the price of land, and
the cost of construction.” (emphasis added)
                                             V - 25

According to the BUILDING BLOCKS publication, non-governmental constraints are
primarily market-driven and generally outside direct local government control.
Nevertheless, the Housing Element must analyze the impacts of the cost of land,
construction costs, and the availability of financing.
       1.     Availability of Financing: Interest rate fluctuations have the greatest effect
              on the ability of buyers to afford housing and the ability of builders to
              construct new housing. Because both buyers and builders must finance the
              purchase/project, housing production is extremely interest-rate sensitive.
              Another major constraint on housing development, which local government
              cannot control, are banking industry regulations and institutional reluctance
              to fund mixed-use or large phases of residential developments. Effectively,
              this restricts housing supplies and keeps the housing market prices high.
              The monetary value of land is what someone else will pay for title and use
              of that property. The “highest and best use” of the land may or may not
              reflect the designated land use allowed on the land.
              a.      Construction Financing: Currently, local banks provide construction
                      loans in the range of the “Prime Rate” plus 2.5 – 4%. The prime rate
                      is the interest rate that larger banking institutions charge to their best
                      customers. During the years of the 2010 Housing Element, the prime
                      rate has remained at 3.25%.
              b.      Homeowner Financing: Currently, short-term, adjustable-rate,
                      mortgages (ARMs) are available in the 4% to 5% range. It should be
                      noted that fixed rate mortgages are the loan of choice. However,
                      when high interest rates or high home prices make monthly housing
                      costs unaffordable, the lower, variable rate mortgages become more
                      attractive for short term financing if the buyer intends to sell in three
                      to five years.
       2.     Price of Land:
              Land has more value when it has potential for higher intensity uses. Land
              is a commodity in the City and the value depends on land use (density,
              intensity), zoning (building height, setbacks, parking, landscaping),
              subdivision (number of lots, right-of-way, easements, utilities) and fees (or
              costs associated with obtaining/providing the development permits) for
              other urban services.
       3.     Cost of Construction:
              The market sets the price of construction materials such as wood, concrete,
              and steel. Construction costs marginally affect the affordability of housing
              unless a shift in construction practice reduces costs considerably.
                                              V - 26

      4.    Other Non-Governmental Constraints:
            Land Use: When more can be produced from the land, land becomes more
            valuable. The concept of “highest and best use” applies to the greatest
            production from the land. Whether it is used for scenic preservation, cattle
            grazing, irrigated agriculture, apartments, or a strawberry packing plant, all
            land has some value. Land value increases because the use of the land
            increases. Dramatic land values result from increased levels of service
            provided by cities. Along with the changes to the City, the areas around the
            City changed too. The bedroom community of Orcutt developed and
            prospers by sitting between the City shopping centers and Vandenberg Air
            Force Base employment center. Areas being considered for annexation to
            the City are under intense pressure to develop at the “highest and best use”
            in the City.
            Economic Development: Santa Maria developed along the lines of
            traditional urban theory. Agriculture remains the economic base. As
            production agriculture developed and grew throughout the Santa Maria
            Valley, secondary (service) economies developed. Cities also grew to
            provide urban opportunities, communication, and services. Location
            advantages, public policy, and land use factors helped make Santa Maria
            the commercial-retail hub for northern Santa Barbara County and southern
            San Luis Obispo County. As such, Santa Maria experiences greater
            residential growth than most of the surrounding communities.

               CHAPTER VI—HOUSING PROGRAMS
Following are the Programs adopted for the Housing Element to address affordable
housing needs within the Santa Maria community.
A.     IDENTIFICATION OF ADEQUATE SITES
       1.    Program 1 - Economic Development Program: Agriculture is a basic
             industry in the North County. However, a majority of the housing and social
             service burdens are borne by the City of Santa Maria without benefit of the
             tax base to support the excess services required by the increased
             population. By expanding the non-agricultural employment sectors–
             especially in the job sectors with high employment multipliers–the City can
             increase the balance between jobs and housing in the City. Improving
             housing conditions often depends on having strong economic growth and
             better paying jobs available to local workers. Employment generated by
             commercial and industrial enterprises increases the ability of workers to
             afford better housing (meeting building codes, uncrowded, low housing cost
             burden) without governmental intervention. Santa Maria strongly supports
             the efforts of the Santa Maria Valley Economic Development Commission
             with staff and monetary assistance. The City has adopted an Economic
             Development Element. The Economic Development Element reiterates the
             needs for jobs-housing balance and economic diversity to expand the job-
             housing opportunities available to the City residents.
       2.    Program 2 - Annexation Program: The City actively encourages
             residential development through annexation of land suitable for
             development. Residential development, constrained as a municipality
             approaches build-out within its jurisdictional boundaries, requires more land
             or more intense use of existing land. The type and tenure of housing choice
             for low and very low-income households become limited as residential
             development slows. Additionally, as build-out approaches, the economics
             of supply and demand come into operation. As housing supply diminishes
             but demand remains strong, housing costs inevitably rise. This situation
             further constrains housing choice for low-income households.
       3.    Program 3 - Mixed Use Development/Adaptive Re-Use: Via the recently
             adopted mixed-use ordinance, the City encourages the use of suitable
             under-utilized and/or abandoned commercial motels to be converted to
             residential use and allows for mixed-use purposes via zoning incentives
             and/or state funded housing programs. The City allows housing above
             ground floor commercial uses in certain land use designations. Expanding
                                           VI-1

       the densities and housing mixtures within the four square mile (4SM) central
       core area provides greater flexibility in mixing uses that more rigid Euclidean
       zoning standards typically segregate.
       The Mixed Use Ordinance increases the flexibility of the zoning district to
       support compatible uses from other zoning districts. The ordinance grants
       the Zoning Administrator, Planning Commission, and City Council
       increasing levels of power to allow reduced standards for parking, setbacks,
       landscaping, open space, or increased height. The ordinance is a design
       based regulation, which understands that the inside of the structure will
       change over time and allows the adaptation to occur without government
       controls. Spaces may be mixed and re-mixed to meet the needs of the
       building markets. The mixed use ordinance is in Title 12 of Chapter 49 of
       the Municipal Code.
   4.  Program 4 - Density Bonuses: The City provides housing incentives, in
       the form of greater density than would otherwise be allowed under the
       current zoning designation, for developers willing to construct affordable
       housing units. State Law does not require the City to promote the use of
       Density Bonus provisions. It has been properly adopted and is part of the
       zoning code (effective January 18, 2007) for housing developers to use as
       a tool. Density bonus provisions may be applied to overcome specific
       design issues that require relief from the code standards.
B. DEVELOPMENT OF LOW- AND MODERATE-INCOME HOUSING
   1.  Program 5 - Homebuyer Assistance Program: The Housing Trust Fund
       of Santa Barbara County operates the First-Time Homebuyer Down
       Payment Program that provides pre-purchase counseling, deferred
       payment down payment loans and closing cost grants to assist low-income
       families within the City of Santa Maria in purchasing an entry-level home.
       The loans are structured as 30-year deferred payment soft second loans
       averaging $37,300 per homebuyer (with a maximum loan of $42,000).
       Funding for the loans is provided from a State HCD grant to the Housing
       Trust Fund. The homebuyers can also receive a grant from the City of Santa
       Maria using CDBG funds to help cover home purchase closing costs. The
       combined homebuyer financial assistance helps expand homeownership
       opportunities for working families. Participants under this program must
       have a combined household income that falls within the federal and state
       definition of low income, or up to the maximum of 80% of the area median
       income, adjusted for household size. In addition, homebuyers seeking
       assistance under this program must meet the following criteria: 1) Applicant
       must live or work in Santa Maria; 2) Applicant must qualify as a first-time
       homebuyer under the State definition; 3) Homebuyer must occupy their
       home as a principal residence; 4) The size of the eligible home must be
       sufficient for the household so that there is no overcrowding; and 5)
                                     VI-2
   Borrower must complete a homebuyer education program, secure pre-
   approval of a first mortgage loan from a participating lender, have their
   income certified and have satisfactory credit and job/income stability.
2. Program 6 - Housing Incentives Program: This program offers a variety
   of incentives to reduce overall costs and is designed to meet the housing
   needs of low-income households. The program can be tailored to develop
   new sites or redevelop deteriorated properties. It is applicable to various
   types of projects: single family detached, condominiums, cooperatives, and
   non-profit rental developments. The key incentives to date have been land
   acquisition, public improvements, on-site improvements and housing
   construction. The program is funded primarily with Community
   Development Block Grant (CDBG) and HOME Investment Partnerships
   (HOME) program funds. Partnerships with non-profit developers with the
   expertise to access state, federal and private funds have proved successful.
   These developers can provide assurances regarding affordability for long-
   term ownership and rental assistance. The Housing Incentives Program
   could also be used in concert with additional cost reductions and incentives
   already offered through the density bonus, mixed use and four-square-mile
   ordinances, including:
       Reducing Site Development Standards
       Reducing Infill Development Fees
       Increasing Site Design Flexibility for Affordable Housing
       Increasing Land Use Flexibility
       Establishing Four Square Mile (4SM) Area Standards
3. Program 7 - Expansion of Code Compliance Program: During the
   previous planning period, the Code Compliance Division worked closely
   with the Community Development Department in development of the
   Efficiency Unit Project Ordinance. This ordinance will address many
   substandard housing issues that the Code Compliance officers observe in
   the field, and will facilitate safe and healthy housing opportunities for all
   income levels.
   The Code Compliance staff consists of four full-time officers and a part-time
   Code Compliance Coordinator. A major focus of these officers’ efforts is to
   address reports of substandard living space that has been constructed
   without permits. Officers work with owners to reconstruct the substandard
   living space so that it is safe and decent to live in. The result of these efforts
   is to greatly increase the supply of housing affordable to persons with low
   incomes. In addition, it provides families with lower incomes the opportunity
   to live in a single-family residential setting. An example is the legal
   conversion of an existing garage into a safe and habitable living space. The
   converted space may not be used as a separate stand-alone unit since no
                                   VI-3

        more than one kitchen facility is permited in a single family dwelling. In any
        event, the City does not endorse illegal garage conversions as a method to
        create additional dwelling units.
        The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) establishes regulations regarding
        nonimmigrant agricultural workers (H-2A workers). Under these regulations
        agricultural employers are required to provide housing meeting applicable
        Federal standards and which meet the local standards for rental and/or
        public accommodations. Where the City regulations are stricter than the
        Federal Government's, City regulations prevail. An application for H-2A
        housing may be submitted in the R-3 district, requesting approval of a
        boarding house use. In the C-2 districts, H-2A workers may occupy a motel
        room (in an approved and legitimate motel facility) for a maximum of 30
        days; City transient occupancy provisions apply.
   4.   Program 8 - Prioritization of Services: As required by Government Code
        Section 65589.7, the City has adopted a written policy providing for priority
        of water and sewer services to affordable housing developments.
C. MITIGATION OF GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
   1.   Program 9 - Permit Processing: The City processes permits as quickly
        and efficiently as possible. The Community Development Department
        coordinates the review and decision-making on required permits and also
        provides information regarding the status of all applications and permits for
        residential developments. The permit processing of the City attempts to
        gather, organize, and distribute the information needed by
        applicant/developers, staff, Planning Commission, and City Council. City
        staff coordinates meetings between applicants, staff and professionals to
        keep project processing running smoothly. Staff offers courtesy inspections
        and phased approvals to low-income housing projects to shorten the time
        between initial application and occupancy.
   2.   Program 9(a) – Conditional Use Permit Process Monitoring: Although
        there is no evidence that City of Santa Maria’s CUP requirement for multi-
        family projects acts as a constraint on housing, the City has added the
        following Program, as requested by the California Department of Housing
        and Community Development (HCD):
        During the previous planning period, the City instituted a monitoring
        program of the conditional use permit process. Under this program the City
        is to prepare a report every two years, evaluating the impacts and potential
        constraints to multi-family development in the R-3 zone. The report will be
        referenced in the progress report required pursuant to Government Code
        Section 65400. The evaluation will consider approvals and denials, number
                                      VI-4

   of applications, length of approval process, and types of conditions imposed
   including cost and any reductions in the initially proposed number of units.
   The City will solicit and consider input from developers including non-profit
   organizations as part of the evaluation process. If the City determines that
   the process does pose a constraint to the development of housing including
   housing affordable to lower-income households, the City will evaluate the
   necessary steps to remove or mitigate the constraint such as replacing the
   CUP process or other similar action.
   The City will also continue to monitor the design review process. The City
   has developed a brochure listing the objective criteria for all types and
   densities of residential development, to provide certainty in design
   requirements during the approval process. The brochure titled City Policy
   and Standards - Residential Development is available at the Community
   Development Department’s counter, and on-line on the City web page.
3. Program 10 - Accommodations for Farmworkers, Seniors and Persons
   with Disabilities: The City will allow reduced parking standards for senior,
   farmworker and/or housing for persons with disabilities. This can be
   accomplished by applying Section 12-32.06 of the Santa Maria Municipal
   Code to develop an appropriate parking standard in individual cases.
   The City will facilitate permitted remodels of single-family residences and
   garage conversions. The City will allow expansion of residential space to
   the full extent allowable by standards of the zone or applicable specific plan.
   In January 2007, the City Council updated the density bonus ordinance. The
   ordinance gives development concessions to individual additional units
   legally constructed and reserved for seniors or persons with low incomes.
   City staff will regularly review City policies and procedures to ensure that
   there are no constraints to housing for persons with disabilities. As part of
   this review, the City will follow a regular program of sidewalk repair and
   maintenance including provision of handicap ramps to facilitate movement
   throughout the City for persons with disabilities regardless of where they
   live.
   On December 18, 2007, the City adopted specific reasonable
   accommodation procedures to provide exception in zoning and land use for
   persons with disabilities. The City has responded to several requests under
   this Ordinance since its adoption.
4. Program 11 - Facilitation of Projects for Homeless Individuals: State
   law defines emergency shelters as housing with minimal supportive
   services for homeless persons that is limited to occupancy of six months or
   less by a homeless person. No individual or household may be denied
   emergency shelter because of an inability to pay. Government Code
   Sections 65583(a)(4) and 65583(a)(5) specify requirements for emergency
   shelters and transitional and supportive housing.
                                  VI-5

       On May 7, 2012, the City adopted the Emergency Shelter Ordinance,
       establishing Santa Maria Municipal Code Chapter 12-53, Emergency
       Shelters, to support organizations that meet the housing and supportive
       service needs of the homeless and those at risk of homelessness.
       The Emergency Shelter code establishes an emergency shelter project as
       a permitted use in the CPO (Commercial Office and Professional Office)
       and PF (Public Facilities) zoning districts. The code also allows Emergency
       Shelter Projects within the C-1 (Central Business) and C-2 (General
       Commercial) zones of the City subject to the approval of a Conditional Use
       Permit. Chapter 12-53 includes definitions, development standards, and
       procedures relating to the approval of emergency shelter projects.
       Additionally on May 7, 2012, definitions for Supportive Housing and
       Transitional Housing were added to Title 12 of the Municipal Code,
       establishing these housing types as a residential use, subject only to those
       restrictions that apply to other residential dwellings of the same type in the
       same zone.
D. CONSERVE AND IMPROVE EXISTING AFFORDABLE HOUSING STOCK
   1.  Program 12 - Neighborhood Conservation Program: This program,
       which was developed in 1990, assists the City's neediest neighborhoods
       through the use of existing improvement programs. Low-income
       neighborhoods; with a high incidence of criminal activity, serious public
       improvement deficiencies, significant code violations, and generally
       deteriorating conditions, receive the efforts of this program. As citizens see
       the positive results of the program, more people will take a more active role
       in preserving their neighborhoods and become involved in activities that
       prevent neighborhood blight and foster community pride. The program is
       funded primarily with CDBG funds.
       Program 12.B – Minor Home Repair Program: This program, which
       began in 2013, is operated by Community Action Partnership of SLO
       County, Inc. (CAPSLO, Inc.) as a sub-recipient to the City of Santa Maria.
       The program targets elderly, disabled and/or low and very low-income
       households in Santa Maria with the construction and installation of
       handicapped access improvements (ramps, wheelchair lifts, door
       widening), removal of architectural barriers, health and safety repairs, such
       as plumbing, electrical, exterior and interior carpentry (porches, decking,
       stairs, flooring) and building code violations. The program is funded
       primarily with CDBG funds.
                                      VI-6

2. Program 13 - Code Compliance Program: Enforcing housing and building
   codes directly links to ensuring the safe and habitable condition of the
   housing stock, and thus the continued viability of neighborhoods. Code
   violations involving immediate health or safety hazards are handled without
   the need for a complaint. Alleged violations involving public welfare issues
   are pursued only after a complaint is received. Complaints will normally
   come directly from citizens, from officials on behalf of citizens, or from staff
   as a consequence of observations in the normal course of duties (e.g.,
   inspections and permitting). When a violation is found, steps are taken to
   correct the problems. Code Compliance Division works with the property
   owners to assure each person living in the residence are afforded proper
   housing while the substandard conditions are being rectified.
   During the previous planning period, the Code Compliance Division started
   a door-to-door program to inform and educate property owners and citizens
   about the provisions of the Municipal Code, and how application of Code
   standards can help citizens improve their residential neighborhoods.
   Information on other available assistance programs, such as the Legal Aid
   Foundation of Santa Barbara County and California Rural Legal Assistance,
   Inc. is also provided by the officers.
3. Program 14 - Efficiency Unit Projects: On April 17, 2012, the City adopted
   the Efficiency Unit Projects Ordinance, adding Chapter 12- 52 to the Santa
   Maria Municipal Code. The Ordinance will facilitate both the new
   construction of efficiency dwelling unit projects and the structural
   conversion of transient occupancy uses into single-room occupancy
   projects. Efficiency Unit projects may be established within the Central
   Business District zone (C-1) and the General Commercial District zone (C-
   2) through the issuance of a planned development (PD) permit. Each
   Efficiency Unit Project must provide a minimum 5 units, but there is no set
   minimum or maximum density per acre.
   Chapter 12- 52 includes standards for minimum and maximum unit size,
   private storage areas, common interior and exterior areas, and requires that
   efficiency unit projects be consistently maintained in accordance with
   applicable standards, all with the goal of providing an overall superior living
   environment for the residents of the project.
   The ordinance incorporates multiple provisions to incentivize the
   development of Efficiency Unit Projects, including the ability to re-use
   existing hotel sites that may currently be marginally viable, reduced parking
   requirements compared to other types of residential uses, and enabling
   dwelling units at no set maximum density, in two commercial districts that
   otherwise prohibit residential uses.
                                  VI-7
E. PRESERVE AT-RISK ASSISTED PROJECTS
   1.  Program 15 - Project-Based Tenant Assistance Programs: Section 236
       construction included the Union Plaza, owned and managed by the
       Teamsters Union, which is a seven-story structure with 122 one-bedroom
       apartments designed to accommodate low-income elderly persons. This
       project remains the only assisted housing project at risk.
       The Housing Authority of Santa Barbara County acquired the Central Plaza
       project, and will maintain the affordability of these units also done under the
       Section 236 Program. The Housing Authority which consists of 112 garden
       style apartments for low-income families. The project includes a park with
       play areas. According to the Santa Barbara County Housing Authority, the
       Section 236 Program has specific targets for the housing needs of
       Extremely Low Income Households.
   2.  Program 16 – Section 8 Tenant-Based Housing Assistance Payments
       Program: Through the Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments Program,
       the Housing Authority provides rental subsidy payments directly to private
       property owners on behalf of eligible low-income tenants who cannot afford
       market rates without a subsidy. Families with certificates must rent
       approved units at fair market rents, and the subsidy represents the
       difference between 30% of the monthly income and the approved rent for
       an adequate housing unit. The program also includes a voucher option,
       which permits families to rent units beyond the fair market rents; the family
       must pay any rent difference. This program, funded through HUD, seeks to
       encourage low-income persons to find housing units throughout the
       community rather than impacting any one particular area. The Housing
       Authority continues to apply for new funds to increase Section 8 assistance.
       During the previous planning period, the Housing Authority received
       approval for tax credit financing and completed construction of the Rancho
       Hermosa project. This project provides 47 permanently affordable rental
       units that include two resident managers, 11 previously homeless families,
       11 special needs households, 11 workforce families, and 12 households
       with a member that has a mental disability. The Housing Authority
       continually seeks input from residents and encourages their involvement in
       management activities. More project-based Section 8 housing units are
       needed, and the Housing Authority will continue to apply to the Department
       of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for funds to provide these
       additional units. According to the Santa Barbara County Housing Authority,
       the Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments Program has specific targets
       for the housing needs of Extremely Low Income Households.
       Program 16.B – City of Santa Maria Tenant Based Rental Assistance
       (TBRA) Program: The Tenant Based Rental Assistance (TBRA) Program
       provides security deposit assistance through a Qualified Referring Agency
       (QRA) to qualified low-income households. The assistance is provided in
                                      VI-8

   the form of a grant for up to 50% of the required security deposit to low
   income families to assist with overcoming obstacles to obtaining housing.
   In order to access the program, participants must apply for assistance
   through a QRA. The following local non-profit agencies have been approved
   as QRA’s:
      Housing Authority of the County of Santa Barbara
      Peoples’ Self Help Housing Corporation, and
      Good Samaritan Shelter, Inc.
   Eligible participants are individuals whose income is at 60% or below the
   area median income by household size as determined by HUD. The
   program is funded with HOME and CDBG funds.
3. Program 17 - Supportive Housing for Homeless Persons: There are
   several transitional supportive housing programs provided in Santa Maria.
   Domestic Violence Solutions for Santa Barbara County (DVS) owns and
   manages Mariposa House which provides eight apartments for transitional
   housing. This housing is available to DVS clients who transition out of the
   DVS emergency shelter. The transitional housing program provides a
   longer-term safe and supportive environment for battered women and their
   children for up to 24 months. The program helps them develop household
   management and parenting skills, increase their job skills and earning
   power, find stable employment, save for housing deposits, and gain
   independent living skills with the ultimate goal of securing permanent
   housing.
   Good Samaritan Shelter, Inc. (GSSI) owns and manages several
   transitional housing facilities in Santa Maria. GSSI’s Transitional Center for
   Women & Children is a transitional housing program for perinatal women
   and their children who are enrolled in a substance abuse day treatment
   program. Clients can live in the facility and participate in the program for up
   to 18 months. The original facility consisted of an older single-family home
   converted to a group home housing eight clients. In 2006 six Single Room
   Occupancy (SRO) units, office and counseling space for on-site supportive
   services was added to the existing facility. Services offered include food,
   shelter, clothing, medical and dental screening, drug and alcohol
   detoxification and treatment, job training, job search assistance, part-time
   employment, mental health counseling and assistance, social services, after-
   school tutoring, parenting and budget training, perinatal care and direct
   assistance to children. This project serves homeless, extremely low income
   women who are in drug and/or alcohol recovery treatment and their
   children. The expansion of the facility was allowed through the City’s Mixed
   Use Ordinance.
                                   VI-9

       GSSI also operates the Family Transitional Shelter located on its main
       campus property. This is a 56-bed facility that has individual rooms and
       provides transitional housing for homeless families for up to 24 months.
       Meals and on-site supportive services are provided. A case manager helps
       families develop a goal-oriented program that allows them to attain skills in
       money management, parenting and budgeting so that they can become
       self-sufficient and secure permanent housing. Education is stressed and
       many of the clients return to school to get their high school diploma and/or
       enroll in the local community college.
       There is no exclusively male transitional housing at this time. The Non-Profit
       Facilities Program is available to these agencies for capital development
       activities. There is a need for transitional housing that would house men as
       well as women and children, and this program could aid in the funding of
       such a project.
       CDBG funds are allocated annually to public service agencies providing
       emergency shelter and support services to the homeless. Such services
       consist of counseling, case management, health care, and transportation.
       The Non-Profit Facilities Program is available to these agencies for capital
       development activities.
       The City expects that the Emergency Shelter Program will specifically assist
       in the development of housing affordable to Extremely Low Income
       Households.
F. EQUAL HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES
   1.  Program 18 - Fair Housing Program: The City supports the local Fair
       Housing Council with a financial and philosophical commitment. The
       housing programs sponsored by the City promote housing opportunities for
       all persons within the community. The Legal Aid Foundation of Santa
       Barbara County, under contract with the City, conducts fair housing
       activities. These include the preparation of a fair housing assessment,
       educational presentations before community groups, testing of fair housing
       practices for rental housing, development of educational materials,
       operation of a special telephone call line, and direct legal representation of
       eligible clients in cases involving housing discrimination in the Santa Maria
       community. The City complies with the Federal Fair Housing requirements
       related to program resources, which are available in English and Spanish.
       The Special Projects Division administers the production and distribution of
       Fair Housing information throughout the City. Locations of the program
       distribution are maintained on the City web page. This program is targeted
       to all income levels but recent experience has shown that Extremely Low
       Income households particularly benefit from the City’s Fair Housing
       Program.
                                      VI-10

G.    ENERGY CONSERVATION OPPORTUNITIES
      1.    Program 19 - Energy Compliance and Conservation: Energy
            conservation plays a vital role in providing decent, affordable housing. The
            City will solicit information from local utility providers about conservation
            programs, rebates, and low-income assistance programs through those
            companies.
            The Building Division is tasked with enforcing the minimum standards found
            in the various model codes adopted by the State of California through the
            Building Standards Commission and as adopted and amended by our City
            Council. These code sections include:
               The 2013 California Energy Code (California Code of Regulations Title
                24, Part 6) which sets energy efficiency standards for buildings and
                appliances; and
               The 2013 California Green Building Standards Code (California Code of
                Regulations Title 24, Part 11) which establishes requirements for energy
                conservation, water conservation, interior building environment air
                quality, recycling, waste management, low impact storm water drainage,
                dark sky provisions, high efficient vehicle and bicycle parking, etc.
            Community Action Commission of Santa Barbara County (CAC) provides
            weatherization and energy conservation home improvements, such as the
            installation of insulation, window caulking, and water-conserving fixtures, to
            low and very low income households, with preference given to seniors.
            Emergency grants are also available for the payment of utility bills. Santa
            Barbara County has emPower, a program to facilitate energy efficiency
            upgrades on single family homes. The program’s goal is to help
            homeowners and contractors overcome obstacles to implement home
            energy improvements, and to help meet statewide energy efficiency
            objectives. Single family homeowners will be able to take advantage of low
            cost unsecured loans and rebates to install energy efficient water heaters,
            furnaces, air conditioners, attic insulation, and to do repairs such as duct
            sealing or replacement.

              CHAPTER VII—QUANTIFIED OBJECTIVES
Quantified Objectives for housing construction, rehabilitation, and conservation of existing
affordable units are contained in this section along with a discussion of programs to be
implemented to help achieve the community goals with qualified objectives for the
maximum number of housing units (by income level) over the remaining time frame of the
element.
A.      OVERVIEW
The Housing Element uses three categories of quantified objectives. These are:
   Producing new housing units. Mostly, production comes from new construction. It may
    involve adaptive reuse of non-residential structures for housing opportunities.
   Rehabilitating existing housing units. To extend the useful life of older residential
    structures, rehabilitation keeps housing units in service to meet the residential needs of
    the community.
   Conserving affordable housing. Rather than creating new housing units or extending
    the life of existing housing units, conservation programs apply to the preservation of
    affordable units at risk of conversion to market rates.
Table VII-1 delineates those quantified objectives, by income level.
                                         TABLE VII-1

                                              VII-1

B.       GOALS, POLICIES AND IMPLEMENTATION
In order to meet these projected numbers for construction, rehabilitation and conservation
as noted above, the following respective goals and policies together with program
implementation commitments will be enacted.
Housing Programs that will enact the City's goals and policies during the remaining term
of this Housing Element follow. These goals and policies insure a total dwelling capacity
equal to the new construction need for all income levels, including rental and
manufactured housing, homeless shelters and transitional and farmworker housing.
Policy actions will include regulatory concessions and incentives as well as insuring
utilization of federal and state financing and/or subsidies.
         Goal 1: New Housing Construction
         Assure sufficient development potential to accommodate future residential
         growth and construction.
         Policy 1-A      Action steps to provide adequate sites.
         (1)    The City will continue to process permits as quickly and efficiently as
                possible. The Community Development Department coordinates the review
                and decision-making on required permits and also provides information
                regarding the status of all applications and permits for residential
                developments. The permit processing of the City will continue to gather,
                organize and distribute the information needed by applicant/developers, staff,
                Planning Commission and City Council in an expeditious fashion.
         (2)    Through the Density Bonus Ordinance (effective January 18, 2007), the City
                provides housing incentives, in the form of greater density than would
                otherwise be allowed under the current zoning designation, for developers
                willing to construct affordable housing units. Density bonus provisions may
                be applied to overcome specific design issues that require relief from the
                code standards.
         (3)    The City will continue its economic development efforts to increase wages
                and bring higher paying jobs to its residents.
         Policy 1-B      Action steps to encourage infill:
         (1)    The City's General Plan establishes goals for preserving agricultural land at
                the perimeter of the City and this boundary remains distinct. The City will
                examine ways to encourage the principles of Smart Growth through infill
                and high-density housing development in several focused areas including
                the Downtown Specific Plan area.
         (2)    The City continually analyzes the relationship between available public
                facilities and services and sites suitable for residential development to assure
                meeting the need for services. Leapfrog development is more costly if urban
                infrastructure (water, sewer, gas, electricity, roads, etc.) is not adjacent to the
                                                VII-2
      site. The City assures development sites for affordable housing receive
      priority scheduling for capital improvements. Building in areas where services
      already exist does not add significant costs to off-site improvements. CDBG
      funds will continue to be used to offset extraordinary costs where appropriate.
(3)   The City of Santa Maria and the County of Santa Barbara allocate HOME
      funds to the Housing Authority of the County of Santa Barbara or other
      qualified non-profit housing providers for construction of apartments that
      house low- and moderate-income families.
(4)   The Downtown Specific Plan was approved in 2008. Subsequent actions
      will be undertaken relating to establishing economic development in the
      downtown and transit oriented development standards.
(5)   In an effort to better coordinate land use and transportation within Santa
      Maria, the Circulation Element (amended in 2011) establishes the potential
      for high quality transit corridors along Broadway (State Route 135) and
      along Main Street (State Route 166) within the City. While the current transit
      frequency within the City does not meet the minimum criteria established by
      Section 21155.1 of the Public Resources Code, the Element recognizes the
      potential benefits of intensifying development along transit corridors. The
      Circulation Element information coordinates with the 2040 Regional
      Transportation Plan & Sustainable Communities Strategy, adopted August
      15, 2013, by the Santa Barbara County Association of Governments
      (SBCAG), which also depicts these “transit priority areas”.
Policy 1-C    Action steps to annex sufficient land for residential needs.
(1)   The City will continue to support the use of infill projects for residential
      development to meet its growing housing need and will actively encourage
      planned residential developments in infill locations. When appropriate, land
      for additional residential development may be obtained through annexation
      of suitable land. This program has been successfully implemented in the
      past, and the City will continue to monitor the need for future annexations, if
      appropriate.
(2)   Based on the UC Davis Farmworker Data and the Census 2000 data, Santa
      Maria houses 55% of the Santa Barbara County farmworker population. The
      resident baseline population is 10,600 farmworkers workers in the County
      and the maximum population peaks in June, adding 9,700 more workers
      (UC Davis, 1999-2000). The calculated demand generated by farmworkers
      in Santa Maria ranges between 3,100 and 4,600 dwelling units. Los Adobes
      de Maria I and II owned and operated by Peoples' Self Help Housing
      Corporation, Inc., provide 117 farmworker apartment units and are model
      projects to be replicated. The City will work cooperatively with County and
      State government entities as well as non-profit and agriculture community
      to address housing for all special needs populations.
                                       VII-3

Policy 1-D       Action steps to encourage mixed-use development:
(1)     The City's Mixed-Use Ordinance (effective 12/16/2004) increases the
        flexibility of the zoning district to support compatible uses from other zoning
        districts. The Ordinance grants the Zoning Administrator, Planning
        Commission, and City Council increasing levels of oversight to allow
        reduced standards for parking, setbacks, landscaping, open space and/or
        increased height. The Ordinance is a design-based regulation, which
        understands that the uses inside the structure will change over time and the
        code allows the adaptation to occur without government controls. Spaces
        may be mixed and re-mixed to meet the needs of the community. Mixed-
        Use projects that encourage provision of affordable housing are given
        priority, especially those within the Downtown Specific Plan area,
        accommodating special needs populations and housing the local workforce
        by employers.
Timeline:
The above action steps are ongoing activities of the City.
Responsibility:
Staff of the Community Development Department is responsible to successfully
implement the Mixed-Use Ordinance. The Ordinance (Municipal Code Chapter 12-
49) identifies the many ways to achieve flexibility in the required development
standards, and the concise range of reductions available for parking, setbacks,
landscaping, open space and/or increased height and/or incentives (financial
and/or regulatory). This information is made available to the public in the following
ways:
   Residential Development Standards handouts referring to the mixed-use
    development standards, available at the front counter and online
   Internet posting of mixed use definitions, policies, and procedures
   City identification of potential mixed use development areas.
Staff will regularly monitor and report on the progress and status of this action to
the Planning Commission and City Council by October 1 of each year via the filing
of the General Plan Annual Report (consistent with Government Code §64500)
and make appropriate revisions to achieve stated objectives over the planning
period.
New programs, like the Mixed-Use Ordinance, cause the reexamination of how
development standards are applied. The City has adopted a building conservation
code and will regularly review and adopt revisions to the Uniform Building Codes.
Goal 2: Housing Rehabilitation
Support decent, affordable housing programs that target low- and moderate-
income sectors of the community for rehabilitation projects.
                                         VII-4

Timeline:
The above action steps presented below are ongoing activities of the City.
Responsibility:
Community Development; Administrative Services/Special Projects
Policy 2-A    Action steps to improve sub-standard housing conditions:
(1)   The City continues to maintain an active code compliance program of
      complaint-based inspections in target neighborhoods. The intent of this
      program is to stop destabilizing elements in the area and work with other
      programs to encourage housing rehabilitation and neighborhood security.
      The City may augment the complaint-based inspection program with a
      building inspection clearance prior to resale of single-family, duplex, tri-plex,
      and four units of properties.
(2)   The City will coordinate its public improvements with neighborhood
      improvement programs. The City Council periodically reviews capital
      improvement requirements and will amend its scheduling for funding
      allocation to coordinate with private sector residential maintenance and
      improvement projects.
(3)   Each requested demolition uses the safety of the structure and the threat of
      imminent collapse as the standard for review. Housing units will be carefully
      reviewed to determine absolute need for demolition and if rehabilitation can
      avoid unnecessary reduction of housing. When demolition is required, efforts
      will be directed toward timely replacement of housing compatible with the
      existing neighborhood.
(4)   The City will continue to provide CDBG funds toward residential
      rehabilitation program for low income homeowners. The program targets
      elderly, disabled and/or low and very low-income households in Santa Maria
      with the construction and installation of handicapped access improvements
      (ramps, wheelchair lifts, door widening), removal of architectural barriers,
      health and safety repairs, such as plumbing, electrical, exterior and interior
      carpentry (porches, decking, stairs, flooring) and building code violations.
Policy 2-B    Action steps to assist special needs populations:
(1)   The City has staff dedicated to grant writing and administration. Funding
      sources are continually reviewed. State Bond funding is one of the potential
      sources for projects to be accessed. The adopted Consolidated Plan and
      subsequent Annual Action Plans outline the goals and objectives for the
      allocation of Federal HOME and CDBG entitlement programs. To avoid
      confusion, the Housing Element will refer the reader to the Federal reports
      for the most up to date status of federally funded housing programs and
      support services. The City will actively seek funding for projects to assure a
      balance of housing opportunities for its residents.
                                    VII-5
(2) The City is working with two local non-profit agencies that have been
    designated as Community Housing Development Organizations (CHDOs).
    (See detailed description of CHDOs in Policy 3A, below). One CHDO will
    undertake various housing related activities including transitional and
    supportive housing facilities, and new construction of affordable permanent
    rental units. The other will concentrate on rehabilitation of existing
    affordable units and new construction of affordable owner units. The City
    has provided funding to both agencies to proceed with these projects. In
    conjunction with Administrative Services/Special Projects Division, the City
    will encourage the development of housing for Extremely Low Income
    households.
(3) Mobile homes provide affordable housing options and are encouraged to
    expand through ordinance amendments enacted in the previous planning
    period.
(4) On May 7, 2012, the City adopted the Emergency Shelter Ordinance,
    establishing Santa Maria Municipal Code Chapter 12-53, Emergency
    Shelters, to support organizations that meet the housing and supportive
    service needs of the homeless and those at risk of homelessness.
    Additionally, definitions for Supportive Housing and Transitional Housing
    were added to Title 12 of the Municipal Code, establishing these housing
    types as a residential use, subject only to those restrictions that apply to
    other residential dwellings of the same type in the same zone. On April 17,
    2012, the City adopted the Efficiency Unit Projects Ordinance, a tool that
    will assist the City in providing clean, comfortable, and safe housing for
    persons of all income levels, through the facilitation of new construction of
    efficiency dwelling unit projects and the structural conversion of transient
    occupancy uses into single-room occupancy projects.
(5) The City will continue to offer a Housing Assistance Program for first-time
    homebuyers in partnership with the Housing Trust Fund of Santa Barbara
    County.
(6) The City encourages property owners to rent using the Section 8 Program
    to encourage rental property retain higher standards as monitored by the
    Housing Authority of Santa Barbara County. The City also works in
    partnership with the Housing Authority in pairing Section 8 Voucher holders
    who are below 60% area median income with the City’s Tenant Based
    Rental Assistance Program which provides 50% of the security deposit
    required to obtain housing for these families.
(7) The City will closely monitor the conversion of condominiums to minimize
    losses to the rental housing stock. Each conversion is to be handled on a
    case-by-case basis; appropriate conditions are placed on any project at the
    time of approval.
(8) The Tenant Based Rental Assistance (TBRA) program provides security
    deposit assistance through a Qualified Referring Agency (QRA) to qualified
    low-income households that provide grants for up to 50% of the required
                                   VII-6

      security deposit to low income families to assist with overcoming obstacles
      to obtaining housing. In order to access the program, participants must apply
      for assistance through a QRA. The following local non-profit agencies have
      been approved as QRA’s: Housing Authority of the County of Santa Barbara,
      Peoples’ Self Help Housing Corporation, and Good Samaritan Shelter, Inc.
      Eligible Participants are individuals whose income is at 60% or less of the
      area median income by household size as determined by HUD. HOME funds
      are being used to continue this program.
      Since 2010 the TBRA program has served 572 households, 88% of which
      were extremely low income (below 30% of the area’s median income). It is
      estimated that many of those households were classified as homeless.
Policy 2-C    Action steps to expand economic opportunities:
(1)   The City will continue, as funding is available, to fund the Santa Maria Valley
      Chamber of Commerce to provide economic development services.
(2)   The City will support the creation of new jobs and housing by annexing
      areas for new employment opportunities and seek to retain currently zoned
      commercial and industrial property by implementing industrial reserve
      zoning.
(3)   The City encourages job creation through new business location and
      existing business expansion and has set aside funds for a Business and
      Retention Loan Program. The Santa Maria Valley Chamber of Commerce
      provides technical assistance for this Loan Program.
Goal 3: Housing Conservation
Work with local housing providers to conserve affordable units at risk of
conversion to market rates.
Timeline:
The above action steps presented below are ongoing activities of the City.
Responsibility:
Community Development; Administrative Services/Special Projects
Policy 3-A Action steps to maximize governmental assistance to conserve
affordable housing units currently receiving subsidies:
(1)   Through the Section 8 Rental Certificate and Voucher Programs, the
      Housing Authority of the County of Santa Barbara provides rental subsidy
      payments directly to private property owners on behalf of eligible low-
      income tenants who cannot afford market rate rents without a subsidy. The
      assistance is tenant-based rather than project-based. As of October 13,
      2014, there were 1,542 Section 8 assisted units located in the City
      (including Orcutt). This represents 42% of the countywide allocation of
      3,685. At that time, there were 425 households on the Section 8 waiting list
                                     VII-7

    and 4,049 on the public housing waiting list. Households using this program
    will continue to be provided assistance and the Housing Authority will
    continue to apply for new funds to increase Section 8 assistance.
(2) The City will encourage property owners and non-profit organizations to
    develop strategies to maintain affordability controls on government-assisted
    projects.
(3) The City will monitor the Union Plaza project. The State offers numerous
    opportunities for financing project construction using Proposition housing
    bond proceeds. The City uses its Federal HUD Community Development
    Block Grant and HOME allocations to invest in projects and contributes to
    a First-Time Buyer Program administered by the County of Santa Barbara.
    With regard to the financing constraint, the City has staff dedicated to grants
    administration; funding sources are continually reviewed. Housing Bond
    Propositions help to fund affordable housing, but bonds are just one of the
    potential sources for project financing. During the term of this Housing
    Element, the City of Santa Maria Special Projects Division will continue to
    seek new outside funding sources for the community and collaborate with
    community partners. The City has an adopted Consolidated Plan and adopts
    Annual Action Plans regarding the allocation of Federal HOME and CDBG
    program funds. To avoid confusion, the Housing Element will refer the reader
    to the Federal reports for the status of federally funded housing programs
    and support services. The City will continue to seek grants for funding of
    programs to serve households with Extremely Low Incomes.
(4) A Community Housing Development Organization (CHDO) is a specific type
    of private nonprofit, community-based service organization that has obtained
    or intends to obtain staff with the capacity to develop affordable housing for
    the community it serves. HOME jurisdictions must set aside at least 15% of
    their allocations for CHDOs exclusively so it is an advantage to be a CHDO
    in securing funding.
    According to the Special Projects Division, there are eight CHDOs approved
    for Santa Barbara County:
       Good Samaritan Shelter, Inc. (GSS)
       Habitat for Humanity, NSBC, Inc. (HFH)
       Lompoc Housing & Community Development Corporation (LHCDC)
       Peoples' Self-Help Housing Corporation (PSHHC)
       Santa Barbara County Community Housing Corporation (CHC)
       Coalition for Housing Accessibility Needs Choice & Equality (CHANCE)
       Cabrillo Economic Development Corporation (CEDC)
       Housing Authority of Santa Barbara County (HASBC)
                                   VII-8

       The City continues its work with area non-profits that specialize in housing
       for persons with disabilities. Peoples' Self-Help Housing Corporation
       (PSSHC) has a non-profit CHDO as a division within its corporate structure.
       PSHHC is expected to continue its construction for special needs population
       including the disabled and farmworkers.
       By City Ordinance, the City allocates a percentage of its hotel and motel
       Transient Occupancy Tax to economic development efforts. The Santa Maria
       Valley Chamber of Commerce holds a contact to provide economic
       development services for the City. In addition, an Economic Development
       Commission meets twice a month to coordinate efforts in the economic
       development arena.
Goal 4: Strategies to Reduce or Remove Government Constraints on Housing
Where appropriate and legally possible, the following strategies address the removal
of governmental constraints (65583(c)(3)) on the construction of housing for all
income levels especially that for low and moderate income households.
Timeline:
This information is presented below for each strategy.
Responsibility:
This information is presented below for each strategy.
1. Land Controls: As a charter city, General Plan amendment projects are not
   subjected to the processing limitations and may be acted on more than four
   times each year.
   The City adopted a Mixed Use Zoning Ordinance (Chapter 49 or Title 12) in
   December 2004. The ordinance is aimed at creating opportunities to establish
   housing in non-residential zoning districts as part of mixed-use projects within the
   City. The ordinance seeks to allow the provision of a mixture of compatible office,
   commercial, industrial and residential uses. Some of the objectives of the
   ordinance are to expand residential opportunities, reduce urban sprawl and
   promote infill development.
      First Baptist Church Caretaker and Valley Christian Academy Staff Housing
       Project is located at 2970 Santa Maria Way. The use permits identify seven
       units in four modular buildings on the campus for staff housing. Three
       duplex buildings house new teachers and one unit houses the caretaker for
       the church on the PF (Public Facilities) zoned site.
      McClelland-Inger Project is located on the northwest corner of McClelland
       Street and Inger Street. In conjunction with a General Plan Amendment and
       rezoning action to change the 2.83-acre site to R-3 (High Density
       Residential), the now completed project was approved for 40 condominium
       apartment units with 8,978 square feet of office space and seven upstairs
       apartments
                                      VII-9

      Lakeview Promenade Project is located on the northwest corner of SR 135
       and Skyway Drive. In conjunction with a General Plan Amendment and
       rezoning action to change a portion of the full block (2.35-acre) site to R-3
       (High Density Residential), the project was approved for a senior lifestyle
       center with 50 multi-family units and ground floor commercial spaces.
2. Code Compliance: The City recently implemented a volunteer program that is
   proving successful. With an increase in funding and staffing this program can be
   expanded. The Code Compliance Division is stepping up its outreach to the
   Spanish-speaking population with homeowner and landlord/tenant information.
       Responsible Department: City Attorney
       Timeframe: Ongoing
       Expected Results During Housing Element Period: 50% compliance per year;
       110 dwelling units brought up to code per year.
3. Site Improvements: The City will seek ways to reduce long term service and
   maintenance costs resulting from new development. Such methods include, but
   are not limited to, requiring: private roads, sidewalks, lighting and landscaping
   districts, and improvement districts. The Maintenance Annuity Fund (MAF)
   concept may be applied to annexation areas resulting in a long-term adverse
   fiscal impact on the City.
   City Council policy continues to allow reduced perimeter fencing standards when
   the subdivision is adjacent to residential land uses. Normally, block walls are
   required for perimeter subdivision fencing to reduce off-site noise impacts on the
   residences. When a new subdivision borders residential property, however, a
   combination of masonry and wood wall may be permitted, reducing development
   costs significantly.
       Responsible Agency: Community Development
       Timeframe: Ongoing
       Expected Results During Housing Element Period: Lower construction costs
       may be transferred to buyers
4. Fees and Exactions: The City will continue to grant a Subdivision/Residential In-
   Lieu Park Fee credit of up to 100% of the fee for existing facilities that convert to
   senior projects, provided the projects have on-site recreational facilities that meet
   certain criteria. In limited cases, the City plans to continue its policy of deferring
   payment of a portion of the fees on projects affordable to lower income persons.
   The City also plans to continue to offer a reduced traffic impact fee to affordable
   and senior affordable housing projects. City fees for projects funded under the
   HOME Program will be waived where legally permitted by City ordinances, on a
   case-by-case basis.
                                      VII-10

    Additionally, the City is considering amending the Downtown Specific Plan to add
    flexibility to the development standards and thereby encourage infill development.
        Responsible Departments: Recreation and Parks, Public Works Engineering,
        Community Development
        Timeframe: Case-by-Case (ongoing)
        Expected Results During Housing Element Period: 200 senior/affordable
        dwelling units will benefit from fee reductions
5. Processing and Permit Procedures: The City policy is to expedite permit
    processing whenever possible. Pre-application meetings and procedural
    handouts help assure that applications will be complete, thereby reducing
    processing time. The City continues to accept and process building permit
    applications prior to completion of Planning Commission approval of a project,
    but at the risk of the developer if required plan revisions cause additional time
    to be spent on the project. Since the mid 1990s most tentative subdivision maps
    are reviewed by the Planning Commission as opposed to the City Council, saving
    processing time. A new courtesy inspection procedure allows inspections before
    permits are issued on a case-by-case basis subject to certain criteria. The City
    Building Division has offered classes on water heater installation, and those
    plumbers who have passed the test have been certified to install water heaters
    without obtaining counter permits.
        Responsible Agency: Community Development
        Timeframe: Case-by-Case (ongoing).
        Expected Results During Housing Element Period: Continued quick
        processing time will result in units available on the market sooner
Goal 5: Promotion of Equal Housing Opportunities
Timeline:
The above action steps presented below are ongoing activities of the City.
Responsibility:
Community Development; Administrative Services/Special Projects
In order to promote equal housing opportunities per Section 65583(c)(5), the County
of Santa Barbara HOME Consortium, with the assistance of its member cities,
prepared an Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing Choice in May 1997, which
was updated September 1, 2006. A thorough update was completed at the end of
September 2011 and submitted to HUD in early October 2011. As part of the
preparation, a survey of community service agencies was conducted to assess the
number and types of fair housing complaints, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data
were collected and analyzed, and maps of the County's racial composition were
created. As a result, the following five impediments were identified through the
Analysis for the County of Santa Barbara HOME Consortium member cities,
including the City of Santa Maria.
                                       VII-11
   Impediment No. 1: Lack of understanding of fair housing laws by landlords,
    tenants, and lenders.
    Recommended Action: Continue and increase educational outreach activities.
   Impediment No. 2: Perceived discrimination by landlords and lenders.
    Recommended Action: Continue and increase educational outreach activities.
   Impediment No. 3: More special needs housing is needed.
    Recommended Action: The County should continue to plan for and finance
    special needs housing.
   Impediment No. 4: Lower home ownership rates among certain classifications
    due to a lack of knowledge about homeownership process.
    Recommended Action: Educational training regarding home finance and
    purchasing should be made more available to improve the chances of minorities
    and women to become a homeowner.
   Impediment No. 5: Insufficient fair housing coordination and enforcement of fair
    housing laws among jurisdictions
    Recommended Action: The County should coordinate fair housing efforts and
    inform residents about fair housing enforcement and supplement state and
    contractual efforts.
The following Fair Housing Action Plan was developed to address the impediments
identified in the Analysis. Included are actions proposed for implementation during
this Housing Element:
1. Execute a renewable agreement for fair housing services. Legal Aid
    Foundation currently has an agreement with the City to perform fair housing
    services. This agreement will be renewed to cover the following terms of the
    agreement:
    a) Interview at least 20 tenants of City residences regarding housing
        discrimination and the habitability of their living quarters.
    b) Assist in the resolution of at least two discrimination disputes through
        mediation or, if necessary, litigation.
    c) Develop a curriculum and make at least two presentations to Santa Maria
        adult education classes, with particular emphasis on the rights of single
        parents and ethnic minorities to equal opportunity housing.
    d) Conduct one community workshop with special emphasis on targeting and
        educating landlords and property managers in Santa Maria about fair housing.
    e) Review local newspapers monthly and report on the presence of
        discrimination in advertising of residential tenancies.
    f) Train volunteers and conduct a fair housing audit, performing random testing
        of at least five landlords and/or property managers per year.
                                       VII-12

   g) Analyze all information gathered from the preceding six activities and prepare
       at least one report based on that analysis.
2. Maintain permanent displays housing printed informational materials in
   Spanish and English directed to housing consumers regarding their rights
   under Fair Housing laws and how they may obtain assistance if they believe
   they are victims of discrimination. The City continues to maintain informational
   displays at City Hall, the Santa Maria Public Library, and the Community
   Development Department.
3. Adopt a proclamation declaring April as Fair Housing Month. The City will
   declare April as Fair Housing Month as it has done for the past several years.
Other Administrative Services/Special Projects actions include:
  Use HOME Consortium funds to provide more affordable rental housing
   and homebuyer assistance. It is projected that there will be greater emphasis
   on education than assistance in the early years of the 2015 Housing Element.
   County HOME Consortium Homebuyer Assistance and Homebuyer Education
   program funding will be identified in the Annual Action Plan and subsequently,
   actions will be discussed in the Grantee Performance Reports that are filed
   annually with HUD.
  Provide handicap modifications for owner-occupied properties under the
   Community Action Partnership of SLO County, Inc. Minor Home Repair
   Program The proposed program will benefit low and very low-income
   households in Santa Maria by the construction and installation of handicapped
   access improvements, removal of architectural barriers, correction of health and
   safety problems and building code violations for eligible homeowners. It is
   projected that there will be approximately 12 homeowners served over the 2014-
   15 year. Minor Home Repair Program funding will be with CDBG monies as
   identified in the Annual Action Plan and subsequently, actions will be discussed
   in the Grantee Performance Reports that are filed annually with HUD.
  Make efforts to upgrade lower income neighborhoods under the
   Neighborhood Conservation Program. The Minor Home Repair program
   began in 2013, and is operated by Community Action Partnership of San Luis
   Obispo County, Inc. (CAPSLO, Inc.) as a sub-recipient to the City of Santa Maria.
   The program targets elderly, disabled and/or low and very low-income
   households in Santa Maria with the construction and installation of handicapped
   access improvements (ramps, wheelchair lifts, door widening), removal of
   architectural barriers, health and safety repairs, such as plumbing, electrical,
   exterior and interior carpentry (porches, decking, stairs, flooring) and building
   code violations. The program is funded primarily with CDBG funds. Funded
   Neighborhood Conservation Programs will be identified in the Annual Action Plan.
                                     VII-13

         Continue to Implement the Reasonable Accommodations Ordinance
         (Chapter 12-50 of the Municipal Code). This Ordinance was adopted in 2007,
         in accordance with the U.S. Fair Housing Act. And California Government Code
         Section 12955.6.

               CHAPTER VIII—OTHER TOPICS
A. ENERGY CONSERVATION
   1. Requirement: Analysis of opportunities for energy conservation in residential
        development (State Government Code Section 65583(a)(8)).
   2. Response: With regard to housing in need of rehabilitation, Community Action
        Commission of Santa Barbara County (CACSB) provides weatherization and
        energy conservation home improvements, such as the installation of
        insulation, weather stripping, water heater blankets, water-conserving
        fixtures, compact fluorescent lights, other minor household repairs, and
        identification of carbon monoxide and other safety hazards for low income
        households. Emergency grants are also available for the payment of utility
        bills.
B. GENERAL PLAN CONSISTENCY
   1.   Requirement: Description of means by which consistency will be achieved
        with other General Plan Elements (State Government Code Section
        65583(c)).
   2.   Response:
         a.     Land Use Element: Of all the General Plan Elements, Land Use links
                directly to Housing because residential uses are identified in the latter
                with maximum densities. Traditionally, densities are measured in
                dwelling units per acre. Because Santa Maria is a charter city, zoning
                need not be consistent with the land use designations. However, the
                City generally seeks vertical coordination between its various tiers of
                land-use regulation. In any event, the 2011 Housing Element reflects
                existing land use policy, and would not change the location, character,
                timing or amount of new development planned for the incorporated
                area. Therefore, no changes need to be made in the Land Use
                Element.
         b.     Circulation Element: Since the 2011 Housing Element reflects existing
                land use policy, and would not change the location, character, timing
                or amount of new development planned for the incorporated area, no
                changes need to be made in the Circulation Element.
                                       VIII - 1

       c.      Economic Development Element: Program 1 in Chapter VI and Policy
               2-C in Chapter VII promote economic development opportunities in a
               manner consistent with the Goals of the Economic Development
               Element. No changes in the Economic Development Element are
               deemed necessary.
       d.      Safety, Noise, Open Space, Resources Management (includes
               Conservation): Since the Housing Element reflects existing land use
               policy, and would not change the location, character, timing or amount
               of new development, no changes need to be made in these Elements.
C. COASTAL ZONE
   1.  Requirement: For Coastal Zone localities, list the pages where the required
       information regarding construction demolitions and conversions within the
       coastal zone is provided (State Government Code Sections 65588 (d)).
   2.  Response: N/A—Santa Maria is not located in the Coastal Zone.
D. REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY HOUSING SET-ASIDE FUNDS
   1.  Requirement: Describe the amount and uses of moneys in the
       redevelopment agency’s Low- and Moderate Income Housing Fund (State
       Government Code Section 65583(c).
   2.  Response: On February 1, 2012, the City of Santa Maria Redevelopment
       Agency (RDA) was officially dissolved. This was a result of Assembly Bill 1X
       26 (Blumenfield)(“AB 26”), signed by the Governor on June 28, 2011, and
       confirmed by the Supreme Court (California Redevelopment Association, et
       al. v. Matosantos, et al. (Case No. S194861)) on December 29, 2011.
       Upon dissolution of RDAs statewide, Successor Agencies were formed to
       wind down the former redevelopment agency functions. On January 17,
       2012, consistent with the provisions of AB 26, the Santa Maria City Council
       elected to become the Successor Agency for its dissolved RDA, by adopting
       Resolution No. 2012-01. Also at the January 17, 2012 meeting, the Santa
       Maria City Council adopted Resolution 2012-07 confirming the Council’s
       decision to transfer any and all local affordable housing assets and functions
       to the Housing Authority of the County of Santa Barbara.
       Prior state redevelopment law required redevelopment agencies (RDAs) to
       set aside 20% of the property tax increment revenue received during the
       fiscal year for deposit into a Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund.
       However, the Redevelopment Agency of the City of Santa Maria had been
       granted a deferral from the mandatory 20% set-aside until the 2027 fiscal
                                     VIII - 2

            year when all existing RDA debt obligations were projected to be paid off.
            There were no moneys available in the fund at the time the RDA was
            dissolved by the State and all housing assets were subsequently transferred
            to the Housing Authority of the County of Santa Barbara.
