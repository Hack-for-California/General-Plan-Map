INTRODUCTIO
INTRODUCTION
                    PURPOSE OF THE
                       GENERAL PLAN
     The fundamental purpose of this General Plan is to protect and enhance Riverbank’s quality
     of life, and address important local concerns as the City grows and changes. The purpose of
     the General Plan is to achieve the vision of the community according to a set of guiding
     principles. Taken together, the General Plan Vision Statement and Guiding Principles
     describe the purpose and direction of the General Plan.
Vision and Guiding Principles
     Riverbank’s General Plan Vision Statement is an expression of the public’s broad, long-range
     view of the community’s desired future. The Vision Statement expresses the hopes, dreams,
     and expectations for current and future generations of Riverbank residents.
     The Vision Statement was created using information from several sources, but it focuses on
     key issues that enjoy consensus among Riverbankers. The Guiding Principles represent
     shared community values that will be used in moving toward the future vision. The Guiding
     Principles were used extensively in drafting updated policies of the General Plan.
     When the City interprets the General Plan, it will be according to the Vision Statement and
     Guiding Principles.
The Riverbank 2025 Vision
     Riverbank in 2025 has a small-town character where residents can live, work, and play
     locally. The City has a thriving downtown that offers a variety of retail opportunities and
     services, and functions as the social and cultural heart of the community. Riverbank has a
     healthy and diversified industrial base served by its railroad, safe and walkable/bikable
     neighborhoods, and a wide range of employment and housing opportunities for its diverse
     population. Although we welcome automobiles, Riverbank is a place for PEOPLE. Those
     who choose not to drive can easily and safely walk, bicycle, or use public transit to get to
     work, school, shopping, or a local park. Riverbankers’ strong sense of community identity is
     reflected in its public gathering places and activities, architectural variety, and the ways in
                                                                                                   IN-1

                                                                           INTRODUCTION
     which the City’s riverfront location, railroad-oriented history, agricultural heritage, and
     other unique qualities are celebrated in the built environment. Riverbank in 2025 has
     succeeded in creating a BALANCE between housing and jobs for its residents, commerce
     and industries that support the local economy, and the protection of agriculture and
     natural resources.
Guiding Principles
     Small-Town Character: Riverbank in 2025 will be a pleasant, quiet, friendly community
     with a distinct small-town character.
     1. Public spaces in Riverbank where people can meet and interact with friends and
         neighbors are essential to our community.
     2. Our neighborhoods are best served by attractive, safe, tree-lined, pedestrian-friendly
         streetscapes.
     3. Our children should be able to safely walk or bike to school.
     4. Downtown should be the social and cultural heart of our community, and must not be
         left behind as the City grows.
     5. Small, locally-owned businesses are an important part of the unique character of
         Riverbank and essential to a healthy local economy.
     6. Our streets and public spaces should be designed with people in mind, not only for the
         convenience of cars.
     7. Commercial corridors, such as Patterson Road, should be attractive, unique, pedestrian-
         friendly centers of commerce to enhance the City’s character.
     8. Our City can grow without being overcome by traffic, noise, air quality, or other
         impacts that would sacrifice the small-town character.
     Community Identity: In 2025, Riverbank’s unique qualities will be enhanced through a
     balance between the built environment, the natural environment, and the working
     agricultural landscape.
     1. The Stanislaus River is a wonderful community asset, the natural beauty and function of
         which we should protect as we increase public access to the River and its views.
     2. Agriculture is important to our history, economy, and culture. Riverbank should remain
         an agricultural center for the region. We should conserve agricultural lands, nurture
         industries that rely on agriculture, market local agricultural goods, and increase the
         productivity of local agriculture through research and development.
     3. Riverbank’s historic roots in agriculture, the railroad, and the River, should be
         recognized, celebrated, and respected as we create the City’s future.
IN-2

INTRODUCTION
    4. Downtown should remain a walkable, pedestrian-scaled commercial center that best
        reflects our community’s unique identity and our desire to maintain our small town
        image.
    5. Riverbank should preserve open green spaces around the City to maintain a distinct
        identity and create buffers between urban and agricultural uses of land.
    Choice and Diversity: In 2025, Riverbank will enjoy a variety of entertainment
    opportunities, retail and commercial services, housing types, job opportunities, and activity
    destinations that are easily accessible by car, transit, on foot, or bicycle. Choices and
    opportunities will be available to the greatest extent possible regardless of the physical or
    developmental abilities, needs, preferences, backgrounds, and incomes of our residents.
    1. We value the opportunities to live, shop, work, and recreate locally if we choose.
    2. We will design our community so that people can walk, bicycle, or use public transit if
        they choose not to drive.
    3. Existing and future residents should have local housing choices that best meet their
        needs.
    4. The City is, and will be, home to all generations. Riverbank is a community where
        children can grow, raise families, and stay in the community as they age.
    5. We will encourage a diversity of jobs and economic opportunities as the City grows.
    6. We value education and skills that provide residents an opportunity for economic
        advancement. Our schools are vital to the social and economic well being of Riverbank.
        We will seek employers who can offer living wages and well-paying jobs for our
        residents.
    Improved Quality of Life as the City Grows: In 2025, growth and change have been
    managed to benefit existing and future residents.
    1. Our City will benefit from an appropriate balance between housing, commerce,
        industry, circulation, and open spaces for agriculture and nature.
    2. The future health of Riverbank requires that older neighborhoods be improved at the
        same time that new areas develop.
    3. Those who benefit from development should compensate for the public costs of serving
        such development.
    4. A healthy community requires that its citizens feel a sense of connection. Physical,
        economic, or social barriers that prevent us from living as one community should be
        removed whenever possible.
                                                                                                IN-3

                                                                            INTRODUCTION
     5. New development should increase, not impede, our sense of being connected as one
          community.
     6. Our City government, guided by the public interest, should be an active leader in
          improving the quality of life in Riverbank.
     7. Economic and fiscal sustainability are important to Riverbank’s future and our citizens’
          quality of life. Development decisions should contribute to the economic health and
          fiscal sustainability of the City.
     Safe, Healthy, and Secure Environment: In 2025, Riverbank’s citizens will travel, work,
     live, and participate in activities confident of their personal and their families’ safety and
     security.
     1. Our community should provide for a diversity of safe and lawful economic, social, and
          civic opportunities for people of all ages to nurture and enhance each others’ quality of
          life.
     2. Our City should be safe and healthy for all our residents.
     3. Community design should encourage people to look out for one another, to view and
          monitor public spaces, and to feel ownership and interest in our community’s safety
          and security.
     4. Pedestrians and bicyclists should be as confident in their ability to travel safely in
          Riverbank as do our drivers.
     5. The air we breathe and the water we use affect our health and well-being. We want
          growth and development to maintain the high standards for the quality of our air and
          water.
     6. Maintaining and improving our urban tree canopy is important to our air quality,
          climate, aesthetic enjoyment, and overall quality of life.

                                                                                 INTRODUCTION
      Noise Element (Mandatory)
     This Element contains provisions for the protection of residents from the health and
     aesthetic problems associated with noise. The Noise Element provides an evaluation of
     existing future noise levels and noise standards for different land uses. In Riverbank, key
     noise generators are roadways, the railroad, and industrial uses.
      Public Services and Facilities Element (Optional)
     The Public Services and Facilities Element evaluates existing sewer, water, storm drainage,
     and other utility facilities, as well as police, fire, parks, libraries, social services, solid waste
     collection, and schools. The Element projects future needs for these facilities and services.
     Key issues include the division of the City into multiple school districts, the need for more
     library and fire protection capacity, a more open and natural approach to drainage, and
     eliminating connections between the sewer and storm drainage collection systems.
      Safety Element (Mandatory)
     The Safety Element identifies hazards that are to be considered in the development of
     future land uses. All locally relevant hazards are considered, including geologic hazards,
     flood zones, hazardous wastes, and fire hazards. Plans for emergency response are also
     examined.
Relationship to Previous General Plan
     The first general plan was adopted by the City of Riverbank on May 12, 1959 and consisted
     solely of a land use and circulation element. A countywide housing element, which included
     the City, was adopted by the City Council in January of 1970. In 1971, a water, sewer, and
     storm drainage element was adopted. In 1973, with the aid of the Stanislaus Area
     Association of Governments, the City’s General Plan was amended to include all the
     required elements with the exception of the safety element. This final element was adopted
     on September 23, 1974.
     Prior to the 2005-2025 update, the General Plan was last comprehensively updated in
     1987. Some of the material from the 1987 General Plan is included in this updated General
     Plan. However, the bulk of the material in this General Plan is new. The goals, policies, and
     implementation measures presented throughout this document are necessary to address
     substantial changes that have occurred in Riverbank since 1987, including substantial urban
     development and continued development pressure. Many new issues have arisen since the
     time of the last update, primarily related to local and regional growth patterns. For the
     2005-2025 General Plan update, the City also determined that the state-of-the art in
     planning and environmental analysis and policy development would be required to achieve
     the quality of life that Riverbankers desire.

INTRODUCTION
General Plan Update Process
      The City and General Plan consultants met early in the process to define the work scope and
      set a General Plan Update schedule. After the overall work program was finalized, the
      General Plan team collected background information and prepared a series of background
      reports concerning each topic covered in the updated General Plan. The background reports
      include:
             Air Quality;
             Biological Resources;
             Cultural Resources;
             Economy;
             Hydrology and Water Quality;
             Land Use, Population, and Housing;
             Minerals;
             Noise;
             Public Services and Facilities;
             Safety; and,
             Circulation/Transportation.
      Each background report was made broadly available via the City’s web site, at City Hall, and
      at various General Plan related public hearings and meetings.
Citizen Input
      Community awareness was raised beginning with the commencement of the update
      process. The City held a communitywide open house at the beginning of the process to
      inform citizens about the General Plan process and also to gather initial input and ideas.
      City staff and consultants conducted extensive outreach including visiting local schools and
      churches, holding public workshops at City Hall or the Community Center, collecting input
      from an email list serve, web site communications, and through various other methods.
      Community input from the first phase of public outreach was summarized for the decision
      makers (Planning Commission and City Council) at a June 16th, 2005 public workshop. The
      City followed up with a series of joint workshops on land use and circulation alternatives,
      soliciting input by various methods throughout this process.
      Stakeholder outreach involved property owners; interested land development groups;
      elected officials; community groups and organizations; community leaders; government
      agencies; neighborhood and business associations; and, other pertinent stakeholders.
Vision and Guiding Principles
      After completing the initial phase of citizen and stakeholder outreach and compiling the
      General Plan background information, City staff and consultants summarized the consensus
      viewpoints in a General Plan Vision and Guiding Principles document. This Vision and
                                                                                                 IN-7

                                                                           INTRODUCTION
     Guiding Principles document was officially adopted by the Planning Commission on July 18,
     2006. The results of the visioning process are discussed above in the Vision Statement and
     Guiding Principles section of this chapter.
     The Vision and Guiding Principles were used to draft several conceptual land use and
     circulation alternatives, which represent different paths to achieving the community’s vision.
     Alternatives are broad, conceptual representations of future growth that focus mainly on
     land use and circulation (transportation).
     A multi-media outreach program continued to inform and update the Riverbank community
     about input opportunities and milestones that were occurring throughout this process.
     Many public workshops were held in the alternatives phase of the General Plan update.
     These workshops provided a forum for citizens and stakeholders to have their questions
     answered, and also to continue providing input to staff and decision makers. Several joint
     study sessions were held with the Planning Commission and City Council. Maps and
     planning documents were created to inform the General Plan process on issues ranging
     from biological resources to current land use. Also at this stage in the process, the City’s
     web site contained frequent updates on the process and notice of scheduled events related
     to the General Plan update. An email distribution list was also used to disseminate
     documents, updates, and other information supporting the process.
General Plan Alternatives
     On February 15, 2006, staff presented the Planning Commission and City Council with three
     conceptual land use and circulation alternatives for consideration, deliberation, and
     direction (Alternatives 1, 2, and 3). Staff and consultants reworked the alternatives based
     on decision maker and public input. The Planning Commission and City Council elected to
     lengthen the schedule by roughly eight months to facilitate additional public workshops
     and encourage substantial additional public input regarding a preferred alternative.
     Alternative 4 was presented at a March 30, 2006 public workshop. Land use and circulation
     concepts were discussed further at a May 18, 2006 public workshop. At a June 20, 2006
     public workshop, a Staff Recommended Preferred Alternative was presented to the joint
     body for consideration, public input, and direction to staff. The Planning Commission and
     City Council expressed support for the concepts presented in the Staff Recommended
     Preferred Alternative.
     The Planning Commission further considered Land Use and Circulation conceptual
     alternatives during a July 18th, 2006 public hearing. As a part of that hearing, the Planning
     Commission recommended to the City Council for adoption the Staff Recommended
     Preferred Alternative (also known as Alternative 5). The City Council adopted a Preferred
     Alternative at an August 14, 2006 hearing.
     There are several key ideas that were included in all alternatives, based on unanimity of
     public opinion and decision maker direction. A description of these concepts follows.
IN-8

INTRODUCTION
PARKS
      Based on input from the public and decision makers, new parks will involve the integration
      of a variety of types and sizes of parks throughout new growth areas, including “tot lots,”
      picnic areas, public greens, public plazas, neighborhood parks, town squares, linear parks,
      and community parks. The different parks will provide a variety of improved facilities. While
      community parks would have sports fields and other facilities, tot lots would have play
      equipment and picnic tables. The smaller parks would be integrated closely into residential
      and mixed-use parts of the community so that most residents are within walking distance
      of a variety of parkland.
      Parkspace will be integrated into residential areas, commercial and civic areas, and mixed-
      use areas. Neighborhood centers will accommodate parkspace in the form of public plazas,
      neighborhood greens, or other types of parks that have passive recreational opportunities.
      Joint-use arrangements with school districts will be pursued, where possible, to help
      provide additional public gathering places.
      Modesto Irrigation District rights-of-way and other linear corridors will become pedestrian
      and bicycle greenways. A greenway along the Stanislaus River could connect new growth
      areas west of the current City limits with existing developed areas and downtown. The
      General Plan will specify potential pedestrian/bicycle crossing points over the Stanislaus River
      to Jacob Myers Park. A western pedestrian bridge could connect future growth areas with
      this Park. A central bridge near downtown could connect downtown and existing
      residential areas with Jacob Myers Park.
HIGHWAY 108 DESIGNATION
      Each alternative assumes that State Route 108 could be re-designated. In planning this new
      route in the southern portion of the Planning Area, the City will recognize Caltrans’ need to
      limit access, Caltrans’ need for acceptable level of service (a measure of traffic congestion),
      and Caltrans roadway standards in designating land uses, establishing access standards,
      and designing traffic impact fee programs and improvement plans. The City will continue to
      coordinate with other jurisdictions in the County to establish a regional funding mechanism
      to supplement State funding for roadway improvements to create this new regional
      expressway facility.
      The City, with designation of a different Highway 108 corridor, would regain control of
      Patterson Road (current State Highway 108) as a local street. With this discretion, the City
      will encourage more efficient use and reuse of properties along Patterson Road, between
      downtown and Oakdale Road. The remaking of the Patterson Road corridor would
      incorporate pedestrian friendliness. Patterson Road would be remade into a safer and more
      walkable, mixed-use district, with a more attractive streetscape that includes additional
      landscaping. A pedestrian theme would continue along Patterson Road through the center
      of the City and into the new growth area in the eastern portion of the Planning Area.
      Housing would be added along Patterson Road and the existing large expanses of parking
      could be reduced and/or rearranged to improve the aesthetics, vibrancy, and function of
      this area. These same ideas would be pursued along Patterson Road as it bends northward
      and then eastward to become Callander Avenue and then Atchison Street, with streetscape
                                                                                                   IN-9

                                                                            INTRODUCTION
      improvements, pedestrian and bicycle facilities, and incentives for commercial and
      residential revitalization.
BRIDGES OVER THE STANISLAUS RIVER
      All alternatives could create the need for a new or expanded bridge over the Stanislaus
      River. Depending on where new Riverbank residents work, the capacity of the existing
      bridges over the Stanislaus River may be taxed during peak-demand periods. The bridge at
      McHenry Avenue is planned to be expanded to accommodate existing traffic, as well as
      future anticipated regional growth. The City anticipates the need for pedestrian and bicycle
      facilities over the river, and potentially, wastewater conveyance facilities.
OFFICE/MIXED-USE OPPORTUNITY ALONG CALIFORNIA AVENUE
      The eastern portion of the Riverbank General Plan area is currently underserved by
      commercial development. To allow opportunity for live-work units (dwellings with spaces
      for offices) and other small-scale commercial uses, the General Plan would establish a
      mixed-use land use designation for properties along California Avenue, which may develop
      concurrently with other projects and plans for east Riverbank.
INDUSTRIAL / BUSINESS PARK
      Each alternative identifies an area for future industrial and business park uses. This area is
      on the southeastern outskirts of the City near the railroad line and existing industrial uses,
      including the decommissioned Riverbank Ammunition Plant. The City will promote re-use of
      industrial land downtown for retail, housing, offices, public spaces, and other land uses
      that are more compatible with the overall environment downtown. The City will assist
      industries that wish to move out of downtown, providing opportunities in the southeastern
      part of the Planning Area. Portions of the industrial / business park area near existing or
      future residences or other sensitive uses will have design requirements that would address
      any land use compatibility issues. Industries to locate in this part of the City could be “wet”
      or “dry,” subject to water supply and infrastructure studies and planning.
CENTRAL PUBLIC PLAZA
      Any alternative could accommodate a central public plaza area near downtown. The plaza
      idea would be developed in concert with traditional Latino/European ideas relative to design
      and function. The plaza could be a public or public/private venture and would provide
      residents with a new central public gathering place.
AFFORDABLE HOUSING
      California State Housing law requires each community to plan for its fair share of housing
      that is affordable to the full range of income groups. Cities and counties prepare a Housing
      Element, as a part of the General Plan, to describe housing needs, constraints, and local
      resources, as well as the City’s approach to meeting affordable housing needs.
IN-10

INTRODUCTION
      Riverbank could, during the General Plan Planning Period, experience four Housing Element
      cycles, each with a regional housing needs allocation reflective of population levels.
      Regional allocations are impossible to predict. However, it is important for the City to plan
      ahead to make compliance with State housing law possible during this General Plan
      Planning Period.
STREETS AND INTERSECTIONS
      All the alternatives have a need for a well-designed circulation system that accommodates
      pedestrian and bicycle travel, in addition to vehicular travel. Any new streets and parking
      areas developed during the General Plan time horizon will be thoughtfully designed, inviting
      public spaces that complement and do not dominate the urban environment. Narrow, tree-
      lined streets with planter strips and adequate pedestrian and bicycle facilities will be
      required in new development areas, consistent with Riverbank’s General Plan Vision and
      Guiding Principles document. (Please refer to Guiding Principles dealing with small-town
      character; choice and diversity; and safe, healthy, and secure environment).
      Development projects in the City will be served with a street network that promotes
      connectivity and free movement of automobiles, bicyclists, and pedestrians (refer to Guiding
      Principles addressing choice and diversity; improved quality of life; and safe, healthy, and
      secure environment).
      In summary, streets will:
       Provide connectivity. New development projects will not simply feed into the nearest
          arterial roadway, but will instead provide frequent through connections to adjacent
          development areas and street stubs to accommodate future through connections.
          Connectivity can be accomplished using a variety of street layouts (see inset figure),
          which have various pros and cons. Cul-de-sacs are permitted only where exterior lot line
          configurations offer no alternatives for connection or through traffic.
       Be Pleasant Public Spaces. Be designed with the recognition that they are the most
          prevalent public space in the community and scaled to the pedestrian, providing
          sidewalks on each side. Private streets and gated communities are not permitted.
       Be Respectful in Terms of Scale. New roads will be designed to be only as wide as
          necessary, while providing adequate access.
       Provide a Street Canopy. Streets will be designed with trees planted in a manner
          appropriate to the street’s function. Commercial and mixed-use areas will have street
          trees that complement building façades and shade the sidewalk. Residential streets will
          provide for an appropriate canopy, which shades both the street and sidewalk, and
          serves as a visual buffer between the street and the home.
       Be context sensitive in design, avoiding excessive cuts and fills and removal of
          significant trees and vegetation.
                                                                                                 IN-11

                                                                              INTRODUCTION
       Be safe and efficient for all users. The use of traffic calming devices such as raised
          intersections, lateral shifts, and traffic circles are encouraged as alternatives to
          conventional traffic control measures.
       Be the focus of buildings – all buildings will front or side onto public streets – all new
          buildings will appropriately “address” the public right of way.
      Segments of straight streets will be interrupted frequently by intersections designed to:
       Disperse traffic flow and reduce speeds, eliminating the creation of de-facto collector
          streets with high-speed, high-volume traffic
       Terminate vistas with a significant natural feature, a building, a park or other public
          space, or some other unique feature
STORM DRAINAGE
      Streets, driveways, and parking lots are a significant source of stormwater runoff and
      potential water pollution. Some areas of Riverbank discharge directly into the river and
      some areas drain into basins. As noted in the biological resources technical background
      report for the General Plan update, the majority of Riverbank’s important biological
      resources and habitats are associated with the Stanislaus River. Water resources were
      identified as the most important environmental asset by resident participants in General
      Plan public workshops.
      The traditional method of runoff disposal by pumping into irrigation canals can create
      problems when pollutants become concentrated in drainage facilities and cause
      groundwater pollution or when canals empty into the Stanislaus River. Downstream impacts
      to the San Joaquin/Sacramento river delta area are an important consideration in planning
      and resource management for jurisdictions up and down the valley.
      As an alternative to a closed and piped system, stormwater management can also employ a
      more open and natural approach that uses vegetated swales, stormwater cascades, and small
      wetland ponds to mimic the functions of nature that have been lost to urbanization. This
      approach is widely known as Natural Drainage System (NDS). Any of the alternatives could be
      developed using a more open system for stormwater management that emphasizes
      infiltration and decentralized treatment (rather than traditional piped approaches that quickly
      convey stormwater to large centralized treatment facilities). These systems can be less
      expensive to construct, as well as providing water quality benefits. The objective of the NDS is
      to reduce pollutants reaching receiving water bodies through infiltration, filtering and
      bioremediation using soils and vegetation, with a focus on suspended solids, temperature,
      and other pollutants generated roads and other urban elements.
GENERAL PLAN
      The City chose a final list of elements for the General Plan after considering multiple
      potential optional elements. The required and optional elements included in the General
      Plan are listed above in the Organization and Content section of this chapter.

SETTIN
SETTING
                                  Riverbank is located in the northern portion of the
                                  San Joaquin Valley in central California. The San
                                  Joaquin Valley is the southern section of the Central
                                  Valley. The San Joaquin Valley centers geographically
                                  around the San Joaquin River. The San Joaquin River
                                  flows from south to north and into the Sacramento
                                  River east of San Pablo Bay. East of Riverbank and the
                                  rest of the valley are the Sierra Nevada foothills and
                                  mountains. Between the valley and the Pacific Ocean
                                  are the Coast Ranges. Throughout its history, the
                                  valley has been a primarily agricultural area, as it still
                                  is. However, the valley has been one of the most
                                  rapidly growing portions of the state in the recent
                                  past. Urban growth has drastically changed the
                                  metropolitan centers of the valley and other formerly
SETTING-1
Welcome Sign                      small cities within commuting distance of these
                                  metropolitan centers and of the San Francisco Bay
                                  Area to the west. The metropolitan centers of the San
                                  Joaquin Valley include Stockton, Modesto, Fresno,
                                  Bakersfield, Merced, and Visalia. Another growing
                                  metropolitan area in the vicinity is Sacramento,
                                  located in the southern Sacramento Valley (the
                                  northern section of the Central Valley).
                                  Riverbank is located just north of Modesto along the
                                  southern bank of the Stanislaus River in Stanislaus
                                  County. The Stanislaus River, which is adjacent to
                                  Riverbank and gives the City its name, forms the
SETTING-2

                                  boundary between Stanislaus County and San
                                  Joaquin County to the north. Near the east end of
                                  Riverbank, Stanislaus County extends north beyond
                                  the Stanislaus River. The Stanislaus River is one of
                                  multiple rivers in the valley that flow west from the
                                  Sierra Nevada mountains into the San Joaquin River.
                                  Downtown Riverbank lies approximately seven miles
                                  north-northeast of downtown Modesto, the seat of
                                  Stanislaus County government. The southern extent
                                  of Riverbank’s city limits now lies only approximately
                                  one mile north of the developed area of Modesto.
                                  The two cities are directly adjacent to one another in
                                  areas along Claribel Road. The next closest major city
                                  to Riverbank is Stockton, which is approximately 25
                                  miles northwest of Riverbank. Other incorporated

                              The two major vehicular transportation corridors in
                              the San Joaquin Valley are Interstate 5 (I-5) and State
                              Route 99 (SR 99), both of which run north and south
                              through the length of the valley. I-5 traverses the
                              western end of the valley. It is located approximately
                              20 miles west of Riverbank. I-5 links San Diego and
                              Los Angeles to the valley. It continues north through
                              Stockton and Sacramento to exit the state to the
                              north and continue on past Seattle. SR 99 is located
                              approximately nine miles west of Riverbank. This
                              highway connects many of the cities of the San
                              Joaquin Valley. It begins at I-5 in the southern end of
                              the valley and travels through Bakersfield, Fresno,
                              Madera, Merced, Turlock, Modesto, Manteca,
                              Stockton, and Lodi. It passes through Sacramento
                              and rejoins I-5 in the northern section of the state.
                              The main highway linking this section of the San
                              Joaquin Valley to the Bay Area is Interstate 580 (I-
                              580). I-580 starts at I-5, just south of the city of
                              Tracy, and crosses the Altamont Pass into the Bay
                              Area. There are many smaller east-west highways in

                              108 begins in Modesto and travels north and east
                              through Riverbank and Oakdale, then east into the
                              Sierra Nevada mountains. SR 120 links travelers
                              heading west from Yosemite National Park, aligning
                              with SR 108 through the foothills and into Oakdale.
                              SR 120 then turns west from Oakdale and continues
                              through Escalon, Manteca, and Lathrop to I-5.

                      INTRODUCTION
   The Land Use Element guides land use change in the City’s Planning Area. As new residences,
   stores, industries, government buildings, schools, parks, and other land uses are proposed,
   the City will refer to the Land Use Element to make sure that these projects are developed
   consistent with the policies contained herein. Consistent with Government Code Section
   65302(a), this Land Use Element designates the proposed distribution and general location
   and extent of land for housing, business, open space, recreation, education, public buildings
   and grounds, and other categories of public and private uses of land. This Land Use Element
   also establishes the allowable density and intensity of development within the Planning Area.
   This Land Use Element has been prepared specifically to support, and be supported by goals
   and policies throughout the rest of the General Plan. The Land Use Element provides
   standards for density and intensity of development that are used in planning the design
   capacity and location of roads and other transportation facilities, as described in the
   Circulation Element. The land use array also dictates, to a great degree, the type, amount, and
   location of public services and facilities that will be required, according to the standards in the
   Public Services and Facilities Element. Areas reserved for open space and conservation of
   natural resources are reflected in the Land Use Element. The City’s goals for accommodating
   alternatives to vehicle travel – goals that are included in the Circulation and Air Quality
   elements – can only be achieved if specifically supported by the City’s land use policies. The
   land use diagram must be designed to incorporate and support the various narrative goals
   and policies throughout the General Plan. In many ways, the Land Use Element establishes
   the context for goals and policies that are contained throughout the General Plan.
   Although in State law (California Government Code, sections 65300 – 65303.4) each
   element of a general plan has equal weight and force of law, the land use element is, in
   some ways, the most fundamental chapter of most local general plans. Through the
   establishment of standards for land use and urban development intensity, the land use
   element of the typical general plan has substantial “ripple” effects throughout the plan.
   This Land Use Element summarizes some of the key land use issues facing Riverbank,
   provides buildout assumptions for land use change during this General Plan time horizon,
   describes and illustrates the location of future land uses, and outlines the goals and polices
   the City will use in implementing the Land Use Element.

Key Issues
            During the extensive public outreach conducted to support this General Plan update, several
            key land use issues emerged. As City staff asked the community to envision what Riverbank
            should look like in 20 years, many of the comments were related to observations of recent
            growth trends in the region. There is a palpable concern among the public about the
            impacts of rapid population growth. Among other issues, key concerns relate to traffic
            congestion, housing affordability, loss of open space and rural character, and development
            of the fringe at the expense of redevelopment and revitalization downtown. Participants in
            General Plan workshops and other public events indicated that, in the future, growth in the
            City should be managed in way that benefits the entire community. Also among the
            primary concerns of the public and decision makers was the exclusive emphasis in recent
            years on single-family housing construction, without a balance of stores, employment, civic
            institutions, apartments and more compact housing choices, and other land uses that make
            up a complete community. Issues, such as pedestrian and bicycle accessibility, the need for
            a variety of housing types, unique design and community identity, and public safety were
            frequently mentioned as priority issues for this General Plan.
            “Balance” became a useful organizing principle for land use planning in Riverbank during
            the General Plan update process. This term has broad application for land use policy
            development. Balance can refer to a locally appropriate match between housing and jobs; a
            balance among housing types to fit the needs of the local population; an appropriate
            balance between economic, environmental, and social goals in managing land use change;
            increased balance and diversity among economic sectors; a balance in transportation mode
            choices; and balance, geographically, of new development in the Riverbank Planning Area
            (western Riverbank, eastern Riverbank, and infill opportunities in and around downtown).
            The goals, policies, and implementation measures that follow focus on the community’s
            priority land use issues.
General Plan Buildout Assumptions
            Based on the assumptions developed during the General Plan update, the Planning Area1 at
            buildout (2025) would accommodate a population of approximately 52,500, which is an
            increase of approximately 140 percent over the estimated 2008 population of 21,757
            (Table LAND-1).2
            Approximately 10,700 new dwelling units could be accommodated during the General Plan
            time horizon, as well as schools, parks, retail and commercial services, industrial and office
            development, and other land uses. Approximately 3,300,000 square feet of commercial

            The best available assumptions were used in developing these estimates. However,
            demographic changes and the land economic environment will dictate, to some extent, the
            actual buildout figures.3 Certain areas designated for urban use may or may not be
            developed during this Planning Horizon. Some areas might be developed at the upper end
            of the density ranges, while other areas might develop at the lower end. Although the City
            has used reasonable buildout assumptions in drafting this General Plan, assumptions
            change. These changes, in part, create the need for future General Plan updates. The City
            will monitor progress toward community planning goals, as well as development trends,
            under this General Plan. Future updates will address variances from the goals and buildout
            assumptions contained herein.

  There is generally a trade-off between transportation costs (including congestion) and housing costs. There is also generally a relationship
between land costs and housing density. When traffic congestion increases within a commuting area, highly accessible land with low
transportation costs (i.e., land near the center city) can become more expensive compared to outlying lands, where transportation costs are
higher. When land costs increase, density and intensity of use increases (all else held constant). Although the buildout assumptions used in
this General Plan are the best available, economic changes can alter the way land is developed and used in the future. Those interested in
learning more about the aforementioned basic principles should study the works of William Alonzo (Location and Land Use, Harvard
University Press, Cambridge, MA, 1964), R.F. Muth (Cities and Housing, University of Chicago Press, 1969), David Ricardo (1772–1823),
Johann Heinrich von Thünen (1783-1850), Harold Hotelling (1895-1973), and others.

             General Plan Land Use Designations are flexible, using broad density ranges. However, to
             come up with overall buildout assumptions, it is necessary to use average densities and
             intensities (Table LAND-2). The average dwelling unit densities, population densities, and
             building intensities are not City policy, but merely estimates used for planning purposes.
             Policies related to dwelling unit density and building intensity are presented in the Land Use
             Classifications section of this Land Use Element.
Land Use Classifications
             This section of the Land Use Element describes the Land Use Designations illustrated on the
             General Plan Land Use Diagram (FIGURE LAND-4). The Land Use Diagram is a
             diagrammatic representation of policies contained in the General Plan, corresponding with
             the Land Use Designations described below. The Land Use Diagram is to be used and
             interpreted in conjunction with the text and other figures contained in the General Plan,
             and in conjunction with the City’s Circulation Diagram (please refer to the Circulation
             Element of this General Plan).
             Density and building intensity standards are presented for certain Land Use Designations, as
             appropriate.4 Density refers to the number of dwelling units per acre, while intensity is
             measured for non-residential and mixed land uses (residential-commercial) according to
             Floor Area Ratio (FAR).5 FAR is a simple metric that, in this case, is used to ensure public
             facilities and services, including roadways, at the Citywide level are planned according to
             some general idea of buildout intensity within the Planning Area. Certain uses may have
             large footprints but low traffic, infrastructure, and service demands. If the City can show
             that a particular project will have low service and infrastructure demands, the maximum
             FAR listed below could be increased.
Agricultural Resource Conservation Area (AG)
             This designation provides for ongoing agricultural operations and land uses compatible
             with ongoing agricultural operations. Generally, this designation occurs in areas with large
             properties, where agricultural practices are more feasible. This designation also tends to
             occur in areas with high-quality soils (for cultivation purposes). Examples of land uses
             compatible with ongoing agricultural operations include equestrian uses, groundwater
             recharge areas, public infrastructure, farmer’s market stands and other on-site sales of local
             produce, and farmworker housing.
4
  It is not appropriate, for example, to discuss building intensity standards for many land use classifications included in this General Plan,
such as Agricultural Resource Conservation Area, an area where substantial building construction is not anticipated.
5
  Floor Area Ratio, or FAR, is a measurement of building space relative to the size of the property upon which the building is located. FAR
of 1.0 would be the equivalent of a one-story building covering an entire piece of property or a two-story building covering half the site.
FAR of 0.5 would be the equivalent of a one-story building covering half the site or a two-story building covering 25 percent of the site.

       The primary purpose of the Agricultural Resource Conservation Area is for agricultural
       production, related processing, services in support of agriculture, and preservation of other
       natural resources. Residential uses, such as the farmer's home, in these categories are
       secondary uses and are permitted on a limited basis to assist and support agriculture.
Buffer/Greenway/Open Space (B/G/OS)
       This designation provides the opportunity to preserve important open spaces containing
       natural resources, such as sensitive biological habitat. This category also includes areas
       where buffering is necessary between different land uses. Bicycle and pedestrian pathways
       are also accommodated by this Land Use Designation.
       Although the Land Use Diagram provides an illustration of where Buffer/Greenway/Open
       Space areas are located, there is some flexibility in exactly where these areas are located and
       exactly how large these areas are. For example, B/G/OS areas are shown along many canals
       in the Riverbank Planning Area. This shows that the City will coordinate with local irrigation
       districts and other relevant agencies to establish a connected system of bicycle/pedestrian
       pathways along existing rights-of-way and easements. The precise width of these pathways
       will be determined through coordination between the City, property owners, and other
       relevant public agencies. Similarly, buffer widths and locations will be determined by the
       City according to the goals and policies of this General Plan.
Multi-Use Recreation/Resource Management (MUR/R)
       This designation would provide opportunities for stormwater management, renewable
       energy production, and community recreation amenities. This area would accommodate
       stormwater detention facilities, groundwater recharge areas, wind generators, solar
       collectors, wind breaks, as well as trails, benches, and other passive recreational areas.
       Areas designated MUR/R could also act as a buffer between ongoing agriculture and new
       residential areas and provide an identifiable and permanent boundary to outward
       expansion of the City. Areas designated MUR/R between new growth areas and ongoing
       agricultural operations will be identified and appropriate widths established through
       Specific Plans. The width of MUR/R areas will vary depending on the intended uses taking
       place within a particular area. The width of the MUR/R for agricultural buffering purposes
       will be designed to minimize noise, dust, and any adverse impacts related to application of
       agricultural chemicals as experienced by encroaching residential uses.
Civic (C)
       This category includes civic and cultural land uses of various types. Examples include
       schools, places of worship, public facilities and infrastructure, community halls, and similar
       cultural and civic land uses. Where such land uses occur within an existing or planned
       neighborhood, they shall be designed to be compatible with the surrounding
       neighborhood. They shall be designed to be pedestrian friendly, include publicly accessible
       areas (where appropriate), and shall unify rather than divide neighborhoods. Certain land
       uses included in this category, such as day care centers, public facilities and services, places
LAND-6
LAND USE
     of religious worship, and other appropriate land uses will be allowed in other land use
     designations, as well, according to standards established in Riverbank’s zoning ordinance.
     The FAR for civic uses is highly variable, depending on the use. One of the school districts
     serving the Planning Area (Sylvan), for example, has a standardized approach to school
     construction that involves an FAR of less than 0.1. Churches, community centers, and other
     civic land uses would have a higher FAR. The General Plan does not, therefore, specify a
     maximum FAR for land uses developed in areas with this Land Use Designation. Civic land
     uses developed in areas with other Land Use Designations should, however, respect the
     relevant maximum FAR standard. This land use category would not include solid or liquid
     waste facilities, as those facilities are provided elsewhere for development within the City
     and establishment of such uses within the Planning Area is not anticipated during this
     General Plan time horizon. Refer to the Public Services and Facilities Background Report and
     Element for more detail.
Parks (P)
     This category includes active and passive parkland of all types. New and existing
     neighborhoods in Riverbank shall have close and convenient access to community parks,
     neighborhood parks, and smaller “pocket parks.” This category can include public plazas,
     town squares, tot lots, parkways, linear parks, and other parkspace configurations.
Mixed Use (MU)
     This designation would accommodate neighborhood-scale retail uses, offices, personal and
     commercial services, and similar land uses. This is the primary category for Riverbank to
     accommodate neighborhood-serving retail, services, offices, and similar needs during the
     buildout of this General Plan. As such, this land use classification is anticipated to be mainly
     non-residential. However, the Mixed Use designation also explicitly allows for higher-density
     residential development in a vertical or horizontal mixed-use setting. This could include
     residential development above (on upper stories of a building) or adjacent to commercial
     operations on the same property.
     Areas designated Mixed Use are located both within existing and planned neighborhoods.
     Specific Plans and the policies therein will be implementing tool of the Mixed Use
     designation for new growth areas, as specified under this General Plan update. Within new
     growth areas, the Mixed Use designation would provide for small-scale retail and service
     opportunities, small professional offices, and higher-density residential development. Mixed
     Use designated areas will be designed to be accessible, safe, and convenient for bicyclists,
     pedestrians, transit users, and drivers. These areas shall not include large areas of surface
     parking or other transportation related features that can divide communities.
     In new growth areas, the Mixed Use designation occurs within identifiable neighborhood
     centers. Neighborhood centers are located internal to each neighborhood and provide
     opportunities for civic, park, higher-density residential, and other higher-activity land uses,
     in addition to commercial/ residential mixed-use development. Refer to the Community
     Character and Design Element for more information. There is no maximum FAR for these
                                                                                               LAND-7

       areas. Rather, the design of such areas shall conform to policies included throughout the
       General Plan, which serve as performance standards.
       Areas with the Mixed Use designation in the existing developed City would accommodate a
       similar mix of land uses as described above. However, this General Plan does not envision

       on vacant and underutilized properties. In order to be consistent with the balance of
       General Plan policy, certain residential neighborhoods with the Mixed Use designation in
       the existing developed City would not experience land use change during this General Plan
       update. As described in policies throughout the General Plan, the City is committed to
       preserving the quality of life in existing developed parts of the City, while also striving to
       add vibrancy to areas with concentrations of underutilized property.
Community Commercial
       Areas with this designation are anticipated to be developed for retail, employment, and/or
       commercial services. These areas are located along major roadways on the periphery of
       existing and planned neighborhoods. The maximum FAR is 0.3.

LAND USE
Industrial/Business Park
          This designation includes manufacturing uses, as well as a mixture of light manufacturing
          and office spaces. 6 These uses may be located in campus-like settings sometimes referred
          to as “business parks” or “research parks.” This category is meant to accommodate a
          variety of employment-generating, basic (as opposed to community serving) enterprises.7
          Office parks could accommodate businesses of various types, research and development,
          logistics services, and other uses. Areas with this designation near existing or future planned
          residential and other sensitive land uses are subject to performance standards to ensure
          against noise, traffic, safety, light spillage and glare, and other impacts typically generalized
          as “compatibility.”
Clustered Rural Residential
          This category provides an opportunity to preserve usable open space, including ongoing
          agricultural operations, or to protect natural resource areas. Residential development in this
          area must be clustered to preserve large and unbroken pieces of property for agriculture or
          open space, including both cultivation and grazing activities.
          Open space may be owned and maintained privately by a homeowner’s association or
          similar mechanism, or by a public entity with ongoing funding for maintenance provided by
          the project applicant.
          The density range of residential development in this area is 0.2 to 1 dwelling unit per acre
          (one to five acres per dwelling unit). One unit per acre is the maximum development yield
          on any given parcel proposed for subdivision. Any residential development in the Clustered
          Rural Residential land use designation requires clustering of proposed development areas
          such that at least 80 percent of the parent parcel in unimproved open space use, and is not
          to be included in any property with a residence or any other urban use.
          Within areas designated Clustered Rural Residential, this General Plan provides for a total of
          250 dwelling units to be developed. The City may allow density to be transferred between
          parcels designated for Clustered Rural Residential where the City’s open space preservation
          objectives are furthered. The City will implement the Clustered Rural Residential land use
          designation through an ordinance to be drafted following this General Plan update (see
          Implementation Measures at end of this Element).
          The City recognizes the value of not only open space preservation, but also open space-
          oriented improvements such as habitat restoration, groundwater recharge areas, and open-
          space oriented recreational facilities. The City also recognizes that the habitat, agricultural,

  Depending on water demand studies that would be conducted with project specific details, this land use designation could potentially
accommodate both “wet” and “dry” industries. “Wet” industries, as the name suggests, are those that require large amounts of water.
Examples of wet industries are soft drink bottling, paper manufacturing, and food processing.

  Economic sectors can be divided into two categories—basic and non-basic. Non-basic industries serve the local population and
economy, while basic industries export their products. Basic sectors are the traditional primary driver for the economic growth of a
region. Agriculture is the best example of the San Joaquin Valley’s basic industry.

LAND USE
Lower-Density Residential
     This designation includes single-family homes, one to each lot, developed at a net density of
     up to eight dwelling units per acre. Lots would be at least 5,000 square feet in size. This
     category would primarily include detached units, but attached single-family units may be
     permitted, provided each unit has ground-floor living area and private outdoor open space.
Medium-Density Residential
     This category includes small-lot, single-family detached homes, attached single-family
     homes, and other residences developed at a net density of between eight and 16 dwelling
     units per acre. Lots would be at least 2,500 square feet in size.
Higher-Density Residential
     This category allows for all types of attached single-family and multi-family housing,
     including condominiums, apartment buildings, townhouses, and other similar residential
     structures developed at a net density of 16 or more dwelling units per acre.
Reserve
     The Reserve category is intended for land that the City has not yet planned for a specific
     urban, agricultural, or resource land use. This designation does not necessarily imply urban
     development, but rather could be areas to preserve in natural open space or for agricultural
     use, for example. This area offers an opportunity to plan for future land uses by setting
     specific performance criteria before development takes place in sensitive areas.
     The Reserve designation does not denote any specific land use, but rather is an overlay
     designation that specifies additional requirements related to timing of development,
     analysis required by the City, infrastructure and service standards, and related topics. Before
     making Reserve areas eligible for consideration for urban development, the City will hold a
     public hearing and make required findings, including the following:
     Development of the Reserve area is adjacent to developed areas of the City and
        infrastructure and services can efficiently be extended to serve the Reserve area;
     The City has had prepared infrastructure planning and financing to serve the needs of the
        proposed development area, including financing of any necessary citywide facilities to
        accommodate the planned level of growth;
     Either the rest of the Riverbank Planning Area is sufficiently built out such that the Reserve
        area is now needed to meet the demand for urban development, or the proposal includes
        a desired land use unique to the Planning Area that cannot be accommodated on lands
        within the City limits or portions of the Planning Area without the Reserve overlay
        designation;
                                                                                            LAND-11

                                                                                      LAND USE
        Completion of an environmental analysis in compliance with the California
            Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), including a mitigation monitoring program, pursuant
            to the California Environmental Quality Act, has been prepared by the City;
        A fiscal impact assessment has been prepared by the City demonstrating that, in the
            short- and long-term, the project would not negatively affect the City from a fiscal
            perspective; and,
        A Specific Plan, pursuant to Government Code Section 65450, has been prepared to
            show the specific land uses, development standards, compliance with the General Plan,
            infrastructure and public service planning and financing, and phasing, in addition to any
            other requirements of State law and the Community Development Director.
Infill Opportunity Area
       The Infill Opportunity Area is an already developed portion of the Riverbank Planning Area.
       However, many properties within this area are vacant or otherwise underutilized. This
       General Plan designates an Infill Opportunity Area where the City will focus reinvestment,
       redevelopment, and revitalization efforts during this General Plan time horizon. In focusing
       development activity in the Infill Opportunity Area, the City will employ a vast array of
       strategies, many of which were in motion prior to the update of this General Plan. Such
       strategies could include public-private partnerships, strategic public investment, infill
       incentives, and other strategies.
       As of the writing of this document, the Infill Opportunity Area has a variety of land uses
       served by a grid street pattern. The same variety of land uses and the same overall street
       layout is anticipated to continue during this General Plan time horizon (through 2025).
       Housing added in the Infill Opportunity Area would mostly consist of apartment buildings,
       condominiums, townhomes, small-lot single-family structures, and other more compact
       residential designs. It is anticipated that industrial operations would have less of a presence
       in and near downtown in the future, compared to today, and that reuse of former
       industrial sites for more compatible uses will be encouraged.
       It is anticipated that the dominance of roadways and surface parking in the western portion
       of the Infill Opportunity Area would be reduced with the application of more pedestrian-
       and bicycle-friendly concepts. These concepts for the current Highway 108 corridor are
       referenced throughout this General Plan. The ability of the City to provide a more
       pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly environment would be further enabled by the redesignation
       of the current State Highway 108 alignment from Patterson Road/Callander
       Avenue/Atchison Street to the Claribel Road corridor along the southern portion of the
       Planning Area.
       This Infill Opportunity Area land use designation is an overlay designation that does not
       specify allowable land uses. On the Land Use Diagram, the Infill Opportunity Area is shown
       as a transparency so that the reader may also view the underlying land use designation. The
       underlying land use designation specifies allowable land use in the Infill Opportunity Area.

Goals and Policies
   Goals, policies, and implementation strategies in this section address various aspects of the
   arrangement, orientation, and planning of land use change during buildout of the Riverbank
   General Plan.
   Goal LAND-1            Managed Urban Growth that Benefits the Entire Community
   Policy LAND-1.1        The City will only allow annexation of land that is: 1) adjacent to
                          existing, developed portions of the City, or, 2) adjacent to lands with
                          available urban services and located within an area designated in the
                          General Plan for urban development.
   Policy LAND-1.2        The City supports LAFCO policy to develop vacant and underutilized
                          land within the City prior to entertaining any annexation if such land
                          can meet the same need as the land proposed for annexation.
   Policy LAND-1.3:       Annexation will be preceded by a City evaluation to determine the
                          level of urban services necessary and financing of infrastructure and
                          services by annexation proponents.
   Policy LAND-1.4        Existing infrastructure in areas seeking annexation will be evaluated
                          to determine the costs necessary to bring such infrastructure up to
                          City standards.
   Policy LAND-1.5        The City will pre-zone land within the Sphere of Influence consistent
                          with the General Plan prior to annexation.
   Goal LAND-2            Balanced and Diverse Uses of Land
   Policy LAND-2.1        Approved specific plans shall include a variety of land uses, including
                          a variety of housing types, mixed in geographic proximity, in
                          proportions and locations illustrated by the General Plan Land Use
                          Diagram.
   Policy LAND-2.2        Approved specific plans containing a sufficient number of dwelling
                          units to support neighborhood-serving commercial and other non-
                          civic, non-residential uses shall include such uses, which should be
                          located in neighborhood centers when feasible.
   Policy LAND 2-3        Approved specific plans that include proposed parks, schools, and
                          other civic uses should locate those uses in neighborhood centers
                          when feasible.
                                                                                           LAND-15
                                                                                  LAND USE
       Policy LAND-2.4  The City will encourage re-use of vacant or underutilized land in the
                        Infill Opportunity Area through policies that seek to encourage more
                        intense infill development.
       Goal LAND-3      Development Patterns that Encourage Alternatives to Vehicular
                        Travel
       Policy LAND-3.1  Higher-activity land uses, such as places of worship, parks, civic
                        buildings, apartments, schools, and shops should be located in
                        “neighborhood centers” whenever possible rather than focused along
                        major roadways. Such neighborhood centers should be small in scale,
                        but sized according to the surrounding neighborhood. Neighborhood
                        centers will provide 360-degree access from the surrounding
                        neighborhood (as opposed to the 180-degree access provided by
                        arterial-focused activity areas). Neighborhood centers should be
                        pedestrian-friendly, including the use of shared and/or on-street
                        parking instead of individual surface parking lots to accommodate
                        parking demand, wherever possible.
       Policy LAND-3.2  The City will coordinate with relevant school districts to ensure that
                        schools are located and designed as to provide safe and convenient
                        pedestrian and bicycle options for students from areas within the
                        surrounding neighborhood.
       Policy LAND-3.3: The City will encourage “compact development,” which places
                        origination and destination points closer together (residence, stores,
                        schools, places of work, etc.), allowing for alternatives to vehicular
                        travel.
       Policy LAND-3.4: Gated projects are permissible only if connectivity with surrounding
                        areas will not be significantly impaired. The City maintains the sole
                        authority to approve a project that includes gates exclusively in cases
                        where a property is located where through connections would not be
                        possible to other existing developed or planned future developed
                        areas. The City will not allow gates in unless fire access can be
                        guaranteed according to Stanislaus Consolidated Fire Protection
                        District. This exception to the general preference for connectivity and
                        access can be made where a project consists solely of unique and
                        locally desired land uses, such senior housing. See also policies DESIGN
                        3-3 and DESIGN-3.6.
       Policy LAND-3.5  The City will encourage development and redevelopment of
                        downtown as a mixed-use area, high-activity area. Development and
                        retention of retail and visitor-oriented uses, business and personal
                        services, government and professional offices, communications
                        facilities, civic uses, and high-density residential uses will be
                        encouraged.

Implementation Strategies
       Implementation  The City will conduct a comprehensive review of the land use
       Strategy LAND-1 element, including analysis and actions to ensure there is adequate
                       land in appropriate locations for employment-generating land uses,
                       no later than 2013.
       Implementation  The Community Development Department will maintain an inventory
       Strategy LAND-2 of vacant and underutilized land to (a) evaluate proposed
                       annexations and (b) ensure an adequate supply of vacant land to
                       meet the community’s needs.
       Implementation  The City and Redevelopment Agency will pursue grant monies, as
       Strategy LAND-3 well as other funding sources for road and public infrastructure
                       improvements to revitalize areas in need.
       Implementation  The City will develop a comprehensive infill development
       Strategy LAND-4 streamlining and incentive program to encourage the redevelopment
                       and revitalization of the Infill Opportunity Area. The Infill
                       Opportunity Streamlining and Incentive Program will include a survey
                       of existing conditions, economic and market feasibility analysis,
                       development standards and incentives required to encourage
                       retention and new development; and streetscape improvements.
       Implementation  The City will update the Zoning Code and other Municipal Code
       Strategy LAND-5 sections regulating land development to ensure consistency with the
                       General Plan.
       Implementation  The City will coordinate with StanCOG and member jurisdictions and
       Strategy LAND-6 Caltrans to remove the State Highway 108 designation as it occurs
                       through Riverbank and plan and condition land uses along a future
                       alignment to enable Caltrans to redesignate Highway 108 near the
                       Riverbank Planning Area.
       Implementation  The City will draft an implementing ordinance for the Clustered Rural
       Strategy LAND-7 Residential land use designation consistent with the policies
                       presented in the General Plan. This land use designation shall be
                       used to preserve usable open space, while clustering residential
                       development on appropriate areas of project sites. The City may
                       allow density to be transferred between parcels designated for
                       Clustered Rural Residential where the City’s open space preservation
                       objectives are furthered. The ordinance will encourage open space
                       preservation and open space-oriented improvements such as habitat
                       restoration, groundwater recharge areas, and open-space oriented
                       recreational facilities.

LAND USE
   Implementation The City will update the General Plan using data to be made
   Measure LAND-8 available by the Department of Water Resources and the Central
                  Valley Flood Protection Board. The City will update the Land Use
                  Element, Conservation and Open Space Element, Safety Element,
                  and other elements, as appropriate, to ensure adequate flood
                  protection. Flood-related revisions to the General Plan will integrate
                  data from the State Plan of Flood Control. Following flood-related
                  updates to the General Plan, the City will revise applicable
                  development standards, including the Zoning Code, for consistency
                  on flood protection policies. Subdivision approvals, development
                  agreements, permits, and other City entitlements will incorporate
                  these revised City policies and regulations.

CIRCULATIO
CIRCULATION
                            INTRODUCTION
         The movement of people, goods, and services is essential to the physical, social, and
         economic well-being of any community. People move about for a number of reasons (work,
         school, personal errands, recreation, to visit others, etc.) and in a variety of ways (car, bus,
         bicycle, on foot, train, airplane, boat, etc.) Circulation also involves the movement of goods
         and services by various means. The movement of people, goods, and services occurs both
         internally (within a community) and externally (between different communities).1
         There are three primary aspects to the system of circulation or movement: 1) the persons or
         thing to be moved, 2) the means of transport (such as a car or truck), and 3) the
         infrastructure that supports the means of transport (such as a street and the system of
         signal lights and other traffic management devices that keep vehicles moving safely and
         efficiently on that street).
         Streets and other circulation improvements represent the City’s largest and most visible
         public investment in community mobility. These investments, along with individual choices
         in how to move about, will determine the transportation options available to future
         generations. The available modes of transportation have long-term ramifications for
         Riverbank’s environmental, social, and economic goals.
         The system of streets, sidewalks, trails, bus routes, and other transportation improvements
         are among the key defining features of neighborhood layout and character. Unfortunately,
         transportation planning too often focuses solely on moving the largest number of cars with
         the least delay during peak travel periods. This focus is understandable since today most
         trips occur by motor vehicle. However, too much focus on moving cars reduces options for
         moving about by other means and reinforces the need to plan for even more streets to
         accommodate the ever-growing volume of vehicular traffic. This exclusive focus on vehicular
         travel also has drastic implications for neighborhood character. The focus on moving cars
         quickly during peak demand periods can have substantial long-term cost implications. Many
         communities have found that it is not cost effective to attempt to construct and maintain a

  While the State General Plan Guidelines indicate that a circulation element can address energy, water,
sewage, storm drainage, and communications, this Element focuses on the circulation of people and goods.

drainage, communications, and various other topics. Please refer also to the Conservation and Open Space
Element for information on energy and additional information on water.
                                                                                                         CIRC-1

                                                                                       CIRCULATION
         transportation system designed to meet demand occurring just one or two hours out of the
         day.
         Planning for circulation needs in Riverbank is closely linked to the types and patterns of land
         uses planned for the City (as described in the Land Use Element). The amount and pattern
         of traffic is directly tied to how people live and whether they can meet their daily needs by
         means other than by private vehicle. For example, where land uses are segregated,
         development densities are low, and the distance between homes and daily destinations
         (work, shopping, recreation, school, etc.) is great, people are forced to drive and tend to
         walk, bike, or use public transit less frequently. Throughout this General Plan are policies
         intended to provide more freedom in travel mode choice for Riverbankers through compact
         development, mixing of land uses, and other means. It is important to combine this land
         use approach with supportive transportation planning. For example, trips are shorter and
         walking and transit is more prevalent with an inter-connected grid pattern street network,
         compared to a transportation system with branching street networks where access is
         concentrated in few points.2
         This Element of the General Plan provides a balanced approach for a circulation system that
         will serve the entire community well in the long term and support policies in other elements
         of the General Plan. Despite prevalent trends in suburban development since World War II,
         the City has elected for more a compact development pattern that mixed uses, reducing the
         environmental impact of cars and the pollution they generate, and improving pedestrian
         and bicycle safety.3
         Not all of our residents are able to, or choose to drive. However, we can design a circulation
         system to serve the needs of those that do drive, as well as those that cannot or choose
         other modes. In doing so, Riverbank can more easily achieve all of our environmental,
         economic, and social goals for the future.
Key Issues
         During the extensive public outreach that accompanied this General Plan update,
         transportation issues were among the most frequently cited. Congestion and safety issues
         were discussed in many hearing and workshops, as was the need to accommodate
         alternatives to vehicular travel.
2 A good synthesis of studies on travel behavior with different land use patterns and transportation system
designs can be found in Reid Ewing and Robert Cervero, “Travel and the Built Environment” Transportation
Research Record, 1780, Paper No. 01-3515.
3 “Balance,” is a useful organizing principle for the Riverbank General Plan. This term has been used
throughout the General Plan public outreach process to make explicit the trade offs between different
elements important to comprehensive land use planning. Balance can refer to balance among housing and
jobs; balance among housing types; balance between economic, environmental, and social goals; balance
and diversity among economic sectors; and, balance in transportation mode choices.
CIRC-2

CIRCULATION
         Several congested roadway intersections were identified by the public and during an initial
         analysis of traffic conditions. Citizens expressed concern about the future of local traffic
         congestion in the face of rapid residential growth. Safety concerns were frequently cited.
         While the public described a preference to provide safe and convenient pedestrian and
         bicycle access citywide, east-to-west connections across the community are of particular
         concern. The community has expressed the desire for a transportation system that
         accommodates, on equal footing, all locally available modes of transportation.4
         Some fundamental concepts have arisen from the public’s desire for a more balanced
         approach to circulation. These concepts and others are woven throughout the goals and
         policies presented later in this document, and include:
          Connectivity and Continuity: Riverbank’s transportation network will be designed to
            provide many alternative routes to any given destination. The transportation system
            should provide direct routes that do not require people to travel out of their way
            unnecessarily. Any new growth areas of the City will be fully connected, via the
            transportation network, to the existing City. Street stubs will be provided with
            development adjacent to open land planned for urban development to provide for
            frequent future through connections. Cul-de-sacs are prohibited except where
            topographic or exterior lot line configurations make any other approach impossible.
          Accessibility: The circulation system should be easily accessible to all users, whatever
            their level of income, age, or physical ability.
          Safety: The circulation system should allow people to feel safe, whether they are
            driving, walking, or riding a bicycle.
          Livability: Public rights-of-way should provide pleasant settings. Streets will be scaled to
            the pedestrian, with sidewalks on both sides. Buildings will front directly onto public
            streets to create attractive “outdoor rooms.” Streets in new areas will avoid existing
            native trees and other substantial vegetation. Landscaping (including a complete street
            tree canopy), street furniture, dispersed traffic flow, separated sidewalks, and an overall
            high quality of streetscape design are required to meet the community’s needs.
Highways and Expressways
         A key planning issue for Riverbank involves the State highway designation of one of the
         City’s primary local roadways. Patterson Road, which becomes Atchison Street in the
         eastern portion of the City, is designated as State Highway 108. This road handles a large
         amount of through traffic as it passes through the heart of Riverbank. Many in the
         community believe this through traffic would be better handled by an alternative route on
         the periphery. The City will continue to coordinate with Stanislaus County, the Stanislaus
         Council of Governments (StanCOG), the City of Modesto, and the City of Oakdale on
         regional transportation planning efforts, including those related to a regional expressway.

information.
                                                                                                    CIRC-3

                                                                                      CIRCULATION
        As of the writing of this document, a Joint Powers Authority (JPA), including the City of
        Riverbank, is analyzing an expressway that would be located along the southern edge of the
        Riverbank Planning Area. Whether one day this future roadway would receive the Highway
        108 designation is an open question at this point. However, the City will cooperate with
        such a planning effort, with the hopes of relieving some internal traffic problems caused by
        through traffic.
Circulation Design, Classification System,
and Diagram
        A major focus of the Riverbank General Plan is to ensure that our citizens who cannot drive
        or choose not to drive can still get around town. Our cars are sometimes the fastest and
        most convenient method of travel. However, it is neither safe nor sustainable to build
        communities where other forms of transportation are inconvenient or impractical or both. A
        holistic approach to land use and transportation planning can easily accommodate
        vehicular travel, as well as alternative modes of travel.
        Development patterns and transportation planning since World War II throughout
        California and throughout the country have emphasized vehicular travel at the expense of
        other travel modes. Part of the problem is planning roadways and intersections strictly on
        the basis of their Level of Service (LOS). LOS is a way of describing perceived traffic
        conditions. The most common way of expressing LOS is by assigning a letter from A to F.
        LOS “A” represents free flow conditions, while LOS “F” represents the most congested
        traffic conditions. LOS uses quantifiable traffic measures such as average speed, intersection
        delay, and volume-to-capacity to determine driver satisfaction. Historically, traffic analysis in
        Riverbank has used a LOS C standard (see Table CIRC-1).

         When peak-hour vehicular LOS is used as a primary basis for transportation investment, this
         can create and perpetuate a system that focuses on expanding road capacity for
         automobiles. Although adding road capacity is sometimes the simplest reaction to vehicular
         traffic congestion, larger roadways can create other problems. Large roadways bring noise
         and air pollution, divide communities, and make travel by other modes more difficult. To
         accommodate LOS C with buildout of the General Plan, many roadways will need to be
         widened, which will create longer crossing distances for pedestrians and wider roadways for
         bicyclists to cross. Developing a roadway system to accommodate LOS C during the two
         most congested hours of the day is also very expensive – not only to develop, but also to
         maintain. For these and related reasons, the City has elected to revise the LOS standard to
         D. In addition, policies in this Circulation Element indicate that the City will consider a range
         of more cost-effective measures to improve mobility (other than road building.
         The Riverbank General Plan presents standards and policies that are intended to
         accommodate convenient travel by all locally available modes, as presented in the material
         that follows.
Street Classification System and Typology
         A hierarchical street classification system describes street standards according to roadway
         function, volume, and speed. This Circulation Element also describes street standards
         according to the predominant land use context served by the circulation system. Street
         design must consider the characteristics of both street function and street type when
         enhancements are made to the multi-modal street system. It is expected that the degree of
                                                                                                       CIRC-5

       access generally increases from arterial to collector to access streets, but different
       environments call for different approaches to access.
       In Riverbank, there are three major classifications for City streets:
        Arterial:
        Collector; and,
        Access.
       The City may require another set of standards for special circumstances, such as State
       Highways or expressways that are located within or near the Riverbank Planning Area. Local
       access road standards may be adjusted somewhat if alley access is provided for public
       services, utilities, and garage/parking access.
       In Riverbank, there are four primary street types:
          Residential;
          Commercial;
          Mixed-use; and,
          Industrial.
       The context for different street types is described below. Commercial and industrial street
       corridors are addressed together, as their context is somewhat similar (although street
       standards are different).
RESIDENTIAL
       Residential street corridors can include public alleys, transit routes, streets, bicycle routes,
       sidewalks, and footpaths. While land uses along residential corridors are predominately
       residential, these corridors may also contain other residential-serving land uses, such as
       neighborhood markets, offices, child care facilities, churches, and public services facilities
       (fire stations, schools, etc.). Residential street corridors shall be designed and maintained in
       a manner that preserves and enhances neighborhood aesthetics.
       These corridors may be designed to accommodate lower automobile traffic speeds and
       provide comfortable paths of travel for children, pedestrians, bicyclists, and others.
       Consideration for the safety of children shall be particularly emphasized. Traffic speeds and
       volumes will be controlled by use of narrow street widths, intersection controls, traffic-
       calming devices, traffic enforcement, and other means. Traffic speeds and volumes will not
       be addressed by the lack of connectivity, dead-end streets, cul-de-sacs, or other means that
       decrease access (including emergency access) and community connectivity.
       The following design features, as appropriate, may be incorporated into residential street
       corridors:
        Lighting / landscaping
        Sidewalks / seating
        Widened sidewalks / raised intersection
CIRC-6

         Street trees / transit stops
         Bicycle racks / lockers / bicycle lanes
         Parkways / newspaper racks
         Stop lights / one way streets
         Curb bulbs / directional signage
         Chokers / signal pre-emption
         Speed humps / fire hydrants
         Reduced speed limits / permit parking
         Utility poles and equipment
         Neighborhood traffic circles
         Other traffic calming measures
         Safe sight distances for vehicles, bicyclists, and pedestrians
COMMERCIAL / INDUSTRIAL
      Commercial corridors can include streets, public alleys, transit routes, bicycle routes,
      footpaths, and sidewalks that principally serve commercial and industrial areas of the City.
      These corridors shall be designed and maintained to support and serve commercial and
      industrial activities emphasizing multi-modal access to preserve and sustain the economic
      vitality of local businesses. These corridors shall be designed and maintained in a manner
      that preserves and enhances aesthetic quality. The following design features, as appropriate
      may be incorporated into commercial corridors:
         Adequate delivery loading / unloading areas
         Safe sight distances for vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians
          Wide sidewalks
          Landscaping which does not distract from nor conceal storefronts
         Transit stops
         Pedestrian-scaled amenities
          Signal preemption
          Paving materials
          Traffic-calming devices
MIXED-USE
      Mixed-use street corridors can include, public alleys, transit routes, streets, bicycle routes,
      footpaths, and sidewalks that serve multiple areas and functions (residential, commercial,
      scenic, through traffic between neighborhoods, etc.). Each mixed-use area in the City is
      different, as determined by location, principal transportation modes, and purpose of users.
      Therefore, each corridor requires individual design.
      The design features for both Residential and the Commercial Corridors, as appropriate, may
      also be used in the multiple/mixed purpose corridors.
      In these corridors, the design features of public rights-of-way will balance and
      accommodate, on equal footing, the needs of residents, businesses, and other users for
      each locally available mode of travel.
                                                                                                  CIRC-7

Street Standards
       The City will require street designs that meet the standards and policies presented in Table
       CIRC-2. In new growth areas, it is the responsibility of proponents of plans, projects, and
       subdivisions to conform to the street standards presented in this Circulation Element,
       including both construction and dedication of streets, as well as funding of street
       improvements required to serve proposed development, based on City standards and
       direction.
       The City will allow greater flexibility for redevelopment and infill projects, where the existing
       development pattern would preclude the typical cross sections envisioned in this Element.
       The City will share the responsibility for achieving street standards in existing developed
       portions of the City, as feasible. The City will improve street cross sections in existing
       developed areas to meet the general parameters outlined below, but also in accordance
       with the goals and policies presented throughout this Circulation Element.
       The exact street cross sections, within the flexibility provided in this Circulation Element, will
       be according to specific goals, policies, and implementation strategies of the General Plan.
       The City will also require the following standards related to street improvements:
        Traffic control devices (e.g. roundabouts, traffic circles, traffic signals, and stop signs)
          shall be utilized to control the flow of traffic, as directed by the City, and provide for
          emergency responder preemption.
        Developers will pay the cost of new roads and streets necessary to serve the development
          and pay costs to mitigate impacts to the existing roads and streets caused by the
          development.
        Developers will be required to provide a traffic study of impacts and possible mitigation
          measures for projects with the potential of causing significant impacts. Traffic studies
          conducted for City of Riverbank projects shall be sensitive to the trip-reducing
          characteristics of higher-density housing development, affordable housing, mixed-use
          development, reduced parking provision, level of service and convenience for pedestrian
          and bicycle travel, and other land use and design elements. Certain projects, such as infill
          projects, projects consistent with approved plans and accompanying traffic studies,
          affordable housing projects, small projects, and projects with enhanced transit features
          or extraordinary travel demand management measures may not be required to perform
          project-specific traffic studies.
        Future residential lots shall not have direct access to arterials unless the area is already
          predominantly developed with lots having access. Proposed housing development along
          a movement corridor shall not have direct vehicle access to an arterial road.
        The roadway width, together with the intersection width and crossover dimensions,
          allows for unobstructed and efficient access to individual lots and sites, even when a car
          is parked on the opposite side of the street. Motorists are able to enter or reverse from a
          lot or site in a single movement.

or other geometric properties of the roadway.
*** Streets sections in higher-activity, mixed-use areas may have a wide sidewalk (at least 10 feet in width) with street trees planted in sidewalk cutouts instead of a planter strip subject to review and approval
by the City.
**** Most street sections will require the use of the use of natural drainage swales designed to meter and filter stormwater runoff. Streets sections in higher-activity, mixed-use areas can collect and convey
runoff to nearby areas for natural metering, filtering, and infiltration.

Circulation Diagram
        The City will require as a part of new development, and pursue within the existing City
        limits, a circulation system consistent with that illustrated conceptually in Figure CIRC-1.
        The Circulation Diagram focuses on the larger roadway facilities, such as arterial and
        collector level streets. Detailed layout, including the placement of access streets, shall be
        included, consistent with Circulation Element policies, as a part of plans, projects, and
        subdivision requests, and subject to City review and approval according to the policies in
        this Element and the City’s standards and specifications (separately adopted).
        Crawford Road is not shown as a through street midway between Oakdale Road and Coffee
        Road. In this area, as of the writing of this document, there are several larger-lot residences,
        the owners of which may not wish to subdivide in the immediate future. The City
        anticipates that someday this area would become developed at a similar density to urban
        development anticipated for the rest of the southwest Riverbank area. It is anticipated that
        a temporary traffic diverter would be installed along Crawford Road as the southwestern
        portion of the Riverbank Planning Area develops. This would be intended to allow access for
        residents and property owners of the area, but prevent significant through traffic. In the
        future, when the large-lot residential area subdivides and develops, the City will remove this
        temporary traffic diverter to provide greater access (including emergency access) and
        connectivity for this area.
        With input from Caltrans, Riverbank, StanCOG, Stanislaus County, the City of Modesto, and
        the City of Oakdale are analyzing and planning for a regional expressway. This regional
        expressway would provide service to the Riverbank Planning Area and would be located
        near the Claribel Road corridor. Under current plans, this route would be a regional facility
        linking northern Stanislaus County, Tuolumne County, and SR 99. The exact nature of
        access to the new route and the level of improvement to major intersections is
        undetermined as of the writing of this document, and will need to be coordinated between
        StanCOG, Stanislaus County, and the affected cities along the route. The City will require
        proposed development projects near or affecting the Claribel Road corridor to plan, analyze,
        and mitigate transportation-related impacts related to the Claribel Road corridor, including
        access, according to the latest known regional expressway plans.
        It is anticipated that one or more specific plans will be prepared to implement the City’s
        General Plan. New growth areas anticipated to be a part of future specific plans include
        areas in the southern portion of the Planning Area that would be affected by expressway
        planning efforts. While it is not possible as of the writing of this document to describe

                            integrated system of bicycle facilities and pedestrian facilities,
                            designed to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act.
     Policy CIRC-1.2        Approved plans, projects, and subdivision requests in new growth
                            areas shall provide a fully connected network of smaller roadways
                            that provide many alternative routes between each point of origin
                            and destination.
     Policy CIRC-1.3        Approved projects, plans, and subdivision requests in new growth
                            areas shall arrange streets in an interconnected block pattern, so
                            that pedestrians, bicyclists, and drivers are not forced onto arterial
                            streets for inter- or intra-neighborhood travel. This approach will
                            also ensure safe and efficient movement of emergency responders.
     Policy CIRC-1.4        Approved projects, plans, and subdivision requests with an internal
                            street network shall provide an internal connectivity index of 1.4 or
                            higher. The connectivity index is calculated by dividing the total
                            number of road segments the number of nodes. Nodes are
                            intersections plus cul-de-sacs. Roadway segments are between
                            intersections. Cul-de-sacs are prohibited except where physical
                            constraints make any other roadway solution impossible. The City
                            may require higher levels of connectivity, beyond this standard, and
                            will review plans and projects to take advantage of opportunities to
                            provide more connectivity.
     Policy CIRC-1.5        Approved projects, plans, and subdivision requests shall connect

                         between downtown and surrounding neighborhoods, across the
                         railroad, across the river, and between other important origin and
                         destination points.
        Policy CIRC-1.8  City street improvement standards and the street classification
                         system will reflect the need to accommodate the full range of
                         locally available travel modes.
        Policy CIRC-1.9  In new and existing developed areas, the City will invest in a
                         convenient, well-maintained, and safe system of pedestrian and
                         bicycle paths that connect residences with shopping centers, public
                         buildings, parks, places of employment, and schools.
        Policy CIRC-1.10 The City will incorporate pedestrian and bicycle improvement
                         projects into the City’s Capital Improvements Program.
        Policy CIRC-1.11 The City’s level of service standards will balance the need to provide
                         convenient vehicular travelways during peak hours of demand with
                         other community goals, such as the desire to accommodate
                         pedestrian and bicycle access.
        Policy CIRC-1.12 The City will use Level of Service D as the goal for roadway
                         segments, as measured on a daily basis. The City’s goal for peak-
                         hour intersection level of service is LOS D. The City may elect to
                         exceed of these standards in favor of other community planning
                         and environmental goals and policies.
        Policy CIRC-1.13 City environmental documents and associated mitigation programs
                         will explicitly consider compact development, mixing of land uses,

                         oriented design elements that generate fewer vehicle trips. Such
                         approved plans, projects, and subdivision requests will have a
                         correspondingly lower contribution toward any roadway or

                     Higher-activity land uses shall not be focused in a linear pattern
                     along large roadways.
    Policy CIRC-2.2  The City will not allow large, unbroken surface parking lots, which
                     unnecessarily inhibit travel on foot and by bicycle. Please refer also
                     to Community Character and Design Element policies that address
                     the location and nature of surface parking.
    Policy CIRC-2.3  Approved projects, plans, and subdivisions shall provide shade trees
                     in parking areas at a ratio of at least one tree for every four parking
                     spaces. These trees shall be dispersed throughout the parking area.
    Policy CIRC-2.4  The City will ensure that redevelopment and revitalization efforts in
                     the existing City are designed to accommodate and encourage
                     pedestrian and bicycle travel, as well as public transit options, as
                     such options become more widely available.
    Policy CIRC-2.5  The City will be flexible in parking requirements or eliminate off-
                     street parking requirements for redevelopment, infill, and multi-
                     family projects by allowing cooperative shared use of parking

        Goal CIRC-3     Increase the Availability and Use of Transit
        Policy CIRC-3.1 The City will coordinate planning efforts and project entitlements
                        with the Riverbank Oakdale Transit Agency, the Stanislaus Area
                        Regional Transit District (START), and any future providers serving
                        Riverbank to enhance and expand transit services throughout the
                        City and surrounding region.
        Policy CIRC-3.2 The City will promote the development, improvement, expansion,
                        and increased ridership of transit within the City, including the
                        development of new transit agencies and new forms of transit, as
                        they become available.
        Policy CIRC-3.3 Approved plans, projects, and subdivision requests will
                        accommodate transit facilities consistent with transit agency
                        planning.
        Policy CIRC-3.4 When transit stops are required in existing developed portions of
                        Riverbank or new growth areas, the City will ensure that stops are
                        safe, convenient, comfortable, well maintained, and
                        complementary to the urban design in the surrounding vicinity.
        Policy CIRC-3.5 The City will coordinate with local and regional transit providers in
                        developing transit plans that link important origin and destination
                        points affecting Riverbank residents and businesses.
        Policy CIRC-3.6 The City will support and provide incentives to encourage local
                        businesses and transit providers to develop transit incentive
                        programs.
        Policy CIRC-3.7 The City will coordinate with all agencies involved in planning for a
                        future east-west expressway through northern Stanislaus County to
                        ensure that transit service is provided along the route, including
                        potentially the use of HOV/transit only lanes during peak hours.

CIRCULATION
    Goal CIRC-4     Move Freight and Passengers Efficiently
    Policy CIRC-4.1 The City will work with relevant public agencies and the railroad to
                    appropriately regulate the movement of truck traffic and hazardous
                    materials throughout the City.
    Policy CIRC-4.2 The City will enforce weight limits as a means to safely regulate
                    truck traffic in noise sensitive areas, such as residential
                    neighborhoods and near schools and hospitals.
    Policy CIRC-4.3 The City will ensure that signage indicating weight limits is clearly
                    posted throughout the City.
    Policy CIRC-4.4 The City will support the development and implementation of a
                    quick-response emergency services program for railroad corridors
                    and continue to support the County’s Hazardous Materials Team.
    Policy CIRC-4.5 The City will coordinate with rail transportation operators, such as
                    BN&SF and Amtrak, to ensure safe and reliable rail transportation in
                    and through the Planning Area.
    Policy CIRC-4.6 The City will limit, with a maximum weight limits, truck traffic to
                    appropriate routes. Truck routes include Highway 108 through the
                    City (Patterson Road, Callander Avenue, and Atchison Street),
                    Roselle Avenue, First Street in the downtown area, Claus Road,
                    Claribel Road, Snedigar Avenue, and Coffee Road. Areas of the
                    aforementioned listed streets not within the City limits will be
                    formally designated by the City upon any annexation that may
                    occur in the future. Although Claribel Road may not be fully within
                    City limits, it is likely that this would be a major roadway serving the
                    County at some point in the future and appropriate for truck traffic.
                    The City will designate, post signage, and otherwise restrict truck
                    traffic from using other streets, with an emphasis on streets that
                    are primarily residential. Trucks may go by direct route to and from
                    restricted streets, where required for the purpose of making pickups
                    and deliveries of goods, but are otherwise restricted to truck routes.
                                                                                      CIRC-17

Implementation Strategies
          Implementation       The City will develop and implement a Bicycle Master Plan. In
          Measure CIRC-1       coordination with the public at large and other relevant public
                               agencies, the City will outline a comprehensive bikeway system that
                               serves the goals of the General Plan. Elements of the Bicycle Master
                               Plan will be included in Citywide capital improvements planning.
                               The Bicycle Master Plan will be coordinated, as appropriate, with
                               City of Modesto Bikeway Planning and Countywide and regional
                               efforts, as they arise. The City will specifically work with the City of
                               Modesto to coordinate bikeways along the Hetch-Hetchy right-of-
                               way and along the railroad line, as appropriate.5
          Implementation       As a part of implementation of the City’s bicycle master plan, the
          Measure CIRC-2       City will work with local irrigation districts, the County, local
                               railroad concerns, other property owners, and other agencies and
                               interested parties to acquire and/or use existing easements and
                               rights-of-way for development of off-street pedestrian and bicycle
                               pathways.
          Implementation       The City will work with outside agencies, employees, and employers
          Measure CIRC-3       to optimize the use of alternative travel modes and reduce the use
                               of the automobile, especially during peak periods of congestion. To
                               support this effort, the City will develop a Travel Demand
                               Management ordinance that requires large employers to provide
                               incentives for employees to commute via transit, bicycle, on foot, or
                               by carpool, rather than the single-occupant vehicular commute.
          Implementation       The City will revise street improvement standards to be consistent
          Measure CIRC-4       with this Circulation Element, including consideration on equal
                               footing of all locally available forms of travel. Standards will ensure,
                               among other things: a complete and comprehensive pedestrian
                               and bicycle system to allow such travel for daily needs; sidewalks
                               are wide and shaded by trees; trees are placed to provide
                               separation between pedestrians and auto traffic; avoid sidewalk
                               damage by tree roots; the width and number of curb cuts

                   development of shared parking facilities; use of on-street parking to
                   meet demand of nearby properties; ensuring parking standards
                   reflect actual parking demand; ensuring parking standards are
                   reduced for properties in walkable and bicycle friendly areas of the
                   City; use innovative design standards, such as tandem parking,
                   stacked parking, and valet parking; and other strategies. The City
                   will develop and include maximum, as well as, minimum parking
                   requirements for new growth areas.
    Implementation The City will work with surrounding jurisdictions, the County, and
    Measure CIRC-8 StanCOG to develop regional solutions to regional vehicular
                   transportation issues. The City will evaluate and make use of City
                   approved regional traffic modeling tools, and use such tools for
                   impact assessment and traffic mitigation for development projects.

COMMUNITY CHARACTER
    AND DESIGN
COMMUNITY AND CHARACTER DESIGN
                        INTRODUCTION
      Riverbank is a distinctive Central Valley community. The City originally developed on a series
      of gridded streets, framed by the Stanislaus River on the north, and agricultural lands on
      the south, east, and west. It is a town whose civic tradition was established by the railroad
      and the agriculture community that supported it. Over the past century, Riverbank has
      become a livable, amenable place, with walkable, tree-lined streets, neighborhood parks,
      accessible natural areas, and a historic downtown. Somewhat removed from major urban
      growth centers, Riverbank has the qualities of a friendly small town.
      The Community Character and Design element builds on the positive existing qualities of
      Riverbank. The Element also reflects Riverbanks cultural history, which has been shaped by
      agriculture, industry, and the railroad. It introduces policies aimed at protecting the natural
      resources of the City and enhancing its livability in the future. Within the city, the element
      advances a model (carried through the entire General Plan) of neighborliness, and the
      design of environments that discourage auto dependence.
      Riverbank looks and feels is a direct statement of the community’s values and desires.
      Residents care about how their City looks and feels. They want to live somewhere that they
      can take pride in calling home. The City also wants to make a positive impression with
      visitors, creating interesting places that people remember and visit again.
Public Outreach Addressing Community Character and Design
      Riverbank residents have diverse cultural backgrounds, which is a great strength. There are a
      variety of households with different socioeconomic characteristics, different preferences,
      and different needs. Since this is the City’s first Community Character and Design Element,
      staff and decision makers have conducted outreach and facilitated community input with a
      special focus on community character and design issues.
      To ensure that the built environment meets the needs of our community, the City staff
      conducted a public outreach effort that invited citizens to civic events to discuss design
      preferences during the General Plan update. The City staff also conducted outreach in the
      community, at citizens’ civic and religious gathering places. Staff and consultants presented
      preference surveys and organized these surveys such that the community’s input could be
      easily used to draft polices in accordance with specific urban design preferences. The survey
      responses were summarized and evaluated by City staff and consultants to provide the basis
                                                                                                 DES-1

                                   COMMUNITY AND CHARACTER DESIGN
      for this Element. The City also conducted a public workshop with the Planning Commission
      and City Council to specifically discuss their opinions on community character and design.
Relationship with other General Plan Elements
      The goals and policies in this Community Design Element have also been drafted to
      incorporate goals and policies from the Land Use and Circulation Element, in particular.
      These Elements include City goals for air quality, transportation, and land efficiency, calling
      for more compact urban development patterns, mixing of land uses, a high-quality multi-
      modal transportation system, and other planning components. These goals in other
      Elements are particularly demanding of design. The City recognizes that high-quality private
      and public design in the overall urban environment is necessary for gaining broad public
      acceptance for more compact communities. Convenience of non-vehicular modes of travel
      similarly will depend on high quality in urban design.
      While the Land Use Element describes the location and distribution of uses within the City,
      the Community Character and Design Element emphasizes how development should relate to
      the user, visual characteristics, and how buildings and other improvements should function in
      the greater context of the community. This Element is the basis for the aesthetic regulation of
      public and private land and structures.
Communitywide Policies and Focus Areas
      The Community Character and Design Element provides policies and design concepts
      regarding the form and character of new private development (and public improvements) at
      a Citywide basis. The Element describes different design requirements for different land uses
      and different districts in the City. The Element also provides focused plans for areas of the
      City in need of special design attention, such as Downtown Riverbank, the Patterson Road
      corridor, and Neighborhood Centers in the new and planned parts of the City. Unless
      specified otherwise, the goals and policies that follow apply Citywide.
Goals and Policies
STREETS GOALS & POLICIES
      Streets comprise the majority of the accessible public spaces of cities and can be among the
      liveliest and most memorable areas of a community. In past years, however, street design
      focused on accommodating motor vehicles with minimal consideration for other activities
      and modes of transportation. Goals, policies, and design guidelines provided in this element
      are aimed at balancing the need for motor vehicle movement and parking with the
      community’s desire to create a sense of place.

       Policy DESIGN-2.7        In general, the City will require the construction of sidewalks on
                                both sides of all new streets. In industrial areas, sidewalks may not
                                be appropriate.
       Policy DESIGN-2.8        The City will coordinate with transit providers and, as appropriate,
                                require land and amenities to accommodate transit.
Residential Development Goals & Policies
      Riverbank's residential areas include older, more
      traditional residential neighborhoods in the central
      area and newer, more auto-oriented development
      to the west. The central area's older neighborhoods
      have tree-lined streets with sidewalks and detached
      garages served by alley access, resulting in a
      pedestrian oriented design. This contrasts with the
      newer single-family neighborhoods, which feature a
      wide, discontinuous cul-de-sac street pattern and
                                                                   Figure DESIGN-8. Preferred – allow
      homes with garage doors that face the street.                for multiple points of access
      Newer multi-family complexes and parking areas
      are usually large and isolated from the surrounding
      community. The bulk and lot coverage of these
      complexes are dominating.
      The following policies are aimed at creating
      neighborhoods that are
       oriented toward pedestrians,
       foster social interaction, and
       create a sense of community.
CRIME PREVENTION THROUGH COMMUNITY DESIGN                          Figure DESIGN-9. To Be Avoided –
                                                                   long blocks with walls that prevent
                                                                   access
      There are two basic approaches to crime prevention
      through environmental design.
      Defensible Space Theory. One theory emphasizes good neighborly relationships that focus
      attention on public spaces. For the purposes of this discussion, this approach is called the
      Defensible Space Theory. Thoughtful site planning and design can provide residents with
      surveillance, territorial control, and community policing. The more people and “eyes on the
      street,” the more that crime can be prevented through community design.
DES-6

COMMUNITY AND CHARACTER DESIGN
   Opportunity Theory. A different approach emphasizes limited and controlled access
   points in and out of neighborhoods. For the purposes of this discussion, this is called the
   Opportunity Theory. Under this theory, public streets and spaces should be difficult to enter
   and escape.
   The two theories are not mutually exclusive, but where there is a conflict, the City reserves,
   at its sole option, to choose between: (1) Defensible Space Theory – a more open and
   integrated lay-out that generates attention to public spaces; or, (2) Opportunity Theory – a
   more closed layout that discourages entry and exit for outsiders.
   It is expected that a vast majority of neighborhoods will be consistent with the Defensible
   Space Theory. Given the City’s General Plan Vision Statement, General Plan Guiding
   Principles, and goals and policies presented throughout this General Plan, the policy
   preference in most instances will be for the Defensible Space approach.
   The City will review each project that proposes limited or controlled public access based on
   its individual merits and its ability to serve the public interest. In its review, the City will
   consider information provided by all reviewing departments (fire, police, public works, and
   others, as relevant).
   Given the range of strategies for controlling access, different types of projects, different
   contexts for development projects, and the ability to regulate without dictating design, only
   general criteria for access and security are provided. General Plan policy is to be used in
   conjunction with concurrent application for discretionary action, such as a Specific Plan,
   tentative map, street abandonment, or other approval process, as determined by the City.
   Decisions must conform to legal and procedural requirements set forth in the California
   Streets and Highways Code, the Vehicle Code and the Government Code, and must also be
   consistent with City ordinances, policies, and design manuals with respect to public and
   private street right-of-way standards.
    Goal DESIGN-3           Neighborhoods Are Oriented to the Pedestrian and Foster a
                            Sense of Community
    Policy DESIGN-3.1       The City will limit block lengths and encourage continuity of streets
                            among neighborhoods to facilitate access, increase connectivity,
                            and support safe pedestrian, bicyclist, and vehicular movement in
                            residential neighborhoods. Individual blocks in approved plans,
                            projects, and subdivision requests shall be no more than 300 to 400
                            linear feet per block face or 1,000 to 1,300 linear feet total per block

                             residential site and building design that contributes to an attractive,
                             pedestrian-friendly environment along neighborhood streets.
                             Approved plans, projects, and subdivision requests will minimize
                             the visual prominence of garages and instead incorporating
                             porches, stoops, active rooms, and functionally opening windows
                             that face the street.
      Policy DESIGN-3.3      The City will not allow the use of sound walls within
                             neighborhoods. Traffic dispersal on a finely connected network of
                             smaller roadways and other planning and site design solutions shall
                             be used instead of sound walls to address any noise issues. Since
                             gated residential areas discourage connectivity, the City only allows
                             such developments if connectivity with surrounding areas will not
                             be significantly impaired and other specified conditions are met.
                             The City maintains the sole authority to approve a project that
                             includes gates exclusively in cases where a property is located where
                             through connections would not be possible to other existing
                             developed or planned future developed areas. The City will not
                             allow gates in unless fire access can be guaranteed, according
                             standards of, and review by the Stanislaus Consolidated Fire

                             connectivity and access may be made where a project consists solely
                             of unique and locally desired land uses, such senior housing. See

     Policy DESIGN-3.5    The City will ensure that smaller residential lots, including those
                          with widths of less than approximately 50 feet, shall minimize
                          driveway widths, set garages back from the home structure, and
                          minimize garage widths. The City will encourage the use of
                          alleyway access, in particular for smaller residential lots, in

DOWNTOWN GOALS & POLICIES
    A city with a thriving downtown has the potential for bolstering community spirit and
    contributing to a healthy local economy. Through innovative urban design programs, as
    well as various land use and economic strategies, Downtown Riverbank will be an attractive
    place for businesses to locate and residents to live. The City will plan for increased
    development downtown, promote urban design that enhances the public realm, improve
    streets and sidewalks, and encourage better building and site design in the downtown built
    environment.
     Goal DESIGN-7          Downtown is a Vital, People-Oriented Place

                     improvements to enhance the identity of the Downtown.
   Policy DESIGN-8.2 The City will support urban design programs that incorporate public
                     and semi-public improvements to enhance the connections among

Neighborhood Centers and Commercial Development Goals & Policies
       In new growth areas of the City, higher-activity land uses, such as schools, parks, retail and
       commercial services, small offices, civic uses, apartments, and others will be located close
       together in neighborhood centers. Neighborhood centers will represent “nodes” of urban
       development where intensity and density is increased relative to the surrounding area. For
       example, while the neighborhood center may contain apartments buildings, surrounding
       areas would contain medium-density housing types, such as townhomes or small-lot,
       single-family housing. These areas would in turn be surrounded by lower-density housing.
       Neighborhood centers will be small in scale, but sized according to the needs and size of
       the surrounding neighborhood. Neighborhood centers will be pedestrian and bicycle
       friendly areas, and will provide the opportunity for transit access, once it is available. Such
       neighborhood centers will have 360-degree access to and from the surrounding
       neighborhood (as opposed to the 180-degree access afforded to linear, arterial-oriented
       development).
       Some of our existing commercial areas are designed to be vehicle-oriented with few
       pedestrian amenities. To become more inviting for pedestrian and transit users, both
       commercial areas and neighborhood centers need wider sidewalks and pedestrian ways
       furnished with benches and street trees. These areas require well-marked crosswalks and
       transit stops, buildings that are oriented to the streets rather than to parking lots, and
       compact development patterns which decrease walking distances between retail outlets.

    Policy DESIGN-10.1 The City will require site and building access for pedestrians and
                       bicyclists by providing the most direct pedestrian access from
                       sidewalks and parking areas to building entrances while minimizing
                       conflicts with motor vehicle traffic.
    Policy DESIGN-10.2 The City will require and establish connecting streets with short
                       blocks in pedestrian-oriented commercial areas in order to create a
                       pedestrian-scale street environment. The City will work to retrofit

                            the front of the buildings. Where it is not possible to provide
                            parking behind a building, parking may be located along the
                            interior side. Signage for parking should be a recognized standard

OPEN SPACE AND NATURAL ENVIRONMENT GOALS & POLICIES
    The preservation and enhancement of the natural environment is of vital importance as
    Riverbank grows. Citizens place a high priority on preserving the rural character and believe
    it is a major component of Riverbank's identity. The City will continue to protect sensitive
    environments and habitats, as well as provide open spaces for passive and active recreation.
                                                                                              DES-23

        The following goals and policies will strengthen and reaffirm Riverbank's commitment to a
        healthy and accessible system of natural and urban open spaces.
        Goal DESIGN-15         Adequate, Safe, Well-Located Public Open Spaces, Parks
                               Facilities, and Access to Features of the Natural Environment
        Policy DESIGN-15.1     The City will identify land to create an open space system that links,
                               parks, greenbelts, wildlife habitats, the Stanislaus River corridor,
                               channels, and other critical areas. Impacts on the environmental
                               functions of critical areas shall be considered in the development of
                               open space system links.
        Policy DESIGN-15.2     The City will require integration in the design of an open space
                               system natural features that also provide flood protection, wildlife
                               habitat, and other environmental enhancements.
        Policy DESIGN-15.3     The City will require the full range of recreational spaces, which could
                               include town squares, public plazas, and small parks. Smaller parks
                               will be located in high activity areas, such as commercial, residential,
                               and civic buildings, to allow pedestrians to rest and interact.
        Policy DESIGN-15.4     The City will require and pursue the preservation and enhancement
                               of public access to riverfront recreation / natural areas while
                               protecting sensitive habitats.

ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE DESIGN GOALS & POLICIES
     Development will continue to consume natural resources and generate waste and pollution.
     The use of environmentally harmful construction materials and practices can diminish life-
     sustaining and enriching functions of the natural environment. Many developers and
     construction industry professionals use approaches to design and materials selection that
     reduce long-term impacts of development. Built it Green, Leadership in Energy and
     Environmental Design, and Low Impact Development are but a few examples of programs
     that describe these more sustainable site and building design approaches.
     The goals and policies that follow address the desired relationship between the natural
     environment, development practices, and the impacts of construction and occupation of
     built forms.
      Goal DESIGN-17        Environmental Sensitivity and Low-Impact Development
                            Principles in the Design and Construction of All Projects
      Policy DESIGN-17.1    The City will support development standards that minimize
                            environmental impacts of development through an appropriate
                            balance of regulations and incentives. Incentives could be tied to
                            compliance with criteria applied throughout the development
                            process.
      Policy DESIGN-17.2    Lighting in development projects shall include low, pedestrian
                            scaled, ornamental street lights, and shall otherwise design lighting
                            as to prevent glare and spillover onto adjacent properties and to
                            prevent any glare that could affect motorists or bicyclists.

       Strategy DESIGN-1 intersections and other locations expected to generate significant
                         pedestrian traffic in the existing City, as funding allows.
       Implementation    Where appropriate opportunities and sufficient right-of-way exists,
       Strategy DESIGN-2 the City will modify wide streets into boulevards with landscaped
                         medians or landscaped strips between the roadway and sidewalks
                         to visually and functionally enhance streets for pedestrian use.
       Implementation    The City will establish design standards and parking requirements
       Strategy DESIGN-3 for accessory dwelling units.
       Implementation    The City will pursue improvements downtown that reduce effective
       Strategy DESIGN-4 Downtown street widths in relationship to building height and
                         bulk, while allowing for automobile movements. The City will
                         pursue improvements including wider sidewalks, additional
                         landscaping, and accommodating a large portion of future parking
                         demand with street, rather than surface parking. Parking
                         requirements for future development would be reduced in
                         recognition of the availability of on-street parking.

  ECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENT
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
                    INTRODUCTION
   Economic development is a priority for Riverbank citizens and decision makers alike. The
   City wishes to encourage business development that will not only serve the growing
   demand for local services created by new households, but also link with burgeoning
   economic activity within Stanislaus County and the region. At its core, economic
   development is about planning for a community where businesses can thrive and attract
   wealth, provide jobs and income growth for local residents, generate revenue for local
   government, and revitalize older neighborhoods. It is within this general context that
   economic development policy is treated in this Element.
   The ability of the City to meet its economic development objectives depend on regional
   market forces that are outside of the City’s direct control. However, the City does have
   control over how to position itself as a place to do business. This includes targeting the
   types of businesses that the community wants to attract and retain, ensuring that
   resources are available for the labor force to improve its occupational skills, and creating a
   business climate that make the community attractive for the right type of businesses to
   locate and expand. By targeting business attraction, improving the labor force, and
   optimizing the business climate, a community positions itself to attract and retain
   businesses that serve markets beyond its own borders and bring higher paying jobs into
   the community.
   Economic development is also about serving local needs. In general, population growth
   increases the level of disposable household income and stimulates demand for new local-
   serving businesses such as commercial retail and services. The City needs to plan
   commercial areas that can meet the needs of businesses that will serve the local
   population.
   In addition to accommodating growth and attracting new businesses, successful economic
   development also requires a consensus about the needs of growing businesses, community
   values, and the type of community in which people want to live. The City, by making the
   community attractive as a place to live for creative and skilled residents, will, in turn, create
   opportunities for economic growth.
   The implementation of this General Plan will ensure that Riverbank is in a position to
   benefit from the economic opportunities that will become available to the community as it
   grows. While many economic forces are outside the realm of local control, the City’s
   strategic approach to economic development will allow City staff and decision makers to
                                                                                                 ED-1

                                                         ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
     focus on the types of businesses that can thrive in Riverbank and contribute to the
     community’s character and collective vision.
Key Issues
     During the 1990s and early 2000s, the residential population of Riverbank increased
     substantially, and was not matched by job growth and business development. In many
     ways, Riverbank reflects much of the Central Valley economy, which is still evolving and
     diversifying from its historical ties to the agricultural industries. In recent years, two major
     employers in Riverbank have closed – the California Fruit & Tomato Kitchen cannery and
     the Riverbank Army Munitions plant. While these closures represent a large loss of jobs,
     they also present new opportunities as the City considers reuse options for both sites.
     These projects exemplify the challenges that face Riverbank as its economy evolves away
     from its traditional base industries.
Diversifying the Economic Base and Adapting to Economic Transition
     Riverbank has an existing base of food processing and durable manufacturing industries,
     but future growth opportunities will need to include other types of industries that are most
     likely to create new employment opportunities in the near future. The California
     Employment Development Department employment projections for Stanislaus County
     estimate that the highest growth rates will occur in the following industries:
        Transportation, warehousing, and utilities
        Construction, natural resources, and mining
        Retail trade
        Information
        Financial activities
        Educational services
        Health services
        Arts, entertainment, and recreation
     These industries are each projected to exceed the 1.5 percent annual growth rate projected
     for Stanislaus County as a whole, and represent the most promising near-term regional
     growth opportunities for the City. These businesses also create potential growth
     opportunities for business support services and other industries that create supplier
     relationships with these industries.
     Other industry sectors that are projected to grow at a lower rate than the countywide rate
     include the following:
      Manufacturing
      Food services
      State and local government
ED-2

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
      It should be noted that food processing is projected to lose jobs through 2012, and while
      durable manufacturing will gain employment, its projected growth rate is slightly below
      the overall employment growth rate.
      Health services in particular have seen some major facility expansions in Stanislaus and San
      Joaquin counties. Historically, these areas have served growing and aging local
      populations, as well as residents from the nearby foothill counties. Health services also
      create growth opportunities for a variety of support industries, including medical
      laboratories and pharmaceutical suppliers, uniform suppliers, building maintenance
      personnel, and other types.
      Much of the Stanislaus County economy will continue to reflect the historic importance of
      agricultural production. Riverbank can continue to diversify its economy while also
      accommodating agricultural support service expansion. Agricultural support services can
      include industries projected for above-average growth in Stanislaus County, such as
      transportation and warehousing activities.
      Previous retail studies of Riverbank identified market gaps in regional retail categories such
      as general merchandise, drug stores. Recently developed retail centers with discount store
      and drug store anchor tenants have addressed these previous market shortfalls and begun
      to reposition Riverbank into a regional retail provider that attracts shoppers from
      neighboring communities, such as Oakdale and north Modesto. Many of the city’s newer
      retail stores are oriented to Latino/Hispanic shoppers, which represent a sizable and
      growing market in Riverbank and surrounding communities.
      Riverbank has an emerging base of arts and cultural activities. Local organizations include
      the Valley Arts Association, Rio Arts and the Riverbank Community Theater. The community
      also hosts an increasing number of ongoing events, and has dedicated $1 million in public
      funds towards the development of the Del Rio Theater performing arts center. This activity
      ties in with regional market support for other opportunities with entertainment and
      recreational uses.
Relatively High Unemployment Rate and Stagnant Income Growth
      Compared to neighboring communities and Stanislaus County as a whole, Riverbank has a
      higher unemployment rate. In addition, the primary job types in Riverbank have not shown
      income growth in recent times.
      By contrast, the household incomes have continued to grow at a higher rate than
      neighboring communities. Some of this is due to the growing commute rate in which an
      increasing number of Riverbank residents work in higher paying jobs located outside of
      Stanislaus County. This indicates that Riverbank is attracting an increasing affluent
      residential population, even as the jobs created in the community have not shown income
      growth and continue to leave a significant portion of the labor force behind. There may be
      opportunities created by these new residents, who may wish to start up businesses in
      Riverbank.
                                                                                                 ED-3

                                                      ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
Increasing the Employment and Income Base
     In order to increase the employment and income base, the City needs to continue its
     ongoing proactive efforts with business attraction, business retention and expansion, and
     labor force development. These activities need to continue and focus on a targeted
     approach to business attraction, and further develop the skills base for the local labor
     force.
Strengthening the Existing Business Base and Retaining Jobs
     Riverbank has strengthened its business base with new regional retail stores, but has had
     some recent job losses with major facility closures. The City needs to strengthen its
     prominent and growing industries since business expansion and retention are generally the
     best sources for job and income growth.
Consider Fiscal Impacts of Development Plans
     As Riverbank grows, much of its recent development activity has been with new housing,
     which typically places greater demand on public services compared to commercial and
     industrial development. The City needs to consider the fiscal trade offs associated with
     different types of development, and consider these factors during the development
     approval process.
Continuity with Ongoing Economic Development Activities
     The City of Riverbank has dedicated staff resources to economic development and has a
     recent history of actively engaging in economic development activities. These activities have
     included the following:
      Formation of a redevelopment agency and project area
      Dedicating City staff resources to business attraction and retention activities
      Implementation of a downtown revitalization plan
      Enterprise Zone designation
      Participation in regional economic development activities with agencies such as the
         Stanislaus Alliance

                      opportunities resulting from new residents that commute into the
                      Bay Area for work. These commuters add to the labor force
                      capacity for Riverbank and should be considered potential
                      resources for new business formation in Riverbank.

                  with a focus on retaining those businesses that are significant
                  sources for jobs and/or tax revenue for the City.
    Policy ED-3.2 Business retention activities will include exploring opportunities for
                  local business expansion. These opportunities include the following:
                   Businesses looking to expand within their existing space
                   Businesses seeking to relocate to a different location
                   Businesses that want to add an additional location
    Policy ED-3.3 Existing industries in Riverbank and Stanislaus County will be
                  strengthened by exploring business attraction opportunities for
                  comparable businesses that can create supplier relationships and
                  clustered industry activity where businesses benefit from operating
                  in close proximity to their clients.
    Goal ED-4     Increase opportunities for income growth among Riverbank
                  residents
    Policy ED-4.1 The City will focus business attraction and retention strategies
                  towards economic sectors that create advancement opportunities
                  (i.e., “career ladders”) for the labor force
    Policy ED-4.2 The City will identify the higher paying occupations and economic
                  sectors outside of Riverbank that attract their labor force from
                  Riverbank residents. The City will explore opportunities for bringing
                  that type of economic activity to Riverbank.
    Policy ED-4.3 The City will continue to support an education and training system
                  that continually increases the productivity of area workers to offset
                  wage increases.
                                                                                      ED-7

                      business climate shortcomings identified through outreach and
                      communication with local businesses.
     Policy ED-5.3    The City will encourage the formation of business district
                      committees that address specific business climate issues for
                      Riverbank as a whole, and within specific areas within the
                      community. Where appropriate, use these committee processes to
                      assess the potential for Business Improvement District formation.
     Policy ED-5.4    The City will identify programs and projects that can be funded
                      through redevelopment actions that help improve business

     AGRICULTURE AND SUPPORT INDUSTRIES
     Policy ED-6.1    Acknowledging the significant agricultural economy in Stanislaus
                      County, the City will continue to accommodate industries that serve

                      farming activity in Stanislaus and San Joaquin counties.
     VISITOR-SERVING
     Policy ED-6.2    The City will continue to explore potential opportunities for lodging
                      establishments in Riverbank. The new lodging would serve tourists
                      passing through Riverbank en route to Yosemite, and
                      accommodate other needs, such as business travel and local
                      visitors.
     Policy ED-6.3    The City will continue to participate in regional efforts to enhance
                      and expand upon Stanislaus County’s tourism trade. Riverbank

                      durable manufacturing industries. Even though this sector is
                      projected to continue growing within Stanislaus County, the City
                      should continue to be open to other sources of business growth
                      such as global trade.
    INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND HOME-BASED BUSINESSES

                      relocate these spurs.
    Policy ED-6.10    As part of its ongoing economic development programs, the City
                      will actively pursue business development opportunities related to
                      transportation and distribution activities as these activities continue
                      to growth throughout Stanislaus and San Joaquin counties.

                        opportunities with professional offices and similar service
                        establishments. Potential sites for these types of businesses would
                        include existing pedestrian-oriented areas such as downtown
                        Riverbank, and areas being considered for reconfiguration into a
                        more pedestrian-friendly alignment, such as Patterson Road.
      Goal ED-7         Continue to increase Riverbank’s base of regional commercial

                        patrons from surrounding communities and other visitors. These
                        uses would potentially include performing arts and indoor
                        recreational facilities.
      Policy ED-7.3     The City will pursue locally-oriented commercial uses that are
                        currently underserved in Riverbank, and expand upon the existing
                        base of local-serving retail and service establishments as population
                        increases create additional market demand.

      Policy ED-8.1     The City will continue to promote downtown Riverbank as a vibrant
                        and pedestrian-oriented center for local-serving business activity,

                     business recruitment, participating in regional economic
                     development initiatives, coordinating with regional labor force
                     development agencies, promoting Riverbank as a business location,
                     coordinating funding resources including redevelopment programs,
                     business outreach, and participation with local business
                     associations.
      Implementation Continue to identify funding resources, and apply for those
      Strategy ED-2  resources for which the City of Riverbank qualifies. The City is
                     already active in the State CDBG program, and other outside

      Implementation Continue to leverage redevelopment funds to develop programs
      Strategy ED-3  and initiatives that improve the physical environment and business
                     climate within the project area. Since the redevelopment project
                     area was established in 2005, redevelopment funds have been
                     allocated towards property acquisition and downtown streetscape
                     improvements. Other potential activities can include programs for
                     façade improvements; grants to property or business owners; and
                     new projects in the Riverbank Industrial Complex, along the
                     Patterson corridor, or at the former California Fruit & Tomato

                   in terms of how well they respond to the needs of local businesses
                   and the degree to which they improve the employment prospects
                   and skill sets for participating workers.
    Implementation Identify opportunities to locate job training sites in Riverbank. Most
    Strategy ED-5  of the existing job training and business assistance resources are
                   based in Modesto. If a major facility development or expansion can
                   be attracted to Riverbank, opportunities should be explored to base
                   any resultant job training activities within Riverbank.
    Implementation Implement a business outreach program that identifies home-based
    Strategy ED-6  businesses operating in Riverbank. With the home-based businesses
                   identified, keep them informed on business assistance resources
                   available to Riverbank business owners and available spaces for
                   future expansion. Use the information collected from this outreach
                   process to identify businesses engaged in high-value added
                   activities that could serve as future job creation. Also use the
                   outreach process to ensure that businesses that generate sales tax
                   revenue are designating Riverbank as the point-of-sale location.
    Implementation Implement a business outreach program that prioritizes businesses
    Strategy ED-7  and/or industry sectors that constitute the most prominent sources
                   for jobs and fiscal revenue in Riverbank. The outreach entails
                   making initial contact with the local facility manager, and where
                   applicable, making higher level corporate contacts. The outreach
                   process would identify business climate issues, and future plans for
                   the business, allowing time for the City to respond. Also use the
                   outreach process to ensure that businesses that generate sales tax
                   revenue are designating Riverbank as the point-of-sale location.
    Implementation Assign City staff and personnel from appropriate agencies to a
    Strategy ED-8  “rapid response” team that will respond to changes in the job
                   training and workforce development needs for large employers in
                   Riverbank. A rapid response approach entails having a designated
                   team of city officials, and representatives from regional workforce
                   development, business retention, and other agencies available to
                   respond quickly in case of a major event that affects the local labor
                   force, such as a large employer coming to or leaving Riverbank, a
                   significant facility expansion, or a change in facility operations that
                   necessitates retraining the existing workforce.
                                                                                       ED-13

                                               ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
      Implementation As part of a targeted business attraction program, the City will
      Strategy ED-9  develop specific marketing messages for different industry sectors,
                     based on Riverbank’s strengths, market position, and future growth
                     opportunities. Local-serving sectors would focus on the housing
                     growth and rising household incomes in Riverbank. Export-oriented
                     industry prospects would focus on available sites, the attributes of
                     the local workforce, and growth prospects from Riverbank’s
                     proximity to regional economic centers.
      Implementation Refine business attraction targets to include business-to-business
      Strategy ED-10 suppliers. Business suppliers would potentially include material
                     distributors, service providers, and component manufacturing.
      Implementation Systematically track available land, and available building vacancies.
      Strategy ED-11 Continually update the information and identify the most efficient
                     and cost-effective methods for distributing the information,
                     including web-based solutions. This information should be matched
                     up with any individual business needs identified through business
                     outreach.
      Implementation As an important source of information for assessing fiscal benefits
      Strategy ED-12 from economic development activities, the City should contract
                     with a sales tax accounting firm to provide customized and
                     quarterly updated audits of the City’s sales tax receipts. The most
                     important function of this data is to track taxable sales growth by
                     industry category. It can be used to track retail store sales, as well
                     as identify nonretail businesses that generate sales tax from point-
                     of-sale transactions. This information would also be used to
                     prioritize the business outreach program, and provide comparison
                     data for fiscal analyses.
      Implementation Dedicate staff resources to tracking employment and payroll trends,
      Strategy ED-13 in order to monitor progress toward community goals for economic
                     development. The U.S. Census ZIP Code Business Patterns can be
                     used for tracking aggregate employment trends. In order to
                     systematically track employment by detailed industry category, the
                     City should request a custom data run from the California
                     Employment Development Department, and continue to update
                     this data on an annual basis. This EDD data will also include wage
                     and salary data, which can be used to track income growth by
                     industry.
      Implementation Implement a residential survey that includes information on where
      Strategy ED-14 Riverbank residents work and their occupations. This survey could
                     also include information about retail shopping preferences, and
                     identify opportunities for new retail store attraction in Riverbank.

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
    Implementation Facilitate the formation of business district committees, and assist
    Strategy ED-15 those districts that wish to further explore the benefits and
                   implementation steps for the creation of a Business Improvement
                   District.
    Implementation Proactively use the business outreach process to identify priorities
    Strategy ED-16 for business climate improvement, including issues such as the
                   approval process and permitting, the quality of public services,
                   infrastructure issues, public spaces, quality of life issues, labor force
                   preparedness, business costs, and the quality and cost of business
                   space. Once priorities are identified, the City can apply resources to
                   addressing any identified weaknesses.
    Implementation Include the redevelopment agency in any efforts to improve the
    Strategy ED-17 local business climate within the redevelopment district. Potential
                   programs funded through redevelopment would potentially include
                   a façade improvement program, business grants and loans;
                   streetscape, infrastructure and public facility improvements; and
                   land assembly, and gap financing for development projects.
    Implementation Initiate a hotel/lodging feasibility study to identify the types,
    Strategy ED-18 numbers, and appropriate locations of lodging facilities that
                   Riverbank could attract.
    Implementation Prioritize business attraction initiatives in the categories identified in
    Strategy ED-19 Goal ED-6. These business attraction categories include the
                   following:
                    Agricultural support industries
                    Visitor-serving sectors
                    Information technology and home-based businesses
                    Durable manufacturing
                    Transportation and distribution
                    Medical offices and medical support services
                    Other office uses
    Implementation Identify options and preferred alternatives for rail spur locations and
    Strategy ED-20 potential relocations, particularly as they pertain to the reuse of the
                   Riverbank Army Munitions site.
                                                                                         ED-15

                                                 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
      Implementation Initiate a retail leakage study in order to identify retail and other
      Strategy ED-21 local-serving attraction opportunities that remain, and project the
                     future growth in household retail demand and supportable
                     establishments. This study would be conducted after completion of
                     a full audit of the sales tax data.
      Implementation Initiate a feasibility study that identifies market opportunities for
      Strategy ED-22 entertainment and recreational uses in Riverbank, particularly as
                     they apply to creating an arts district in downtown Riverbank.
      Implementation Continue to identify and procure the necessary funding to fully
      Strategy ED-23 implement the streetscape improvement plans identified in the
                     Downtown Revitalization Plan, and continue to work with state
                     agencies to implement the pedestrian-oriented streetscape for
                     Patterson Road as identified in the State Route 108
                     Pedestrian/Bicycle Enhancement Plan.
      Implementation Continue to facilitate special events in downtown Riverbank.
      Strategy ED-24
      Implementation Initiate a fiscal impact analysis that identifies fiscal costs and
      Strategy ED-25 benefits associated with specific types of development.
      Implementation Identify options such as Zoning Code changes, corridor planning for
      Strategy ED-26 older commercial areas, and specific plans for new growth areas
                     that would implement and promote mixed use development. This
                     type of development would be appropriate to taking advantage of
                     future opportunities with office uses.
      Implementation Prepare an urban design plan for downtown Riverbank to
      Strategy ED-27 complement business attraction, redevelopment strategies, and
                     streetscape improvements.
      Implementation Continue to network with regional agencies as part of the City’s
      Strategy ED-28 economic development program, and include Latino/Hispanic
                     business organizations as part of this strategy.

CONSERVATION AND
   OPEN SPACE
CONSERVATION AND OPEN SPACE
                     INTRODUCTION
   This Element addresses topics related to two mandatory General Plan Elements. A General
   Plan Conservation Element broadly addresses the conservation, development, and use of
   natural resources. The types of resources involved include water, forests, soils, fisheries,
   wildlife, minerals, and others. Government Code Section 65563 requires a city of county to
   have an adopted Open Space Element for the "comprehensive and long-range preservation
   and conservation of open-space land within its jurisdiction." Open space is a broad term,
   which means different things to different people. However, in a General Plan, open-space
   lands are defined in Government Code Section 65560(b) as lands for:
     The preservation of natural resources;
     The managed production of resources;
     Outdoor recreation;
     Public health and safety;
     Support of the mission of military installations; or,
     Protection of cultural resources.
   The required topics for open space and conservation, as outlined in the Government Code,
   are addressed in this one Element, to the extent they apply to the Riverbank Planning Area.
   Please refer to the Background Reports prepared to support the General Plan, which include
   reports and maps addressing Air Quality, Biological Resources, Cultural Resources, Geology
   and Soils, Hydrology and Water Quality, Land Use (which includes agricultural resources),
   Mineral Resources, and others. The General Plan Background Reports are a part of the
   Riverbank General Plan, but are provided under separate cover for ease of reference. Open
   space for the purpose of recreation is addressed in the Land Use Element and the Public
   Services and Facilities Element, as is water supply. Policies concerning open space for public
   health and safety are also included in the Safety Element. Issues related to air quality are
   addressed in the Air Quality Element.
   The Land Use Element includes a Land Use Diagram that identifies various types of open
   spaces designated to be free of urban development (Agricultural Resource Conservation
   Area and Buffer/Greenway/Open Space) or to be provided for recreation and enjoyment (in
   the case of parkland and parkways) or management of flood waters (Multi-Use Recreation
   and Resource Management). Open space is addressed in other ways in the Land Use
   Element, including policies that promote conservation of resources. Please refer to the Land
   Use Element of the General Plan for more information. In addition to the Land Use
   Diagram, information throughout this General Plan Policy Document and the supporting
   Background Reports identify areas with natural features or other characteristics making such
                                                                                             CONS-1

                                                             CONSERVATION AND OPEN SPACE
           lands appropriate for inclusion in Riverbank’s overall inventory of open space lands. Taken
           together, the General Plan Background Reports, various elements of the General Plan, and
           the policy diagrams address all state law-required topics for open space and conservation
           relevant for Riverbank.
Key Issues
           Preservation of open land is one way to achieve open space and natural resource
           conservation goals. In fact, for many open space and conservation goals, protecting natural
           features and resources through planning and site design is by far the most effective
           approach. Urban development patterns play an extremely important role in this
           preservation. With more efficient use of land in cities, there is more open space available
           outside of cities for permanent land preservation. For many reasons, however, recent urban
           growth has been land inefficient.1 Most quickly growing areas in the country convert open
           land to urban use at a much greater rate than population growth. In fact, for the nation as
           a whole, land consumption occurred at more than twice the rate of population growth
           between 1982 and 1997.23
           Compared to typical low-density development patterns, compact growth preserves more
           open land and natural resource areas. Roads are narrower, excessive surface parking is
           reduced, some back yards are smaller, and land is generally used more efficiently. There are
           fewer miles of roadways, water lines, sewer lines, and consequently more efficient public
           service and infrastructure delivery with compact growth. This reduces use of resources of all
           types and reduces the long-term expense to taxpayers. Shorter trips and trips on foot, by
           bicycle, and via transit are possible with compact growth patterns, thus reducing the use of
           fossil fuel resources and conserving air quality. Compact growth is a fundamental strategy
           employed throughout this General Plan to achieve open space, conservation, and other
           environmental, social, and economic goals. But, this Element also includes other strategies
           to achieve the community’s goals, including those related to methods, materials, and
           timing for both development and conservation efforts.
           Through extensive public outreach, decision maker and staff direction, and comprehensive
           data collection and analysis, the City has identified a few key issues that relate specifically to
           the Open Space and Conservation Element.
           Riverbank’s population has grown rapidly in the last 20 years. Homebuilding has converted
           orchard lands and other valuable open spaces and natural resources urban use. There are a
           variety of concerns among the public regarding the rate and amount of recent growth.
1
  Aspects of land inefficient development include, but are not limited to: high land consumption; fragmented open space lacking
biological, agricultural, and other use value; low residential population densities; dependence on automobile travel; higher service and
infrastructure costs; lack of housing choices for many households; and, overparked commercial buildings and unnecessarily large
amounts of impervious surfaces, including roads.

CONS-2

CONSERVATION AND OPEN SPACE
   Citizens have suggested managing future growth to avoid unnecessary use of resources and
   conversion of open space lands.
   Other key issues deal with rare plants and animals with the potential to occur within the
   Planning Area. Wetlands and riparian areas are often supportive of such species. There are
   isolated wetlands in the Riverbank Planning Area, as well as wetlands and riparian habitat
   associated with the Stanislaus River. The Stanislaus River corridor is an excellent example of
   the overlap of issues typically addressed in an open space element and conservation
   element. This area is the most important area for sensitive habitat and wildlife in the
   Riverbank Planning Area. But it is also an area with fertile agricultural land, important
   surface water quality considerations, scenic views, recreation potential, areas prone to
   flooding, areas associated with groundwater recharge, and even mineral deposits. In
   general, areas along the Stanislaus River are the most important natural open spaces in the
   Riverbank Planning Area.
   Other key issues for Riverbank include groundwater depressions and groundwater pollution;
   loss of agricultural land and the need for a regional approach to preservation; and, cultural
   and historic resources associated with the river, the railroad, and oriented around historic
   downtown Riverbank.
Goals, Policies, and Implementation
Strategies
   Goals, policies, and implementation strategies in this section address various aspects of
   open space preservation and provision, and conservation of resources during buildout of
   the Riverbank General Plan.
    Goal CONS-1             Maintain Riverbank’s Historic Resources
    Policy CONS-1.1         Historically significant buildings shall not be demolished or changed
                            in way that affects their historic value, except to protect public health
                            and safety, or where saving the structure is infeasible.
    Policy CONS-1.2         Buildings and other cultural resources that are not historically
                            significant but have historical or architectural value should be
                            preserved or relocated, wherever feasible. Where this is not feasible,
                            the resource shall be documented and the information retained in a
                            secure, but publicly accessible location. An acknowledgment of the
                            resource should be incorporated in historic signage and the reuse or
                            display of historic materials and artifacts.
                                                                                              CONS-3

                                    CONSERVATION AND OPEN SPACE
       Policy CONS-1.3 The City will promote and encourage adaptive reuse of historic
                       buildings. Consistent with health, safety, and other basic
                       considerations, the City will be flexible in applying building and
                       zoning standards to encourage continued use and adaptive reuse of
                       historic buildings.
       Policy CONS-1.4 The City shall coordinate with local, State, and federal agencies to
                       ensure that historic preservation regulations are implemented.
       Goal CONS-2     Minimize Negative Impacts to Archaeological Resources
       Policy CONS-2.1 Approved projects, plans, and subdivision requests shall incorporate
                       all available measures, with a preference for avoidance, to reduce or
                       eliminate impacts to known and unknown archaeological and
                       paleontological resources.
       Policy CONS-2.2 All Native American cultural and archaeological sites shall be
                       protected permanently from urban development, wherever possible.
       Policy CONS-2.3 The City shall restrict the circulation of cultural resource locational
                       information to prevent potential site vandalism.
       Policy CONS-2.4 The City shall not knowingly approve any public or private project
                       that may adversely affect an archaeological site without first
                       consulting with the Central California Information Center of the
                       California Historical Resources Information System (CHRIS) and, if
                       necessary, consulting with a qualified professional archaeologist
                       regarding the significance of the site. Implementation of this policy
                       shall be guided by Section 15064.5 of the State CEQA guidelines.
       Policy CONS-2.5 As guided by State law, in the event of the inadvertent discovery of
                       previously unknown archaeological sites during excavation or
                       construction, all construction affecting the site shall cease and the
                       contractor shall contact the appropriate City agency. If Native
                       American human remains are discovered, the City shall work with
                       local Native American representatives to ensure that the remains and
                       associated artifacts are treated in a respectful and dignified manner.
CONS-4
CONSERVATION AND OPEN SPACE
   Goal CONS-3     Support the Practice of Agriculture and the Resources Associated
                   with Farming in the Riverbank Planning Area and Beyond
   Policy CONS-3.1 The City will prepare a comprehensive Sustainable Agricultural
                   Strategy intended to conserve agricultural production in the
                   Stanislaus River Watershed, herein defined as the area within
                   Stanislaus County and San Joaquin County between the Tuolumne
                   and Calaveras Rivers, attributable to implementation of the 2025
                   General Plan. This strategy should provide flexibility so that it can be
                   tied to land-use and regional agricultural preservation policies, and is
                   intended to be funded on a fair-share basis by those projects that
                   have a significant impact on the conversion of Important Farmlands,
                   a non-renewable resource, to urban use. In determining a level of
                   significance, it is the intent of the City to use quantifiable,
                   measurable inputs and if a project has a significant impact on
                   Farmland resources, then the project will mitigate for this impact.
   Policy CONS-3.2 Ongoing agricultural practices on fertile lands in the western portion
                   of the Riverbank Planning Area shall be protected from
                   encroachment of urban use through the use of buffers. The buffers
                   should also protect residential development from the effects of
                   existing agricultural operations. The buffer shall be designed to
                   protect the feasibility of ongoing agricultural activities on nearby
                   lands and reduce the effects of noise, dust and the application of
                   agricultural chemicals on residential development. The width of the
                   buffer shall be 300 feet, except that the width of the buffer may be
                   reduced where a project applicant demonstrates that a narrower
                   buffer would protect the feasibility of ongoing agricultural activities
                   on nearby lands and reduce the effects of noise, dust and the
                   application of agricultural chemicals on residential development.
                   Buffer areas may remain as open space or may be used for
                   stormwater management; renewable energy production; community
                   recreation amenities; or any other allowed use consistent with this
                   policy.
   Goal CONS-4     Preserve Habitat Associated with the Stanislaus River While

   Policy CONS-4.1 Approved projects, plans, and subdivisions shall avoid conversion of
                   habitat within the existing Stanislaus River riparian corridor, including
                   Great Valley Mixed Riparian Forest, Great Valley Willow Scrub, and
                   Riparian Scrub areas, and shall preserve an open space buffer along
                   the Stanislaus River and associated riparian areas. The open space
                   buffer shall be designed to avoid impacts to habitat and special
                   status species in the riparian corridor, as specified in Policy CONS
                                                                                      CONS-5

                       and open space buffer shall be provided through a permanent
                       covenant, such as a conservation easement and shall also include an
                       ongoing maintenance agreement with a land trust or other qualified
                       nonprofit organization. The preservation of the riparian corridor and
                       ongoing maintenance agreement is required prior to City approval of
                       any subdivision of property or development project located in areas

                       that impacts to these sensitive habitats are avoided or fully mitigated
                       by demonstrating no net loss of habitat functions or value. Urban
                       development shall not be allowed in this buffer area.
       Policy CONS-4.2 Approved projects, plans, and subdivisions shall provide for
                       collection, conveyance, treatment, detention, and other stormwater

                   For projects that would affect the function and value of river, stream,
                   lake, pond, or wetland features, each of these features shall be
                   delineated. For wetlands, the delineation shall be conducted in
                   accordance with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Wetland
                   Delineation Manual and verified by USACE. The project applicant
                   shall determine the exact acreage of important habitat (including
                   those protected by federal, state, regional, and/or local regulations)
                   that would be impacted by project implementation. A mitigation

                   status species, their habitats, or movement corridors, or result in the
                   fragmentation of their habitats, a Biological Inventory Report shall be
                   prepared by a qualified biologist, to determine if, and to what extent
                   special-status species and their habitat may be affected by a
                   proposed project. Projects shall be designed to avoid disturbance or
                   fragmentation of important habitats and wildlife movement
                   corridors. For projects where avoidance is not possible, the project
                   applicant shall be required to fully mitigate the effects the
                   development on special-status species, and the loss and/or
                   fragmentation of their habitat.
   Policy CONS-5.7 A mitigation plan shall be prepared and reviewed and approved by
                   the appropriate regulatory agencies for projects where avoidance of
                   adverse effects to special-status species is not feasible, and
                   authorization for take of listed species shall be obtained, if necessary.
                   The mitigation plan shall include measures to minimize potential for
                   effects during project construction (e.g., pre-construction surveys
                   and timing of construction) and measures to compensate for loss of
                   special-status species habitat. Loss of Swainson’s hawk foraging

Implementation Strategies
   Implementation  Development projects and subdivisions will be consistent with, and
   Strategy CONS-1 implement land use planning and greenhouse gas emission
                   reduction measures developed pursuant to the regional Sustainable
                   Community Strategy (per SB 375 of 2008), and consistent with
                   Countywide and regional agricultural preservation planning, to the
                   maximum extent feasible. In determining feasibility, there is a
                   recognized need to balance the importance of agricultural resource
                   conservation with other needs of Riverbank, such as State defined
                   affordable housing, air quality, noise, water usage, and other public
                   resources and services.
                   It is the City’s intent to gather and consider the best practically
                   available scientific information regarding resource areas and
                   farmland in the region and develop conservation measures that will
                   ensure the viability of agriculture within the Stanislaus River
                   Watershed. Riverbank’s planning effort will include provisions for the
                   conservation of Important Farmland (as defined by the State
                   Department of Conservation). It is a goal of the City to promote
                   advances in crop yields, marketability of locally produced agricultural
                   products, and advances in labor productivity through education.
                   The information gathered will be used as inputs within Land
                   Evaluation and Site Assessment (LESA) system. LESA is a point-based
                   approach that is generally used for rating the relative value of
                   agricultural land resources. In basic terms, a given LESA model is
                   created by defining and measuring two separate sets of factors. The
                   first set, Land Evaluation, includes factors that measure the inherent
                   soil based qualities of land as they relate to agricultural suitability.
                   The second set, Site Assessment, includes factors that are intended
                   to measure social, economic, and geographic attributes that also
                   contribute to the overall value of agricultural land. While this dual
                   rating approach is common to all LESA models, the individual land
                   evaluation and site assessment factors that are ultimately utilized
                   and measured can vary considerably, and can be selected to meet
                   the needs and conditions of the Stanislaus River Watershed. In short,
                   the LESA methodology lends itself well to adaptation and
                   customization by the City in determining the level of significance of a
                   project within the Stanislaus River Watershed.
                   It is the City’s intent to use and potentially modify the Land
                   Evaluation and Site Assessment (LESA), as amended, developed by
                   the State Department of Conservation, when considering if a project
                   will have a significant impact upon farmland resources.
                   The LESA Model is used to assess the relative quality of agricultural
                                                                                    CONS-11

                      CONSERVATION AND OPEN SPACE
        land based upon specific measurable features. The formulation of
        the LESA Model is the result of Senate Bill 850 (Chapter 812/1993),
        which charges the Resources Agency, in consultation with the
        Governor’s Office of Planning and Research, with developing an
        amendment to Appendix G of the California Environmental Quality
        Act (CEQA) Guidelines concerning agricultural lands. Such an
        amendment is intended “to provide lead agencies with an optional
        methodology to ensure that significant effects on the environment
        of agricultural land conversions are quantitatively and consistently
        considered in the environmental review process” (Public Resources
        Code Section 21095).
        The California Agricultural LESA Model is composed of six different
        factors. Two Land Evaluation factors are based upon measures of soil
        resource quality. Four Site Assessment factors provide measures of a
        given project’s size, water resource availability, surrounding
        agricultural lands, and surrounding protected resource lands.
        For a given project, each of these factors is separately rated on a 100
        point scale. The factors are then weighted relative to one another
        and combined, resulting in a single numeric score for a given project,
        with a maximum attainable score of 100 points. It is this project
        score that becomes the basis for making a determination of a
        project’s potential significance, based upon a range of established
        scoring thresholds. If a project is deemed to have significant impact,
        then a project shall be responsible for mitigating this impact via
        applicable components of the Sustainable Agricultural Strategy.
        Projects that will lead to the conversion of agricultural land to urban
        uses, to the extent that it is considered a significant impact, will fund
        either a single component or a combination of the following
        described components on a reasonable fair-share basis. The program
        will seek to minimize the net loss of agricultural production within
        the Stanislaus River Watershed in the most feasible manner.
        The City shall develop a Sustainable Agricultural Strategy to minimize
        the agricultural production lost to urban development through
        annexation to Riverbank so that, on a regional level, there is no
        significant net loss of agricultural production within the Stanislaus
        River Watershed, to the maximum extent feasible. In determining
        feasibility, the strategy is not intended to be a sole reason why a
        project that is otherwise desired by the community is not achieved,
        but rather a reasonable strategy that balances economic, social, and
        environmental benefits of a project with the need to conserve the
        agricultural production of the Stanislaus Watershed.
        The preparation and update of the Sustainable Agricultural Strategy
        shall be overseen by a City Council selected committee. The City’s
        Sustainable Agriculture Committee will cooperate with nearby cities,
        the County, and UC Extension, the Farm Bureau, and other experts

CONSERVATION AND OPEN SPACE
                   and stakeholders. The Riverbank Sustainable Agricultural Strategy
                   should be adaptable with the region’s Sustainable Community
                   Strategy, pursuant to SB 375, to the maximum extent feasible, and
                   ensure that there is no significant net loss of agricultural production
                   within the Stanislaus River Watershed, which shall be defined as the
                   annual dollar value of the agricultural commodity taken out of
                   production.
                   The City’s Sustainable Agriculture Committee shall be charged with
                   developing the following components of the Sustainable Agricultural
                   Strategy:
                   1) Priority Agricultural Land Inventory Component.
                   2) Agricultural Land Conversion Component.
                   3) Agricultural Resource Conservation Component.
                   4) Agricultural Loss Mitigation Component.
                   5) Agricultural Easement Implementation Component.
                   6) Agricultural Marketing Component.
                   7) Educational Outreach Component.
                   The Committees’ final report shall be finished by April 1, 2010. The
                   City Council will consider the strategy and shall take action on the
                   strategy after completion of the report. If the City chooses to initiate
                   a Specific Plan pursuant to Section 65450 of the State Government
                   Code, prior to completion of all components of the Sustainable
                   Agricultural Strategy, then the City Council should give direction
                   upon initiation of the Specific Plan policy direction on how to include
                   and address the intent of each of the above Components as part of
                   such a Specific Plan.
   Implementation  The City will adopt a "right-to-farm" ordinance (or adopt the County’s
   Strategy CONS-2 right-to-farm ordinance, as appropriate) that informs residents of
                   ongoing agricultural practices at the edges of Riverbank and protects
                   farmers and other agriculture interests from dumping, nuisance
                   complaints, and other problems typically associated with new
                   residents on the City fringe. The City will coordinate with Stanislaus
                   County regarding the design of the County’s Right-to-Farm
                   Ordinance to develop consistency, where appropriate.

SAFETY ELEMEN
SAFETY ELEMENT
                      INTRODUCTION
    California law requires a safety element as one of the seven mandated elements of the
    General Plan. A safety element contains policies that contribute to the protection of the
    community from any unreasonable risks associated with the effects of seismically induced
    surface rupture, ground shaking, ground failure, tsunami, seiche, and dam failure; slope
    instability leading to mudslides and landslides; subsidence, liquefaction and other seismic
    hazards, flooding; and wild land and urban fires. “
    General plans are required to include mapping of known seismic and other geologic
    hazards. General Plan must also address “evacuation routes, military installations, peakload
    water supply requirements, and minimum road widths and clearances around structures, as
    those items relate to identified fire and geologic hazards” (Government Code 65302 (g)).
    Please refer to the Safety General Plan Background Report for more information. Please refer
    to the Public Services and Facilities General Plan Background Report and the Hydrology and
    Water Quality General Plan Background Report for information on water quality and supply.
    The seismic safety element was one of the first mandatory general plan elements. However,
    California law has changed over time, including combining those issues previously
    addressed in seismic safety elements to be incorporated into the safety element. Seismic
    safety is not a major issue for Riverbank, compared to other parts of California. Please refer
    to the Safety General Plan Background Report for more information.
    The following section describes goals and policies that address the pertinent safety topics
    for the City of Riverbank.
Goals and Policies
    Goals and policies presented in the following section of this Safety Element address various
    aspects of public health and safety related to buildout of the Riverbank General Plan.
                                                                                             SAFE-1

                                                                   SAFETY ELEMENT
       Goal SAFE-1     Minimize the Loss of Life and Damage to Property Natural and
                       Human-Caused Hazards
       Policy SAFE-1.1 The City will ensure that approved development projects and public
                       investments are consistent with the information provided in the
                       Stanislaus County Multi-Jurisdictional Hazard Mitigation Plan.
       Policy SAFE-1.2 The City will continue to enforce State of California Building
                       Standards Commission uniform codes, such as the California Building
                       Code and California Fire Code with adopted Fire District
                       amendments.
       Policy SAFE-1.3 The City will encourage the retrofitting of older buildings to current
                       safety standards, and require compliance to recommendations of the
                       fire and law enforcement service providers and the State Building
                       Standards Commission uniform codes in coordination with major
                       remodeling or additions.
       Policy SAFE-1.4 The City will require set backs, ignition resistant building materials, or
                       other measures to reduce exposure to potential wildfires in areas
                       designated for natural open space preservation, in coordination with
                       California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection
                       recommendations and Maintenance of Defensible Space Measures,
                       as appropriate.
       Policy SAFE-1.5 Approved plans, projects, and subdivision requests will ensure
                       adequate fire flow per City and Fire District standards. The
                       installation of automatic fire sprinklers may, at the discretion of the
                       City and the Fire Chief, allow for a reduction in the required fire flow,
                       while still complying with the California Fire Code requirements.
       Policy SAFE-1.6 The City will not allow the development of housing in the 100-year
                       floodplain, as determined by the Federal Emergency Management
                       Agency. The City may permit placement of non-residential
                       improvements within the 100-year floodplain under a very limited set
                       of circumstances. Any development project that includes structures
                       or disturbances of natural features within the 100-year floodplain
                       shall prove that the proposal does not:
                        Create danger to life and property due to increased flood heights
                           or velocities caused by excavation, fill, roads, or intended use.
                        Create difficult emergency vehicle access in times of flood.
                        Create a safety hazard due to the unexpected heights, velocity,
                           duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters
                           expected at the site.
SAFE-2

SAFETY ELEMENT
                      Create excessive costs in providing governmental services during
                         and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of
                         public facilities.
                      Interfere with the existing waterflow capacity of the floodway.
                      Substantially increase erosion and/or sedimentation.
                      Contribute to the deterioration of any watercourse or the quality
                         of water in any body of water.
    Policy SAFE-1.7  The City will require any public facilities in the 100-year flood zones
                     to be flood-proofed to a point at or above the base flood level
                     elevation from the Stanislaus River.
    Policy SAFE-1.8  The City will require that hazardous materials are used, stored,
                     transported, and disposed in a safe manner and in compliance with
                     local, State, and federal safety standards.
    Policy SAFE-1.9  Developments located on farmland or former farmland shall prepare
                     reports that analyze residual agricultural chemicals that may be
                     present on-site. Developments on such sites shall include measures
                     to remove any risk due to hazardous materials for on-site proposed
                     land uses, as well as existing and proposed land uses and users in
                     the vicinity.
    Policy SAFE-1.10 The City will review development requests and require that any
                     airborne, waterborne, windborne, and other hazardous materials
                     issues are fully disclosed, analyzed, and mitigated to ensure against
                     any risk relative to any nearby planned or existing land uses and their
                     users.
    Policy SAFE-1.11 Proposed developments located within river bluff areas and other
                     areas prone to geologic and soil limitations require a detailed
                     geotechnical study prepared by an independent qualified geologist
                     approved by the City. Approved plans, projects, and subdivision
                     requests shall incorporate measures to reduce risks identified in the
                     geotechnical study, to the City’s satisfaction.
    Policy SAFE-1.12 The City will not allow the location of water wells in areas where
                     subsidence could occur as a result or where existing potential for
                     subsidence could be increase as a result of operation of a domestic
                     water well.
                                                                                         SAFE-3

                                                                  SAFETY ELEMENT
       Goal SAFE-2     Provide Adequate Access for Emergency Response
       Policy SAFE-2.1 The City will require development and maintenance of a road system
                       that provides adequate access for emergency equipment.
       Policy SAFE-2.2 The City will consult with fire protection service providers in
                       reviewing development proposals. Development proposals will
                       include City conditions that respond to concerns of fire protection
                       service providers.
       Policy SAFE-2.3 The City will improve fire flow in existing developed areas of the City,
                       as feasible, to meet standards presented in the Public Facilities and
                       Services Element of the General Plan and relevant City Master Plans.
       Policy SAFE-2.4 The City will coordinate with the County Office of Emergency
                       Services to identify evacuation routes and operational plans to be
                       used in case of dam failure, flood disaster, and wildfire for any new
                       growth areas in addition to any updates required to serve the
                       existing developed City.
Implementation Measures
       Implementation  The City will work with the Department of the Army to ensure
       Measure SAFE-1  successful clean-up and reuse of the decommissioned Riverbank
                       Army Ammunition Plant.
       Implementation  The City will, in coordination with the County Office of Emergency
       Measure SAFE-2  Services, implement and periodically update disaster plans, including
                       the City's Emergency Operations Plan, to meet federal, State, and
                       local emergency requirements. Included in this work will be the
                       identification and planning for evacuation routes for dam failure,
                       flooding, and wildfire that may affect existing developed areas of the
                       City, as well as new growth areas.
       Implementation  The City will coordinate with public safety service providers serving
       Measure SAFE-3  the City to ensure proper training and disaster preparedness, and
                       period testing of equipment and facilities, in coordination with the
                       County Office of Emergency Services.
       Implementation  The City will work with emergency responders serving the City to
       Measure SAFE-4  support the purchase and maintenance of proper emergency
                       communication systems and equipment, and other necessary tools
                       dealing with emergencies.
SAFE-4
SAFETY ELEMENT
    Implementation The City will coordinate with emergency service responders serving
    Measure SAFE-5 the City to prepare design guidelines for development projects that
                   ensure appropriate emergency access and other requirements for
                   appropriately serving proposed development. The City will require
                   adherence to such design guidelines as a routine part of project and
                   environmental review.
    Implementation The City will update the General Plan using data to be made
    Measure SAFE-6 available by the Department of Water Resources and the Central
                   Valley Flood Protection Board. The City will update the Land Use
                   Element, Conservation and Open Space Element, Safety Element,
                   and other elements, as appropriate, to ensure adequate flood
                   protection. Flood-related revisions to the General Plan will integrate
                   data from the State Plan of Flood Control. For flood-related revisions
                   to the Safety Element, the City will consult with the Central Valley
                   Flood Protection Board and local flood protection agencies serving
                   the Planning Area, consistent with State law. Following flood-related
                   updates to the General Plan, the City will revise applicable
                   development standards, including the Zoning Code, for consistency
                   on flood protection policies. Subdivision approvals, development
                   agreements, permits, and other City entitlements will incorporate
                   these revised City policies and regulations. The City will coordinate
                   on Stanislaus County’s development of a flood emergency plan
                   following the adoption of the Central Valley Flood Protection Plan.
                                                                                     SAFE-5

NOIS
NOISE
                      INTRODUCTION
    The Noise Element provides a basis for comprehensive local policies to control and abate
    environmental noise and to protect the citizens of Riverbank from excessive noise exposure.
    Noise is commonly defined simply as unwanted sound. Noise in the community has often
    been cited as being a health problem. The health effects of noise arise from the interference
    with human activities such as sleep, conversation, and tasks demanding concentration or
    coordination.
    To measure sound directly as air pressure changes would require a very large and awkward
    range of numbers. To avoid this complexity, the decibel (dB) scale was devised. The decibel
    scale uses the hearing threshold as a point of reference, defined as zero decibels. It is
    common to describe community noise in terms of the "ambient" noise level, which is
    defined as the all-encompassing noise level associated with a given noise environment. A
    common statistical tool to measure the ambient noise level is the equivalent energy noise
    level (Leq), which is the sound level corresponding to a steady-state A-weighted sound level
    containing the same total energy as a time-varying signal over a given time period (usually
    one hour). The Leq is the foundation of other noise descriptors, and it shows a very good
    correlation with community response to noise. The two most common noise descriptors in
    use are the day-night average level (Ldn) and the Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL).
    Ldn is based upon the average hourly Leq over a 24-hour day, with a 10-decibel penalty
    applied to the nighttime Leq (10:00 pm to 7:00 am). The nighttime penalty is based upon
    the assumption that people react to nighttime noise exposures as though they were twice
    as loud as daytime exposures. CNEL is the same as the Ldn, except that an additional
    penalty of approximately 4.5 decibels (dB) is applied to the evening Leq (7:00 pm to 10:00
    pm).
    Please refer to the Noise Background Report, under separate cover, for more information.
    The Noise Element is intended to:
     Provide sufficient information so that noise may be effectively considered in the land use
        planning process;
     Develop strategies for abating excessive noise exposure through cost-effective mitigation
        measures in combination with appropriate zoning to avoid incompatible land uses;
                                                                                             NOISE-1

                                                                                            NOISE
        Protect areas where noise levels are acceptable and noise sensitive areas from excessive
          noise;
        Protect existing noise-producing agricultural, commercial, and industrial uses from
          encroachment by noise-sensitive land uses; and,
        Balance goals regarding the community’s noise environment with other environmental
          goals, economic and social goals, and goals for fiscal sustainability and balanced urban
          development, including redevelopment and revitalization.
       The contents of a Noise Element and the methods used in its preparation are specified in
       California Government Code Section 65302(f) and in "Guidelines for the Preparation and
       Content of Noise Elements of the General Plan," adopted and published by the California
       Office of Noise Control in 1976. As adopted, the Office of Noise Control Guidelines require
       that certain major noise sources and areas containing noise-sensitive land uses be identified
       and quantified by preparing generalized noise exposure contours for current and projected
       levels of activity within the community. According to Government Code Section 65302(f)
       and the Office of Noise Control Guidelines, the following major noise sources should be
       considered in the preparation of a Noise Element:
         Highways and freeways;
         Primary arterials and major local streets;
         Railroad operations;
         Aircraft and airport operations;
         Local industrial facilities; and,
         Other stationary sources.
       According to State law, noise-sensitive areas to be considered in the Noise Element should
       include areas containing the following noise-sensitive land uses:
         Schools;
         Hospitals;
         Rest homes;
         Long-term medical or mental care facilities; and,
         Other uses deemed noise-sensitive by the local jurisdiction (such as residences).

Key Issues
    As addressed in the Noise Background Report, the primary sources of noise in the Riverbank
    Planning Area include roadways, industrial operations, agricultural activities, and railroad
    operations. Noise sensitive land uses include: parks, schools, residences, and medical and
    other health care facilities.
    Certain industrial operations may relocate out of the Downtown Riverbank area during this
    General Plan update, which could result in lower ambient noise levels in certain existing
    developed areas compared to the situation today. As the City considers reuse of this land
    and other efforts to revitalize and redevelop the community, noise impacts will be
    considered and balanced with other environmental, social, and economic considerations.
    In this General Plan, the City has identified important sources of noise in the existing
    community, which include industrial and transportation facilities. The City has developed a
    strategy to avoid planning mistakes of the past, including funneling all inter- and intra-
    neighborhood vehicular traffic onto large-volume arterial roadways that divide
    neighborhoods, citing noisy industrial uses in proximity to noise-sensitive uses. In
    communities throughout California and elsewhere, outward urban growth creates problems
    for ongoing agricultural operations related to periodic noise. The City supports ongoing
    agricultural operations at the edges of urban growth and elsewhere and will prevent, through
    land use planning and through other means, any additional pressure to convert agricultural
    lands due to the urban/rural interface. Overall, the City wishes to plan intelligently as to
    reduce substantial noise problems and avoid the need for soundwalls and other reactive fixes
    that themselves create unnecessary barriers to community connectivity and cohesiveness.
Goals and Policies
    Following is a description of Riverbank’s goals, policies, and implementation strategies to
    address existing and future noise issues.
     Overarching Goal        Ensure that Noise does not Substantially Reduce the Quality of

              Policy NOISE-1.2               New growth areas shall avoid the use of large-volume, high-speed
                                             roadways within neighborhoods and instead disperse vehicular traffic
                                             onto a network of fully connected smaller roadways.

                                             or projected levels of noise from transportation, stationary sources,
                                             or agricultural operations exceeding, or estimated to exceed, levels
                                             specified in Table N-1 shall require transportation planning, traffic
                                             calming, site planning, buffering, sound insulation, or other methods
                                             to reduce noise exposure in outdoor activity areas and interior spaces
                                             to the levels specified in Table N-1.
              Policy NOISE-1.5               Soundwalls are prohibited as a method for reducing noise exposure
                                             that could be addressed through other means.
              Goal NOISE-2                   Minimize Noise Impacts Associated with Development Projects
                                             and other Land Use Change

                                                 of 3 dB Ldn or greater is considered significant and requires
                                                 mitigation to achieve allowable levels.
                                              Where existing exterior noise levels are greater than 65 dB Ldn at

  For the purposes of this Noise Element, noise-sensitive land uses include schools, hospitals, rest homes, long-term care, mental care
facilities, and residences. Outdoor activity areas are considered to be the portion of a noise-sensitive property where outdoor activities
would normally be expected (i.e., patios of residences and outdoor instructional areas of schools). Outdoor activity areas for the purposes
of this element do not include gathering spaces alongside transportation corridors or associated public rights-of-way.

    similar land uses. Outdoor activity areas are considered to be the portion of a noise-sensitive property where outdoor activities
    would normally be expected (i.e., patios of residences and outdoor instructional areas of schools). Outdoor activity areas for
    the purposes of this element do not include gathering spaces alongside transportation corridors or associated public rights-of-
    way. Where development projects or roadway improvement projects could potentially create noise impacts, an acoustical
    analysis shall be required as part of the environmental review process so that noise mitigation may be included in the project
    design. Such analysis shall be the financial responsibility of the applicant and be prepared by a qualified person experienced in
    the fields of environmental noise assessment and architectural acoustics. Mitigation strategies shall include site planning and
    design over other types of mitigation.

Implementation Strategies
     Implementation                 The City will update implementing ordinances related to noise
     Strategy NOISE-1               consistent with the policies of this element and City redevelopment
                                    and revitalization planning.
     Implementation                 The City will ensure that personnel charged with enforcing such
     Strategy NOISE-2               ordinances are properly trained and equipped for on-site
                                    measurement techniques and other necessary tasks.
     Implementation                 The City will coordinate with StanCOG and Caltrans to ensure
     Strategy NOISE-3               transportation planning and improvement programs are consistent
                                    with this element.
     Implementation                 The City will coordinate with Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad
     Strategy NOISE-4               to have installed directional warning devices at Riverbank railroad
                                    crossings that, compared to whistles mounted on trains, would
                                    reduce noise in noise sensitive areas of the community. The City will
                                    coordinate with the Railroad company to reduce or eliminate the use
                                    of horns in noise sensitive areas of the community with the
                                    installation of alternative sounding devices. These improvements will
                                    be reflected in Capital Improvements Programming.

PUBLIC SERVICES AND FACILITIES
                      INTRODUCTION
    One key element of Riverbank’s overall quality of life over the next 20 years will be the level
    of public services available to meet the needs of residents, visitors, and businesses. These
    services include public and private utilities (water, sewer, storm drainage, solid waste,
    communications, electricity, gas, etc.), parks and recreation, health care, schools, fire
    protection and law enforcement, social services, and general government. The delivery of
    services requires both construction and operation of facilities and infrastructure (buildings,
    pipelines, pump stations, equipment, treatment plants, etc.).
    Urban development anticipated under the General Plan is guided by the ability of services
    and the resources associated with those services (such as water, energy, natural areas) to
    sustain it. The City will ensure that new development provides public facilities and services
    required to serve new neighborhoods without diminishing the quality of services to current
    residents and businesses. The City will also seek to maintain and enhance the level of service
    within the existing City, including areas that experience redevelopment.
    The City is not directly responsible for providing all of the services and facilities addressed in
    this Element. However, the City will use its land use entitlement and other discretionary
    authority to ensure the needs of citizens and businesses are met during buildout of the
    General Plan.
    This Element establishes:
     Goals for service provision;
     Policies and standards used for service expansions, improvements, extensions, and other
       investments;
     General guidance on infrastructure and service planning, phasing, and financing to
       accommodate new development.
    Please refer to the Circulation Element for information on streets and related infrastructure.
    Please refer to the Public Services and Facilities Background Report, under a separate cover,
    for additional information.

Goals and Policies
       Goals, policies, and implementation strategies in this section address various aspects of
       public service and facilities during buildout of the Riverbank General Plan.
       Goal PUBLIC-1            Public Service and Infrastructure Provision to Meet or Exceed
                                Level of Service Standards Consistent with other Community
                                Goals
       Policy PUBLIC-1.1        The City will coordinate the planning and construction of capital
                                improvements with the timing of urban development within the
                                Planning Area.
       Policy PUBLIC-1.2        New development must pay for the public facilities, services, and
                                infrastructure required to serve the needs of such development
                                based on service standards applied by the City. The mechanisms for
                                such funding will be part of the development approval, or as set
                                forth in any applicable development agreement or specific plan,
                                which, with the approval of the City Council, may provide for
                                alternative financing mechanisms in-lieu of City development fee
                                programs and ordinances. The use of in-lieu fees or in-lieu financing
                                will be reserved for communitywide facilities that serve areas beyond
                                the proposed project or plan. Construction and dedication of
                                facilities will be the method for providing facilities that serve the
                                proposed project or plan area. The City may make exceptions on the
                                basis of financial hardship or small projects or plans, allowing
                                payment of an in-lieu fee.
       Policy PUBLIC-1.3        The City will require that new developments, depending on their
                                size, either: 1) designate lands in appropriate locations, sizes, and
                                free of constraints to accommodate public facilities and
                                infrastructure needed to serve such development, or 2) pay a fee
                                proportional to the development’s cost of acquiring such land at the
                                time acquisition will be required.
       Policy PUBLIC-1.4        The City shall give priority to serving areas within the existing City
                                limits as of the adoption of this General Plan based on current
                                infrastructure and service capacity. New growth proposed outside
                                existing City limits is responsible for providing, or paying a
                                proportionate share of the cost of, public facilities and infrastructure
                                adequate to serve the needs of such development according to the
                                General Plan, a specific plan (if prepared for such development),
                                and/or any infrastructure Master Plan that covers such development
                                through the use of a City-approved development agreement. The use
                                of in-lieu fees or in-lieu financing will be reserved for communitywide
                                facilities that serve areas beyond the proposed project or plan.

  A neighborhood park is generally anywhere from 2 to 10 acres in size, serves a population within a one-half mile, and should be
centrally located and pedestrian/bicycle accessible from within the neighborhood it serves. Neighborhood parks are very versatile. They
provide passive and active recreational opportunities for broad components of Riverbank’s population. Obstructions such as higher-
volume roadways and natural barriers should be taken into consideration when identifying potential park location. Community parks are
generally at least 25 or 30 acres in size and tend to be used by the entire community. Community parks accommodate organized
(league) recreational programming opportunities along with passive recreation. Linear parks are basically trails and trail systems and the
buffer space around them. Linear parks include educational signage, rest stops, or play areas that occur along the trails. Linear parks are
often designed along natural features such as a stream, river, or along human defined corridors such as railroad right of ways, canals or
power line easements. Recreational travel, as well as travel between destinations can be accommodated through planning of linear parks
that are connected with the rest of the bicycle/pedestrian network. Mini parks, also called tot lots, pocket parks, neighborhood greens,
etc., are very small park spaces with an assortment of grass play areas, benches, playground equipment, and other minor improvements.

                        INTRODUCTION
    The air we breathe is one of our most valuable natural resources. Air pollution can affect
    our health, harm the natural and built environment, damage crops, and change the earth's
    climate. Air pollution has localized, regional, and global effects. Our future climate is
    threatened and uncertain due to excessive emissions of atmospheric greenhouse gases, a
    situation that could have catastrophic impacts related to flooding, habitat suitability,
    agriculture, and the global economy. The Air Quality Element of the General Plan addresses
    the City’s goals, policies, and implementation strategies for maintaining and improving air
    quality during and after the buildout of the General Plan.
    Some air quality problems are beyond the direct control of the City or beyond the scope of
    a General Plan. However, the location of stationary sources of air pollution, such as
    industrial facilities, relative to houses, schools, and other sensitive land uses, is an important
    consideration in land use planning. There are also very important indirect air quality
    consequences of land use planning. Sprawling residential development that is not
    integrated with schools, parks, employment, shopping, and public transit encourages
    reliance on the automobile, a major source of pollution. In order to minimize automobile-
    related pollution associated with new development, more compact residential development
    must be provided in areas within walking distance of other land uses and where public
    transit is, or can be, made available.
    Compact development strategies are throughout the General Plan since the benefits of this
    approach are applicable in almost all aspects of the physical planning of the City. In
    particular, refer to the Circulation Element and the Land Use Element. Refer also to the Air
    Quality General Plan Background Report for more detail on the issues facing Riverbank.
Key Issues
    Ozone and particulate matter pollution levels in the San Joaquin Valley are among the
    worst in the nation. The total number of vehicle miles traveled (VMT) has increased at a
    higher rate than has population growth in the Valley. Despite cleaner running vehicles, this
    increased reliance on the automobile has caused in higher criteria air pollutant and
    greenhouse gas emissions, which are harmful to human and environmental health in both
    the short and long term.
                                                                                                  AIR-1

                                                                                                           AIR QUALITY
            The predominant approach to land development since World War II in the United States has
            emphasized vehicular transportation at the expense of other travel modes. While the City
            cannot control regional commuting patterns, the City can plan for a local jobs-housing
            balance and alternatives to automobile commuting (including tele-commuting) that could
            reduce work-related vehicular trips. Since the great majority of trips are not work related,
            the General Plan can make important strides for air quality by encouraging infill
            development, mixing land uses, and requiring that new development be compact, well-
            connected, and walkable. Even if households in the future choose to work elsewhere or
            employees in Riverbank live in another community, the great majority of daily trips, such as
            school trips, shopping, running errands, and recreational trips, can be by walking or
            bicycling.
            With simple land use and urban design principles, these alternative modes can be
            accommodated with the same level of consideration typically afforded to the needs of
            vehicular transportation. This General Plan represents an integration of land use and
            transportation planning so that “pedestrians and bicyclists [feel] as confident in their ability
            to travel safely in Riverbank as [do] our drivers.”1 Reducing automobile trips is the most
            important way the City can protect public and environmental health related to air quality in
            the long term.
            This Element also includes policies that focus on adequately separating people from
            industrial processes that emit toxic and hazardous emissions. The best way to reduce
            exposure to these emissions is through source reduction, but this is the responsibility of the
            local air quality management district, and by extension the State and federal Environmental
            Protection Agency. Riverbank’s primary role is to arrange land uses in a way that minimizes
            exposure, including the use and location of any arterial roadways. If properly implemented,
            the policies in this section will help minimize the health risks associated with exposure to
            toxic air contaminant and hazardous air contaminant pollutant emissions.
Goals and Policies
            Goals, policies, and implementation strategies in this section have direct and indirect air
            quality benefits, and they address a very broad range of planning and air quality issues
            facing Riverbank.

             Quality Goal                  future air quality problems, whether experienced locally,

  The term “grain” can be used to describe the degree to which land uses are mixed and the size of development blocks. “Fine grain”
development involves land uses located in proximity with one another on relatively smaller parcel or development blocks, allowing
residents and employees to walk or bicycle among different destinations to meet their daily or occasional needs without use of a private
automobile. By contrast, “course grain” development involves land uses that are isolated from one another, with non-residential land
uses typically occurring on larger parcels. This presents a situation in which residents and employees have a more difficult time traveling
among destinations except by automobile. Public transit service is less feasible because transit routes would be located at a significant
distance from potential transit users.

Implementation Strategies
            Implementation                   The City of Riverbank will develop a program to reduce daily
            Strategy AIR-1                   emissions of nitrogen oxides. Under this program, the City would
                                             require an air quality/transportation design analysis for projects
                                             exceeding Air District CEQA significance thresholds. The analysis will
                                             be prepared by an air quality specialist familiar with design measures
                                             that can reduce vehicle trips. The analysis will provide simple analysis
                                             of the daily emissions based only on the project’s land use and size.
                                             The analysis would then propose measures which would reduce
                                             operational emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) from the project by
                                             one third (33.3%) compared to this basic emissions profile. The City
                                             will develop guidance showing the air quality benefits through
                                             reduced trip generation of compact, mixed-use development. The
                                             measures would focus on reducing vehicular trips. Infill projects,
                                             small projects, affordable housing projects, and
                                             bike/pedestrian/transit projects are exempt.

                     both to new and existing developed areas. The City will monitor
                     progress toward the overall goal and periodically revise the local
                     action plan, as appropriate. Implementation of Riverbank’s
                     greenhouse gas reduction program will require the cooperation of
                     other agencies, private businesses, and residents, and will be
                     implemented over a period of several years. It is likely that, during
                     the design and monitoring period of this program, State guidance,
                     case law, and other information will become available, making
                     revisions to the reduction program appropriate. The City will monitor
                     changes in the regulatory environment, as well as grant and other
                     funding programs that could be made available to help Riverbank in
                     implementing this program.
      Implementation The City of Riverbank will vigorously pursue and use State and
      Strategy AIR-3 federal funds earmarked for bicycle and transit improvements,
                     transit-oriented planning and development, and other planning and
                     improvement grant programs intended to encourage alternatives to
                     automobile transportation.
      Implementation The City of Riverbank will proactively coordinate with local irrigation
      Strategy AIR-4 districts, the County, Caltrans, and other interested parties to
                     develop bikeways and pedestrian paths along canals, abandoned
                     railroad lines, and other easements and rights-of-way.
      Implementation The City will develop planning strategies and supportive ordinances,
      Strategy AIR-5 as necessary, addressing Downtown Riverbank and West Riverbank
                     (along Patterson Road and Callander Avenue). These areas will be
                     designated for higher-density (more than 16 units per acre, net),
                     mixed-use, pedestrian-friendly development. The City will provide a
                     variety of incentives, including but not limited to streamlined review
                     and density bonuses to entice development and redevelopment
                     within the designated infill opportunity areas.
AIR-8

AIR QUALITY
    Implementation In planning and budgeting for transportation infrastructure, before
    Strategy AIR-6 considering constructing more roadway capacity, the City of
                   Riverbank will consider measures to increase the capacity of the
                   existing road network including, but not limited to, the following:
                    Integrated and synchronized traffic signal network for major
                      thoroughfares to assure smooth-flowing traffic through
                      intersections and to minimize congestion through maintenance of
                      stable traffic flow at intersections;
                    Modify intersections using turn restrictions, channelization, etc.
                      where necessary and feasible;
                    Redirect truck traffic during peak hours (including redirection
                      away from bus routes);
                    Construct bus turnouts to remove buses from traveled lanes
                      during passenger loading and unloading; and,
                    Prohibit on-street parking during peak hours on major
                      thoroughfares and designate that space for buses only.
    Implementation The City will coordinate with transit providers on the portion of long-
    Strategy AIR-7 range transit plans serving Riverbank and accommodate necessary
                   facilities such as bus pull-outs, bus shelters, information kiosks, street
                   furniture, lighting, etc).
    Implementation The City will require project proponents to prepare health risk
    Strategy AIR-8 assessments in accordance with Air District-recommended
                   procedures as part of environmental review when the proposed
                   industrial process has associated air emissions that have been
                   designated by the State as a toxic air contaminant or, similarly, by
                   the federal government as a hazardous air pollutant. Also, the City
                   will require health risk assessments for major arterial roadways or
                   major freeways proposed near sensitive land uses and sensitive land
                   uses proposed near existing or planned major freeways. Major
                   freeways, for these purposes, are those that handle more than
                   50,000 vehicles per day. In general, the City will apply the California
                   Air Resources Board Air Quality and Land Use Handbook (California
                   Air Resources Board, 2005), and relevant updates, for
                   recommendations on siting distances for sensitive or noxious uses.
                                                                                        AIR-9

       Pollution Control District) - a county agency with authority to regulate stationary sources of
       air pollution (such as refineries, manufacturing facilities, and power plants) within a given
       county, and governed by a District Air Pollution Control Board composed of the elected
       county supervisors.
       AQAP (Air Quality Attainment Plan) - a plan prepared by a APCD/AQMD designated as a
       nonattainment area, to comply with the California Clean Air Act for purpose of meeting the
       requirements of the California Ambient Air Quality Standards.
       AQMD (Air Quality Management District) - a group of counties or portions of counties with
       authority to regulate stationary sources of air pollution within the region and governed by a
       regional air pollution control board comprised mostly of elected officials from within the
       region. An AQMD is established by state legislation. (Compare APCD)
       ARB (California Air Resources Board) - the State's lead air quality agency consisting of a
       nine-member Governor appointed board fully responsible for motor vehicle pollution
       control, and having oversight authority over California's air pollution management program.
       Areawide Sources - also known as "area" sources, these include multiple stationary emission
       sources such as water heaters, gas furnaces, fireplaces, and woodstoves. The CCAA requires
       districts to include these area sources in the AQMPs.

AIR QUALITY
    Biogenic - produced by living organisms.
    CAAQS (California Ambient Air Quality Standards) – specified concentrations and durations
    of air pollutants, recommended by the California Department of Health Services and
    adopted into regulation by the Air Resources Board, which relate the intensity and
    composition of air pollution to undesirable effects. CAAQS are the standard which must be
    met per the requirements of the California Clean Air Act.
    CCAA (California Clean Air Act) - a California law passed in 1988 which provides the basis
    for air quality planning and regulation independent of Federal regulations, and which
    establishes new authority for attaining and maintaining California's air quality standards by
    the earliest practicable date. A major element of the Act is the requirement that local
    APCDs/AQMDs in violation of the CAAQS must prepare attainment plans which identify air
    quality problems, causes, trends, and actions to be taken for attainment.
    CEQA (California Environmental Quality Act) - a state law intended to protect the
    environment of California. It is codified in Sections 21000 through 21177 of the Public
    Resources Code. CEQA establishes mandatory ways by which governmental (public agency)
    decision makers are informed about the potential significant environmental effects of
    proposed projects. CEQA also mandates the identification of ways to avoid or significantly
    reduce damage to the environment. After preliminary review or the completion of an Initial
    Study, the lead agency may decide to prepare an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for a
    project. An EIR is an informational document used to inform public agency decision-makers
    and the public of the significant effects of a project. The EIR also identifies possible ways to
    eliminate or minimize the significant effects and describes reasonable alternatives to the
    project. Both alternatives and mitigation measures must be discussed in the EIR.
    CO (Carbon Monoxide) - a colorless, odorless gas resulting from the incomplete combustion
    of fossil fuels. Over 80% of the CO emitted in urban areas is contributed by motor vehicles.
    CO interferes with the blood's ability to carry oxygen to the body's tissues and results in
    numerous adverse health effects. CO is a criteria air pollutant.
    CO2 (Carbon Dioxide) - a colorless, odorless, gas that occurs naturally in the earth's
    atmosphere. Significant quantities are also emitted into the air by fossil fuel combustion.
    Emissions of CO2 have been implicated with increasing the greenhouse effect.
    Concentration - the amount of an air pollutant present in a unit sample, usually measured
    in parts per million (ppm) or micrograms per cubic meter (ug/m3).
    Criteria Air Pollutant - an air pollutant for which acceptable levels of exposure can be
    determined and for which a Federal or State Ambient Air Quality Standard has been set.
    Examples include: Ozone, Carbon Monoxide, Nitrogen Dioxide, Sulfur Dioxide, and PM10
    (see individual pollutant definitions).
    EPA (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency) - the Federal agency charged with setting
    policy and guidelines, and carrying out legal mandates for the protection of national
    interests in environmental resources.

       Greenhouse Effect - the warming effect of the earth's atmosphere on the earth. Light
       energy from the sun which passes through the earth's atmosphere is absorbed by the
       earth's surface and re-radiated into the atmosphere as energy. The heat is then trapped by
       the air, creating a situation similar to that which occurs in a greenhouse.
       FCAA (Federal Clean Air Act) - Federal law passed in 1970 and amended in 1977 and 1990
       which sets primary and secondary National Ambient Air Quality Standards for major air
       pollutants and thus forms the basis for the national air pollution control effort.
       Hydrocarbon (HC) - any of a large number of compounds containing various combinations
       of hydrogen and carbon atoms. They may be emitted into the air as a result of fossil fuel
       combustion and fuel volatilization, and are a major contributor to smog.
       ISR (Indirect Source Review) - a rule or regulation that governs entities such as stationary
       facilities, buildings, structures, properties, and/or roads which, through their construction to
       operation, indirectly contributes to air pollution. This includes projects and facilities that
       attract or generate mobile sources activity (autos and trucks) such as shopping centers,
       employment sites, schools, and housing developments, that results in the emissions of any
       regulated pollutant. In June 2005, the proposed rule changed the name from ISR to
       DESIGN, which stands for Decreasing Emissions’ Significant Impact from Growth and New
       development.
       Land Use Pattern - refers to the distribution of land uses in a geographic area. It includes
       factors such as the density of population, housing, and jobs, and the mix of uses (proximity
       of housing, commercial, industrial, public facilities to one another). The general plan
       represents the community's vision of its future land use pattern.
       Mobile Sources - sources of air pollution such as automobiles, motorcycles, trucks, off-road
       vehicles, boats, and airplanes. (Contrast with stationary sources)
       Monitoring - the periodic or continuous sampling and analysis of air pollutants in ambient
       air or from individual pollutant sources. NAAQS (National Ambient Air Quality Standards) -
       are standards set by the Federal EPA for the maximum levels of air pollutants which can
       exist in the ambient air without unacceptable effects on human health or the public
       welfare.
       Nonattainment Area - an area identified by the EPA and/or ARB as not meeting either
       NAAQS or CAAQS standards for a given pollutant.
       Ozone (O3) - a pungent, pale, blue, reactive toxic gas consisting of three oxygen atoms. It is
       a product of the photochemical process involving the sun's energy. Ozone exists in the
       ozone layer as well as at the earth's surface. Ozone at the earth's surface causes numerous
       adverse health effects and is a criteria air pollutant. It is a major component of smog.
       Ozone Precursors - compounds such as hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen, occurring
       either naturally or as a result of human activities, which contribute to the formation of
       ozone, the principal component of smog.
AIR-12

AIR QUALITY
    Pedestrian Oriented Development (POD) - any of a number of design strategies that
    emphasize pedestrian access over automobile access. They typically provide pedestrian
    amenities such as sidewalks, street trees, commercial at street frontage, safe street
    crossings, etc.
    PM-10 (Particulate Matter) - a major air pollutant consisting of solid or liquid matter such as
    soot, dust, aerosols, fumes and mists less than 10 microns in size (one micron =
    1/1,000,000 meter = 0.00003937 inch). PM-10 causes visibility reduction and adverse
    health effects, and is a criteria air pollutant.
    ROG (Reactive Organic Gas) - hydrocarbon compounds which are reactive and may
    contribute to the formation of smog. Also sometimes referred to as Non-Methane Organic
    Compounds (NMOCs).
    RACT (Reasonably Available Control Technology) - the most effective emission limits in
    existing regulation that are currently in effect in any nonattainment district.
    Sensitive Receptor – people, or facilities that generally house people (schools, hospitals,
    residences, etc.), that may experience adverse effects from unhealthful concentrations of air
    pollutants.
    SIP (State Implementation Plan) - a document prepared by each state describing existing air
    quality conditions and measures which will be taken to attain and maintain National
    Ambient Air Quality Standards. In California, districts prepare nonattainment area plans to
    be included in the State's SIP.
    Site Design – individual subdivisions, multi-family developments, and commercial and
    industrial site plans. It also includes architectural features of buildings and landscapes.
    Smog - a combination of smoke, ozone, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and other
    chemically reactive compounds, which, under various conditions of weather and sunlight,
    may result in a murky brown haze that causes adverse health effects. A primary source of
    smog is automobiles.
    Stationary Sources - non-mobile sources such as refineries, power plants, and
    manufacturing facilities which emit air pollutants. (Contrast with mobile sources)
    Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) - a pungent, colorless gas that is formed by the combustion of fossil
    fuels. Power plants, which may use coal or oil high in sulfur content, have traditionally been
    major sources of SO2. SO2 is a criteria pollutant.
    Sulfur Oxides - acrid, corrosive, poisonous gases produced chiefly when fuel containing
    sulfur is burned. The principal sources of sulfur oxides are electric generating plants and
    industrial plants.
    Transit Oriented Development (TOD) – moderate to high density, mixed use neighborhoods,
    up to 160 acres in size, which are developed around a transit stop and core commercial
    area. The entire TOD must be within an average of 2,000 foot walking distance of a transit
                                                                                                AIR-13

                          LEGAL BASIS
    California planning law requires cities and counties to prepare and adopt a "comprehensive,
    long-range general plan" to guide development of the community. The General Plan could
    be thought of as the jurisdictions’ “constitution.” The General Plan requires a complex set of
    analysis, comprehensive public outreach and input, and meaningful policy direction in vast
    range of topic areas. Put simply the General Plan has several basic functions:
     A vision for the future. The General Plan contains a vision statement, goals, and policies
        and implementation strategies to achieve the vision and goals for the future.
    Decision making guide. As decision makers change over time, the General Plan includes
        educational material and background information that provide a context for the policy
        guidance contained in the Plan. The General Plan provides continuity for guiding and
        influencing the many public and private decisions that together influence the
        community’s future.
    Legal requirement. The General Plan has been prepared to fulfill the requirements of
        state law and guidelines adopted by the California Office of Planning and Research. State
        law not only requires adoption of the General Plan, but that zoning codes, subdivision
        regulations, specific plans, capital improvement programs, and other local measures be
        consistent with the General Plan .
    State law also specifies the content of general plans. Current law requires seven mandated
    elements:
      land use,
      circulation,
      housing,
      conservation,
      open space,
      noise, and
      safety.
    A general plan must contain development policies, diagrams, and text that describe
    objectives, principles, standards, and plan proposals. The following are highlights of the
    required topics to be covered within each mandatory element. According to the Governor’s
    Office of Planning and Research’s (OPR) guidelines regarding general plans, topics from
    different elements may be combined, but all must be addressed within the general plan.
    Please refer to the Governor’s Office of Planning and Research General Plan Guidelines for
                                                                                            LEGAL-1

       more information. Section references below are from the Government Code, unless
       otherwise specified.
Land Use
       A land use element must designate the proposed general distribution and general location
       and extent of the uses of the land for housing, business, industry, open space, including
       agriculture, natural resources, recreation, and enjoyment of scenic beauty, education, public
       buildings and grounds, solid and liquid waste disposal facilities, and other categories of
       public and private uses of land. The land use element shall include a statement of the
       standards of population density and building intensity recommended for the various districts
       and other territory covered by the plan.
Circulation
       A circulation element consisting of the general location and extent of existing and proposed
       major thoroughfares, transportation routes, terminals, and other local public utilities and
       facilities, all correlated with the land use element of the plan.
Housing
       The housing element consists of standards and plans for the improvement of housing and
       the provision of adequate sites for housing to meet the needs of all economic segments of
       the community.
Conservation
       A conservation element for the conservation, development, and utilization of natural
       resources including water and its hydraulic force, forests, soils, rivers and other waters,
       harbors, fisheries, wildlife, minerals, and other natural resources. The conservation element
       may also cover:
        The reclamation of land and waters;
        Prevention and control of the pollution of streams and other waters;
        Regulation of the use of land in stream channels and other areas required for the
          accomplishment of the conservation plan;
        Prevention, control, and correction of the erosion of soils, beaches, and shores;
        Protection of watersheds;
        The location, quantity and quality of the rock, sand and gravel resources; and,
        Flood control.

Open Space
      The open-space element details plans and measures for the preservation of open space for
      natural resources, for the managed production of resources, for outdoor recreation, and for
      public health and safety.
Noise
      A noise element shall identify and appraise noise problems in the community. The noise
      element shall recognize the guidelines established by the Office of Noise Control in the State
      Department of Health Services and shall analyze and quantify, to the extent practicable, as
      determined by the legislative body, current and projected noise levels for all of the following
      sources:
       Highways and freeways;
       Primary arterials and major local streets;
       Passenger and freight on-line railroad operations and ground rapid transit systems;
       Commercial, general aviation, heliport, helistop, and military airport operations, aircraft
          overflights, jet engine test stands, and all other ground facilities and maintenance
          functions related to airport operation;
       Local industrial plants, including, but not limited to, railroad classification yards; and,
       Other ground stationary noise sources identified by local agencies as contributing to the
          community noise environment;
      Noise contours shall be shown for all of these sources and stated in terms of community
      noise equivalent level (CNEL) or day-night average level (Ldn). The noise contours shall be
      used as a guide for establishing a pattern of land uses in the land use element that
      minimizes the exposure of community residents to excessive noise. The noise element shall
      include implementation measures and possible solutions that address existing and
      foreseeable noise problems, if any. The adopted noise element shall serve as a guideline for
      compliance with the state’s noise insulation standards.
Safety
      A safety element for the protection of the community from any unreasonable risks
      associated with the effects of seismically induced surface rupture, ground shaking, ground
      failure, tsunami, seiche, and dam failure; slope instability leading to mudslides and
      landslides; subsidence, liquefaction and other seismic hazards, and other geologic hazards
      known to the legislative body; flooding; and wild land and urban fires. The safety element
      shall include mapping of known seismic and other geologic hazards. It shall also address
      evacuation routes, peakload water supply requirements, and minimum road widths and
      clearances around structures, as those items relate to identified fire and geologic hazards.

Air Quality
       State law has specific guidance for San Joaquin Valley areas regarding air quality policies in
       the General Plan.
       Section 65302.1
       (a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
       (1) The San Joaquin Valley has a serious air pollution problem that will take the
       cooperation of land use and transportation planning agencies, transit operators, the
       development community, the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District and
       the public to solve. The solution to the problem requires changes in the way we have
       traditionally built our communities and constructed the transportation systems. It
       involves a fundamental shift in priorities from emphasis on mobility for the
       occupants of private automobiles to a multimodal system that more efficiently uses
       scarce resources. It requires a change in attitude from the public to support
       development patterns and transportation systems different from the status quo.
       (2) In 2003 the district published a document entitled, Air Quality Guidelines for
       General Plans. This report is a comprehensive guidance document and resource for
       cities and counties to use to include air quality in their general plans. It includes
       goals, policies, and programs that when adopted in a general plan will reduce
       vehicle trips and miles traveled and improve air quality.
       (3) Air quality guidelines are recommended strategies that do, when it is feasible, all
       of the following:
       (A) Determine and mitigate project level and cumulative air quality impacts under
       the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) (Division 13 (commencing with
       Section 21000) of the Public Resources Code).
       (B) Integrate land use plans, transportation plans, and air quality plans.
       (C) Plan land uses in ways that support a multimodal transportation system.
       (D) Local action to support programs that reduce congestion and vehicle trips.
       (E) Plan land uses to minimize exposure to toxic air pollutant emissions from
       industrial and other sources.
       (F) Reduce particulate matter emissions from sources under local jurisdiction.
       (G) Support district and public utility programs to reduce emissions from energy
       consumption and area sources.
       (4) The benefits of including air quality concerns within local general plans include,
       but are not limited to, all of the following:
LEGAL-4
LEGAL AUTHORITY
    (A) Lower infrastructure costs.
    (B) Lower public service costs.
    (C) More efficient transit service.
    (D) Lower costs for comprehensive planning.
    (E) Streamlining of the permit process.
    (F) Improved mobility for the elderly and children.
    (b) The legislative body of each city and county within the jurisdictional boundaries
    of the district shall amend the appropriate elements of its general plan, which may
    include, but are not limited to, the required elements dealing with land use,
    circulation, housing, conservation, and open space, to include data and analysis,
    goals, policies, and objectives, and feasible implementation strategies to improve air
    quality.
    (c) The adoption of air quality amendments to a general plan to comply with the
    requirements of subdivision (d) shall include all of the following:
    (1) A report describing local air quality conditions including air quality monitoring
    data, emission inventories, lists of significant source categories, attainment status
    and designations, and applicable state and federal air quality plans and
    transportation plans.
    (2) A summary of local, district, state, and federal policies, programs, and
    regulations that may improve air quality in the city or county.
    (3) A comprehensive set of goals, policies, and objectives that may improve air
    quality consistent with the strategies listed in paragraph (3) of subdivision (a).
    (4) A set of feasible implementation measures designed to carry out those goals,
    policies, and objectives.
    (d) At least 45 days prior to the adoption of air quality amendments to a general
    plan pursuant to this section, each city and county shall send a copy of its draft
    document to the district. The district may review the draft amendments to determine
    whether they may improve air quality consistent with the strategies listed in
    paragraph (3) of subdivision (a). Within 30 days of receiving the draft amendments,
    the district shall send any comments and advice to the city or county. The legislative
    body of the city or county shall consider the district's comments and advice prior to
    the final adoption of air quality amendments to the general plan. If the district's
    comments and advice are not available by the time scheduled for the final adoption
    of air quality amendments to the general plan, the legislative body of the city or
    county may act without them. The district's comments shall be advisory to the city or
    county.
                                                                                           LEGAL-5
                                                                        LEGAL AUTHORITY
       (e) The legislative body of each city and county within the jurisdictional boundaries
       of the district shall comply with this section no later than one year from the date
       specified in Section 65588 for the next revision of its housing element that occurs
       after January 1, 2004.
       (f) As used in this section, "district" means the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution
       Control District.
       The Riverbank General Plan is specifically designed with this statutory guidance in mind.

Changes in Relevant Law
       The legislature routinely revises sections of State law that are relevant for consideration in
       updating a General Plan, including but not limited to the following (all sections listed below
       are in the Government Code, unless otherwise specified):
        Section 65302.2 was added to require general plans to use water management plans
           from water agencies as source documents for water issues.
        Section 65302.3, which addresses general plan consistency with airport land use plans,
           was amended in 2002, as follows:
            o   §65302.3 Consistency with airport land use plans
            o   The general plan, and any applicable specific plan prepared pursuant to Article 8
                (commencing with Section 65450), shall be consistent with the plan adopted or
                amended pursuant to Section 21675 of the Public Utilities Code.
            o   The general plan, and any applicable specific plan, shall be amended, as necessary,
                within 180 days of any amendment to the plan required under Section 21675 of the
                Public Utilities Code.
            o   If the legislative body does not concur with any provision of the plan required under
                Section 21675 of the Public Utilities Code, it may satisfy the provisions of this section
                by adopting findings pursuant to Section 21676 of the Public Utilities Code.
        Regarding the Safety element, Section 65302.5 was added to require each county that
           has State responsibility areas for fire suppression to comply with Public Resources Code
           Section 4128.5.
        As a part of 1996 amendments, §65352 was amended, which deals with notification of,
           and commenting by affected public agencies in the case of adoption of substantial
           amendment to a general plan, including cities, counties, special districts, school district,

     Also added was Section 65352.2 on local government coordination with school districts
      in general planning.
     In 1996, the legislature amended requirements for coordination and consultation among
      water supply agencies relative to general plan updates (see §65352.5, Water supply
      coordination).
     Amendments in 1988 deal with public hearings and public noticing relative to general
      plan amendments (see §65353, Commission notice and hearing). Amended by Stats.

      amendments. Amended by Stats. 1990, Ch. 1572.
     Amendments to §65358 address procedural requirements for amending a general plan.
      Amended by Stats. 1990, Ch. 1572.
     The legislature included amendments in 2000 dealing with implementation of the general
      plan as a part of §65400. This section is included below:
       o    After the legislative body has adopted all or part of a general plan, the planning
            agency shall do both of the following:
       o    Investigate and make recommendations to the legislative body regarding reasonable
            and practical means for implementing the general plan or element of the general
            plan, so that it will serve as an effective guide for orderly growth and development,
            preservation and conservation of open-space land and natural resources, and the
            efficient expenditure of public funds relating to the subjects addressed in the general
            plan.
       o    2a. Provide an annual report to the legislative body, the Office of Planning and
            Research, and the Department of Housing and Community Development on the
            status of the plan and progress in its implementation, including the progress in
            meeting its share of regional housing needs determined pursuant to Section 65584
            and local efforts to remove governmental constraints to the maintenance,
            improvement, and development of housing pursuant to paragraph (3) of subdivision
            (c) of Section 65583.
       o    2b. The housing portion of the annual report required to be provided to the Office
            of Planning and Research and the Department of Housing and Community
            Development pursuant to this subdivision shall be prepared through the use of forms

            o   Section 65404 was added to require the Governor to develop conflict resolution
                processes for use in conflicts among state agencies, plans, and projects.
        Open-Space Lands. The definition of opens space was amended for clarity as a part of
           changes enacted in 2002 (refer to §65560, Definitions). Amended by Stats. 2002, Ch.
           971.
       Amendments to the Public Resources Code also affect local jurisdictions’ preparation and
       implementation of general plan policy, as addressed below:
        Amendments to §2762 and 2763 address the establishment and implementation of
           mineral resource zones and management strategies.
        Section 2764 was added in 1986 to establish the need for general plan amendments or
           specific plans in response to surface mining requests. The amendments or specific plans
           must plan for future land uses in the vicinity of and access routes serving the operation in
           light of the importance to minerals in the whole market region. The lead agency shall
           make findings as to whether the future land uses and access routes will be compatible
           with the continuation of the mining.
        In 1998, the legislature amended §4125, which deals with classification of state
           responsibility areas for preventing and suppressing fires.
        Section 4128.5 regulates the submission of draft safety elements in the interest of
           ensuring land uses in state responsibility areas are those that protect life, property, and
           natural resources from unreasonable wild land fire risks. This section was added in 1989.
       A package of flood related bills were passed and signed in 2007 dealing with flood
       protection and land use planning in Central Valley. This legislation raises the standard for
       flood protection of urban areas, requires the State to provide updated information on the
       extent of floodplains, and requires local land use entitlement authorities to make more
       responsible land use decisions in floodplain areas.
       The Legislature expressed its intent as follows (California State Water Code Section
       9601):
       (a) The Central Valley of California is experiencing unprecedented development,
       resulting in the conversion of historically agricultural lands and communities to
       densely populated residential and urban centers.
       (b) The Legislature recognizes that by their nature, levees, which are earthen
       embankments typically founded on fluvial deposits, cannot offer complete protection
       from flooding, but can decrease its frequency.
       (c) The Legislature recognizes that the level of flood protection afforded rural and
       agricultural lands by the original flood control system would not be adequate to
LEGAL-8

LEGAL AUTHORITY
    protect those lands if they are developed for urban uses, and that a dichotomous
    system of flood protection for urban and rural lands has developed through many
    years of practice.
    (d) The Legislature further recognizes that levees built to reclaim and protect
    agricultural land may be inadequate to protect urban development unless those
    levees are significantly improved.
    (e) Cities and counties rely upon federal flood plain information when approving
    developments, but the information available is often out of date and the flood risk
    may be greater than that indicated using available federal information.
    (f) The Legislature recognizes that the current federal flood standard is not sufficient
    in protecting urban and urbanizing areas within flood prone areas throughout the
    Central Valley.
    (g) Linking land use decisions to flood risk and flood protection estimates comprises
    only one element of improving lives and property in the Central Valley. Federal, state,
    and local agencies may construct and operate flood protection facilities to reduce
    flood risks, but flood risks will nevertheless remain for those who choose to reside in
    Central Valley flood plains. Making those flood risks more apparent will help ensure
    that Californians make careful choices when deciding whether to build homes or live
    in Central Valley flood plains, and if so, whether to prepare for flooding or maintain
    flood insurance.
    The 2007 statutes create new responsibilities for state agencies, such as the Department of
    Water Resources (DWR) the newly reorganized Central Valley Flood Protection Board
    (CVFPB), The California Department of Fish and Game (DFG), and the Department of
    Housing and Community Development (HCD).
    By July 1, 2008, DWR is required to provide preliminary maps of areas within 100- and 200-
    year floodplains protected by “project levees” (Water Code 9610). “Project levees” are those
    levees that are part of the facilities of the State Plan of Flood Control. Generally, these are
    levees for which the Department or CVFPB are responsible for ensuring that they provide
    flood protection. Currently, the 100-year floodplain is the most frequently cited standard for
    flood risk and flood protection. DWR is also required, by December 31, 2008, to prepare
    maps that show levee protection zones, including those lands where flooding would be
    more than three feet deep if a levee were to fail (Water Code 9130). DWR will forward
    suggested requirements for adoption by the Building Standards Commission related to
    construction in areas protected by project levees where flood waters would exceed three feet
    in a 200-year flood (Health and Safety Code 50465).
    By January 1, 2012, DWR is required to have prepared the Central Valley Flood Protection
    Plan (Water Code 9612). This plan will identify and evaluate the Sacramento-San Joaquin
    Rivers flood management system; assess climate changes implications for flood control;
    outline necessary improvements to facilities in the system to provide 200-year flood
    protection to urban areas; propose structural and non-structural improvements to riverine
                                                                                               LEGAL-9

                                                                         LEGAL AUTHORITY
       ecosystem functions; and, related items. “Urban areas” are those with more than 10,000
       residents protected by project levees.
       The State Reclamation Board is now known as the Central Valley Flood Protection Board
       (CVFPB). This organization maintains its historic responsibility for oversight of project levees.
       In addition, the CVFPB is responsible for actually adopting the Central Valley Flood Protection
       Plan (described above), which is drafted by DWR.
       With the addition flood related information provided by the State of California, local
       agencies will be required to update their plans and regulations to ensure consistency. The
       2007 flood bills revised the requirements for the Land Use, Conservation, and Safety
       elements of city and county General Plans, with special attention to jurisdictions within the
       Central Valley.
       Cities and counties in the Central Valley are required to update their General Plans within 24
       months of adoption of the Central Valley Flood Control Plan. The updates must reflect the
       facilities identified in the State Plan of Flood Control; locations of other flood management
       facilities; maps of property protected by these facilities; and, the locations of flood hazard
       zones. Jurisdictions must use the data from the State Plan of Flood Control to create goals
       and policies that reduce the risk of flood damage. In the future, when Central Valley cities
       and counties look to update the General Plan safety element, consultation is required with
       the CVFPB, as well as any local agency that provides flood protection. Specific findings are
       required if the city or county rejects the advice of the CVFPB or local flood protection
       agencies (Government Code 65302.7).
       Once jurisdictions update their General Plans, the zoning ordinances then must be updated
       for consistency (including charter cities, which are frequently exempted from requirements of
       California law). Once the General Plan and zoning ordinance have been amended, no
       subdivisions, development agreements, or permits that would place development within a
       flood hazard zone can be approved unless the city or county makes explicit findings that
       either existing flood management facilities provide an adequate level of protection from
       flooding, the city or county has conditioned the project to provide an adequate level of
       protection, or the local flood management agency has made adequate progress on the
       construction of a flood protection system that will provide adequate protection.
       Central Valley counties, in collaboration with their cities, are required to develop “flood
       emergency plans” within 24 months of the adoption of the Central Valley Flood Protection
       Plan. Central Valley cities and counties are also required to collaborate with State and local
       flood management agencies to reduce flood risk to existing economically disadvantaged
       communities.

IMPLEMENTATION
GENERAL PLAN IMPLEMENTATION
                USE OF GENERAL PLAN
            The real measure of a general plan is how well its policies are carried out once the plan has
            been adopted.
            The General Plan will be implemented through a combination of private and public actions.
            The City will consider specific plans to implement General Plan policy in new growth areas.1
            The City will consider development proposals and will make investments in existing
            developed portions of Riverbank. City decision makers will use the policies included
            throughout this General Plan as a decision making guide for a wide range discretionary
            actions.
            The General Plan also includes implementation strategies, which are proactive measures the
            City will undertake to assist in achieving the General Plan’s vision and goals.
Amendments
            As the City of Riverbank uses its General Plan, there may be need to amend sections or
            elements of the plan document. Riverbank is limited in how many times it may amend any
            one of the mandatory general plan elements. An element may not be amended more than
            four times in one calendar year, except in the following circumstances:
             The element is optional;
             The amendments are requested and necessary for affordable housing;
             The amendment is necessary to comply with a court decision in a case involving the legal
                adequacy of the general plan;
             The amendments are made to bring a general plan into compliance with an airport land
                use plan; or,
             The amendments are needed in connection with the adoption of a comprehensive
                development plan under the Urban Development Incentive Act.
            Amendments may include more than one change to the general plan. In some cases, a
            government may group together several proposals to be considered in one amendment.
            Amendments can be adopted by the governing agency, with the mandated process outlined

      requirements of planning law, including consistency requirements. Amendments are subject
      to compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
      When the Planning Commission and City Council are considering a proposed General Plan
      amendment, at a minimum, the answers to the following questions (plus additional
      considerations as conditions warrant) will determine the City’s action: Is the proposed
      amendment in the public interest? Is the proposed amendment consistent and compatible
      with the goals and the vast majority of policies of the General Plan? Have the potential

State
CALIFORNIA PLANNING LAW
      Statutory authority for a general plan is described in Title 7, Division 1 of the Government
      Code of the State of California. Article 5, Section 65302 et seq. requires cities to adopt a
      comprehensive general plan to guide future physical development. The plan may recognize
      local conditions in a format that is appropriate for the local agency. Although the general
      plan must address a number of mandatory subjects and elements, the City may choose the
      degree of specificity and level of detail that is appropriate for the City.
      The law requires that cities and counties make a “consistency” finding with the general plan
      for any subdivision map, zoning action, public facility plans, and other functions of local
      government. Court decisions have concluded that these “consistency” determinations
      cannot be made if the local jurisdiction does not have a legally adequate general plan. In
      effect, local governments cannot issue development permits, or perform many vital public
      functions without a legally adequate general plan.
      The question of “legal adequacy” is addressed according to the standards of State law.
      Further guidance is provided by the General Plan Guidelines, which are prepared by the
      Governor’s Office of Planning and Research (OPR). More information on the General Plan
      Guidelines can be found at the OPR’s web site: http://opr.ca.gov/
      Local governments have the sole responsibility for the review, approval, and adoption of the
      general plan. However, State agencies have review and comment authority over some local
      government actions. Some of the agencies likely to involved are described in detail later in
IMP-2

GENERAL PLAN IMPLEMENTATION
      this section. In California, courts are frequently asked to rule on local government
      compliance with State general plan law.
      State law specifies that each general plan address seven issue areas, known as “elements,”
      which must be consistent with one another. The seven required elements are:
      1.   Land use;
      2.   Transportation;
      3.   Open space;
      4.   Conservation;
      5.   Housing;
      6.   Noise; and,
      7.   Safety.
      The plan must analyze issues of importance to the community, set forth policies for
      conservation and development, and outline specific programs or actions for implementing
      these policies. The relationship between the titles and topics presented in Riverbank’s
      General Plan and those addressed in State law is presented in each Element of this General
      Plan.
CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT
      As previously noted, the general plan is the primary document that guides growth and
      development in a city or county. The plan is also closely linked to the State’s environmental
      law. CEQA recognizes the authority of the local general planning process in several areas. In
      law and in practice, the environmental review process is an integral part of the local
      planning, development review, and decision making process.
      As a “project”, under CEQA, the general plan adoption process is subject to environmental
      analysis and disclosure. As a policy document, the general plan provides guidance and sets
      standards for several areas of mandatory environmental review for other “projects”
      undertaken by local governments and the private sector. In recognition of this close
      relationship between general plan policy and the environmental review process, the
      Riverbank General Plan has been prepared to respond to changes in the State’s CEQA
      regulations, CEQA Guidelines, relevant and applicable CEQA case law.
Local Government and Regional Agencies
      The planning process in California involves the coordination and cooperation of several levels
      of government in order to be effective. In the City of Riverbank, several governmental entities
      have planning resources and authority that support the City’s planning efforts.
THE COUNTY OF STANISLAUS
      The County of Stanislaus generally operates under the same rules and standards as the City
      of Riverbank with respect to land use planning and development review authority. The land
      use and development standards of lands located outside the City boundaries are subject to
      the rules and regulations of Stanislaus County. When these lands are located within the
                                                                                                IMP-3

                                           GENERAL PLAN IMPLEMENTATION
       City’s Sphere of Influence but outside the City’s corporate boundaries, development projects
       pursued at the County level are referred to the City for review and comment.
       The Stanislaus County General Plan governs all unincorporated lands in the County,
       including lands in the Riverbank planning area outside the Riverbank city limits. The current
       County designations for these lands include Urban Transition, Agricultural, and Industrial.
STANISLAUS COUNTY LOCAL AGENCY FORMATION COMMISSION (LAFCO)
       LAFCOs were created by the State in 1963 in order to oversee the growing complexity of
       overlapping local governmental jurisdictions. Each county in the state has its own LAFCO.
       LAFCOs are responsible for:
        coordinating logical and timely changes in local government boundaries (annexations),
        conducting special studies which review ways to reorganize and streamline governmental
          structure, and
        preparing “Spheres of Influence” or ultimate growth boundaries for each city and special
          district in each county, among other responsibilities.
       The following are some of the policies from the Stanislaus LAFCO Policies and Procedures
       document (adopted 2001, amended 2003) that are most relevant to potential annexations
       or sphere of influence adjustments in Riverbank.
Policy 4 – Priorities for Annexation and Formation
       The Commission will consider the following priorities or guidelines for annexation and
       formation with the provision that overriding circumstances must be stated in exceptions
       (Government Code Section 56001):
       A. Annexation to an existing city or district instead of formation of a new agency.
       B. Annexation to a city rather than a district if both can provide comparable services.
       C. Annexation to a multi-purpose district in preference to annexation to a single purpose
           district.
       D. Formation of a new political entity as the last and least desirable alternative.
Policy 5 – Prezoning for City Annexation
       Effective January 1, 2001, prezoning is mandated by Government Code Section 56375. All
       prezoning designations shall remain in effect for at least two years unless the City Council
       makes specified findings relating to changed conditions and circumstances. No city
       annexation application will be deemed complete unless the prezoning process has been
       completed.
IMP-4

GENERAL PLAN IMPLEMENTATION
       Such prezoning shall also require that the city become the lead agency for environmental
       review for the proposed change and shall prepare and submit to LAFCO the environmental
       assessment forms in sufficient time for LAFCO’s Executive Officer to comment before a
       determination of environmental effects is made.
Policy 6 – Concurrent City-District Annexation
       For any annexation within a community served by a variety of community-based local
       agencies, the Commission shall require concurrent annexation to all of the local agencies
       serving the community (concurrent city/district annexations).
Policy 19 – Streets and Canals
       The following shall be used in determining the appropriate territory to be included in the
       boundaries of a proposal:
       A. Annexation to Cities.
           1. Areas surrounded or substantially surrounded by a city may include all contiguous
               public rights of way that can reasonably be included without fragmenting
               governmental responsibility by alternating city and county jurisdiction over short
               sections of the same right of way.
           2. Contiguous areas located substantially within a sphere of influence may provide for
               the continuation of established street annexation patterns when appropriate.
           3. When a boundary street is coterminous with the sphere of influence boundary of a
               city, the entire right of way of the boundary street may be included.
           4. When a street is a boundary line between two cities the centerline of the street may
               be used as the boundary or whatever agreement is reached by the affected cities.
       B. Annexations to Special Districts.
           1. Areas located within a sphere of influence shall include all contiguous public rights
               of ways that can reasonably be included.
           2. When a street is the boundary line between two similar types of special districts the
               centerline of the right of way shall be the boundary or whatever agreement is
               reached by the districts involved.
       C. Canals.
           When an annexation proposal is adjacent to an irrigation canal or lateral, the entire right
           of way of the lateral or canal shall be included in the proposal, unless the annexing
           agency presents compelling evidence to support its exclusion.
                                                                                                  IMP-5

                                            GENERAL PLAN IMPLEMENTATION
Policy 20 – Logical Boundaries
       The following shall be considered as favorable factors in determining logical boundaries for a
       proposal (amended April 23, 2003):
       A. The Commission encourages the creation of logical boundaries and proposals which do
           not create islands and would eliminate existing islands, corridors, or other distortion of
           existing boundaries.
       B. Proposals which are orderly and will either improve or maintain the agency’s logical
           boundary are encouraged.
Policy 21 – Development of Vacant or Underutilized Land Prior to Annexation of
Additional Territory
       The following shall be considered with regards to development of vacant or underutilized
       land prior to annexation of additional territory:
       A. Development of existing vacant non-open space, and non-prime agricultural land within
           an agency’s boundaries is encouraged prior to further annexation and development.
       B. Annexation proposals to cities or districts providing urban services of undeveloped or
           agricultural parcels shall show: that urban development is imminent for all or a
           substantial portion of the proposal area; that urban development will be contiguous
           with existing or proposed development; and that a planned, orderly, and compact urban
           development pattern will result. Proposals resulting in leapfrog, non-contiguous urban
           development patterns shall not be approved.
Sphere of Influence Policies
       1. LAFCO will designate a Sphere of Influence line for each local agency that represents the
           agency’s probable physical boundary and includes territory eligible for annexation and
           the extension of that agency’s services within a zero to twenty-year period. LAFCO shall
           also designate a Primary Area line for a local agency which represents the agency’s short-
           term growth area. Areas within an adopted Primary Area shall be eligible for annexation
           and extension of urban services within a zero to ten year period.
       2. Territory between an adopted Primary Area line and Sphere of Influence of an agency
           shall be considered a transition area, anticipated to need and receive the agency’s
           services within ten to twenty years. To preclude urban sprawl within an adopted sphere
           of influence, transition areas shall not be considered eligible for annexation and urban
           services.
       3. LAFCO may adopt a zero sphere of influence encompassing no territory for an agency.
           This occurs where LAFCO determines that the public service functions of the agency are
           either non-existent, no longer needed, or should be reallocated to some other agency of
           government. The local agency, which has been assigned a zero sphere of influence,
           should ultimately be dissolved.
IMP-6

GENERAL PLAN IMPLEMENTATION
      4. Territory not in need of urban services, including open space, agriculture, non-protested,
          or protested and not upheld Williamson Act contracted lands, shall not be assigned to
          an agency’s sphere of influence, unless the area’s exclusion would impede the planned,
          orderly and efficient development of this area.
      5. LAFCO may adopt a Primary Area and Sphere of Influence that excludes territory
          currently within that agency’s boundaries. This occurs where LAFCO determines that the
          territory consists of agricultural lands, open space lands, or agricultural preserves whose
          preservation would be jeopardized by inclusion within an agency’s sphere of influence.
          Exclusion of these areas from an agency’s sphere of influence indicates that detachment
          is appropriate.
      6. Where an area could be assigned to the sphere of influence of more than one agency
          providing a particular needed service, the following hierarchy shall apply dependent
          upon ability to service.
          A. Inclusion within a city sphere of influence.
          B. Inclusion within a multi-purpose district sphere of influence.
          C. Inclusion within a single-purpose district sphere of influence.
          In deciding which of two or more equally-ranked agencies shall include an area within its
          sphere of influence, LAFCO shall consider the agencies’ service and financial capabilities,
          social and economic interdependencies, topographic factors, and the effect the eventual
          service extension will have on adjacent agencies.
      7. Sphere of Influence boundaries shall not create islands or corridors unless it can be
          demonstrated that the irregular boundaries represent the most logical and orderly
          service area of an agency.
      8. Non-adjacent, publicly-owned properties and facilities used for urban purposes may be
          included within that public agency’s sphere of influence if eventual annexation would
          provide an overall benefit to agency residents.
      9. LAFCO shall review the Primary Area and Sphere of Influence determinations at least
          once every five years. If a local agency or the county desires amendment or revision of an
          adopted sphere of influence, the local agency by resolution may file such a request with
          the Executive Officer. Any local agency or county making such a request shall reimburse
          the Commission for the actual and direct costs incurred by the Commission. The
          Commission may waive such reimbursement if it finds that the request may be
          considered as part of its periodic review of spheres of influence.
      10. LAFCO shall adopt, amend or revise the Primary Area or Sphere of Influence
          determinations following the procedural steps set forth in the Cortese-Knox-Hertzberg
          Act.
STANISLAUS COUNTY COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS (STANCOG)
      The Stanislaus County Council of Governments is comprised of representatives of the County
      of Stanislaus and the cities within Stanislaus County, with broad-based participation from a
                                                                                                  IMP-7

      variety of public agencies and organizations throughout the County and the region. The
      primary responsibility of StanCOG is to administer the regional transportation planning
      efforts in the County. StanCOG also has responsibility for administering the Regional
      Housing Allocation process, as required by State law, and serves as an information
      clearinghouse for local governments in Stanislaus County.
      The regional planning efforts that StanCOG has directed include the Regional Bicycle
      Transportation Master Plan, adopted in 1996, the Regional Bicycle Action Plan adopted in
      2001, and Visioning Project 2000. The Regional Bicycle Action Plan is the continuation of the
      Master Plan and is intented to guide the planning and implementation of bicycle facilities in
      the region.
      Visioning Project 2000 was a county-wide visioning process completed in 2002. The process
      resulted in the preparation of a seven-page guiding document for cities and the County of
      Stanislaus. In this process, representatives of the cities and the County worked together to
      create a vision and guiding principles with the intent that the collaboration and cooperation
      of municipalities would lead to a regional plan of action. Topics covered by the vision were
      land use, environment, economy, transportation, education, community, government, and
      public safety. A copy of this document may be found at www.stancog.org/vision.pdf.
SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT (SJVAPCD)
      The City of Riverbank is located within the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin. The SJVAPCD
      regulates air quality in the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin. SJVAPCD is an independent regional
      agency that receives funding from the State of California and the participating cities and
      counties. It operates under State laws and locally adopted rules.
      The SJVAPCD publishes Air Quality Guidelines for General Plans. This document was last
      revised in June 2005. The purposes of this document, according to the document, are the
      following:
       To provide local planning agencies with a comprehensive set of goals and policies that
          will improve air quality if adopted in a general plan.
       To provide a guide to cities and counties for determining which goals and policies are
          appropriate in their particular community.
       To provide justification and rationale for the goals and policies that will convince decision
          makers and the public that they are appropriate and necessary.
      The document discusses the importance of local government efforts to improve air quality
      including the inclusion of air quality elements in general plans. The following is a summary
      of the major components of the document, as listed in the document’s executive summary:
       The Existing Air Quality and Regulatory Setting section explains the air quality regulatory
          framework, the existing air quality in the San Joaquin Valley, and the topographical and
          meteorological factors affecting air quality. This section could be used in air quality
          analysis sections of environmental documents.
IMP-8

GENERAL PLAN IMPLEMENTATION
      The Comprehensive List of General Plan Goals and Policies to Improve Air Quality section
        covers the full range of air quality issues faced by cities and counties. A main theme of
        the policies is to link land use, transportation, and air quality planning. A number of the
        policies, such as policies that promote compact development and efficient infrastructure,
        have indirect air quality benefits. The main purposes of these policies are to minimize
        infrastructure costs and to preserve natural or agricultural lands; however, secondary air
        quality benefits are achieved by reducing vehicle trip lengths and by improving the
        potential for transit service.
      The Policy Analysis and Air Quality Benefits section is intended to provide justification for
        cities and counties to adopt the policies. This section provides available emission
        reduction estimates and provides the logic behind policies that are not quantifiable. This
        section also gives examples of programs in operation to illustrate where the policies have
        been successfully implemented. This section is divided into three components: Suggested
        Goals and Policies for Separate Air Quality Elements, Chapters, or Sections; Suggested
        Goals and Policies for Land Use Elements; and Suggested Goals and Policies for
        Circulation Elements.
      The document provides a matrix that identifies the policies that are appropriate for each
        of seven different community types identified in the San Joaquin Valley. The matrix is
        intended as a guide only. Each city and county will determine the goals and policies
        appropriate for their community. Also provided are a glossary of terms and an extensive
        bibliography.
CENTRAL VALLEY REGIONAL WATER QUALITY CONTROL BOARD (CVRWQCB)
     The Central Valley RWQCB is a nine-member state board with the primary duty of protecting
     the quality of the waters within the Central Valley Region for all beneficial uses. This duty is
     performed by formulating and adopting water quality control plans for specific ground and
     surface water basins and by prescribing and enforcing requirements on waste discharges.
     The CVRWQCB will be responsible for approving storm drain and wastewater discharge
     permits required by the City to implement its stormwater management and wastewater
     system master plans.
CALTRANS, DISTRICT 10
     California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) plans and oversees the state highway
     system and works with other governmental agencies and local jurisdictions to plan, develop,
     manage, and maintain California’s transportation system.
     The state is divided into 12 Caltrans planning districts. Stanislaus County is in District 10,
     which also includes the San Joaquin Valley counties of San Joaquin, Merced, five mountain
     counties (Alpine, Amador, Calaveras, Mariposa, and Tuolumne), and Solano County in the
     Bay Area. Caltrans has permitting authority for all access to, and from State Route 108, and
     therefore works closely with the City to ensure that this important roadway continues to
     function in a safe and efficient manner.
                                                                                                   IMP-9

                                             GENERAL PLAN IMPLEMENTATION
Relationship to City of Riverbank Plans and Regulations
       The General Plan provides a governing basis for all other plans and planning documents of
       the City and all codes, ordinances, and policies of the City related to land use change,
       transportation, environmental resources, infrastructure, and other related topics.
       In California, general plans are cities’ and counties’ guiding policy documents. Local agencies
       implement general plans in part through the adoption and enforcement of zoning codes,
       subdivision ordinances, and other regulations. General plan land use designations and
       planning policy provide a framework for zoning designations and development standards.
       Cities and counties’ design regulations and guidelines are also governed by general plans.
       General plans often contain policy that guides any municipal code sections and ordinances
       that regulate grading, building permits, open space dedications, landscaping requirements,
       parkland dedication, off-street parking requirements, transportation infrastructure, signage,
       and any other planning-related codes and ordinances.
       Riverbank’s zoning code and municipal code will likely undergo a comprehensive or at least
       considerable update following the adoption of the updated General Plan, to ensure
       consistency and effective implementation.
RIVERBANK HOUSING ELEMENT
       The Housing Element of Riverbank was adopted in December 2004, but covers the period
       from January 1, 2003 through June 30, 2009. The Housing Element is an element of the
       Riverbank General Plan, but is produced and adopted as a separate document due to the
       relatively short cycle (compared to how often Riverbank and most other jurisdictions update
       their general plans) required by the State for housing elements. As an element of the
       General Plan, the Housing Element and the rest of the General Plan must be consistent with
       one another. The Housing Element designates housing-related programs, evaluates the
       performance of programs from the previous cycle, addresses constraints to the development
       of affordable housing, and programs the City will implement to fulfill the City’s obligation to
       accommodate housing development in line with its regional share and affordable to the full
       range of household income groups.
BRUINVILLE AREA MASTER PUBLIC FACILITIES PLAN
       This Plan was adopted by the City in 2005. Bruinville is the area surrounding Riverbank High
       School. The Bruinville plan area is partially in the Riverbank city limits and partially in the
       City’s Sphere of Influence. This Plan analyzes the level of (mostly residential) growth expected
       in this area in relation to the capacity of the public services and facilities (including those
       provided by the City) that serve this area. The Plan also illustrates how much each public
       service and facility needs to expand or improve to serve the anticipated Bruinville growth at
       buildout and how each such expansion and improvement would be financed. The Bruinville
       Area Master Public Facilities Plan may require amendment following adoption of this General
       Plan.
IMP-10

GENERAL PLAN IMPLEMENTATION
RIVERBANK DOWNTOWN REVITALIZATION PLAN
       In 2002, the City Council approved the Riverbank Downtown Revitalization Plan, which
       assessed the existing market conditions in downtown Riverbank and created an urban design
       concept plan for the district. Streetscape improvements are a major component of the urban
       design concept.
INFRASTRUCTURE MASTER PLANS
       The City updated its infrastructure master plans in coordination with this General Plan
       update (water, wastewater, stormwater drainage). For each of these respective systems, the
       plans designate improvement and replacements to be implemented. General plan growth
       projections and land use designations are used to guide the infrastructure master plans.
SPECIFIC PLANS
       In accordance with State law, the City may adopt additional specific plans for properties
       within the boundaries of the Planning Area.
Crossroads Specific Plan
       This Plan was originally adopted by the City in 1995. The Plan was written and adopted in
       response to developer interest in the Crossroads area, which is the southwest section of the
       City. The Specific Plan contains goals, policies, implementation items, and land use
       designations to guide urban development of the area. For more information, please refer to
       materials related to this plan on file with the City’s Community Development Department.
Geographic Focus
       For new growth areas (areas outside the existing City limits as of January 1, 2007), the
       majority of new urban development in the Riverbank Planning Area shall occur under a
       limited number of specific plans. This General Plan provides guidance for all land use change
       in the City’s Planning Area, including important guidance for the preparation and adoption
       of specific plans to address new growth areas.
       In general, three different geographic areas are to be addressed by future specific plans (see
       Figure IMPLEMENT-1):
       1. Southwest Riverbank: south of Patterson Road and west of Oakdale Road
       2. Northwest Riverbank: north of Patterson Road and west of the existing developed City
       3. East Riverbank: areas east, northeast, and southeast of the City limits as of January 1,
            2007
       All property owners in a specific plan are encouraged to participate on equal footing in the
       specific planning process.

                                                GENERAL PLAN IMPLEMENTATION
Specific Plan Content
         If properly designed and implemented, a specific plan, as set forth in California Government
         Code, is a helpful tool for providing a transition between the citywide goals and policies
         contained in the General Plan and subsequent entitlement requests (e.g., tentative maps and
         conditional use permits).
         The specific plan is essentially a complete “blueprint” for the development of a defined area;
         it includes land use and circulation diagrams, public facilities required to serve proposed land
         use, the cost and methods of financing needed public facilities and services, and guidance
         on implementation of the plan, including infrastructure phasing and development standards
         (i.e., zoning).
         Specific plans must be consistent with the City’s General Plan and the City’s infrastructure
         master plans, as determined by the City, and contain information as required by State law
         and information including, but not limited to the following:
          Land use diagram and description
          Circulation system diagram and description
          Policies, design guidelines, and development standards for specific plan development
          Economic development
          Parks
          Affordable housing
          Cost analysis/fiscal benefit
          Public facility plan, including the location and sizing of major infrastructure (water,
             wastewater, storm drainage), and other public facilities (e.g., parks, schools, etc.)
             consistent with the General Plan, City master plans, and standards
          Phasing and financing of all public facilities, consistent with City requirements and LAFCO
             requirements for Sphere of Influence adjustment
          A description of the requirements, entitlements, and process for specific plan
             implementation
          Analysis of consistency with General Plan policies and diagrams
         In addition to providing well-coordinated land use and infrastructure planning, specific plans
         shall provide the information necessary to support a Sphere of Influence expansion at
         LAFCO, including the information required by LAFCO for a Master Services Element.2 Specific

GENERAL PLAN IMPLEMENTATION
      plan approval by the City is required before the City will forward an annexation request to
      LAFCO. The City may elect to forward an annexation request that does not include the entire
      geographic area included in an approved specific plan. The City may elect not to request
      from LAFCO a Sphere of Influence update that includes the entire geographic area of a
      specific plan.
      Specific plans are subject to CEQA analysis, with the City as the lead agency, pursuant to the
      statutory guidance, CEQA guidelines, and case law applicable at the time of processing.
      The Riverbank General Plan anticipates large new growth areas northwest, east, and
      southwest of the City. New growth areas are located outside the City’s current Sphere of
      Influence and jurisdictional limits. There are complex, large-scale infrastructure and public
      service planning and financing strategies required to implement such ambitious growth
      during build out of the General Plan. The specific plan process will be used to achieve
      certainty regarding the extent and character of urban development and conservation, as well
      as how that future development is provided with public services and utilities.
      When considering whether to approve a specific plan, the Planning Commission and City
      Council will deliberate on such questions as: Does the proposed specific plan help the
      community to achieve the goals outlined in the Riverbank General Plan? Is the proposed
      specific plan consistent with policies and standards of the Riverbank General Plan?
Regional Expressway and Circulation Improvements
      StanCOG and the member cities and the County have been working on regional expressway
      plans for the north Stanislaus County area, including an alignment that could potentially
      traverse the southern Riverbank Planning Area. Whether or not that east-west expressway
      comes to fruition, there are important transportation improvement and funding issues that
      must be addressed at the specific plan level. Developers will be required to develop and
      dedicate or set aside impact fees that will be used to expand east-west roadways to handle
      additional future traffic.
      Given the layout of the City, many specific roadway improvements required to serve new
      growth are best estimated at the specific plan level, according to the generalized guidance
      in the General Plan. Frequent through connections across specific plan areas and from
      specific plan areas to the existing developed City will required to connect together, forming a
      cohesive whole transportation system. As the Planning Area builds out over time, certain
      roads will be constructed, stubbed out for future use, and sized to handle growth of the
      Plan Area.
      Specific plans will address the planning, design, phasing, and financing of the entire
      roadway system, include pro-rata sharing mechanisms for communitywide facilities, so that
      connectivity and accessibility are provided at the highest level. Specific plans will also be
      required to address access and alignment issues associated with the planning of a future
      regional expressway.
                                                                                                  IMP-13

                                            GENERAL PLAN IMPLEMENTATION
Utilities
        Recent water, wastewater, and stormwater drainage master plan updates reflect
        development assumptions of General Plan buildout. The concept plans for these utilities in
        new growth areas will guide (at a general level) more specific utility planning, phasing, and
        financing that would be included in specific plans. Utility lines must be sized and designed
        to handle demand generated at the entire General Plan level. Utilities must be sized to serve
        large areas, and certain lines might have capacity that goes unused for many years as
        Planning Area builds out. Specific plans will provide utility planning, phasing, and financing
        consistent with the City’s master plans, consistent with General Plan buildout assumptions
        and General Plan policy, allowing orderly urban development of the Planning Area from the
        inside out.
