A. LAND USE ELEMENT
INTRODUCTION
The Land Use Element plays the central role in the General Plan. It establishes a pattern for land
use development, and sets policy for population density and building intensity. The Land Use
Element serves as the basis for determining service requirements, including plans for future
streets and roads, water and sewer, schools, and police and fire protection services. It is the
determining factor for the future transportation system, as well as future noise compatibility
issues. These topics are addressed in the Circulation Element and the Noise Element,
respectively.
The Land Use Element of many city and county general plans deals with growth and
development. Although the City of Rocklin has undeveloped areas, almost all of these areas
have been master-planned through a series of Planned Unit Developments referred to as
“General Development Plans” under the Rocklin Zoning Ordinance. This limits the changes the
City can make to the land use designations from the 1991 General Plan in the planning area.
As the City continues to develop, the land use decisions facing the community will evolve.
There will be fewer instances in which large-scale residential development is proposed for
vacant parcels, and more situations in which neighborhoods express concern regarding
development proposals for specific smaller sites. With the City’s physical growth reaching the
limits of its planning area, there will be less of a focus on large scale “planned developments”
and more on the quality of the living environment within the city limits. The policies of the
Land Use Element are designed to guide decisions regarding new development in existing
developed areas (commonly referred to as “infill development”) and mixed use development
(commercial and residential) using smart growth principles.
In addition to the goals and policies, the Land Use Diagram is a part of the Land Use Element.
In this General Plan, the Land Use Diagram also depicts the Open Space Diagram. It is located
in the pocket in the back cover of this document.
The Land Use Element also includes definitions of each land use designation, population density
and building intensity standards, a description of the General Plan holding capacity, and the
Zoning Compatibility Matrix. The State Office of Planning and Research’s General Plan
Guidelines note that the Land Use Element should address the distribution of open space,
mineral resources, recreation facilities, educational facilities, and public buildings and grounds.
In the Rocklin General Plan, those topics are addressed in the Open Space, Recreation and
Conservation Element.
DESCRIPTION OF EXISTING CONDITIONS
EXISTING LAND USE
The Rocklin planning area encompasses approximately 13,000 acres, or 21 square miles. The
City’s planning area is defined as all of the area within the City boundaries (approximately 19.8

square miles), plus the additional 1.2 square miles outside the City boundaries that are included
within the City’s “Sphere of Influence.” The Sphere of Influence is identified by the Placer
County Local Agency Formation Commission as the area of probable physical boundaries and
service area for the City of Rocklin. Any expansion of the Rocklin Sphere of Influence is
unlikely to occur since it is constrained by the City limits of Lincoln to the north, Loomis to the
east, and Roseville to the south and west. One unincorporated county “island” is located east of
I-80.
Figure 3-1 in Chapter III shows the planning area boundary as well as the existing City limits
(the incorporated area which makes up the City of Rocklin). Interstate 80 (I-80) and the Union
Pacific Railroad tracks bisect the City and State Route (SR) 65 borders the west and southwest
boundary of the City.
LAND USE INVENTORY
The City of Rocklin has compiled an inventory of existing land uses. This information, which is
available by Assessor’s parcel number and street address, provides a parcel-by-parcel inventory
of development status (vacant or developed) and development type (residential, mobile home,
commercial, industrial, and other uses). This information is maintained by the Rocklin
Community Development Department.
REDEVELOPMENT
The City of Rocklin has an adopted Redevelopment Plan and a Redevelopment Project Area.
The Redevelopment Plan, amended most recently in 2004, was prepared in conformance with
California Community Redevelopment Law, Section 33000 et seq. of the Health and Safety
Code. The Project Area, as shown on Figure 4-1, generally encompasses the area between
Interstate 80 and Pacific Street between Sunset Boulevard and the Sierra College Boulevard
interchange. It includes downtown Rocklin as well as the Sunset Plaza shopping center, the
Civic Center Master Plan Area, the last active granite quarry (Big Gun), commercial properties
along Granite Drive and I-80 east of Sierra Meadows Drive, as well as light industrial and
residential areas. Existing land uses in the Project Area include residential; neighborhood,
community and highway-oriented retail; downtown retail and office; service commercial; and
industrial. Other land uses are churches and various public facilities, including government
buildings, public rights-of-way and roads. A number of vacant industrial zoned parcels are
located along Dominguez Road in partially developed industrial parks. Vacant commercial sites
are located along commercial corridors.
The Redevelopment Plan includes the following goals:
•    The elimination of environmental deficiencies in the Redevelopment Project Area, including,
     among others, small and irregular lots, incompatible and uneconomic land uses, obsolete and
     aged building types and land uses, and inadequate or deteriorated public improvements and
     facilities.

Land Use Element

•    The assembly of land into parcels suitable for modern, integrated development with
     improved pedestrian and vehicular circulation in the Redevelopment Project Area.
•    The replanning, redesign, and development of undeveloped areas that are stagnant or
     improperly utilized.
•    The strengthening of retail and other commercial functions in the downtown area.
•    The provision of opportunities for participation by owners and tenants in the revitalization of
     their properties.
•    The strengthening, expansion and diversification of the economic and employment base of
     the Redevelopment Project Area and the community by the installation of needed site
     improvements to stimulate new commercial and light industrial expansion, employment and
     economic growth, and through the facilitation of more year-round employment opportunities.
•    The provision of adequate land for parking and open space.
•    The establishment and implementation of performance criteria to assure high site design
     standards and environmental quality and other design elements which provide unity and
     integrity to the entire Redevelopment Project Area.
•    The increase, improvement and/or preservation of the City’s supply of housing for low- and
     moderate-income persons, through rehabilitation, reconstruction, new construction and other
     programs.
•    The creation/enhancement of recreational and cultural opportunities available to the residents
     of the Redevelopment Project Area and the City.
Anticipated redevelopment programs and/or projects include Civic Center Master Plan
infrastructure improvements; public parking improvements; quarry reclamation; water system
improvements; Granite Drive improvements; a commercial rehabilitation program; Rocklin Road
interchange improvements; Dominguez overpass improvements; Midas under-grounding or over-
crossing; general drainage improvements; assistance in new affordable housing construction;
Granite Drive/Sierra Meadows parcel consolidation; development impact fee assistance; traffic
circulation system improvements; Safe Routes to School program; assistance to senior housing
projects; improvements to public facilities including, but not limited to, parks , performing arts
center, senior center, library, and community theater; Down Payment Assistance Programs
(ongoing); and a housing rehabilitation program (ongoing).
SPECIAL PLANNING AREAS
The City has established a number of special planning areas as part of the community planning
process. These areas include:

Land Use Element

Rocklin Downtown Revitalization Plan and Downtown Plan Update: The Downtown Revitalization
Plan area is generally defined as the area abutting Rocklin Road west of I-80 to Front Street and
Pacific Street from Midas Avenue to Farron Street. The Plan, adopted in 1988, guides physical
improvements in downtown Rocklin. The Plan seeks to enhance the potential for economic
development in the downtown area. The Plan contains guidelines for public and private
improvements relating to land use, circulation, parking, streetscape, architecture, lighting,
signage and historic preservation.
In February 2005 the City initiated a new planning effort to update the vision for development in
the Downtown Rocklin Area. The focus of the new plan is to address land use mix (particularly
providing for more residential living units incorporated in commercially designed projects),
parking, pedestrian movement, traffic and circulation, add more specificity regarding the design
of buildings and features and address promotion opportunities to provide a clear and strong
economic identity to the core downtown area. After review of conceptual versions of the new
Downtown Rocklin Plan in 2006, the City Council and the Planning Commission directed staff
to incorporate key portions of the new Downtown Rocklin Plan concepts including land use
densities and intensities into the General Plan Update. The more detailed components of the
Downtown Plan Regulating Code and Implementation Strategy are also being finalized and
processed as separate planning documents. Once completed, these documents will supersede the
1988 Downtown Revitalization Plan.
Rocklin Civic Center Plan: This Plan expanded the Civic Center into areas designated under the
1991 Rocklin General Plan and originally included Medium Density Residential, Medium High
Density residential, and Retail Commercial uses for the purpose of supporting development of
governmental operations and recreational and cultural facilities. The Plan, adopted in 1996, also
included an amendment to the City’s Circulation Element. Due to some areas of overlap between
the Civic Center Plan and the area addressed in the Downtown Plan Update (2009), the portions
of the Civic Center Plan dealing with commercial development will be superseded by the
Downtown Plan Update and identified with a Mixed Use land use designation to separate and
create consistency between the two plans. The resultant Civic Center Land Use Plan consists of
only residential designations and is shown in Figure 4-2.
Front Street Historical Area Master Plan: The Front Street Historical Area Master Plan was
adopted in 1982, with the intent to preserve and enhance structures located within the City’s
historical area, and to guide further development. The area where this Master Plan applies has
been designated as H-D (Historic District) on the City’s zoning map. The Plan identified
permitted uses in the area, established the Front Street Historic Committee, and established
architectural styling and design criteria. The Front Street Historical Area Master Plan will be
modified as necessary to ensure consistency with the new Downtown Rocklin Plan.
COMMUNITY DESIGN
Design Review
The City of Rocklin Zoning Ordinance provides for design review for multiple-family,
commercial and industrial developments through application of a Design Review procedure.
City of Rocklin General Plan                      4A-4                                 October 2012
Land Use Element

Due to the size, bulk, and height of many multiple-family, commercial and industrial
developments, the ordinance is intended to assure that project designs make the most efficient
use of available resources and are consistent with existing uses. The City established a Design
Review Board to be appointed by the Mayor, with the concurrence of the City Council. The
Planning Commission is currently the designated Design Review Board. The Design Review
Board must approve permits for new structures, alterations or remodeling and some single family
dwellings and associated accessory structures. The Design Review Board reviews site plans,
parking, lighting, signs, fencing, building elevations, materials, color scheme, landscape plans,
and preliminary grading plans. The criteria considered by the Design Review Board include:
•    Compatibility of height and scale of structures, including signs, with the surrounding area;
•    Preservation of natural topographic patterns and their incorporation into site plans;
•    Preservation of oak trees;
•    Orientation of structures to conserve energy;
•    Compatibility of different architectural styles;
•    Orientation and intensity of lighting;
•    Variable siting of individual structures;
•    Avoidance of monotony of texture, building lines or mass;
•    Avoidance of blank walls;
•    Variation in roof planes and exterior building walls;
•    Screening of roof flashing, rain gutters, vents, and roof-mounted mechanical equipment;
•    Signage guidelines;
•    Parking and landscaping guidelines.
The City has also adopted general development plans that include design guidelines or design
criteria that apply to specific projects. These include, but are not limited to: Whitney Oaks,
Clover Valley Lakes, Granite Lakes Estates, Mansion Oaks, commercial property on Sunset
Boulevard between Third and Whitney, Stanford Ranch, Granite Tech Center, the Highlands, the
North West Rocklin Annexation Area, the Rocklin Crossings Shopping Center, the Rocklin
Commons Shopping Center, and the Sunset West development.
Visual Survey
The City of Rocklin and the Rocklin planning area can be characterized as scenic, stimulating,
and contrasting. Topography varies from flat to hilly, with low lying areas, bluffs, ravines and
creeks. Some areas are still undeveloped and feature oak woodlands and riparian areas.
Sweeping vistas across low lying areas and ravines are common throughout the planning area.
Urbanized residential areas feature large newer homes in planned developments set in rolling
topography, and older residential areas exist in both flat and hilly areas. The circulation system
in the hillier portions of the City generally follows the topography, with curvilinear streets.
The original development area is located in the center of the City, and is referred to as
Central/Downtown Rocklin. This area is laid out in a grid street pattern, and includes most of
the City's historical structures, including buildings made from native granite. The City has
implemented a downtown beautification plan with streetscape improvements, including
decorative walkways and landscaped medians. More contemporary commercial areas are found

in locations throughout the planning area, including Stanford Ranch, Sunset West and the
Granite Drive/Sierra Meadows community area. The Redevelopment Project Area encompasses
the older areas of the City, and is characterized by some visual blight (vacant buildings, lack of
landscaping, buildings in need of rehabilitation).
The historic Union Pacific rail line corridor passes through Central Rocklin. Typical of most
older rail corridors, it does not always showcase the most attractive side of the community. Uses
along the corridor include older commercial and industrial areas, vacant lots and scattered
residences. In the Central Rocklin area, the appearance of portions of the corridor has been
upgraded through various efforts directed at downtown revitalization and redevelopment.
Other industrial uses are concentrated mainly near the Union Pacific Railroad tracks, which
bisect the planning area. Interstate 80 also bisects the planning area in a southwesterly to
northeasterly direction, while State Route 65 forms one of the City's southerly and westerly
boundaries.
Another visual feature that is relatively unique to Rocklin is the existence of granite quarries,
many with associated ponds.
Open space in the Rocklin planning area consists primarily of large swaths of native vegetation
and riparian areas which have been set aside as part of planned developments, often running
through the middle of these developments, and used by residents for walking and other
recreational activities. Developed parks are also interspersed throughout the neighborhoods of
Rocklin. Two golf courses serve as important open space features located throughout the City,
serving both as views from other vantage points and as areas from which views can be observed.
Scattered pockets of rural residential development exist throughout the planning area. The area
east of I-80 and north of Rocklin Road encompasses rural residential areas, as well as the Sierra
Community College campus.
The urbanized area of Rocklin is generally not visible from I-80 and State Route 65. Typical
views from these transportation corridors include rolling oak woodlands, the rear yards of some
residential areas, sound walls, and some commercial uses located along the south side of Granite
Drive. Many of the major arterial roads, especially in more recently developed areas, offer
sweeping vistas across canyons and views of bluffs. Maintaining these open vistas as additional
planned development occurs will be an ongoing challenge to the City.
The intensity of night lighting within the planning area varies from very low in residential and
rural residential areas to relatively high in commercial centers, the Central Rocklin area and
along Rocklin Road. It is anticipated that lighting intensity levels in newly developed areas,
while increasing from current levels due to street lighting and new commercial uses, will remain
relatively low due to use of contemporary lighting fixtures that shield and direct lighting
downward.
Photoplates 1 through 8 illustrate many of the features described above.

FUTURE LAND USE PATTERNS
The Land Use Diagram included in the pocket inside the back cover of this General Plan depicts
the major land use categories of residential, commercial, industrial, public, and
recreation/conservation, as well as mixed use categories. These basic categories are classified in
greater detail and defined in Table 4-1.
POPULATION DENSITY AND BUILDING INTENSITY STANDARDS
A general plan must contain standards for population density. Quantifiable standards of
population density must be provided for each of the land use categories contained in the plan.
Population density is best expressed as the relationship between two factors: the number of
dwellings per acre, and the number of residents per dwelling. Population density standards are
set forth in Table 4-1.
A general plan must also contain standards for building intensity. Local general plans must
contain quantifiable standards of building intensity for each land use designation. These
standards should define the most intensive use that will be allowed under each designation.
While the land use designation identifies the type of allowable uses, the building intensity
standard defines the concentration of use. Maximum dwelling units per acre is used as the
standard for residential uses. Floor area yield (the percentage of building floor area to the total
site area) is the standard used for commercial, industrial and public/quasi-public intensity.
Building intensity standards are set forth in Table 4-2.

GENERAL PLAN HOLDING CAPACITY
Based on available land and densities identified in this General Plan for the incorporated area and all
other areas within the City’s Sphere of Influence likely to be annexed, the total eventual population
of the City at “buildout” is estimated to be 76,136. Buildout will occur when all property designated
for residential uses within the City’s Sphere of Influence has been annexed, and all properties have
been developed with some use. Buildout does not preclude intensification of uses within the City.
In 2008, the City re-calculated its land use data as part of the General Update process and estimated
the number of housing units at full buildout including the a combination of residential land use
increases and decreases as well as intensification of land uses in the Downtown Rocklin Area. The
updated estimate for residential buildout is approximately 29,283 housing units. This represents an
increase of 1,505 units over the previous estimate (1994) of 27,778.
Population at buildout is estimated by multiplying the number of housing units by the estimated
number of persons per household. For purposes of this General Plan, the assumed average number of
persons per household in Rocklin is 2.6. Based upon that assumption, the City’s population at
buildout would be 76,136 + (2.6 multiplied by 29,283 housing units).
Since there is no certainty with regard to the actual pace of population growth, it is useful to develop
population projections based on a low, mid-range and high growth scenario. Table 4-3A provides a
range of growth scenarios. The low growth scenario assumes that residential building permits issued
will average 200 dwelling units per year. The mid-range growth scenario assumes that residential
building permits issued will average 400 dwelling units per year. The high-growth scenario assumes
that residential building permits issued will average 600 dwelling units per year. For planning
purposes, the City has assumed that the mid-range growth scenario is most likely over the buildout
horizon. However, the effect of the prolonged economic downturn beginning in 2007 is still
evolving, making both residential and non-residential absorption rates difficult to predict.

Table 4-3B presents non-residential development in the City of Rocklin between 2008 and
buildout.
In order to project buildout of non-residential development, the City estimated the annual
average absorption rate (historic) for each land use category based upon an annual average of the
actual growth that has occurred between 1992 and 2008. The timeframe selected includes both
slow and high growth cycles and would therefore normally be considered a reasonable estimate
for purposes of these projections. However, the pace of both residential and non-residential
growth has slowed significantly since 2008 and the timing for a rebound of growth in these
sectors is unknown.
The historic average annual growth for non-residential development between 1992 and 2008 is
as follows:
Retail – 140,975 square feet per year.
Office – 54,931 square feet per year.
Industrial – 72,076 square feet per year.
Based upon the assumption that non-residential development absorption in Rocklin will continue
to occur at rates that are similar to or slower than the trends shown above, buildout of non-
residential development, particularly retail and office uses, is anticipated to occur well beyond
the General Plan horizon year of 2030. In contrast, buildout of residential development within
the City would occur by the year 2028 under the mid-range scenario.
It should also be noted that the development of key non-residential growth catalysts (i.e., the
recently completed construction of an interchange at State Route 65/ Sunset Boulevard and
improvements to the freeway interchange at Sierra College Boulevard/I-80, and the future
construction of an interchange at State Route 65/Whitney Ranch Parkway) has the potential to
generate accelerated absorption of retail and office land uses in the vicinity of those facilities at
the time those improvements are completed. The effect of those growth catalysts on non-
residential absorption rates have not been factored into the data presented in Table 4-3B.

ZONING COMPATIBILITY MATRIX
Zoning is generally considered to be the primary tool for implementing the General Plan. State
law requires that the City’s Zoning Ordinance be consistent with the General Plan. This means
that the land uses allowed by the Zoning Ordinance must be compatible with the goals, policies
and land uses specified in the General Plan.
The consistency of existing City zoning categories with General Plan land use designations is
presented in Table 4-4.

Land Use Element
LU-10 Encourage preservation and adaptive reuse of significant historic structures and sites.
LU-11 Encourage infill residential development that is in keeping with the character and scale of
         the surrounding neighborhood, while providing a variety of densities and housing types
         as reflected by the zoning and land use designation of the infill property.
Policies for New Residential Land Use
LU-12 Provide a variety of residential land use designations that will meet the future needs of
         the City.
LU-13 Review proposals for new residential development for compatibility with the character
         and scale of nearby neighborhoods, while providing a variety of densities and housing
         types as reflected by the zoning and land use designation of the infill property.
LU-14 Buffer residential land uses locating adjacent to non-residential land uses through the use
         of landscaping, soundwalls, berms, fencing, open space setbacks, terrain features,
         greenbelts, building orientation, and/or other similar techniques.
LU-15 Restrict single family residential units proposed to be located adjacent to non-residential
         land uses to a single story where appropriate.
LU-16 To the extent feasible, require that new development in areas contiguous to neighboring
         jurisdictions be compatible with those existing land uses.
LU-17 Designate residential land according to the following densities:
                                                         Dwelling Units Per Gross Acre

          Dwelling units will be rounded to the nearest tenth.
         (Land use projects that propose fewer or more units than the designated residential land
         use density ranges allowed shall be considered inconsistent with the General Plan.)
         *        Density in this designation is typically calculated using net acreage. No individual
         parcel which has a Mixed Use land use designation is required to build a specific ratio of
         residential to non-residential development. Mixed Use designated parcels may be all
         residential, all non-residential, or a mix of residential and non-residential uses. However,
         if residential uses are developed, they must be within the density range assigned to the
         Mixed Use category as noted above.

B. OPEN SPACE, CONSERVATION & RECREATION
         ELEMENT
INTRODUCTION
The Open Space, Conservation and Recreation Element provides a description of the lands and
water that are unimproved and are to be devoted to natural uses through General Plan land use
designations, and a description of existing and planned recreation sites and facilities. Open
Space, Conservation and Recreation are combined in one element because the topics they cover
are closely related.
The Open Space and Conservation Elements are mandatory elements of the General Plan (they
must be included). The Recreation Element is an optional element. Including it in the City’s
General Plan reflects the importance of parks and recreational facilities and programs to the City
of Rocklin. It also establishes park standards that provide the basis for requiring new
development to dedicate park lands or pay fees toward acquisition and development of new
parks.
The Conservation Element addresses the conservation, development, and utilization of natural
resources. Conservation of water resources, heritage trees, soils and geologic features, creeks
and riparian habitat, plants and wildlife, flood protection, energy, air quality, minerals and
cultural resources is relevant to the Rocklin planning area and included in this Element. The
goals and policies for this Element reflect an increased emphasis on protection of valued natural
resources as the community continues to develop, and provide specific direction as to how that
protection should occur. Policy OCR-7 of this Element makes specific reference to the role the
City should take with regard to the Placer Legacy program. Placer Legacy is a voluntary County
program that has as its purpose the protection of the County’s open space and agricultural
resources.
The Open Space Element is intended to guide the comprehensive and long-range preservation
and conservation of “open space land,” which is defined in State law as any parcel or area of
land or water that is essentially unimproved and devoted to open space use. The Open Space
Element must address the following topics to the extent that they are locally relevant:
•    Open space for the preservation of natural resources
•    Open space for the managed production of resources
•    Open space for outdoor recreation
•    Open space for public health and safety
•    Demands for trail-oriented recreational use
•    Retention of all publicly-owned City and County trail routes with appropriate segments of
     the California Recreational Trails System
Planning for the preservation of the natural environment and the development and maintenance
of parks and recreation facilities enhances the quality of life in a community. Providing open
space area benefits the environment through the preservation of critical lands, combating air

pollution, and attenuating noise. The local community also benefits from the recreational and
educational opportunities that parks and open spaces provide. Finally, natural areas and parks
can help to shape urban growth in a community and bolster local economics by increasing
property values.
The City has taken a leading role in preserving open space corridors and other natural features in
newly developing areas. This approach is reflected in the open space goals and policies, which
in turn reflect the high interest expressed by Rocklin residents in the community survey in
preserving remaining areas for open space and outdoor recreation. The survey showed that
Rocklin residents value open space, park and recreation facilities, and the natural amenities of
the community. Construction of streets, schools and parks, protecting creeks and waterways,
preserving open space, and providing recreational programs and facilities were all ranked as
“very important” in the survey. Connectivity of habitat and open space areas is another
important issue that is addressed in the General Plan policies related to the preservation of open
space for natural resources. In addition to traditional parks, Rocklin contains areas of open space
that are rugged and undeveloped. Linear green space along creeks and other corridors is
encouraged, while recognizing that issues related to maintenance, security and access must also
be addressed. Linear open space areas can also be multi-purpose, including bicycle and
pedestrian paths.
This Element establishes a standard for developing 5 acres of parkland for each 1,000 residents.
It also establishes park location guidelines and park standards, which are intended to set forth
City requirements for future park and recreational facilities.
Cultural resources (archaeological and historical) are also addressed in this Element. The City of
Rocklin has a proud past, as described briefly in the section that follows. Identifying and
protecting the community’s cultural and historic resources benefits those who will follow in
future generations by protecting a sense of history and ensuring that an historic perspective is
retained. Such activities also benefit those who live in the City today by providing a longer-term
perspective that may encourage balance in making planning decisions for the type of community
to be created through the ongoing development process. This Element includes policies that
encourage recognition of historic structures and a stronger recognition of the City’s history.
This Element also recognizes the unique role of mineral resources in the City of Rocklin, both in
the past and in the present day, as evidenced by the presence of granite quarries in the
community. Although no quarries remain active, the former quarry sites help shape the physical
form and appearance of Rocklin.
In addition to the goals and policies, the Open Space Diagram is a part of the Open Space,
Conservation and Recreation Element. In the Rocklin General Plan, the Land Use Diagram
(found in the pocket inside the back cover of this document) depicts the Open Space Diagram.
Areas depicted on the General Plan Land Use Diagram as open space, conservation or recreation
shall be considered conceptual in dimension. The actual limits of these areas are further defined
when specific development projects are proposed and approved. Applications for development
entitlements are required to show the actual boundaries of open space, resource and conservation

DESCRIPTION OF EXISTING CONDITIONS
This section provides a description of the lands and waterways in the planning area that are
unimproved. This section addresses the natural resources of the planning area, including natural
habitats, vegetation and wildlife, soils, and mineral resources. Cultural resources and parks and
recreation are also described in this section.
MAJOR WATER COURSES
In 1972 the U.S. Congress enacted the Clean Water Act to maintain and restore the chemical,
physical, and biological integrity of the waters of the United States. Water bodies, water ways
and wetlands are protected under the Clean Water Act, which gives authority to the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers to regulate activities that could discharge fill or dredged material into the
waters of the United States. Under the Clean Water Act, wetlands are defined as areas that are
inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to
support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically
adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs,
and similar areas (Wetlands Delineation Manual, Corps of Engineers, 1987).
The City of Rocklin contains a variety of water-oriented sites including creeks, abandoned
granite quarries, ponds, riparian forested wetlands, and seasonal wetlands. Antelope Creek,
Secret Ravine Creek and Sucker Creek are perennial streams that provide riparian habitat for a
variety of animals. Pleasant Grove Creek and Clover Valley Creek are also significant streams
in the community. Other ephemeral streams exist during the rainy season. Seasonal wetlands in
the Rocklin area commonly occur within the grassland habitat areas. Vernal pools are seasonal
depression wetlands that are covered by shallow water for variable periods from winter to spring.
The water-oriented environments found within Rocklin provide important resources to a wide
variety of species. A map of major water courses, creeks and drainages is included as Figure 4-
3.
VEGETATION/WILDLIFE
The City of Rocklin planning area supports a variety of habitat types with numerous plant and
wildlife species. The predominant habitats included within the City limits are urban, annual
grassland, and oak woodlands. Riparian and streamside habitats and seasonal wetlands also
provide important habitats. These habitats are generally described as follows:
Urban: Common species of mature trees, shrubs and herbaceous vegetation are associated with
urban areas. Typically, the plants integrated into landscape designs are non-native species,
although many native oaks have been integrated into landscapes throughout the City of Rocklin.
The habitat value of these areas has been altered by the development of residential and
commercial structures, roadways and other urban facilities. Common wildlife species occurring
in the urban areas of Rocklin include: lesser goldfinch (Carduelis psaltria), scrub jay

(Aphelocoma caerulescens), Anna’s hummingbird (Calypte anna), house sparrow (Passer
domesticus), California ground squirrel (Spermophilus beecheyi), western gray squirrel (Sciurus
griseus), opossum (Didelphis virgiana), striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), raccoon (Procyon
lotor), and a variety of small rodents.
Annual Grasslands: Annual grassland habitats support relatively low plant diversity, and are
commonly dominated by wild oats, soft chess, and brome. Non-native species have invaded
much of the grasslands in California, and only scattered islands of native grasslands continue to
exist. The dominant plants in the planning area are introduced species that have largely replaced
native species due to intentional and unintentional introduction, changes in grazing pressures and
fire abatement practices. Common bird species supported by annual grasslands in the Rocklin
area include: western meadowlark (Sturnella neglecta), western kingbird (Tyrannus verticalis),
loggerhead shrike (Lanius ludovicianus) and Brewer’s blackbird (Euphagus cyanocephalus).
Predatory birds such as white-tailed kite (Elanus leucurus), American kestrel (Falco sparverius),
sharp-shinned hawk (Accipiter striatus), golden eagle (Aquila chrtsaetos), Cooper’s hawk
(Accipiter cooperii), red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), red-shouldered hawk (Buteo lineatus),
northern harrier (Circus cyaneus), burrowing owl (Athene cuniculari), and great horned owl
(Bubo virginianus) are typical of annual grasslands in the Rocklin area.
Seasonal Wetlands: Seasonal wetlands in the Rocklin planning area are characterized by vernal
pools that form in some areas during the rainy season in shallow hardpan depressions. A variety
of distinctive plant species flourish along the margins of these pools as water recedes in the
spring. A number of brackish, alkaline springs, known as salt seeps, exist within these grassland
areas. During the dry season, wildlife in these areas is similar to that described for annual
grassland habitats. However, when these pools fill with water, they provide habitat for aquatic
invertebrates, including a variety of insect larvae, and breeding sites for amphibians such as the
pacific tree-frog (Hyla regilla) and the western toad (Bufo boreas).
Riparian and Streamside Habitats: These habitats occur along the creeks, drainages, and adjacent
to ponds and marshy areas throughout the Rocklin planning area, and support a variety of
vegetation including various willow species, Himalayan blackberry, California buckeye, Valley
oaks, Fremont’s cottonwood and coyote brush. These habitats are an important resource in the
life cycle of many vertebrate species and can be expected to support a higher density of birds and
mammals. Typical riparian species include wood duck (Aix sponsa), red-shouldered hawk
(Buteo lineatus), belted kingfisher (Ceryle alcyon), black phoebe (Sayornis migricans), and
raccoon (Procyon lotor).
Oak Savannah/Oak-Foothill Woodlands: Oak savannah/oak-foothill woodland habitats in the
Rocklin planning area are dominated by blue oaks, valley oaks, and live oak species, and
underlain with herbaceous annual species found in the annual grassland communities.
Associations of predominately blue oak and digger pines are typical of oak-foothill woodland
habitats. Typical bird species found in these habitats include: western kingbird (Tyrannus
verticalis), Brewer’s blackbird (Eupagus cyanocephalus), mourning dove (Zenaida macroura),
turkey vulture (Cathartes aura), great horned owl (Bubo virginianus), acorn woodpecker
(Melanerpes formicivorus), western scrub-jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens), yellow-rumped
warbler (Dendroica coronata), and American kestrel (Falco sparverius). Other species typical

of this habitat include: black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus columbianus), western gray
squirrel (Sciurus griseus), arboreal salamander (Aneides lugubris), California newt (Taricha
torosa), southern alligator lizard (Gerrhonotus multicarinatus), Gilbert’s skink (Eumecis
gilberti), raccoons (Procyon lotor), coyote (Canis latrans) and mule deer (Odocoileus
hemionus).
WILDLIFE
Special-Status Species
Special-status species are those species that have been designated by federal, state, or local
agencies for special recognition. Listed and special-status species are defined as:
•    Listed as rare, threatened, or endangered by the California Department of Fish and Game
     (CDFG) or the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS);
•    Listed by CDFG as Species of Special Concern;
•    Protected under local regulations and policies.
Federal Endangered Species Act/California Endangered Species Act
The Federal Endangered Species Act (FESA) was enacted in 1973 in order to provide a means of
conserving endangered and threatened species and the ecosystems that support those species. In
1984, California enacted a similar law, the California Endangered Species Act (CESA). These
acts work in conjunction with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) to conserve the ecosystems upon which threatened and
endangered species depend. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) is responsible for
implementing FESA; the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) has authority over
CESA.
Species of Special Concern
The CDFG maintains a list of species of special concern that receive additional consideration.
Species of special concern are not protected under FESA or CESA, but are species whose
numbers are declining at a rate that could lead to listing, or have historically occurred in low
numbers and there are known threats to their continued existence.
Listed Special Status Species
The California Department of Fish and Game maintains the California Natural Diversity
Database (CNDDB), an inventory of the location and condition of California’s rare, threatened,
endangered, and sensitive plants, animals, and natural communities. On November 19, 2008 a
search of the CNDDB was performed for the Rocklin, Roseville, Clarksville, Folsom, Lincoln,
Citrus Heights, Pilot Hill, Auburn, and Gold Hill 7.5 USGS Quadrangles. A list of special-status
species is also maintained by the USFWS, and was searched by USFWS on September 11, 2008
for the same 7.5 USGS Quadrangles identified above.

Local Regulations and Policies
In addition to several General Plan policies related to special status species, the City of Rocklin
maintains an Oak Tree Preservation Ordinance regulating the protection and preservation of oak
trees along with mitigation measures for trees allowed to be removed. The ordinance applies to
oaks with a trunk diameter at breast height of six inches or more. Prior to removal of any native
oak, an application must be submitted for an Oak Tree Removal Permit. A certified arborist
report may be required prior to removal. Mitigation for removal may include replacement on a
one-to-one basis or greater ratio based on the diameter of the tree removed, payment into the
City’s Oak Tree Preservation Fund, or dedication of land. On finished single family residential
lots, oak trees can be removed with mitigation measures established in the ordinance to allow the
owner to build on the lot. On developed multifamily, commercial and industrial lots, oak trees
can be removed without mitigation only if dead or diseased. On property proposed for
development, preservation and removal of healthy oak trees is addressed during the development
application review process.
CULTURAL RESOURCES
The Rocklin planning area has a rich history, and the value of the area’s cultural and historical
resources is recognized in the General Plan. The following discussion is based on information
collected by Peak and Associates for the Open Space, Conservation and Recreation Element.
Prehistory
In the past, few archeological studies have been conducted in the planning area region. Early
excavations had focused either on the large, rich village sites in the Delta region and along the major
waterways in the Central Valley or on the higher elevation sites in proposed reservoir areas, along
major Sierran waterways. In general, research first established the patterns of human development
for each region, with later work emphasizing refinement of these patterns.
Increasing urbanization in the Sacramento region over the past twenty years has pushed
development further from the major drainages and into the margin of the Sacramento Valley and the
Sierran foothills. There is no pattern of human development through time, as defined by studies of
archaeological excavation for the region, but the cultural ties seem to be stronger to the Sierra
Nevada.
The City of Rocklin is located between three areas with defined patterns of human development:
the Oroville locality to the north, the Central Sierra area to the east and the Central Valley/Delta
area to the west. These prehistorical areas include many similar artifact types and dates for major
cultural changes, but there are also significant differences between them. It is not clear at present
which of these nearby patterns of development best reflects the prehistory of the City of Rocklin, or
if a separate local prehistorical description is necessary to adequately describe the area.
An excavation project by Chavez (1982) on sites on Linda Creek and Strap Ravine corroborated the
findings of earlier work that indicated that the strong Central Valley association characteristic of the
late prehistoric cultures in the foothill area might not extend to earlier cultures in the Rocklin
City of Rocklin General Plan                        4B-6                                    October 2012

vicinity. Although there are many similarities with the material culture of the Late Horizon of the
Central Valley, there are also significant points of diversion.
It is clear that the most recent prehistoric cultures of the area reflect, in general, the late cultures of
the Central Valley, though there are interesting local variations. Some of the differences clearly
result from the greater wealth and population in the valley, but other differences may reflect a
technological response to differing ecological settings and resource exploitation techniques.
In the preceding phase of prehistory there is a consistent expression of high Sierra Nevada and
Great Basin relationships of some sort. However, the projectile points that reflect this connection
are often produced on material imported from the Coast Ranges, although manufacturing on locally
available non-obsidian materials is much more common. The reasons for this situation are not clear.
This could also be a response to differing ecological settings, but the relationship between foothill
sites and the Martis Culture proper is an open question.
Sites in the planning area that contain prehistoric resources most commonly occur along
drainages, on flat ridges and terraces, and in areas that contain oak woodlands with rock outcrops
(Rocklin Civic Center Plan DEIR, L-9). Common prehistoric resources found in the area are
bedrock mortars. Typically, mortars do not represent a unique occurrence and are not considered
significant resources due to lack of research potential (Granite Lakes Estates DEIR, O-7). Other
prehistoric resources found in the area include lithic scatter, fire-fractured rock, ground stone
fragments, basalt flakes, and midden deposits (Sunset West DEIR, U-3; Granite Lakes Estates
DEIR, O-8; Clover Valley Lakes federal Section 106 draft management plan).
Ethnology
At the time of the Gold Rush, the planning area was occupied by the Nisenan Indians, identified by
the language they spoke. There have been several general treatments of the Nisenan culture by
Beals 1933; Kroeber 1929, 1953; Littlejohn 1928; Wilson and Towne 1978; and Wilson 1982.
There are also several articles on various aspects of their culture as reported in the bibliography and
elsewhere. The following discussion relies extensively on text by Norman Wilson, and where not
cited, is derived from Wilson and Towne 1978 and Wilson 1982.
The Nisenan peoples occupied the drainages of the Yuba, Bear, and the American Rivers from the
Sacramento River on the west to the summit of the Sierra in the east. The Foothill Nisenan peoples
were distinctive from the Valley Nisenan and were loosely organized into tribelets or districts with
large central villages, surrounded by smaller villages. These are often referred to as winter villages
by older Indians. These central villages and their leaders seemed to have had power or control over
the surrounding smaller villages and camps and specific surrounding territory (Beals 1933;
Littlejohn 1928; Wilson and Towne 1978). These districts were oriented to natural resources and
land forms. In the foothills and mountains the major drainages became formal or informal
boundaries with the land in between forming the district. Thus, the Placerville District is between
the Cosumnes River and the Middle Fork of the American River, the Auburn District between the
Middle Fork of the American River and the Bear River, and the Nevada City District between the
Bear River and the Yuba River.

Open Space, Conservation & Recreation Element
The Nisenan depended on activities attuned to the seasonal ripening of plant foods, the seasonal
movements and migration of the animals, and the runs of fish. With the flooding of the valley in the
winter and spring, a great number of animals such as elk, antelope and bears moved to the natural
levees along the rivers and up into the lower foothills. Along the foothill margins they joined the
resident and migratory deer herds. Huge flocks of waterfowl visited the flooded areas between the
rivers and the foothills, coveys of quail gathered in the fall, and pigeons were common in the fall
and spring. Steelhead and salmon ran up most of the major streams, including Secret Ravine, in the
fall, winter and spring. The hunting of these plentiful resources was part of the foothill way of life.
This same bounty was available to the river-oriented valley peoples out on the valley floor and
along the natural levees of the rivers.
There were major north-south Indian trails along the margin of the foothills that were usable year
around as well as other trails east and west along the natural levees of the stream courses. There
was probably not a great deal of competition for resources at this time except in lean years. Both
the Valley and Foothill peoples lived at the edges of rich ecotones: the rivers and the valley floor;
and the valley floor and the foothills.
While the Foothill Nisenan to the east in the foothills carried on trade with the valley peoples and
shared some of the cultural traits, their culture lacked the complexity and richness of the Valley
Nisenan. The Foothill Nisenan had a different resource base to work with, which required greater
mobility and more intense use of the available resources (Matson 1972). They developed a local
culture that was more closely oriented to the gathering, storage and year-round use of the acorn,
continual foraging of resources by everyone in the village group, specialized hunting strategies and
availability of different plants to gather and process (Erskian and Ritter 1972). They depended on
activities attuned to the seasonal ripening of plant foods and the seasonal migrations and increased
populations of animals and insects. The foothill people relied more on foraging for food, for
immediate use or short-term storage, rather than gathering for future needs. As a result, they had to
be much more mobile in their use of the land and its resources. Lower population densities and the
large number of campsites reflect the more limited ability to acquire and utilize the fewer available
resources.
This continual movement meant the Foothill people did not have large year-round villages. There
are no known major villages in the foothills or mountains that can compare with the valley
permanent village sites or population densities. Instead, there are hundreds of small campsites and
villages scattered across the foothills and mountains and specific localities have been identified as
the centers for gathering of these Foothill peoples. One of these villages in the City of Rocklin can
be identified as “Ba ka cha,” apparently occupied at the time of contact. The location of this site
correlates with the recorded location of a prehistoric site in the southeastern section of the City.
It appears that the Foothill people were more socially organized around the extended family than the
village, and would often camp in informal family groups around the central village. Since they did
some foraging and extensive fishing and hunting in the winter they needed to have some access to a
resource base at all times. However, due to the ability to store acorns and other dried foods and take
advantage of the winter concentrations of game, birds and fish, they could congregate in larger
villages in the wintertime. There is some evidence that these winter villages were relocated at times
if the local resources were largely depleted. Over a long period of time, a center village may have

been abandoned and moved and then reoccupied at a later time. Many place names refer to these
old or unoccupied sites.
At the central villages there was the need to build and maintain more substantial houses for winter
living. Larger family houses, a dance house and acorn granaries were part of these winter quarters.
The availability of firewood may also have been a factor in the preference for living up in the oak
woodlands of the foothills. Winter was the time of ceremonies, social gatherings and marriages.
Shamans had contests, children were trained, and trade items, tools, baskets and equipment were
made and repaired.
The introduction of malaria to central California circa 1831 occurred as a result of expeditions of
several fur brigades of the Hudson's Bay Company with infected individuals. The introduction of
the disease led to the tremendous epidemic of 1833 that decimated the Valley Nisenan population of
the region. It is estimated that three-quarters of the total Valley Nisenan population of the region
died from the disease in that year. The impacts of malaria played a major role in defining the post-
Contact land use pattern of the Indians of the region, as well as impacting Euro-American economic
development.
Gold Rush and Beyond
Malaria remained endemic in the region in the mining camps of the Sierran foothills, with frequent
sharp local outbreaks throughout the Central Valley until about 1880. The Third Biennial Report of
the State Board of Health published in 1875 referenced an undated article from The Placer Press
that reported, "Almost everybody living west of Gold Hill is either down with fever, or chills and
fever, or more or less affected by the miasmatic poison generated and floating around in that locale"
(Gray and Fontaine 1951:27).
Secret Ravine was the site of extensive placer mining in the 1850s and 1860s in the vicinity of
Newcastle, and also to the south around Stewarts Flat. Pine Grove, later Pino, was the center of
ravine diggings at that time (Gudde 1975:276). Pino is located at the modern location of the Town
of Loomis.
The Central Pacific Railroad arrived in Rocklin in May of 1864, making Rocklin an important
transportation center. It appears the name “Rocklin” was a corruption of Rock Land, because of the
extensive rock outcroppings in the area and the granite quarrying beginning to take place. It has
also been reported that the Finnish people changed the name to Rocklin, since the Finnish write the
name as Rocklissa or “in Rocklin” and “Rocklin” as Rockland (History of Rocklin California, Roy
Ruhkala, 1974).
A major locomotive terminal was established in Rocklin in 1866 because of its location at the
“bottom of the hill”. It served as the railroad’s roundhouse until 1908 when it moved to Roseville.
Trains were cut into two sections at Rocklin in order to ascend the grade of the Sierra Nevada
(California Department of Parks and Recreation 1990). The first shipment from Rocklin consisted
of three carloads of granite.

Rocklin became the principal granite-producing point in the Sacramento Valley. The first quarry
opened in 1863, and the stone was used in construction work on the Central Pacific for culverts.
The Rocklin quarries were comparatively close together, occurring in an area less than a mile square
on a gently rolling plain that borders the railroad.
By 1904, there were at least fifteen quarries in operation and several others idle. Most of the
quarries were small, employing from three to ten men. The largest quarry employed 33 men, and at
times, as many as 50. Most of the smaller quarries were operated by immigrant Finns, Russians,
and Italians. Each of the quarries had a railway spur connecting with the Southern Pacific Railroad
at Rocklin (Aubury, 1906:38-40).
Chinese workers had been brought in to work on the construction of the railroad after the Central
Pacific had completed 40 miles and federal funding became available. At that point the rail had
reached a point about four miles east of Auburn. The Rocklin-Roseville Chinatown was reportedly
situated between the communities of Rocklin and Roseville. Other reports indicate that Chinatown
was located behind and northeast of the roundhouse. On September 16, 1877, the Chinese living in
the community were forced to leave, and their buildings were destroyed after an incident in which
three non-Chinese were killed by a Chinese individual (McDannold 2000:166).
Although gold mining and quarrying remained important industries in Placer County, the value of
the land for cultivation was recognized very early. A variety of grains were experimented with
including wheat, oats, barley, and hay, and vineyards were planted in the valley and foothills.
The commercial fruit industry expanded rapidly in western Placer County in the late 1870s and
early 1880s, with the Central Pacific providing a wide market in the east for California's agricultural
products. A wide variety of fruits and nuts were raised, including citrus, apples, peaches, pears,
plums, cherries, olives, almonds, and walnuts (Lardner and Brock 1924:228-237). Chinese laborers
were reportedly used in the agricultural fields because they seemed to endure the malaria, while the
white laborers did not. In 1894, Japanese laborers began to move into the region, eventually
providing virtually all of the fruit orchard labor.
The City of Rocklin was incorporated in 1893, with a population of approximately 550.
Western Rocklin/Spring Valley Ranch
The Whitney family played an important role in the development of western Placer County.
Much of the western part of Rocklin is a portion of the vast Spring Valley Ranch of over 20,000
acres accumulated and held by the Whitney family, from the late 1850s until 1949 (Miller 1969).
George Whitney, the patriarch of the clan, was a seventh generation New Englander, from a family
of farmers. He attended Harvard and chose a life of business enterprise rather than following the
occupation of his forbears. George had six sons, George O., William J., Charles, Francis, Joel
Parker, and James G., all of whom but the youngest were trained in the mercantile business. The
family home was located in Gardner, Massachusetts, and the family traveled extensively throughout
the eastern states for both business and sporting expeditions.

After hearing of the discovery of gold in California, the elder Whitney brothers traveled overland to
the gold country. They chose to set up a mercantile business in San Francisco rather than try to
become rich through mining. Three years later, Joel Parker also came to California and took up
mining, then commercial game hunting, and eventually joined his brothers in the mercantile
business. He set up an independent shipping business, making at least eight transcontinental trips
by way of the Isthmus of Panama in the succeeding seven years.
During one of his return trips, George Whitney decided to visit his sons in California. He noted that
there was an increasing need for mutton and wool. Most of the sheep in California at the time were
from Texas, small in size with wool that was light and of an inferior quality. Since much of the
imported wool at the time came from Australia, the Whitneys decided that it might be profitable to
import Spanish Merino sheep from Australia to cross with Saxony rams from the east. General
Hollister, an acquaintance of the Whitneys and a major sheep grower in San Benito County, was
able to provide the family with some of his Saxony stock brought from Vermont. By 1856 the
sheep importation from Australia had been started with the purchase of 400 ewes. Of this initial
shipment, about 120 survived the long voyage. The flock was taken to Placer County and placed on
the open range with a herder.
The senior George Whitney initially purchased a half section of land for sheepraising headquarters
near what would become Rocklin. The 320-acre parcel was surrounded by thousands of
unoccupied acres and open land. Because the crossbred sheep were extremely prolific, there was a
need for new land within a few years. The Whitneys began acquiring all of the adjacent parcels as
soon as finances permitted. All of the brothers had some interest in the business; the father and
brothers would regularly travel from San Francisco to the ranch to check on the flock and bring
supplies for the herder. By the time the senior Whitney died in 1873, J. Parker Whitney had
acquired control of the range and had 15,000 head of sheep.
J. Parker Whitney traveled extensively and had business interests in Colorado, New Mexico, and
other parts of California. He built his family home near Rocklin on the lands acquired for the sheep
business. His home site, known as the Spring Valley Ranch, included at least twenty buildings.
Further improving his ranch in 1871, Whitney built major engineering works to provide a better
water supply for the ranch. The water system allowed him to plant orchards and vineyards near the
headquarters of the ranch in Spring Valley. After 1875 Whitney began to cultivate all of the
available grain land on the ranch. Since the cultivation of grains required vast tracts of land in order
to turn a profit, it is not surprising that Whitney dedicated 8,000 acres of his ranch to this
production. Spread throughout the remainder of the vast acreage of the ranch lands were 11 sets of
farm buildings, each of which usually included a small house with a few utility buildings and a barn
for various farm animals (Miller 1969:159-167).
To connect the different buildings on the ranch complex, Whitney constructed over twenty-five
miles of roads. These roads were approximately twenty-five feet wide and well crowned, with a
slope of about two feet from the center of the road down to ditches on either side. The roads were
surfaced with decomposed granite quarried from a pit on the ranch. Twelve granite bridges crossed
the creeks on the main road from Rocklin to the headquarters. This road continued from the ranch
headquarters through the vineyard near the main house and around the back of the ranch (Miller
1969: 181).

Whitney maintained the roads with three horse-drawn graders. The largest was a huge iron and oak
grader that required three men and a team of four heavy horses for operation. He also had a small,
light iron and oak grader that required only two men to operate. The final horse-drawn grader,
purchased around 1900, was a small, light iron-wheel grader that could be drawn by a team of light
horses but still required two men for operation. These graders had been abandoned in the ranch
dump by 1939 (Miller 1969: 181).
J. Parker Whitney initiated the development of an agricultural area named "English Colony" at
Loomis in 1889, with 2,000 to 3,000 acres subdivided for colonists from England. Whitney and
others tried to establish an English countryside in the Placer County foothills between Loomis and
Newcastle, building fine homes and establishing a country club. Malaria, combined with the
financial depression of 1893 to 1897, ruined the colony. The wealth of many of the colonists might
have weathered the depression, but they could not withstand the disease. After the demise of the
colony, the orchards became full bearing and very profitable, worked by Asian labor forces.
J.P. Whitney retained control of the ranch until his death in 1913. His son Parker Whitney
continued management at the ranch until his death eleven years later. During the subsequent years,
the heirs sold off the ranch in large parcels, with the final sale in 1946 containing the old mansion
(Sacramento Bee, October 23, 1958).
The seasonal drying of the grasslands, resulting in a loss of a pasture land for livestock herds, led
pioneer ranchers to use higher elevation grasslands for summer and fall grazing. The ranchers could
find ample grasslands in the mountain regions, and could move the herds of cattle and sheep in May
to graze on the vast acreages of unclaimed land at the higher elevations until the late fall. The herds
had to be moved to lower elevations prior to the first snowstorms that marked the onset of winter.
At lower elevations in the area of concern, the fall rains would bring the regeneration of the grasses
at the home ranch, allowing return of the herds for the winter and spring. This pattern of seasonal
transhumance, as ancient as domestic livestock raising itself, is found throughout the world among
cattle and sheep raising peoples; it was a practice that would have been familiar to immigrants from
many different areas of Europe, Latin America, and the eastern United States (Jordan 1993).
Without a large herd of cattle or sheep, pioneer ranchers would not find seasonal transhumance to
be commercially cost-efficient. Moreover, because of the low carrying capacity of the pasture lands
in the western portion of what is now Rocklin, a 160-acre tract could not maintain a sufficient
number of animals to achieve efficiency of scale in stock-raising, even with the practice of seasonal
transhumance. But larger landowners with substantial available cash could hire lower cost outside
laborers. Thus, in the process of adapting established rural agricultural practices to this environment
of seasonally meager natural resources, the earliest farmers and stockraisers encountered an inherent
pressure either to create large holdings, with a substantial investment in both livestock and land, or
to sell their claims to newcomers who had the economic resources and the market-centered
discipline to create such large holdings.
By the early 1870s it had become virtually impossible to earn a living from the smaller parcels of
land within the region. Landowners such as the Whitneys began acquiring their neighbors'
holdings, allowing larger herds to be maintained on the combined parcels.

The mixed economic strategy utilized by the early occupants of the arid landscape gradually became
replaced by a single strategy: the large-scale production of cattle and sheep. Most early landowners
disappeared from the records after the sale of their land.
The later apparent "success" of some of the ranchers of the region appears to be keyed to their
ability to acquire large tracts of land for both summer and winter range. It must have been
necessary to be "land poor" for some time, to become financially secure. Whitney began land poor
in Placer County, but soon acquired a sizable wealth, perhaps due in part to the unified businesses
and cooperative nature within the Whitney family, as well as the proximity of the ranch to the major
transcontinental railroad line for shipping agricultural products to a wider market. J. P. Whitney's
business acumen and diversified interests in other regions and states allowed him capital to invest in
the acquisition of additional lands, to acquire water rights and develop water systems, to use the
land in part for vineyards and orchards, and to experiment with different types of animals and crops,
without risking his livelihood, unlike the smaller rancher or farmer in the same environment.
Whitney perhaps provides the best example of the successful use of a marginal territory. Even so,
water for agricultural use continued to be a problem. Ultimately, the major portion of the ranch
remained in use for seasonal grazing.
Although the Spring Valley Ranch was subdivided, the former ranch lands remained in large tracts
in the hands of a few families who continued to use the land for ranching. During the late 1950s
and early 1960s, the increased urbanization and expansion of suburban communities from
Sacramento to the northeast, along the Highway 80 corridor, led to growth of the housing market in
the Rocklin community. Beginning in the 1980s, the lower cost of living and land drew high
technology firms and other industries to the region, resulting in the subsequent commercial and
residential development and expansion of the communities of Roseville, Rocklin, and Lincoln,
virtually closing out the era of the large cattle ranches.
Until recent years, the lands of western Rocklin continued to be leased by the property owners to
ranchers of the region for grazing their cattle in the winter and spring months. Local ranchers still
take their cattle herds to summer range in the Sierra, thus demonstrating the long-term persistence of
the traditional pattern of seasonal movement of livestock and herders to different grazing grounds as
an environmental adaptation to a region of limited, seasonally fluctuating natural resources.
Although now fully integrated into the wider market economy, these operations demonstrate the
persistence of economic strategies that allowed the long-term survival of Euro-American settlers
within a marginal environment.
Historic resources found in the area are representative of Rocklin’s history. Resources that are
typical to quarry areas include quarry pits, waste rock piles, derricks, derrick bases, derrick tie-
downs, various outbuilding and shed remnants, rock alignments, and granite fence posts (Rocklin
Civic Center Plan L-6). Remnants of the Spring Valley Ranch can be found throughout the area.
Some of these resources are rock fences, old buildings and foundations, and bridges.

Large portions of the City have been studied as part of the City’s environmental review processes in
areas where new development has been proposed. Most of these surveys deal with more recent
developments that have occurred primarily outside of the Central Rocklin area. As a result, there
are heavy concentrations of more recent sites recorded in the northern, northwestern and
southeastern sections of the City, but very few in the central area. For several of these project areas
such as Stanford Ranch, Whitney Oaks, North West Rocklin, Sunset West, Granite Lakes Estates
and Clover Valley, a management plan has been prepared for federal Section 106 review that guides
the long-term treatment and management of the resources.
There is no reliable predictor of site location apparent from the site distribution. As one would
expect, there are concentrations of prehistoric sites along reliable watercourses such as Pleasant
Grove Creek and Clover Valley Creek, but there are many sites that are not located near main
watercourses. Historic sites are even less constrained by the topography.
The bulk of the prehistoric sites have bedrock mortars (grinding holes) in association. Part of this is
probably due to visibility. Bedrock mortars are much easier to find in tall grass than flake scatters.
Part of the high incidence of mortars also results from increased population in this ecological zone,
after the development of mortar and pestle technology made the oak park land zone a favored
environment.
PALEONTOLOGICAL RESOURCES
Fossil remains of prehistoric plant and animal life could be found in the sedimentary rocks and
volcanic rock sedimentary materials that are present throughout Placer County. Sediments
associated with the Mehrten Formation in the Roseville area have been found to contain fossils of
terrestrial vertebrates. Fossilized animal remains also may be present in caves associated with the
limestone geology that can be found in the central part of the Sierra Nevada foothills. A search of
the University of California Museum of Paleontology (UCMP) collections database indicated that
the fossilized remains of mammalian vertebrates have been discovered in the Rocklin General Plan
Update Planning Area. In addition, the search identified 37 other locations in the county where
fossils have been discovered.

GRANITE AND GRAVEL EXTRACTION
Granite extraction is an important part of Rocklin's identity. Starting in the 1860s the granite
business was a driving force behind early population growth in Rocklin. It has influenced the
City's demographics, economy, and aesthetics.
Roy Ruhkala is a long standing member of the Rocklin community and the Rocklin Historical
Society. His father, Matt Ruhkala, started working in the Rocklin granite business in 1889, and
established the Union Granite Company in 1904. The Ruhkala family still runs the Ruhkala
Granite & Marble Company, Inc. today. In 1975 Roy Ruhkala wrote a History of Rocklin. The
following discussion of granite and gravel extraction is based on that account, information
provided by Peak and Associates, and personal communication with Mr. Ruhkala.
The granite found in Rocklin is optimal because it is even-textured, very hard, available in large
blocks and takes a high polish. It was used extensively in memorial and building work, and has
been used in many important projects including the State Capitol, the United States Mint in San
Francisco, Pearl Harbor and Mare Island Drydocks, the Sacramento River levee maintenance,
several city halls, and city and county courthouses and jails. See the discussion above, the Gold
Rush and Beyond, for additional history on the granite quarries.
One commercial business, Big Gun Quarry, was the last active granite quarry in Rocklin. The
granite that the Ruhkala business currently uses is imported from other areas of California, the
U.S. and from all over the world.
Gravel was seldom commercially excavated in Rocklin due to the concern over the presence of
mica. Mica weathers differentially and is sometimes detrimental to gravel aesthetics and
durability.
SOILS
The planning area is part of the Loomis Basin, situated in the western foothills of the Sierra
Nevada Range. Soils in the planning area have resulted from stream erosion during the episodic
uplifting of the Sierra Nevada Range combined with volcanic activity.
Soils within the planning area are generally of poor quality, and do not support commercial
agricultural activities, with the exception of livestock grazing. In addition, several of the soil
types found within the planning area require special review and consideration where construction
of foundations, structures, roadway and underground infrastructure are proposed, due to their
stony and unconsolidated nature.
The United States Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service (USDA-
NRCS) completed a soil survey of Western Placer County in 1980. The dominant soil types
found within the City of Rocklin are:

Alamo Fiddyment complex. This soil occurs at elevation of 50 to 500 feet. It is moderately deep
and somewhat poorly drained on hill terraces. It has very slow permeability and slow surface
runoff with a low to moderately high erosion hazard.
Alamo Variant clay. This soil occurs at elevation of 100 to 200 feet. It is moderately deep, gently
sloping, somewhat poorly drained clay on alluvial bottoms and rolling foot slopes in valleys
between volcanic ridges. It has very slow permeability and slow to medium surface runoff with
slight to moderate erosion hazard.
Andregg coarse sandy loam. This soil occurs at elevations of 200 to 1,000 feet. It is moderately
deep, gently rolling, and well drained, underlain by weathered granitic bedrock. Permeability is
moderately rapid and surface runoff is medium with a moderate erosion hazard.
Andregg-Shenandoah complex. This soil occurs at elevations of 200 to 1,800 feet. It is
moderately deep, strongly sloping, and well drained. Permeability is moderately rapid and
surface runoff is slow to rapid. The hazard of erosion is slight to moderate.
Caperton-Rock outcrop complex. This soil occurs at elevations of 200 to 1,500 feet. It is
shallow, somewhat excessively drained soil with moderately rapid permeability. The hazard of
erosion is moderate to high.
Cometa sandy loam. This soil occurs at elevations of 75 to 200 feet. It is deep and well drained
on low hill terraces. Permeability is very slow and surface runoff is slow to medium. The hazard
of erosion is slight.
Cometa-Fiddyment complex. This soil occurs at elevations of 75 to 200 feet. It is deep to
moderately deep and well drained on low hill terraces. It has a slow permeability rate and slow
surface runoff with a slight erosion hazard potential.
Cometa –Ramona sandy loams. This soil occurs at 75 to 200 feet. It is about 50 percent Cometa
soil on short side slopes and bottoms, and 30 percent Ramona soil on fingerlike ridges and
younger land surfaces. The Cometa soil is deep and well drained, with very slow permeability
and slow surface runoff. The Ramona soil is very deep and well drained with moderately slow
permeability and medium runoff. The hazard of erosion is slight.
Exchequer very stony loam. This is a shallow, somewhat excessively drained very stony soil
underlain by hard andesitic breccia and occurring at 100 to 2,000 feet. It has moderate
permeability, medium surface runoff and a slight to moderate hazard of erosion.
Exchequer-Rock outcrop complex. Occurring at 100 to 1,000 feet, this soil is approximately 60
percent Exchequer soil and 15 percent andesitic breccia (lava cap). The Exchequer soil is
shallow, somewhat excessively drained very stony soil with moderate permeability, medium to
rapid surface runoff, and slight to high hazard of erosion. Rock outcrops consists of areas of
hard andesitic breccia 50 to 500 square feet in size.

Fiddyment-Kaseberg loams. Occurring as undulating to gently rolling soils on low siltstone
terraces at elevations of 75 to 135 feet, this soil is approximately 50 percent Fiddyment soil and
30 percent Kaseberg soil. The Fiddyment soil is moderately deep over a hardpan and is well
drained, moderately deep, with slow permeability, slow to medium surface runoff and a slight to
moderate hazard of erosion. The Kaseberg soil is shallow over hardpan and is well drained with
moderate permeability, slow to medium surface runoff and has a slight to moderate hazard of
erosion.
Inks cobbly loam. This soil occurs at elevations of 200 to 1,200 feet. This shallow soil is well
drained and sloping. It is moderately permeable with medium to rapid runoff characteristics. The
hazard of erosion is high.
Inks-Exchequer complex, 2-25% slopes. Occurring at elevation of 200 to 1,200 feet, this soil is
approximately 40 percent Inks soil and 30 percent Exchequer soil. The Inks soil is shallow, well
drained cobbly soil that has moderate permeability, medium surface runoff and has a slight to
moderate hazard of erosion. The Exchequer soil is shallow, somewhat excessively drained very
stony soil with moderate permeability, medium to rapid surface runoff, and slight to high hazard
of erosion.
Xerofluvents, occasionally flooded. This soil is found adjacent to stream channels and consists of
small areas of moderately well drained loamy alluvium. Areas containing this soil type are
occasionally flooded by stream overflow and therefore are not considered suited for urban uses
because of their flood potential. This soil is very deep and possesses a slight hazard for erosion.
Xerofluvents, frequently flooded. This moderately deep soil is found adjacent to stream channels
and consists of narrow stringers of somewhat poorly drained recent alluvium. Areas containing
this soil type are subject to frequent flooding and channelization and therefore are not considered
suited for urban uses due to their flood hazard. This soil is poorly drained and possesses a high
hazard for erosion.
Xerofluvents, cut and fill areas. This soil type consists of mechanically removed and mixed soil
material used primarily for highways and urban development. Cut and fill areas are typically
well drained with a very rapid surface runoff. These areas have a moderate erosion hazard.
Xerofluvents, placer areas. This soil type consists of stony, cobbly, and gravelly material and is
found adjacent to streams that have been placer mined. The erosion potential of this soil type is
variable.
Rubble land. Rubble land consists of areas where the majority of the surface is covered by stones
or boulders. Rubble land typically is made up of cobbly and stony mine debris and tailings from
dredge or hydraulic mining.
FARMLAND RESOURCES
The California Department of Conservation (CDC) integrates the USDA-NRCS Soil Surveys
information and current land use information to determine Important Farmland designations. In
City of Rocklin General Plan                     4B-18                                  October 2012

1982, the Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program (FMMP) was established to assess the
location, quality and quantity of agricultural lands. The inventory is updated every two years.
FMMP also maps Interim Farmland for which no USDA-NRCS Soil Surveys are available. The
CDC defines the Important Farmland designations as follows:
Prime Farmland. Farmland with the best combination of physical and chemical features able to
sustain long term production of agricultural crops. This land has the soil quality, growing
season, and moisture supply needed to produce sustained high yields. To be included, the
applicable land must have been used for production of irrigated crops at some time during the
four years prior to the mapping date.
Farmland of Statewide Importance. Farmland similar to Prime Farmland but with minor
shortcomings, such as greater slopes or less ability to store soil moisture. Land must have been
used for production of irrigated crops at some time during the four years prior to the mapping
date.
Unique Farmland. Farmland of lesser quality soils used for the production of the state’s leading
agricultural crops. This land is usually irrigated, but may include non-irrigated orchards or
vineyards as found in some climatic zones in California. Land must have been cropped at some
time during the four years prior to the mapping date.
Farmland of Local Importance. Land of importance to the local agricultural economy as
determined by each county’s board of supervisors and a local advisory committee. For Placer
County this includes: lands zoned for agriculture by County Ordinance and the California Land
Conservation Act as well as dry farmed lands, irrigated pasture lands, and other agricultural
lands of significant economic importance to the county and include lands that have a potential
for irrigation from Placer County water supplies.
Grazing land. Land on which the existing vegetation is suited to the grazing of livestock. The
minimum mapping unit for Grazing Land is 40 acres.
Urban and Built up land. Land occupied by structures with a building density of at least 1 unit to
1.5 acres or approximately 6 structures to a 10-acre parcel. This land is used for residential,
industrial, commercial, construction, institutional, public administration railroad and other
transportation yards, cemeteries, airports, golf courses, sanitary landfills, sewage treatment,
water control structures, and other developed purposes.
Other land. Land not included in any other mapping category.
Water. Perennial water bodies with an extent of at least 40 acres.
The Rocklin planning area is primarily designated as Urban/Built-up Land, Grazing Land or
Other Land, but also includes a small area of Farmland of Statewide Importance. The small area
of Farmland of Statewide Importance represents the remnants of a historical olive orchard that is
no longer in production, and has not been in production or actively irrigated for some time.

PRESERVATION OF OPEN SPACE
Through its development, the City of Rocklin has placed high importance on the preservation of
open space throughout the community. Some open space areas have been designated to retain
unique natural features and characteristics. Others have been established to preclude
development in areas with significant physical constraints.
Examples of natural features that have been incorporated into the many open space areas that
traverse through the City include oak woodlands, wetlands, archaeological sites, water filled
quarries, and numerous creeks including Secret Ravine Creek, Sucker Creek, Antelope Creek,
Clover Valley Creek, Orchard Creek, and Pleasant Grove Creek. Areas with significant physical
constraints that have been retained in their natural condition include locations within the 100-
year floodplain and areas containing steep slopes.
Through its efforts, the City has been successful in retaining approximately 2,200 acres of open
space including both improved and unimproved park land. This equates to approximately 19% of
the total acreage within the Planning Area. This does not include the 359 acres occupied by both
the Whitney Oaks and Sunset Whitney Golf Courses (which would add another 3% to the total)
or all of the areas within private property where open space and conservation easements have
been applied, but the land may not be formally designated as open space on the Land Use
Diagram.
PARKS AND RECREATION FACILITIES
The City owns 31 parks that consist of 428+/- acres of parkland that includes 219+/- improved
acres. 30 of the parks are fully or partially developed (5 community parks, and 25 neighborhood
parks). There will be 2-3 future parks (not yet dedicated to the city) located in the Whitney
Ranch and Clover Valley projects. At build-out the City will have 33 or 34 parks totaling over
440 acres of improved and unimproved land. The Rocklin Unified School District (RUSD)
operates ten elementary schools, two middle schools, two comprehensive high schools, and one
continuation high school and one independent study school. RUSD also provides additional
recreational field space and open space within the City. Future school facilities projected include
a middle school and two new elementary schools. The attributes of the city parks are
summarized in Table 4-6, and the locations of the parks, schools, and recreational facilities are
shown on Figure 4-5.
The City of Rocklin Community Services & Facilities Department develops, maintains, and
operates all City-owned park and recreation facilities. The City of Rocklin has a City Council-
appointed Recreation Commission. The Commission serves as an advisory board to the City
Council on matters including parkland acquisition, design and development, and recreation
programs and activities.
PARKS AND RECREATION FACILITIES FEES AND STANDARDS
The City has adopted park and recreation facilities improvement fees to finance parks and city-
wide recreational facilities improvements to reduce the impacts of increased use on existing
facilities. New developments are required to either dedicate parkland or pay park development

fees based on a General Plan standard of 5.0 acres per 1000 residents. In addition, the City has
negotiated “turnkey” provisions whereby developers construct parks and install recreational
equipment within parks as part of development projects. This allows developers to market their
projects with a known time frame as to when new residents can expect completion of parks
within their neighborhoods.
With an estimated 2008 population of 53,843 people, and 428 acres of parks (219 improved
acres), Rocklin has 7.94 acres of parks (4.07 improved acres) per 1,000 people. With the
additional acreage of planned future parks bringing the City’s total park acreage to 440,
Rocklin’s population could increase to approximately 88,000 and still provide five acres of parks
per 1,000 residents. Based upon current land use assumptions and projections including the
intensification of land uses in the Downtown Rocklin area, the City’s population is estimated to
be 76,136 at buildout.
Definitions
Park standards are intended to establish City requirements for future park and recreational
facilities. In developing park standards, the City of Rocklin adopted standards as part of the 1991
General Plan, and carries those standards into this General Plan Update. These standards are
related to the designation of the park as follows:
Mini-Park. A park of 1 acre or less, serving a radius within 1/4 mile. It is a specialized facility
that serves a concentrated or limited population or specific group such as tots or senior citizens.
Neighborhood Park. A park of 1 to 10 acres, serving a 1/4 to 1/2 mile radius. Typical
improvements may include but are not limited to preschool and school-aged playgrounds,
(unlighted) open turf fields, pathways, basketball court, sand volleyball court, small covered
picnic area, and open space areas. Neighborhood parks do not contain lighted sports fields and
restrooms are included on the park master plan but are not typically constructed.
Community Park. A park of 10+ acres, serving a 1 to 2 mile radius. Typical improvements may
include but are not limited to lighted sports and multi-use fields, community centers and other
recreation buildings, large group picnic areas, pathways, preschool and school-aged playgrounds,
off street parking, aquatics centers, restrooms, and other large or heavy-use recreation facilities.
Community parks may also have large areas of undeveloped open space that may include oak
tree groves and creeks.
Special Use Park. No specific size or service area. It includes areas for specialized or single-
purpose recreational activities, such as golf courses, nature centers, zoos, conservatories,
arboreta, display gardens, arenas, outdoor theaters, gun ranges, or areas that preserve, maintain,
and interpret buildings, sites, and objects of archaeological, historical or cultural significance.
Special use parks can also be located in plazas or squares in or near commercial centers,
boulevards, or parkways.
Conservancy. No specific size or service area. It provides for protection and management of the
natural/cultural environment with recreation use as a secondary objective.

Park Location Guidelines
The following are guidelines for selection of potential new park sites. Each site will have its
own merits; however, application of these guidelines will assist in the determination of a
potential site’s suitability for park use.
•   The site should help preserve valuable natural and historical features, such as evidence of
    past mining activities, historic structures or buildings, oak woodlands, creeks and riparian
    areas, hilltops and natural areas.
•   The site should be easily accessible.
•   The site should allow multi-purpose use.
•   Where possible, neighborhood parks should be located adjacent to elementary schools, other
    public open space, or public facilities.

C. Circulation Elemen
C. CIRCULATION ELEMENT
INTRODUCTION
The Circulation Element provides a description of streets and roads, highways, transit services,
bicycle/pedestrian facilities, and other transportation services and facilities within the City and
the planning area. This Element provides a plan for the future transportation, transit and
bicycle/pedestrian services and facilities necessary to accommodate and serve the development
of the City envisioned in the Land Use Element.
The City of Rocklin was incorporated in 1893, and was founded in the 1860s. A city that has
been in existence for over 100 years has older areas that do not lend themselves to conventional
roadway improvements or solutions such as road widening. In addition to the cost of acquiring
right-of-way in older areas, road widening can adversely affect the developed fabric of the
community and irreversibly impact its appearance and historic resources. In these areas, creative
solutions to roadway congestion must be sought, such as one way streets, traffic calming
measures, roundabouts, or modified improvement standards. It is also recognized that a certain
amount of congestion and slowing of traffic must be accepted in these areas, and indeed can
contribute to the charm or ambience of older areas of the community.
Pursuant to Government Code Section 65302(b)(2)(A) and (B), the City has embraced the
concept of establishing “Complete Streets”, as well as, off-street bicycle and pedestrian trails, to
the extent feasible. This commitment is expressed through goals and policies within various
elements of the General Plan.
Complete streets are defined by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) as, “A
transportation facility that is planned, designed, operated and maintained to provide safe mobility
for all users, including bicyclists, pedestrians, transit, vehicles, truckers, and motorists,
appropriate to the function and context of the facility. Complete street concepts apply to rural,
suburban, and urban areas.”
Complete streets in a urban or suburban setting are considered to not only safely accommodate
all modes of transportation, but they include landscaping and other amenities designed to
improve the experience of all users, while providing direct access to goods, services, schools,
parks, and other desirable destinations within the City. Additional potential benefits of a
multimodal transportation network include offering solutions to roadway traffic conditions, the
promotion of healthy active lifestyles for residents and greenhouse gas emission reductions.
Policies contained in the Land Use, Circulation, and Open Space, Conservation and Recreation
Element articulate the City’s intent to implement the Complete Streets concept, by focusing on
activities and efforts, including, but not limited to:
•    Encouraging mixed land use patterns and pedestrian oriented streetscapes, particularly within
     the Rocklin Downtown Area. Mixed uses will also be considered in other appropriate
     locations in the City along major transportation corridors.
City of Rocklin General Plan                      4C-1                                  October 2012
Circulation Element

•    Planning and providing accommodations for bicycles, pedestrians and Neighborhood Electric
     Vehicles (NEV) and other amenities on new streets or while upgrading existing streets, as
     funding and physical limitations permit.
•    Evaluating opportunities to improve or provide for non-vehicular facilities and connections
     when modifications to existing streets, interchanges and over or under crossings are
     considered.
•    Continuing to implement appropriate City street standards as new development is considered
     and approved.
•    Continuing to implement the “Safe Routes to Schools” program in older sections of Rocklin
     where sidewalks do not currently exist.
•    Continuing to implement development of the City’s urban forest, particularly along street
     rights-of-way.
•    Continuing to provide for fixed route transit and dial-a-ride services within the community
     through contracts with Placer County Transit (PCT) or other providers.
•    Pursuing grants and other sources of funding for roadway, bicycle, pedestrian and NEV
     improvements.
•    Maintaining and periodically updating the City’s Bikeway Diagram, as well as,
     implementing planned bicycle improvements through both development and roadway
     projects.
•    Applying land use patterns within the Community which will provide employment
     opportunities for residents and potentially reduce vehicle miles traveled (VMT) through and
     outside of Rocklin.
•    Emphasizing the need for non-vehicular connections and amenities within new commercial
     development and between residential neighborhoods and commercial uses.
•    Requiring that amenities such as bicycle parking be incorporated into new non-residential
     development proposals.
In the broader picture, traffic issues in the City of Rocklin cannot be isolated from the larger
south Placer region of which it is a part. The City of Rocklin is virtually surrounded by other
cities. Traffic to and from the cities of Roseville, Lincoln, and the Town of Loomis, all which
Rocklin shares a boundary with, affects roadway volumes and Level of Service in Rocklin, and
must be factored into traffic forecasts and future transportation system improvements. Traffic
from Interstate 80 and State Route 65 must similarly be considered. The goals and policies of
the Circulation Element also address these regional traffic issues.
City of Rocklin General Plan                     4C-2                                 October 2012
Circulation Element

The goals and policies are grouped by transportation mode: roadways, transit, and
bikes/trails/NEV’s.
In addition to the goals and policies, the following diagrams are a part of the Circulation
Element:
•    Functional Classification System
•    Bikeway Diagram
•    2030 Road Improvements
The State General Plan Guidelines provide that the Circulation Element should also address the
circulation of energy, water, sewage, storm drainage, and communications. In the Rocklin
General Plan, those topics are addressed in the Public Services and Facilities Element.
This Section describes the existing transportation system, services and facilities within the City
of Rocklin and the planning area, including streets and highways, transit services and bikeways.
STREETS AND HIGHWAYS
The Circulation Element classifies roadways according to the following hierarchy:
•    State/Interstate Highway
•    Arterial
•    Collector
•    Local
Descriptions of the interstate and state highways and arterial roadways in the Rocklin Planning
Area are provided below:
Interstate Route 80 (I-80) provides the primary regional access to Rocklin, Roseville, Loomis, and
the remainder of Placer County. To the west, the roadway continues into Sacramento County
and the Bay Area. To the east, the roadway continues through Placer County to Auburn, and
eventually into Nevada. In Rocklin, this highway serves both local travel, such as commuter
traffic, as well as interstate travel, including goods movement. I-80 access to Rocklin is
provided via interchanges at Taylor Road (located in Roseville), Rocklin Road and Sierra
College Boulevard. Through the City of Rocklin, I-80 has three travel lanes in each direction.
State Route 65 (SR 65) is a north-south state highway that begins at I-80 in Roseville and extends
north through Rocklin and Lincoln to State Route 70 near Marysville. SR 65 is a four-lane
freeway between I-80 and Industrial Avenue and a two-lane to four-lane conventional highway
from Industrial Avenue to Lincoln and beyond. A new interchange on SR 65 at Sunset
Boulevard was recently completed. Access to Rocklin is also provided through interchanges at
Sunset Boulevard, Blue Oaks Boulevard, Pleasant Grove Boulevard (Park Drive) and Stanford
Ranch Road/Galleria Boulevard.

Circulation Element

Sierra College Boulevard is a major north-south arterial connecting Placer County with
Sacramento County. The roadway intersects with Rocklin Road, I-80, Pacific Street/Taylor
Road, and continues north to State Route 193 near Lincoln. To the south, the roadway extends
through Roseville to the Sacramento County line. In Sacramento County, it becomes Hazel
Avenue and continues south to U.S. 50.
Rocklin Road is an east-west arterial in the City of Rocklin. It connects Sierra College Boulevard
to I-80 (via the Rocklin Road interchange) and to Central Rocklin to the west. East of Sierra
College Boulevard, Rocklin Road extends to Barton Road in Loomis. Rocklin Road is four lanes
wide from west of Pacific Street in downtown Rocklin to Sierra College Boulevard and two
lanes to the Loomis town limit east of Sierra College Boulevard. The segment between Sierra
College Boulevard and the Loomis town limit includes a three to two lane transition in the
westbound direction.
Sunset Boulevard is an arterial that extends in a northwest direction from Woodside Drive to
Pacific Street and then to west of SR 65 in unincorporated Placer County. Sunset Boulevard has
four to six lanes east of SR 65.
Stanford Ranch Road is an arterial that extends from the SR 65/Stanford Ranch Road/Galleria
Boulevard interchange in a generally northern direction into Rocklin. It has six lanes between
the interchange and Sunset Boulevard, four lanes between Sunset Boulevard and Crest Drive,
and six lanes between Crest Drive and West Oaks Boulevard. It continues southwest from West
Oaks Boulevard as West Stanford Ranch Road with six lanes, and then becomes Lonetree
Boulevard past Sunset Boulevard.
Pacific Street is an arterial that connects Rocklin with Roseville to the west and Loomis and
Newcastle to the east. East and west of the city it becomes Taylor Road. It has four lanes from
the vicinity of the SR 65 overpass to north of Sierra Meadows Drive, and two lanes east and west
of that section.
Park Drive extends north from the Roseville/Rocklin city limit line to east of Wyckford
Boulevard as a four-lane to six-lane arterial roadway, until it transitions into Whitney Oaks
Drive. South of the Roseville/Rocklin city limit line, this road becomes Pleasant Grove
Boulevard and provides access to SR 65 via an interchange.
Granite Drive is a four lane arterial that connects Rocklin Road to Sierra College Boulevard along
the north side of I-80.
Blue Oaks Boulevard is an arterial that extends from the SR 65/Blue Oaks Boulevard interchange
in an east/northeasterly direction into Rocklin. Blue Oaks Boulevard is four lanes from the SR
65 interchange to its terminus at Sunset Boulevard.

four lanes between Blue Oaks Boulevard/Fairway Drive and Sunset Boulevard/West Stanford
Ranch Road.
West Oaks Boulevard is an arterial that extends from Lonetree Boulevard in a northeasterly
direction to its current terminus north of West Stanford Ranch Road. It will ultimately connect
to the primary east-west road through North West Rocklin (i.e., Whitney Ranch Parkway). West
Oaks Boulevard ranges from two to four lanes between Lonetree Boulevard and Sunset
Boulevard and is four lanes from Sunset Boulevard to its current terminus near Holly Drive. The
segment that will be constructed from its current terminus into North West Rocklin will also be
four lanes.
Wildcat Boulevard is a north-south arterial that begins at West Stanford Ranch Road and
continues to the Rocklin/Lincoln City limit where it becomes East Lincoln Parkway. This facility
is currently four lanes and provides access to the newer Whitney Ranch development.
Whitney Ranch Parkway is an east-west arterial that will eventually connect State Route 65 on the
west to Sierra College Boulevard (via Park Drive and Valley View Parkway) to the east. Portions
of the facility have been built and portions have not yet been built. Whitney Ranch Parkway
currently exists as a four-to-six lane roadway from west of Wildcat Boulevard to Painted Pony
Lane and it will eventually be built as a six lane facility from SR 65 to West Oaks Boulevard and
as a four lane facility from West Oaks Boulevard to Park Drive. It should be noted that a new SR
65 interchange will be built to provide access to Whitney Ranch Parkway and eventually to
Placer Parkway.
University Avenue will be a north-south four lane arterial traveling roughly parallel to SR 65
between SR 65 and Wildcat Boulevard. This roadway will begin at Sunset Boulevard and
terminate just south of the Rocklin/Lincoln City limit.
Valley View Parkway will be a two lane roadway connecting Park Drive (and Whitney Ranch
Parkway) to Sierra College Boulevard. It will be built as part of the Clover Valley development.
While the roadway will be two lanes, it will be widened out to four lanes at its intersections with
Park Drive and Sierra College Boulevard.

Existing Levels of Service
Level of Service (LOS) is a term that describes the operating performance of an intersection or
roadway. LOS is measured quantitatively and reported on a scale from “A” to “F,” with LOS
“A” representing the best performance and LOS “F” the worst. Table 4-7 relates the LOS letter
designation to a general description of traffic operations.

The City of Rocklin has typically utilized the Interim Materials on Highway Capacity - Circular
212 (Transportation Research Board, 1980) critical movement method to determine levels of
service at signalized intersections. With this method, the City has used the intersection capacities
published in Circular 212. However, with this General Plan Update, the City is using modified
capacities to be more consistent with observed operations and capacities that other nearby
jurisdictions are currently using. These modified capacities are approximately 5 percent higher
than the published Circular 212 capacities. This methodology determines the Level of Service
by comparing the volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio of critical intersection movements to the
thresholds shown in Table 4-7. Unsignalized intersections, signalized intersections at State
highway interchanges, and intersections within the Town of Loomis were analyzed using the
methodology described in the Highway Capacity Manual, Special Report 209 (Transportation
Research Board, 1994) consistent with the City of Rocklin standards.
Table 4-8 displays the existing p.m. peak hour Level of Service at the major signalized
intersections within the City and several just outside of the City. As shown, all intersections in
the City currently operate at LOS “C” or better during the p.m. peak hour, with the exception of
SR 65/Sunset Boulevard, Whitney Boulevard/Sunset Boulevard, and Sunset Boulevard/Park
Drive. The p.m. peak hour was used (rather than the a.m. peak hour) because traffic volumes at
most of the City’s signalized intersections are highest during the PM peak hour (generally
between 4:30 PM and 5:30 PM) on an average weekday.

Regional Improvement Plans
The Placer County Transportation Planning Agency (PCTPA) has been designated in state law as
the Regional Transportation Planning Agency for Placer County. PCTPA is also the County’s
Congestion Management Agency (CMA), a statutorily designated member of the Capitol
Corridor Joint Powers Authority (CCJPA) and the airport land use planning body and hearing
board for Lincoln, Auburn and Blue Canyon Airports. As part of their Joint Powers Agreement,
PCTPA is the designated administrator for the South Placer Regional Transportation Authority
City of Rocklin General Plan                           4C-7                                   October 2012

(SPRTA). Under an agreement with the Sacramento Area Council of Governments (SACOG),
PCTPA also represents Placer jurisdictions in federal planning and programming issues. As a
Regional Transportation Planning Agency (RTPA) with an urbanized population of over 50,000,
PCTPA is responsible for preparing a Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) and Regional
Transportation Improvement Plan (RTIP).
SACOG, the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) for this six-county region, is
responsible for preparing the federal Metropolitan Transportation Plan (MTP) every three years.
Placer County and its cities, including Rocklin, contribute to this planning process through the
PCTPA under an agreement with SACOG. PCTPA submits the state mandated RTP to SACOG
for inclusion in the federal Metropolitan Transportation Plan. Pursuant to the agreement with
SACOG, PCTPA receives a “fair share” allocation of both federal urbanized Surface
Transportation Program (STP) funds and Congestion Air Quality Mitigation Improvement
Program funds. PCTPA nominates projects for these funds, and SACOG has agreed to select
these nominated projects unless they fail to meet a federal requirement. SACOG cannot add
projects to the PCTPA nominations. Realistic funding sources must be shown to implement the
projects in the MTP.
The “Bizz Johnson” Highway 65 Interchange Joint Powers Authority (JPA) was created in 1990
by the City of Rocklin, the City of Roseville, and the County of Placer to finance and construct
four interchanges on Highway 65: at Stanford Ranch Road, Pleasant Grove Boulevard, Blue
Oaks Boulevard and Sunset Boulevard. To date, all four of these interchanges have been
constructed. The Authority has been working to finance the freeway interchanges with benefit
assessments (traffic impact fees), developer fees, and State and Federal highway funds. The
benefit area for traffic impact fees covers all of the cities of Rocklin and Roseville plus the
Sunset Industrial Plan Area in unincorporated Placer County.
The South Placer Regional Transportation Authority (SPRTA) is a Joint Powers Authority (JPA)
comprised of the Cities of Lincoln, Rocklin, Roseville and the County of Placer. The Authority
was formed for the purpose of implementing a Regional Transportation and Air Quality
Mitigation Fee to fund specified regional transportation projects. The following projects are
currently being funded with SPRTA fees:
     •    Placer Parkway
     •    Sierra College Boulevard Widening
     •    Lincoln Bypass (State Route 65)
     •    I-80 / Douglas Boulevard Interchange
     •    State Route 65 Widening
     •    I-80 / Rocklin Road Interchange
     •    Auburn-Folsom Road Widening

Federal and State Transportation Improvement Programs
The State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP) includes the programming of funds from
the State of California Highway Account for projects to increase the capacity of the
transportation system. The STIP is a five-year capital improvement program, renewed every two
years. Projects in the STIP may include projects on State highways, local roads, intercity rail, or
public transit systems. The Regional Transportation Planning Agencies (RTPAs) propose 75% of
STIP funding for regional transportation projects in their Regional Transportation Improvement
Programs (RTIPs). The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) proposes 25% of
STIP funding for interregional transportation projects in the Interregional Transportation
Improvement Program (ITIP). As noted previously, the Placer County Transportation Planning
Agency (PCTPA) is the RTPA for Placer County.
The State Highway Operation and Protection Program (SHOPP) is a four-year programming
document that includes projects designed to maintain the safety and integrity of the State
highway system. It does not include projects to add through lanes to increase capacity. Most of
the projects are for pavement rehabilitation, bridge rehabilitation, and traffic safety
improvements. Other projects may include such things as operational improvements (e.g., traffic
signalization) and roadside rest areas.
Each of California's fifteen Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) prepares a Federal
Transportation Improvement Program (FTIP) incorporating all highway and transit projects
funded with federal funds or of regional significance. SACOG is the Metropolitan Planning
Organization for six regional counties - El Dorado, Placer, Sacramento, Sutter, Yolo and Yuba -
and the 19 member cities, including Rocklin. The previously mentioned agreement with SACOG
integrates the PCTPA Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) within the SACOG process. PCTPA
receives a “fair share” allocation of both Federal urbanized Surface Transportation (STP) funds
and Congestion Air Quality Mitigation Improvement Program funds (CMAQ). PCTPA
nominates projects for these funds, and SACOG has agreed to select these nominated projects
unless they fail to meet a federal requirement. SACOG cannot add projects to the PCTPA
nominations.
EXISTING PUBLIC TRANSIT SERVICES
Transit
Rocklin is generally served by four Placer County Transit (PCT) bus routes: the Auburn Light
Rail Express route, the Lincoln to Galleria to Sierra College route, the Taylor Road shuttle, and
the Placer Commuter Express. PCT is a fixed-route scheduled transit system operated by Placer
County. PCT principally serves the I-80 corridor area between Alta and Roseville, Highway 65
corridor area into Lincoln, and the Highway 49 corridor. Some of the rural routes are
“deviated.” A “deviated route” means that the buses generally travel on a main route (e.g., I-80),
but can deviate from that route up to a certain distance (three-quarter mile in the case of PCT) to
serve the specific needs of transit patrons.

Circulation Element

There are currently 15 bus runs a day in each direction on PCT’s Auburn-Light Rail Express
route between Auburn and Sacramento Regional Transit’s Watt/I-80 light rail station. This route
provides service to Sierra College and the Roseville Galleria shopping center. It connects with
Roseville Transit and RT buses at Louis Lane near Auburn Boulevard and I-80.
PCT’s Lincoln to Galleria to Sierra College route has 14 runs a day in each direction and
services the Sunset Boulevard corridor, Downtown Rocklin and Sierra College. The Taylor Road
shuttle is a deviated route that connects Auburn and Sierra College with 7 runs a day in each
direction. Placer Commuter Express is a commuter bus service traveling from Rocklin Road and
Bush Street in Central Rocklin to Downtown Sacramento with three morning and three afternoon
trips.
In addition to regular bus service, PCT also provides paratransit services for patrons with more
challenging transportation needs. Such services include a dial-a-ride program in the
Rocklin/Loomis area and a dial-a-ride program in Granite Bay. The dial-a-ride also serves the
portion of Roseville along the State Route 65 corridor adjacent to Rocklin.
Placer County also coordinates a commuter vanpool program serving residents of Placer County.
Currently, there are a total of 10 vanpools in operation under this program. The vans are leased
from a private provider and are driven by one of the vanpool participants. Placer County
provides a subsidy for approximately half of the cost of this program.
The Capitol Corridor Intercity Train Service provides passenger rail service between Auburn and
San Jose daily. There are three stations in Placer County: Auburn, Rocklin and Roseville. There
are currently 9 runs per day in each direction, but only 1 run in each direction from Auburn to
Oakland that serves Rocklin. There are 4 runs in each direction from Sacramento to Oakland and
4 runs in each direction from Sacramento to San Jose. Amtrak provides bus connections from
Rocklin to the Sacramento Amtrak station to connect to these additional Capitol Corridor runs.
Railroads
The Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) operates a double-tracked parallel mainline through the
center of downtown Rocklin along the north side of Pacific Street. Near the intersection of
Railroad Avenue and Pine Street, the parallel main line splits into two separate lines. The line
which follows Pacific Street between the split and the town of Loomis turns into a downhill, or
westbound, track. The other line, which follows Sierra College Boulevard north for a way before
curving east to rejoin the westbound track at Newcastle, is UPRR’s uphill, or eastbound, track.
There are six (6) public railroad crossings in the planning area. Only one crossing, at Sunset
Boulevard, is grade separated. However, the City has conducted a study which looked at the
feasibility of constructing a railroad undercrossing or an overcrossing at Midas Avenue. Both
options are considered viable depending upon the availability of funding. The City has submitted
information to the State Grade Separation Funding Program and has also included the project in
Rocklin’s Capital Improvement Program (CIP).

Multimodal Train Station
The Rocklin Multimodal Train Station is a permanent building for rail users located along the
Union Pacific Railroad track at the Rocklin Road crossing. Rocklin is served by the Amtrak
Corridor service. Passenger service is available both westbound and eastbound from Rocklin to
Sacramento and the San Francisco Bay area metro services.
Existing Bicycle Facilities
Bikeways are defined by the State of California Street and Highways Code as follows:
•    Class I Bikeways provide a completely separated right-of-way designated for the exclusive
     use of bicycles and pedestrians with cross-flows by motorists minimized (also called a bike
     path or trail).
•    Class II Bikeways provide a restricted right-of-way designated for exclusive or semi-exclusive
     use of bicycles with through travel by motor vehicles or pedestrians prohibited, but with
     vehicle parking and cross-flows by pedestrians and motorists permitted (also called a bike
     lane).
•    Class III Bikeways provide a right-of-way designated by signs or permanent markings and
     shared with pedestrians or motorists (also called a bike route).
The City of Rocklin’s General Plan includes a Bikeway Diagram (Figure 4-7), which specifies a
number of existing and proposed bike lanes and bike routes. Class II on-street bike lanes exist on
a number of roadways, including the following:
• Stanford Ranch Road                                •  Sierra Meadows Drive
• Sunset Boulevard (partial)                         •  Rawhide Road

• Whitney Boulevard                                  •   Fifth Street
• Wildcat Boulevard                                  •  Meyers Street
• Scarborough Drive                                  •  Wyckford Boulevard
• Sierra College Boulevard from Rocklin              •   Farrier Road
     Road to the southern city limits
Class I bikeways currently exist in the open space areas within Sunset West, portions of Whitney
Ranch in North West Rocklin, and in the Springview area along Antelope Creek. Additional
Class I facilities are proposed within Whitney Ranch, Clover Valley and along Secret Ravine
Creek in southeast Rocklin.

Neighborhood Electric Vehicle Facilities
Assembly Bill 2353 authorized the cities of Lincoln and Rocklin to establish neighborhood
electric vehicle (NEV) transportation plans. The City of Rocklin adopted an NEV Transportation
Plan on February 26, 2008. The NEV plan is an effort to accommodate the City’s changing urban
lifestyle by encouraging the use of bicycles and NEVs to travel from residential areas to the
Rocklin commercial centers. This effort will result in air quality improvements, energy savings,
reduced travel costs, and increased mobility and independence for aging and impaired drivers.
Minor modifications to the existing streets and circulation system are needed to accommodate
NEVs. The plan includes guidelines for signing and striping, parking spaces and charging
stations, and an NEV route system to facilitate access and to increase safety.
NEVs routes are defined by the Plan as follows:
•    Class I NEV routes provide a completely separate right-of-way for the exclusive use of NEVs,
     pedestrians and bikes with cross-flow minimized. The minimum paved width for a Class I
     NEV route is 14-feet (for two way travel) with a minimum 2-foot wide graded area provided
     adjacent to the pavement. Currently, there are no Class I NEV routes in Rocklin.
•    Class II NEV routes are designated as a separate striped lane adjacent to traffic. There is one
     striped lane for each travel direction. The desirable minimum width for a Class II NEV route
     is 7-feet. Park Drive between Whitney Oaks Drive and Coldwater Drive is an example of a
     proposed Class II NEV lane. It is the intent to design all Class II NEV routes to allow
     combined NEV/bicycle use.
•    Class III NEV routes provide for shared use with automobile traffic on streets with a posted
     speed limit of 35 mph or less. All residential streets within the City of Rocklin are Class III
     NEV routes. The City will provide signage to direct NEVs to preferred streets. Some streets
     within the City that are posted at 35 mph or higher may not be appropriate for NEV use.
The Rocklin City Council did not commit funds when adopting the plan. The City has secured
grant money and other funding for NEV infrastructure.
Truck Routes
Rocklin has an adopted truck route system, the purpose of which is to manage truck traffic
within the City to minimize congestion and undesirable noise. A copy of this map, which is
periodically updated, is maintained on the City’s website.
In addition to I-80 and SR 65, established truck routes include Pacific Street and Sierra College
Boulevard between Granite Drive and the south city limit boundary. Additional routes include
Sierra Meadows Drive between Pacific Street and Corporation Yard Road, Dominguez Road
between Granite Drive and Pacific Street, Granite Drive between Dominguez Road and Sierra
College Boulevard, Sunset Boulevard between SR 65 and West Oaks Boulevard, West Oaks
Boulevard between Sunset Boulevard and Vine Circle, Lonetree Boulevard between Blue Oaks
Boulevard and Sunset Boulevard, Stanford Ranch Road between the south city limit boundary

FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATIONS
The objective of a functional classification system is to classify streets having similar functions,
purposes and importance in the roadway network (e.g., arterial, collector, and local streets).
Roadways have two functions, which are incompatible from a design standpoint: to provide
mobility and to provide land access. High and constant speeds are desirable for mobility, while
low speeds are more desirable for land access. A functional classification system provides a
functional specialization of meeting the access and mobility requirements of the roadways.
Local streets emphasize the land access function, arterials emphasize a high level of mobility for
through movement, and collectors offer a more balanced service for both functions.
The existing street network in the City of Rocklin is a product of both roadways that have
provided access to the older portions of the City for decades and roadways that were designed to
serve developing areas.
The functional classification system in the Circulation Element has been updated to reflect
recently approved developments. The revised system is shown in Figure 4-8. The functional
classification system allows the development of distinct standards for each street class.
Standards for right-of-way preservation and roadway cross-section are established, as well as a
policy for access control and design speed.
Arterial streets carry heavy traffic volumes, and vehicles normally travel further on arterial
streets than they do on collector, minor collector and local streets. Driveway access to individual
residential properties is generally prohibited due to typical speeds and volumes. On the other
hand, local streets should be designed to discourage high speeds and facilitate property access.
Collectors function as a transition between arterials and other streets at lower levels within the
classification system. Collectors accommodate some direct property access; however, this is
kept to a minimum to reduce conflicts to the extent possible. The design speed of a collector is
also lower than what would be experienced on an arterial.
In addition to the citywide street system presented in Figure 4-8, the Rocklin Civic Center Plan
added a proposed East-West Drive (now referred to as Civic Center Drive) as a collector street,
changed the delineation of Ruhkala Road and altered the alignment of Winding Way. Figure 4-2
depicts the specific circulation plan in the Civic Center Area as modified by the recently
developed Downtown Plan concept which shows Civic Center Drive aligning with Oakview
Drive in the east before it turns northerly toward Rocklin Road.

LEVEL OF SERVICE
While a primary goal of the City’s Circulation Element is “to create a balanced and coordinated
transportation system which utilizes all transportation modes efficiently and promotes sound land
use,” the City recognizes that automobiles are and will continue to be the primary transportation
mode for the City’s residents and employees. To that end, the City must strive to provide
adequate roadway capacity so that its system of roadways operates free of excessive traffic
congestion and delay. The operational performance of the City’s roadway system is expressed
using “Levels of Service” which generally describe traffic operations as perceived by the
motorist. There are six Levels of Service (LOS) ranging from “A” through “F”, with LOS “A”
representing the best range of operating conditions (high speeds and low delay) and LOS “F”
representing the worst (low speeds and high delay). Level of Service definitions at signalized and
unsignalized intersections are described in Table 4-7.
The Level of Service policy in the 1991 General Plan was as follows:
          To maintain a minimum traffic Level of Service “C” for all streets and
          intersections, except for intersections located within ½ mile from direct access to
          an interstate freeway where a Level of Service “D” will be acceptable.
          Exceptions may be made for peak hour traffic where not all movements exceed
          the acceptable Level of Service.
The Level of Service of the City’s arterial and collector roadway system is primarily determined
by the capacity and operations of its signalized intersections. Traffic volumes at most of the
City’s signalized intersections are highest during the PM peak hour (generally between 4:30 PM
and 5:30 PM) on an average weekday. Therefore, the revised Level of Service policy in this
Circulation Element focuses on the operations of signalized intersections during the weekday PM
peak hour. Intersection Levels of Service for signalized intersections within the City (with the
exception of signalized intersections at State highway interchanges) shall be evaluated using the
Transportation Research Board (TRB) Circular 212 (critical movement) method, with modified
capacities.
The City’s Capital Improvement Program (CIP) defines the roadway and intersection
improvements needed to maintain the adopted Level of Service policy. Traffic volumes and
Levels of Service are estimated for future travel conditions using forecasted development levels
of the General Plan.
The City recognizes that some signalized intersections within the City serve and are impacted by
development located in adjacent jurisdictions, and that these impacts are outside the control of
the City. While it is still the City policy to maintain a minimum traffic Level of Service “C” for
its signalized intersections, it has redefined the exceptions to that policy in this Circulation
Element.

GENERAL PLAN ROADWAY SYSTEM
The City regularly monitors traffic on City streets to include in the City’s Capital Improvement
Plan those improvements needed to maintain an acceptable level of service through the use of
traffic fees and other financing mechanisms. Table 4-9 outlines the functional classification
system and shows the existing (2008) and required 2025 travel lanes under the current CIP.
Figure 4-9 illustrates the roadway improvements needed to support projected 2030 development
levels under this Circulation Element.
The City’s CIP was most recently updated in 2004 and 2007. A previous update was conducted
in conjunction with the North Rocklin Circulation Study and the resulting North Rocklin
Circulation Element Amendment (GPA-93-03). That amendment consisted of two parts: the
Base Circulation Element for the year 2020 and the Long-Range Planning Options. The
amendment stated that the Long-Range Planning Options were included “to allow the City of
Rocklin the flexibility to consider future densities in its planning reserves as well as allowing for
possible roadways that may be needed beyond the year 2020 horizon.”
Some of those Long-Range Planning Options are part of the North West Rocklin Annexation
Area, including the extensions of Whitney Ranch Parkway and Wildcat Boulevard, and thus
have been included in the list of projects in the City’s 2025 traffic fee program. Yet, like the
North Rocklin Circulation Element Amendment, this Circulation Element recognizes that the
City of Rocklin still needs the flexibility to allow for possible roadways that may be needed
beyond that horizon. Therefore, Figure 4-9 and Table 4-9 show some “post- 2025” roadway
extensions and widenings. Rights-of-way for these Post- 2025 Improvements, as well as actual
construction of some of the improvements, could be required prior to 2025 depending on the
pace of development. Therefore, these improvements will be addressed in the CIP.
Extensions of Rocklin Road (from 5th Street to Whitney Boulevard) and Argonaut Avenue (to
Delmar Avenue) were included in the 1991 General Plan and North Rocklin Circulation Element
Amendment because they would (1) reduce traffic on Midas Avenue; (2) limit congestion at the
Sunset Boulevard/Pacific Street intersection, and (3) improve emergency vehicle access.
However, due to concerns about the location, difficulties and high costs associated with
construction, as well as the impacts these extensions might have, they have been eliminated from
the General Plan roadway system as part of the proposed General Plan Update.

CIRCULATION ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES
GOAL FOR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM: To create a balanced and coordinated transportation
system which utilizes all transportation modes efficiently and promotes sound land use.
Policies for Transportation System
C-1       Provide for a circulation pattern for regional, community, and neighborhood traffic needs.
C-2       Coordinate land use and transportation planning to support transit services, NEV facilities
          and non-motorized transportation.
C-3       Promote the use of Neighborhood Electric Vehicles (NEV) by providing
          accommodations (i.e., lane striping and signage) to facilitate the use of these vehicles
          where feasible within existing and planned rights-of-way.
C-4       Promote the use of non-motorized transportation by providing a system of bicycle routes
          and pedestrian ways.
C-5       Coordinate with public transit providers to meet residents’ needs.
C-6       Encourage non-residential development proposals to incorporate features that promote
          ridesharing or use of alternative transportation modes.
GOAL FOR CITY AND REGIONAL STREET SYSTEM: To provide a safe and well maintained
system of streets that meets community needs.
Policies for City and Regional Street System
C-7       Monitor traffic on City streets to determine improvements needed to maintain an
          acceptable Level of Service.
C-8       Update the Capital Improvement Program (CIP) and traffic impact fees at least every five
          years, or as determined necessary with the approval of major new developments or major
          general plan amendments not considered in the adopted Capital Improvement Program.
C-9       Provide for an annual inflationary adjustment to the City’s traffic impact fee to ensure
          that the fee is adequate for the future construction of roads.
City of Rocklin General Plan                       4C-18                                October 2012
Circulation Element

C-10      A. Maintain a minimum traffic Level of Service “C” for all signalized intersections
              during the p.m. peak hour on an average weekday, except in the circumstances
              described in C-10.B and C. below.
          B. Recognizing that some signalized intersections within the City serve and are impacted
              by development located in adjacent jurisdictions, and that these impacts are outside
              the control of the City, a development project which is determined to result in a Level
              of Service worse than “C” may be approved, if the approving body finds (1) the
              diminished level of service is an interim situation which will be alleviated by the
              implementation of planned improvements or (2) based on the specific circumstances
              described in Section C. below, there are no feasible street improvements that will
              improve the Level of Service to “C” or better as set forward in the Action Plan for the
              Circulation Element.
          C. All development in another jurisdiction outside of Rocklin’s control which creates
              traffic impacts in Rocklin should be required to construct all mitigation necessary in
              order to maintain a LOS C in Rocklin unless the mitigation is determined to be
              infeasible by the Rocklin City Council. The standard for determining the feasibility of
              the mitigation would be whether or not the improvements create unusual economic,
              legal, social, technological, physical or other similar burdens and considerations.
C-11      Continue to participate with adjacent jurisdictions toward the completion and
          improvement of streets that extend into other communities through individual
          cooperation and/or use of the Placer County Transportation Planning Agency (PCTPA),
          joint powers authorities, and similar entities.
C-12      Encourage improvements to the existing Federal Interstate and State highway system, and
          the addition of new routes that would benefit the City of Rocklin.
C-13      Consider a variety of funding mechanisms, either independently or with other
          government agencies, to fund needed regional improvements.
C-14      Prohibit residential driveways along collector or arterial streets within newly developing
          residential areas. This policy does not apply to multi-family residential uses, or where
          past decisions have created existing lots with residential frontages on collector or arterial
          streets.
C-15      Reduce the potential for the use of local residential streets as shortcuts for through traffic
          on streets that are not improved to full City standards.
C-16      Provide each new elementary school site with a minimum of two full street frontages.
C-17      Keep truck traffic away from residential areas and streets not structurally designed for
          truck traffic by designating truck routes.
C-18      Designate truck routes that can be used for the hauling of hazardous materials.
City of Rocklin General Plan                       4C-19                                    October 2012

C-19      Maintain existing streets in a safe condition and require that new streets be built to City
          standards.
C-20      Maintain street design standards for arterials, collectors and local streets.
C-21      Apply appropriate street design standards for private streets.
C-22      Interconnect traffic signals and/or consider the use of roundabouts where financially
          feasible and warranted to provide flexibility in controlling traffic movements at
          intersections.
C-23      Require street designs where appropriate to connect neighborhoods. These connections
          allow for vehicular and pedestrian use and for the efficient movement of service and
          emergency vehicles.
C-24      Require landscaping and tree planting along major new streets, properties abutting
          highways/freeways and along existing streets as appropriate.
C-25      Minimize the impact of road construction on the natural terrain and the character of
          existing neighborhoods.
C-26      Minimize the impact of road construction on creek corridors and related floodplain and
          riparian areas.
C-27      Design and phase construction of road improvements to minimize disruption to local
          residents and traffic, to the extent feasible.
C-28      Design new street alignments to minimize the number of creek crossings and adverse
          impacts to existing wildlife habitats.
C-29      Conduct a comprehensive inventory of the vegetative structure of riparian corridors prior
          to specific siting of new road alignments and creek crossings. This inventory will be
          used as a factor in the selection of an alignment which minimizes impacts to mature
          riparian vegetation, while still meeting the alignment or access and engineering
          requirements of siting the alignment or crossing.
C-30      Restore streambed and bank contours as near as possible to pre-project conditions
          following construction of creek crossings.
C-31      Design road improvements and new road alignments to avoid or minimize disturbance to
          identified cultural resources, where feasible.

Special Street Improvement Policies
C-32      Restrict vehicular access to emergency vehicles only from the Clover Valley Community
          Area onto the existing portions of Clover Valley Road and Rawhide Road within the
          Mission Hills-Clover Valley Community Area to minimize traffic volume increases on
          Midas Avenue.
C-33      Seek improvement to existing railroad crossings and construction of new grade separated
          crossings or undercrossings where appropriate and feasible.
C-34      Provide for the extension of Dominguez Road over I-80 as a future improvement to
          relieve the Sierra College Boulevard/I-80 and Rocklin Road/I-80 interchanges and create
          access to the southeast quadrant of the Sierra College Boulevard/I-80 interchange.
C-35      Increase traffic capacity at Rocklin Road and I-80, as traffic conditions require, by
          widening, overcrossings, or other design features, to allow for more efficient traffic
          movement and pedestrian and bike facilities.
C-36      Develop a new east/west road connection between State Route 65 and Sierra College
          Boulevard. The road shall traverse the Northwest Rocklin area, connect to Park Drive in
          the northern portion of Whitney Oaks, and extend from Park Drive through Clover Valley
          to intersect with Sierra College Boulevard.
C-37      Develop a new north/south road connection between Sunset Boulevard and the new
          east/west road connection described in Policy C-36.
C-38      Provide primary vehicular access to future development within the Parcel K planning
          area of the North West Rocklin General Development Plan by at least two points of
          access. The access points shall consist of one street that intersects with Wyckford
          Boulevard and another that connects to the extension of Kali Place. These facilities shall
          be open non-gated public streets.
C-39      Prohibit extension of Wyckford Boulevard north of Parcel K into the Whitney Ranch /
          Sunset Ranchos Planning Area.
C-40 Provide for the connection of Woodside Drive and Ruhkala Road in the Civic Center
          area.
C-41      Create a Civic Center street/drive network south of Rocklin Road that provides access to
          Pacific Street and South Grove Street.
C-42      Improve and extend Railroad Avenue between Farron Street and Midas Avenue to
          provide an alternative north/south route to Pacific Street.
C-43      Minimize the need to sever existing developed parcels for new roads designed to serve
          the Southeast Rocklin area.
City of Rocklin General Plan                      4C-21                                 October 2012

C-44      Prohibit an easterly extension of Greenbrae Road that would connect with Southside
          Ranch Road.
C-45      Extend Monument Springs Drive southerly across Secret Ravine Creek to developing
          areas south of Greenbrae Road.
C-46      Sever Aguilar Road at a time specified by the City of Rocklin. The severing shall occur
          at or near the Aguilar tributary crossing to preclude through traffic.
C-47      Design road improvements and new alignments to avoid or minimize encroachments into
          existing yards on Aguilar Road, Greenbrae Road and Foothills Road by minimizing the
          use of standard curb, gutter and sidewalks, where appropriate.
C-48      Acknowledge that new taxes, fees, or assessments to finance the severing of Aguilar
          Road and the Monument Springs Bridge/extension identified in the policies above shall
          not be levied upon fully developed parcels that cannot be further subdivided.
C-49      Encourage use of a free span bridge design over Secret Ravine Creek as the
          environmentally preferred option whenever feasible, to minimize the fragmenting effects
          of any bridge crossing on riparian habitat. Pre-cast concrete bridge joists should be used,
          whenever possible, to avoid prolonged construction and reduce construction disturbances
          in riparian corridors.
GOAL FOR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION: To promote a safe and efficient public transit system,
utilizing both bus and rail modes, to provide viable non-automotive means of transportation and
help reduce traffic congestion.

D. Community Safety Elemen
D. COMMUNITY SAFETY ELEMENT
INTRODUCTION
The Community Safety Element identifies potential natural and human-created hazards, and
describes activities and services that provide protection from these hazards. Topics addressed in
this Element include emergency preparedness, homeland security, flooding, hazardous
materials/contaminated sites, fire hazards, seismic and geologic hazards, and other hazards.
The purpose of the Community Safety Element is to reduce the potential risk of death, injuries,
property damage, environmental, economic, and social dislocation resulting from hazards such as
fires, floods, earthquakes, landslides and other hazards. Each of these topics is addressed as it
applies to the City of Rocklin. Although not large in area, the Rocklin planning area is
characterized by slopes, open space areas subject to wildland fires, and potential for localized
flooding. Other safety issues unique to Rocklin include the existence of quarries and bulk
petroleum storage and transmission pipelines.
Homeland security is a relatively new issue not addressed in the 1991 General Plan. The City of
Rocklin serves in the role of first responder to any local threat to homeland security. As with all
safety issues, it is essential that the City coordinate with nearby cities, Placer County, and other
local and regional agencies in responding to hazardous situations.
The City of Rocklin is traversed by Interstate 80 (I-80), a major east-west freeway, State Route
65 (SR 65), which borders portions of the western boundary of the City, and railroad tracks that
carry both freight and passenger traffic. Each of these routes regularly carries hazardous
materials or hazardous wastes that could create significant harm to residents if released. Because
such materials are traveling in interstate shipment, the ability of the City to control the manner or
time of shipment is substantially limited. Setbacks may be considered, but are probably not
feasible, because most areas along the major routes are already developed. Nonetheless, the fact
that such shipments occur, and are a source of at least some hazard to Rocklin residents, raises
the issue for discussion. The General Plan includes policies supporting Police and Fire
Department preparation for response, improved resident education and communication regarding
hazards, and similar measures.
Brush and wildland fires still pose a threat. If severe weather conditions occur, involving high
temperatures and winds, sparks from even distant fires can pose a threat to lives and structures.
There is little that can be done to control such risks themselves, other than clearing vegetation in
appropriate areas, maintaining vigilance, and requiring adequate access and fire safe construction
materials.
In some cases, residential and other urban uses are located in the foothills adjacent to
unimproved property. The fire risk for such development is significantly greater than for other
urbanized uses in the community, due to the proximity of high fuel areas.
General Plan policies promote access at regular intervals for Fire Department personnel and
equipment. This is an area in which policies relating to fire safety provide mutual support for

policies supporting open space corridors and linear parks. Such uses can be consistent with the
application of appropriate policies. For example, one of the key issues is vehicular access, and
General Plan policies provide guidance with regard to the expectations of the community.
Development in known wildfire areas increases exposure and the likelihood of emergency
response. Fire and other emergency personnel, as a result, plan for such emergencies through
training, and in some cases acquiring new equipment and hiring additional personnel. The City
currently requires owners of large areas of grasslands that are annexed to the City to pay the
costs for the City to contract with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection
(CalFire) to provide fire suppression. The General Plan includes a policy that calls for these
additional costs to be borne by the development creating the additional impact.
The City of Rocklin currently has a total of six public railroad crossings, including one above-
grade road crossing on Sunset Boulevard. Highway 65 also crosses over the railroad tracks, but
is located in the City of Roseville just west of Rocklin. Interstate 80 provides the closest
unimpeded crossing of the railroad tracks to the east of Rocklin, in Newcastle.
Due to the lack of over/undercrossings of the railroad tracks, portions of the city are isolated
each time a train passes. This could pose an obstacle to emergency vehicles, especially in the
event a train stalls or derails. The General Plan provides for adequate services to be maintained
on both sides of the mainline track in the event of a stoppage or derailment along the tracks;
however, the City Council has contemplated another grade separation over the railroad tracks.
The City has conducted a study which looked at the feasibility of constructing a railroad
undercrossing or an overcrossing at Midas Avenue. Both options are considered viable
depending upon the availability of funding. The City has submitted information to the State
Grade Separation Funding Program and has also included the project in Rocklin’s Capital
Improvement Program (CIP).
DESCRIPTION OF EXISTING CONDITIONS
GEOLOGIC HAZARDS
The City of Rocklin is located in the Central Valley, in Placer County. The Central Valley is
bounded by the Sierra Nevada Range on the east and the Pacific Coast Ranges on the west.
The Rocklin planning area is located within the Loomis Basin, which is situated in the western
foothills of the Sierra Nevada Range. The Sierra Nevada is a large fault block composed of
granitic and metamorphic rocks tilted gently from the summit near Donner Lake to the west,
where the block dips under sedimentary and alluvial units of the Sacramento Valley. Most of the
surface of the Loomis Basin consists of granitic rocks.
Throughout much of geologic time, the Sierra Nevada has experienced mountain uplift, deep
erosion off the crest of the mountains, and sporadic volcanic activity from vents near the crest, or
in Nevada. Stream erosion during the periods of uplift, combined with the effects of volcanic
activity, has produced a variety of sedimentary rock units present in the Loomis Basin.

Community Safety Element

Deepening erosion and sedimentation within the Loomis Basin within the past million years have
resulted in alluvial deposits now present along former and existing stream channels.
The soils within the Rocklin planning area are predominantly of the Exchequer-Inks units.
These soils are undulating to steep, well-drained and somewhat excessively drained soils that are
shallow and found over volcanic rocks. Soils of the Andregg-Caperton-Sierra and Cometa-
Ramona units are also found in the Rocklin area. Andregg-Caperton-Sierra soils are undulating
to steep, well-drained and somewhat excessively drained soils that are deep to shallow over
granitic rock. Cometa-Ramona soils are undulating, deep and very deep, well-drained soils
found on terraces. These soils are of poor quality, and do not support agricultural uses, with the
exception of cattle grazing.
The Soil Survey of Placer County, Western Part, identifies soil types in portions of the planning
area that may require special review and consideration where construction of foundations,
structures, roadways and underground infrastructure are proposed. These include Alamo Variant
Clay (wetness, shrink-swell potential, and low strength); Exchequer very stony loam (depth to
rock); Inks-Exchequer Complex (slope, depth to rock); and Fiddyment-Kaseberg loams (depth to
rock, cemented pan, shrink-swell potential, and strength).
Geologic hazards include ground shaking from seismic events, erosion, landslides, and seiches.
Seiches (an earthquake generated wave in an enclosed or partially enclosed body of water) are
not a significant risk, because of the absence of a body of water that could pose a threat as a
result of seismic activity. The risk of erosion of most soil types found in the planning area is
slight to moderate, though the risk of erosion increases as the slope increases, and erosion control
should be practiced in connection with any development.
SEISMIC SAFETY
The City of Rocklin is located in an area that has a relatively low risk of seismic activity. While
the seismic risk may not be considered substantial, seismic activity may affect development in
the planning area and cannot be completely discounted as a planning factor.
There are no known active faults in Placer County. The distance to major regional faults and
general stability of the underlying geology of the planning area combine to minimize the
potential localized impact of seismic events that may occur elsewhere. Figure 4-10 illustrates the
known and inferred active faults in the vicinity of the City of Rocklin. The Alquist-Priolo
Earthquake Fault Zoning Act, enacted in 1972, provides for the identification of special study
zones near active fault areas. No Alquist Priolo zones have been established in Placer County
(Special Publication 42, 1997, California Geological Survey).
The Rocklin area could be subject to moderate to strong ground shaking from earthquake or fault
zones located in the area near the boundary of the Sierra Nevada and the Sacramento Valley, and
near the Coast Ranges and the San Francisco Bay Area. There are other fault zones in the Sierra
Nevada foothills that could also produce seismic effects in the planning area. The nearest well-
defined fault zone is a portion of the West Branch of the Bear Mountains Fault Zone, a portion of
the Foothills Fault System, which follows the eastern side of the Sacramento Valley through El
Dorado, Placer and Amador Counties. The closest recently active fault in the western Sierra

Nevada foothills is the Cleveland Hills fault, which is situated approximately 40 miles north of
Rocklin. This fault was the source of the 1975 Oroville earthquake, which was felt strongly in
Placer County and neighboring areas. Within the Sierra Nevada foothills, the maximum credible
earthquake has been estimated at a magnitude of 6.5 and the maximum probability earthquake
has been estimated at a magnitude of 5.0 to 5.5 (Rocklin Civic Center Plan DEIR, 12/1994).
All development in Rocklin is subject to the effects of potential seismic activity. The Uniform
Building Code (UBC) has undergone continuing review and revisions to ensure that building
safety issues are adequately addressed in the design and construction of structures in areas
subject to seismic activity, including Rocklin.
FLOOD HAZARDS
Flood hazards in Rocklin occur due to overflows from the existing stream drainage system (see
Figure 4-11). Drainage in the planning area is characterized by a variety of watersheds that flow
westward from the Sierra Nevada foothills, and ultimately discharge into the Sacramento River
southwest of the city.
The City’s urban drainage system discharges into the creeks that transect the community. These
include Antelope Creek, Secret Ravine Creek, Clover Valley Creek, Sucker Creek, and Pleasant
Grove Creek (see Figure 4-3 in Chapter IV (B) of this document). All of these ultimately
discharge into Dry Creek. The Pleasant Grove Creek watershed flows to Sutter County, where it
discharges into the Sacramento River (see Figure 4-12).
The major contributors to flooding are Antelope Creek, Secret Ravine Creek, Clover Valley
Creek and Sucker Creek. These perennial streams can overflow during storm events, but
flooding is typically of a local nature.
The City of Rocklin participates in the federally sponsored Flood Insurance Program
administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). FEMA has mapped
known floodplains in Rocklin and surrounding areas. The maps show 100-year and 500-year
floodplains and floodways located primarily along the channels of the creeks listed above (see
Figure 4-11). A 100-year floodplain is an area that experiences a 1-in-100 chance of flooding in
any given year; a 500-year floodplain is an area that experiences a 1-in-500 chance of flooding in
any given year. Floodways are areas subject to much more frequent flooding and are necessary
to carry the normally expected flows of the various waterways.
The soils in Rocklin typically have a subsurface hardpan layer that inhibits the infiltration of
rainwater. Surface soils frequently become saturated following periods of rainfall, and areas of
standing water are common during such periods. Inadequate storm drainage in the Central
Rocklin area also contributes to the problem of standing water. The City has developed a Master
Plan for the Central Rocklin area to address drainage issues and is in the process of
implementing the recommended improvements contained within the Master Plan.
The City participates in the Placer County Flood Control and Water Conservation District, which
was formed to solve flood and water conservation problems in Placer County. In addition, the
City of Rocklin General Plan                    4D-4                                 October 2012

City has adopted a Flood Hazard Ordinance to restrict or prohibit unsafe land uses in flood-prone
areas, to control alteration of natural floodplains, control development activities that would
increase flood danger, and control the diversion of flood waters (Rocklin Municipal Code,
Chapter 15.16).
HAZARDOUS MATERIALS MANAGEMENT
Hazardous material incidents may occur anywhere and at any time in the City of Rocklin.
Containment, identification and cleanup of hazardous materials are mandated by law. Hazardous
materials spills on state and federal highways are the responsibility of Caltrans and the California
Highway Patrol, which provide on-scene management of the spill site and coordinate with the
Environmental Health Department, California Emergency Management Agency, and the local
fire department.
Incident command and management responsibility at the scene of hazardous materials incidents
within the City of Rocklin have been assigned to the Rocklin Fire Department (City of Rocklin
Resolution No. 2004-226). For all hazardous materials incidents occurring in the Rocklin Fire
Protection District, Placer County Sheriffs Department will assume scene management
responsibilities.
All City of Rocklin Fire Department personnel have been trained to the First Responder
Operational (FRO) level. In addition, several personnel have been trained to the Hazardous
Materials Specialist level. The Rocklin Fire Department is staffed with its own Mass
Decontamination Response Teams which provides mutual aid support to Hazardous Materials
Response Teams within Placer County and to surrounding areas.
Hazardous materials incidents, even minor ones, usually require a multi-agency response. City
of Roseville Fire Department and Placer County Interagency Hazardous Materials Response
Teams provide mutual-aid response to the City of Rocklin when requested.
The City has enacted a Hazardous Materials Cleanup ordinance that would allow it to require
reimbursement for cost incurred from those responsible for hazardous waste spills (Rocklin
Municipal Code, Chapter 8.20).
EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS
Emergency procedures in the City are guided by the Emergency Operations Plan (Rocklin
Municipal Code, Chapter 2.32). The Emergency Operations Plan provides a framework to guide
the City’s efforts to mitigate and prepare for, respond to, and recover from major emergencies or
disasters.
The City has established a Disaster Council, which is responsible for reviewing and
recommending emergency operations plans for adoption by the City Council. The Disaster
Council plans for the protection of persons and property in the event of fires, floods, storms,
epidemics, riots, earthquakes and other disasters.

FIRE HAZARDS
The Rocklin Fire Department provides fire protection services in the City of Rocklin. The
Rocklin Fire Protection District, through a contract with the City of Rocklin, serves the
Greenbrae unincorporated “island.” Fire protection outside the planning area is provided by
Placer County, under a contract with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection
(Cal Fire).
Rocklin belongs to a statewide mutual aid system, through which fire suppression assistance is
provided to a member agency requesting assistance when it has exhausted its own resources and
needs assistance. Bordering fire jurisdictions participate with Rocklin in the statewide mutual
aid system.
There are currently three fire stations in the city. Fire Station No. 1 is located at 4060 Rocklin
Road, Fire Station No. 2 is located at 3401 Crest Drive and Fire Station No. 3 is located at 2001
Wildcat Blvd. A fourth station is planned at the future intersection of Park Drive and Valley
View Parkway, but is currently being postponed until adequate funding for construction and staff
needs is identified.
While the major fire threat in the city is related to urban development, annexations in the early
1990’s brought land into the city that contains large areas of grassland and is subject to a threat
of wildfire. These areas include Clover Valley, areas at the southern end of China Garden Road,
portions of Whitney Oaks, the Croftwood/Dias Lane area, Whitney Ranch and, open-space
easements and recreational properties.
The City has adopted the California Fire Code as part of its building regulations. The Code
governs the fire safety requirements in building and construction (Rocklin Municipal Code,
Chapter 15.04).
OTHER HAZARDS
Additional potential hazards within the Rocklin planning area include hazardous materials spills
or other accidents on I-80, SR 65 or the Union Pacific Railroad. All are major transportation
corridors of regional or national significance. Vehicles and rail cars may carry explosives,
military ordnance, chemicals and a variety of petroleum products. Cleanup where accidents
occur involving these facilities would be the responsibility of Caltrans or the Union Pacific
Railroad. Two derailments have occurred in the City of Rocklin, but were confined to the
railroad right-of-way, and no injuries or hazardous materials spills occurred.
Figure 4-13 shows natural gas, petroleum and major electric transmission lines in the Rocklin
planning area. Refer to the Public Services and Facilities Element (Chapter IV (F)) for a

PETROLEUM BULK STORAGE FACILITY AND PIPELINES
A petroleum bulk storage facility known as the Roseville Station began operations in 1957 at the
northwest corner of Pacific Street and Sunset Boulevard. The facility operates 24 hours a day, 7
days a week. The facility receives incoming petroleum product via a 12-inch line from Concord.
The product is then pumped north to Chico via an 8-inch diameter line and east to Sparks,
Nevada through 6-inch, 8-inch and 12-inch diameter lines. There is also a 4-inch line supplying
the Roseville rail yards (see Figure 4-13 for pipeline locations within the planning area). The
types of products passing through the facility include gasoline, diesel, commercial jet fuel and
military jet fuel. The total capacity of all storage tanks on the site is approximately 455,000
barrels or 19-million gallons. The Kinder-Morgan Energy Company now owns the pipelines and
bulk storage facility. The Southern Pacific Transportation Company originally owned the
facility. Pipelines to the northeast of the facility are located primarily within railroad rights-of-
way) and pipelines to the northwest are generally located on private properties.
The facility grounds are controlled with security fencing, and guard dogs patrol the interior
fenced area. Entry to the facility is through either locked gates off Sunset Boulevard or a
checkpoint off Pacific Street. Kinder-Morgan has developed local response teams, should a
product release occur, and has also upgraded the containment system surrounding the tanks. The
dike area is designed to hold full release from the largest tank, should failure occur.

E. Noise Elemen
E.       NOISE ELEMENT
INTRODUCTION
The purpose of the Noise Element is to limit the exposure of the community to excessive noise
levels. The Noise Element is used to guide decisions regarding land use and the location of new
roads and transit facilities, since they are commonly sources of excessive noise levels. Noise
levels from existing land uses, including mining and industrial activities, must be closely
analyzed to ensure compatibility with planned land uses.
The Noise Element, by its nature, is the most technical of the General Plan Elements.
Definitions of the acoustical terminology used in this Element are provided in Appendix B,
Glossary.
The City of Rocklin includes varied geographic features. Some portions of the community are
separated from the railroad, freeway and industrial areas by geographic features that substantially
reduce noise levels from those sources. For those areas exposed to such sources due to the lack
of intervening geographic features, alternatives for noise attenuation include soundwalls, berms
and setbacks.
The best approach for future land uses is to plan their location in such a way as to minimize
exposure of sensitive receptors, such as residences or schools, to substantial noise sources.
Noise contours and predicted distances to noise contours have been developed as part of this
Noise Element that will be used in planning for distribution of various land uses within the
community and determination of required setbacks from noise sources.
As noted in the description of existing conditions below, the major sources of noise in Rocklin
are industrial areas, SR 65, I-80 and the railroad. It seems unlikely that a major new
transportation-related noise source will be created in the community. No additional railroad
routes or freeways are planned. However, the nature and extent of railroad activity on the
established Union Pacific line is not subject to the control of the City, and could change during
the planning period, affecting noise levels in the community. Increased frequency of passenger
rail service between Auburn and the Bay Area is planned to ease congestion and improve air
quality on the I-80 corridor. The extent to which freight service may increase is unknown.
Noise is also generated by urban land uses: schools, children playing, yard maintenance, dogs,
outdoor activities (including amplified music), siren and airplanes. As a practical matter, most of
these noise sources are recognized as a part of urban living that must be tolerated. The issue is
whether some of these noise sources are so disruptive that they deserve special attention.
The emphasis of the Noise Element is to prevent future noise impacts from occurring in new
development, and to minimize these noise impacts in existing developed areas of the community.

Noise Element
DESCRIPTION OF EXISTING CONDITIONS
Noise is often defined as unwanted sound, and its perception can be characterized as a subjective
reaction to a physical phenomenon. Researchers have grappled for many years with the problem
of translating objective measurements of sound into directly correlated measures of public
reaction to noise. The descriptors of community noise in current use are the results of these
efforts, and represent simplified, practical measurement tools to gauge community response.
Table 4-10 provides examples of maximum or continuous noise levels associated with common
noise sources.

A common statistical tool to measure the ambient noise level is the average sound level (Leq),
which is the sound level corresponding to a steady-state A-weighted sound level in decibels (dB)
containing the same total energy as a time-varying signal over a given time period (usually one
hour). The Leq, or average sound level, is the foundation for determining composite noise
descriptors such as Ldn and CNEL (see below), and shows very good correlation with
community response to noise.
Two composite noise descriptors commonly used are Ldn and CNEL. The Ldn (Day-Night
Average Level) is based upon the average hourly Leq over a 24-hour day, with a +10 decibel
weighting applied to nighttime (10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.) Leq values. The nighttime penalty is
based upon the assumption that people react to nighttime noise exposures as though they were
subjectively twice as loud as daytime exposures. The CNEL (Community Noise Equivalent
Level), like Ldn, is based upon the weighted average hourly Leq over a 24-hour day, except that
an additional 5 decibel penalty is applied to evening (7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m.) hourly Leq values.
The CNEL was developed for the California Airport Noise Regulations, and is normally applied
to airport/aircraft noise assessment. The Ldn descriptor is a simplification of the CNEL concept,
City of Rocklin General Plan                              4E-2                          October 2012
Noise Element
but the two will usually agree, for a given situation, within 1 dB. Like the Leq, these descriptors
are also averages and tend to disguise short-term variations in the noise environment. Because
they presume increased evening or nighttime sensitivity, these descriptors are best applied as
criteria for land uses where nighttime noise exposures are critical to the acceptability of the noise
environment, such as residential developments.
The State Office of Planning and Research Noise Element Guidelines require that major noise
sources be identified and quantified by preparing generalized noise contours for current and
projected conditions. Noise measurements and modeling are used to develop these contours.
Significant noise sources include traffic on major roadways and highways, railroad operations,
airports, and representative industrial activities and fixed noise sources.
EXISTING CONDITIONS
Noise modeling techniques and noise measurements were used to develop generalized
Ldn/CNEL or Leq noise contours and predicted distances to noise contours for the major
roadways in the City of Rocklin planning area for existing and future conditions. Discussions on
noise levels for fixed noise sources in the City General Plan planning area are also provided.
Noise modeling techniques use source-specific data, including average levels of activity, hours
of operation, seasonal fluctuations, and average levels of noise from source operations.
Modeling methods have been developed for a number of environmental noise sources such as
roadways, railroad line operations and industrial plants. Such methods produce reliable results
so long as data inputs and assumptions are valid. The modeling methods used in this chapter
closely follow recommendations made by the State Office of Noise Control, and were
supplemented, where appropriate, by field-measured noise levels to account for local conditions.
The noise exposure contours are based upon annual average conditions. Because local
topography, vegetation or intervening structures may significantly affect noise exposure at a
particular location, the noise contours should not be considered site-specific.
A community noise survey was also conducted to describe existing noise levels in noise-
sensitive areas within the planning area so that noise level performance standards may be
developed to maintain an acceptable noise environment.
EXISTING REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
The criteria in the Noise Element are established for determining potential noise conflicts
between various land uses and noise sources. They are based on the recommendations of the
California State Office of Noise Control as contained in the Guidelines for the Preparation and
Content of Noise Elements of the General Plan. The standards for all noise sources are based
upon the CNEL/Ldn descriptor.
As described earlier, the CNEL and Ldn are 24-hour average noise level descriptors, which
assume that individuals are more sensitive to noise occurring during the evening and nighttime
hours. The CNEL and Ldn descriptors have been found to provide good correlation to the
potential for annoyance from transportation-related noise sources (i.e., roadways, airports and, to
City of Rocklin General Plan                       4E-3                                   October 2012
Noise Element
a lesser extent, railroad operations). However, these descriptors do not provide a good
correlation to the potential for annoyance from non-transportation or stationary noise sources,
such as industrial and commercial operations, because many times stationary noise sources
operate sporadically or for short durations. Examples of these types of noise sources include
loading docks, special event concerts, and pressure relief valves or alarms, which tend to be short
duration noise events. When applying an Ldn or CNEL descriptor, the noise levels associated
with these types of short term operations will be averaged over a 24-hour period, which tends to
minimize the actual potential for annoyance.
The State of California "Model Community Noise Control Ordinance" suggests that an exterior
hourly L50/Leq noise level of 55 dBA should be used for evaluating stationary noise source
impacts during the daytime period (7 am - 10 pm) and 45 dBA during the nighttime period (10
pm - 7 am) within "suburban" areas. The hourly Leq, or hourly average noise level, has been
found to provide good correlation to noise sources which operate for a short duration.
Since the Leq is calculated on a logarithmic scale, loud noise levels of short duration are
emphasized. For example, a maximum noise level of 70 dBA can only be generated for 2
minutes without exceeding an hourly average (Leq) noise level of 55 dBA. If an on-site noise
source generated a noise level of 73 dBA for 1 minute, the hourly average (Leq) noise level
would be approximately 55 dBA.
Based upon previous project-specific acoustical analyses within Rocklin, and upon discussions
with the City of Rocklin Community Development Department staff, an exterior hourly average
noise level criterion of 55 dBA Leq has been applied to stationary noise sources during the
daytime period, and a 45 dBA Leq criterion has been applied during the nighttime period.
In some instances, such as second story noise-sensitive rooms, the City staff have requested that
an interior noise level criterion be used for evaluating noise. Research indicates that interior
noise levels suitable for sleeping areas is within the range of 38 dBA to 48 dBA. The State of
California "Model Community Noise Control Ordinance" suggests that an interior maximum
noise level (Lmax) of 45 dBA should be used for residential uses between the hours of 10 pm
and 7 am. Therefore, the City has used an interior maximum noise level criterion of 45dBA for
stationary noise source operations which may occur during the nighttime period.
ROADWAY NOISE LEVELS
The Federal Highway Administration’s (FHWA) Highway Traffic Noise Prediction Model
(FHWA-RD 77-108) was used to develop Ldn (24-hour average) noise contours and predicted
distances to noise contours for all highways and major roadways in the planning area. The
FHWA Model is the analytical method presently favored for traffic noise prediction by most
state and local agencies, including the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans). The
current version of the model is based upon the CALVENO noise emission factors for
automobiles, medium trucks, and heavy trucks, with consideration given to vehicle volume,
automobile/truck mix, speed, roadway configuration, distance to the receiver and the acoustical
characteristics of the site. The FHWA Model predicts hourly Leq values for free-flowing traffic

Noise Element

conditions, and is generally considered to be accurate within 1.5 dB. To predict Ldn values, it is
necessary to determine the hourly distribution of traffic for a typical 24-hour period.
Traffic data representing annual average traffic volumes for existing conditions were obtained
from Caltrans and the General Plan traffic consultant, DKS Associates. Day/night traffic
distribution for I-80 and SR 65 were based upon the traffic data collected for those roadways.
Truck mix data were also based on Caltrans file data. Using these data and the FHWA
methodology, traffic noise levels as defined by Ldn were calculated for existing traffic volumes.
Distances from the centerlines of selected roadways to the 60 and 65 dB Ldn contours are
summarized in Table 4-11.
In many cases, the actual distances to noise level contours may vary from the distances predicted
by the FHWA model. Factors such as roadway curvature, roadway grade, shielding from local
topography or structures, elevated roadways, or elevated receivers may affect actual sound
propagation. The distances reported in Table 4-11 are generally considered to be conservative
estimates of noise exposure along roadways in the City of Rocklin.
The effects of factors such as roadway curvature and grade can be determined from site-specific
traffic noise measurements. The noise measurement results can be compared to the FHWA
model results by entering the observed traffic volumes, speed and distance as inputs to the
FHWA model. The differences between the measured and predicted noise levels can be used to
adjust the FHWA model and more precisely determine the locations of the traffic noise contours.

FUTURE TRAFFIC NOISE CONTOURS
Table 4-12 shows the future traffic noise levels based upon the year 2030. The results of the
analysis are based upon inputs to the Federal Highway Administration Traffic Noise Prediction
Model (FHWA RD-77-108). Traffic volumes used for the analysis were provided by the
General Plan Circulation Element.
The results of the analysis indicate that future traffic noise levels are expected to increase over
existing levels between 0.3 dB and 6.4 dB Ldn. The largest increase in traffic noise levels are
expected to occur along Sierra College Boulevard, Sunset Boulevard and Stanford Ranch Road.
However, most increases in traffic noise are expected to be less than 5 dB Ldn.

NON-TRANSPORTATION (FIXED) NOISE SOURCES
The production of noise is a result of many industrial processes, even when the best available
noise control technology is applied. Noise exposures within industrial facilities are controlled by
Federal and State employee health and safety regulations (OSHA and Cal-OSHA), but exterior
noise levels could exceed locally acceptable standards. Commercial, recreational and public
service facility activities can also produce noise which affects adjacent sensitive land uses.
These noise sources can be continuous and may contain tonal components that may be annoying
to individuals who live nearby. In addition, noise generation from fixed noise sources may vary
based upon climatic conditions, time of day and existing ambient noise levels.
From a land use planning perspective, fixed-source noise control issues focus upon two goals:
     1) To prevent the introduction of new noise-producing uses in noise-sensitive areas; and
     2) To prevent encroachment of noise sensitive uses upon existing noise-producing facilities.
The first goal can be achieved by applying noise level performance standards to proposed new
noise-producing uses. The second goal can be met by requiring that new noise-sensitive uses in

with noise performance standards.

Fixed noise sources that are typically of concern include, but are not limited to, the following:
         HVAC Systems                           Cooling Towers/Evaporative Condensers
         Steam Valves                           Steam Turbines
         Generators                             Fans
         Air Compressors                        Heavy Equipment
         Conveyor Systems                       Transformers
         Pile Drivers                           Grinders
         Drill Rigs                             Gas or Diesel Motors
         Welders                                Cutting Equipment
         Outdoor Speakers                       Blowers
         Loading Docks                          Amplified music and voice
         Lift Stations
The types of uses which may typically produce the noise sources described above include, but
are not limited to: industrial facilities, including pump stations, trucking operations, tire shops,
auto maintenance shops, metal fabricating shops, shopping centers, drive-up windows,
businesses using amplified sounds, car washes, loading docks, batch plants, bottling and canning
plants, recycling centers, electric generating stations, race tracks, landfills, sand and gravel
operations, schools, playgrounds and athletic fields.
Within the City of Rocklin, major non-transportation noise sources consist primarily of industrial
and commercial land uses. Major noise-generating industrial land uses consist primarily of
wood-product processing facilities located along Pacific Street.
To a somewhat lesser extent, other noise-generating land uses located in these areas, including
distribution centers, lumber handling and sales establishments, and assorted automotive service
facilities, also contribute to the ambient noise environment. Noise levels associated with major
non-transportation noise sources are discussed in more detail below.
Sierra Pine
At times, the lumber manufacturing plants will operate 24-hours per day. In the past, the Sierra
Pine Limited was a source of numerous noise complaints due to processing facilities. In
response to the complaints, Bollard & Brennan, Inc. has worked with Sierra Pine to evaluate
noise levels due to the facility. Noise level measurements conducted in 1999 indicated that
typical hourly noise levels ranged between 59 dB and 65 dB Leq at the closest property lines
adjacent to Sierra Pine. Sierra Pine expanded operations in late 1999, and added a new
regenerative thermal oxidizer (RTO) exhaust stack which produced objectionable noise levels.
Bollard & Brennan, Inc. worked with the City and Sierra Pine to develop a solution to the noise
from the RTO stack. As a result, an exhaust silencer was installed in July of 2000. Noise level
measurements indicated that noise levels due exclusively to the stack were reduced by
approximately 26 dB. Bollard & Brennan, Inc. conducted additional measurements of noise
levels due to Sierra Pine, and the resulting overall noise levels have been reduced by
approximately 5 dB to 7 dB.
City of Rocklin General Plan                       4E-9                                   October 2012
Noise Element
Recent noise measurements of plant operations were conducted on October 28, November 11
and November 13, 2008 along the eastern and southern boundaries of the plant. Average hourly
noise levels measured approximately 67 dB Leq at approximately 200 feet from the plant.
Ambient noise levels at the southern boundary of the plant measured approximately 59 dBA Leq.
Assuming a maximum noise level of 67 dBA Leq at 200 feet, the predicted 60 dB Leq noise
contour would extend to a distance of approximately 475 feet from the plant. However, because
of the directional aspects of on-site noise sources and shielding provided by on-site structures,
operational noise levels at off-site locations are highly variable. As a result, operational noise
levels and distances to predicted noise contours will vary depending on several factors, including
the specific operational activities being conducted, orientation of off-site receptors to on-site
noise sources, and meteorological conditions.
Other Wood Processing Facilities
Other wood processing facilities generally produce noise levels which are masked by
background noise from Sierra Pine, local traffic and railroad operations. Operational noise levels
and distances to predicted noise contours will vary as discussed above.
RAILROAD NOISE LEVELS
Railroad activity in the City of Rocklin planning area generally occurs along the Union Pacific
Railroad (UPRR) double-track mainline railroad tracks. The UPRR mainline track generally
runs parallel to the north side of Pacific Street from the SR 65 overpass to near the intersection of
Railroad Avenue and Pine Street. At that point, the westbound track continues to run parallel to
Pacific Avenue, while the eastbound track heads in a northerly direction where it enters the
Town of Loomis and runs parallel to Sierra College Boulevard.
The UPRR is used for both freight transport and Amtrak passenger service. The number of
freight trains can vary from day to day, depending on demand, and there are currently no hourly
restrictions pertaining to freight transport along this railroad corridor. In 2009, the total number
of freight trains traveling along this corridor typically averaged approximately 16 trains per day.
Based on site reconnaissance surveys, Union Pacific freight trains are estimated to travel at
speeds of approximately 35-40 miles per hour. Amtrak passenger trains typically run between the
daytime hours of 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m., and averaged approximately 10 trains per day in
2009. Average train lengths can vary from approximately 85 railcars for freight trains to
approximately 8 passenger cars for Amtrak trains.
Noise measurements were conducted at two locations for railroad operations within the planning
area adjacent to the UPRR track. The measurements were conducted to determine the
contribution of railroad mainline operations to the area noise environment.
The purpose of the noise level measurements was to determine typical sound exposure levels
(SEL) for railroad line operations in the General Plan study area, accounting for the effects of
travel speed, warning horns and other factors which may affect noise generation. In addition, the
noise measurement equipment was programmed to identify individual train operations, so that
the typical number of train operations could be determined. The data could then be compared to
City of Rocklin General Plan                       4E-10                                  October 2012

other file data for railroad operational noise levels to better describe the railroad noise
environment as it affects the area noise environment and an annual average Ldn could be
calculated. The railroad noise measurement locations were at Sites 22 and 23, as shown on
Figure 4-14.
The Federal Transit Administrations (FTA) Transit Noise and Vibration Impact Assessment
Guidelines (FTA, 2006) were used for the calculation of train noise levels, based on the above-
discussed operations. Predicted noise levels at 50 feet from the track centerline and distance to
predicted noise contours are summarized in Table 4-14.

Mainline
Source: Ambient, 2009
Notes: Noise levels were calculated based on methodology obtained from the Federal Transit Administration’s
Transit Noise and Vibration Impact Assessment Guidelines (FTA, 2006). Assumes 16 freight trains, distributed
equally over a 24-hour period, and 10 Amtrak trains between the daytime hours of 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. The sounding of
locomotive horns typically occurs within distances of approximately 1,000 feet of at-grade crossings. Noise contours
do not include shielding due to intervening terrain or structures.
COMMUNITY NOISE SURVEY
Several sources of noise that could affect local residents were identified within the City of
Rocklin. These sources include noise generated from non-transportation sources (e.g.,
commercial and industrial uses), railroad operations, and vehicle traffic on area roadways and
highways. Ambient noise measurements were conducted for the purpose of documenting and
measuring the existing noise environment in various areas of the City. Noise measurement
surveys were conducted on October 28 and 29, 2008; November 11 and 13, 2008; and January
30, 2009. A total of two long-term (i.e., 24-hour) noise measurements were conducted along the
Interstate 80 and State Route 65 corridors. Short-term (i.e., 10-minute) noise measurements were
conducted at 21 locations throughout the City during the daytime, evening, and nighttime hours.
All noise measurements were conducted using a Larson David Laboratories, Model 820 Type 1
sound-level meter placed at a height of approximately 4.5 feet above the ground surface.
The results of the community noise survey indicate that there are major noise sources in Rocklin,
including I-80, SR 65, the Union Pacific Railroad, and some industrial uses which are located in
close proximity to noise-sensitive receivers. Measured noise levels within most areas of Rocklin
are consistent with a typical suburban community. Recently developed residential areas within

NOISE ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES
GOAL: To protect City residents from the harmful and annoying effects of exposure to excessive
noise.
GOAL: To protect the economic base of the City by discouraging noise-sensitive land uses from
encroaching upon existing or planned noise-producing uses.
GOAL: To encourage the application of innovative land use planning methodologies in areas of
potential noise conflicts.
Policies
N-1         Determine noise compatibility between land uses, and to provide a basis for developing
            noise mitigation, an acoustical analysis shall be required as part of the environmental
            review process for all noise-sensitive land uses which are proposed in areas exposed to
            existing or projected exterior noise levels exceeding the level standards contained
            within this Noise Element.
N-2         Emphasize site planning and project design to achieve the standards of this Noise
            Element. The use of noise barriers shall be considered a means of achieving the noise
            standards; however, the construction of aesthetically intrusive wall heights shall be
            discouraged.
GOAL: To prevent noise-sensitive land uses from being adversely affected by stationary noise
sources.
Policies
N-3         Ensure that stationary noise sources do not interfere with sleep by applying an interior
            hourly maximum noise level design standard of 45 dBA in the enclosed sleeping areas
            of residences affected by stationary noise sources. This standard assumes doors and
            windows are closed.
N-4         Restrict development of noise-sensitive land uses where the noise levels due to existing
            or planned stationary noise sources will exceed the exterior stationary noise level
            design standards of the Noise Element, unless effective noise mitigation measures have
            been incorporated into the project.
N-5         Evaluate and mitigate as appropriate, noise created by proposed stationary noise
            sources so that the exterior stationary noise level design standards of the Noise Element
            are not exceeded.

 The City can impose noise level standards that are more restrictive than those specified above based upon
 determination of existing low ambient noise levels.
 “Fixed” noise sources which are typically of concern include, but are not limited to the following:
             HVAC Systems             Cooling Towers/Evaporative Condensers
             Pump Stations            Lift Stations
             Emergency Generators Boilers
             Steam Valves             Steam Turbines
             Generators                Fans
             Air Compressors          Heavy Equipment
             Conveyor Systems          Transformers
             Pile Drivers             Grinders
             Drill Rigs               Gas or Diesel Motors
             Welders                  Cutting Equipment
             Outdoor Speakers         Blowers
 The types of uses which may typically produce the noise sources described above include but are not limited to:
 industrial facilities including pump stations, trucking operations, tire shops, auto maintenance shops, metal
 fabricating shops, shopping centers, drive-up windows, businesses using amplified sound systems, car washes,
 loading docks, batch plants, bottling and canning plants, recycling centers, electric generating stations, race
 tracks, landfills, sand and gravel operations, schools, playgrounds, and athletic fields.
 NOTE: The point of measurement for noise levels is at a location at least 5 feet inside the property line of the
 receiving land use and at a point 5 feet above ground level. In the case of lots where the noise-sensitive use has a
 reasonable outdoor activity area for outdoor enjoyment, the stationary noise source criteria can be applied at a
 designated outdoor activity area (at the discretion of the City).
GOAL: To prevent noise-sensitive land uses from being adversely affected by transportation noise
sources.
Note: For the purposes of the Noise Element, transportation noise sources are defined as traffic on
public roadways and railroad line operations.
Policies
N-7         Restrict development of noise-sensitive land uses in areas exposed to existing or projected
            levels of noise from transportation noise sources that exceed the noise level standards contained
            within the Noise Element, unless the project design includes effective mitigation that results in
            noise exposure which meets standards.

F.       PUBLIC SERVICES & FACILITIES ELEMENT
INTRODUCTION
The Public Services and Facilities Element provides a description of existing public services and
facilities, their locations, and plans for and locations of future expansions to existing services and
facilities. The Public Services and Facilities Element is an optional element of the General Plan.
It provides a logical framework for organizing plans and policies regarding infrastructure, law
enforcement, fire protection, emergency response, schools, refuse collection and disposal,
utilities, storm drainage, libraries and cemeteries. It also addresses methods of financing
installation, expansion, maintenance and operation of public facilities, as well as provision of
public services. The inclusion of a separate element for public services and facilities is an
indication of the importance attached to these issues by the City of Rocklin.
The City of Rocklin does not provide all of these public services and facilities directly. Schools,
refuse collection, gas and electricity, telecommunications, sewer service, water service, libraries
and cemeteries are provided by a combination of special districts, public utilities and private
entities. Nevertheless, the City has an obligation to assure that the full range of these services is
provided to residents of the City of Rocklin, and to coordinate with these agencies and entities
toward that end. Residents of the City of Rocklin have expressed a high level of satisfaction
with the services they receive, and the goals and policies of the Public Services and Facilities
Element are designed to assure that services and facilities continue to meet residents’ needs and
expectations.
Public services and facilities depend on adequate funding. Funding requirements are based on
planning that includes identification of the desired level of service, construction and maintenance
of required infrastructure, and attracting, training and retaining qualified personnel. As
development occurs in Rocklin, the agencies providing the various public services must expand
facilities and operations to accommodate the expanded service area.
The costs of providing public services and facilities are at least partially offset by service fees
and charges paid by current users, either through direct service charges or payments to an
assessment district or other entity. In the case of new development, impact fees are designed to
provide required new facilities.
The discussion which follows addresses issues related to each of the topics included in the Public
Services and Facilities Element.
Public Buildings
Public buildings serve many functions. City buildings attract a steady stream of residents
seeking information, permits or response to a particular need. These visitors, and those
employed in public buildings, generate regular and dependable activity. As centers of human
activity, public buildings can serve to enliven a neighborhood, and are viewed for that reason as
positive economic factors.
City of Rocklin General Plan                      4F-1                                   October 2012
Public Services & Facilities Element

Police and fire stations occupy an important place in any neighborhood, signifying the
community’s commitment to public safety. These locations serve as neighborhood gathering
spots, often serving as voting and education centers.
Public buildings have historically served as architectural signposts for the community. Rocklin’s
Civic Buildings have been developed with a careful eye to community character, and police and
fire stations have been developed in a manner consistent with neighborhood standards.
The City has engaged in significant community planning in connection with development of the
Rocklin Civic Center. The City recognized that locating and planning for public buildings has an
impact on many aspects of the community’s activities. Issues considered during the planning
process included impacts of traffic and noise, accessibility, and financial feasibility.
The Public Services and Facilities Element provides encouragement for continued good planning
practices in connection with the planning for public buildings, and provides policies regarding
this type of development.
The Public Services and Facilities Element considers the impact not only of new development on
public services and facilities, but also the impact of eventual buildout in the City. As new
development proceeds, the City’s system of imposing development impact fees, and establishing
methods to ensure continued adequate funding of public services and facilities for new
development, must generate an adequate stream of revenue.
Also important, however, is ensuring that adequate funds are available once the City reaches
buildout. Rocklin is anticipated to achieve residential “buildout” within the planning period, and
planning for a stable and adequate stream of funding is very relevant to the General Plan.
Law Enforcement
Law enforcement in the City is provided by the Rocklin Police Department. The Public Services
and Facilities Element includes specific policies relating to the provision of law enforcement
services. Other policies include those supporting community-oriented policing, strong crime
prevention programs, adequate funding, addition of resources concurrent with new development,
school resource officers and adequate crime prevention education in the schools. Specific
staffing ratio goals are not included, but rather a more flexible approach that encourages the
Police Department to serve, protect, and promote a safe community.
Community surveys indicate traffic-related issues and crime associated with growth are general
areas of concern. The Public Services and Facilities Element provides that patrol resources be
considered for such areas at the point of development. Such resources could include the ability
to patrol such areas on motorized bicycles or motorcycles. The Element also provides goals and
policies to be followed in the design of community facilities, such as parks, to promote public
safety. For example, many in law enforcement view designs that put public rear access to
residential properties as a potential hazard unless offsetting design features are utilized. Issues
concerning visibility of public areas, residential streetscapes and the interior of businesses such
City of Rocklin General Plan                   4F-2                                      October 2012
Public Services & Facilities Element

as mini-marts, as well as adequate lighting in public areas are addressed in the Design Review
process.
The City’s active Neighborhood Watch program attests to the view of the Police Department that
residents are a key part of any crime prevention program. This Element provides support for this
program, as well as others that enlist the support of residents for public safety purposes.
Fire Protection and Emergency Services
Fire Prevention, suppression, emergency medical, and technical rescue services are provided by
the City of Rocklin Fire Department. In addition to emergency response and rescue, the
Department must maintain the fire stations, fire apparatus, and water systems essential for
fighting fires in the community. The Department also conducts weed abatement and fuel
modification programs. The Fire Department provides a variety of public safety and educational
programs and is a regular visitor to the City’s schools, educating youth on various aspects of fire
safety.
The Public Services and Facilities Element includes specific policies relating to the provision of
fire protection and emergency medical services. Although Insurance Services Office (ISO)
ratings and response time are currently adequate, future development could adversely affect
these standards, regardless of station location, if a comprehensive approach is not taken. This
Element along with the Community Safety Element includes policies concerning automatic and
mutual aid, fire flow, public education, and development projects posing special needs (such as
assisted living facilities).
There are areas in Rocklin where private residences back up to “ open space” areas that become
very brown and dry in the summer and fall, thereby creating a fire hazard. The City’s open space
easements allow for property owners to undertake activities within these easements, such as tree
trimming and weed abatement, to create defensible space around their property. This Element
includes policies that recognize the effect of topography on fire access and that land developers
may be required to pay for equipment necessary to access sites consistent with Fire Department
standards (i.e., gates, opticoms systems, key boxes, bollards, etc.).
Public safety facilities are strategically located for quick response to most areas of the City.
These facilities have utilized modern codes and comply with seismic construction practices. All
fire stations are in close proximity to main response routes throughout the City. Fire facilities
and some equipment and apparatus are funded with assistance from development fees.
Libraries
A branch library is located in Rocklin. Due to population growth in the City of Rocklin, the
Rocklin library needed an expansion of facilities, staff and the collection in order to maintain the
level of service the Auburn-Placer County Library District wishes to provide, and which it
believes the residents of Rocklin desire. The Redevelopment Agency of the City of Rocklin
purchased a building at the corner of Granite Drive and Rocklin Road, and has leased the
building to Placer County for the new library which opened in January 2011. The Public
City of Rocklin General Plan                    4F-3                                    October 2012
Public Services & Facilities Element

Services and Facilities Element includes policies specifically aimed at ensuring that adequate
library services are provided within the City.
Schools
Schools are an important issue in Rocklin: a significant number of the community survey
respondents identified “Schools” as the most important issue facing the City. “Ensuring
streets/schools/parks are constructed” was viewed as “very important” by respondents. Schools
are an important part of any community. Schools are major sources of activity within the
community, and the quality of schools in a community can have an impact on its youth.
However, the school districts are separate governmental entities, and the City has no direct role
in the operation of the schools.
At the same time, as a focus of activity and energy, schools affect vehicular, bicycling and
pedestrian traffic. Schools also present security issues, and require attention from various public
service providers in the community. As centers of employment, schools are an important part of
the community’s economic fabric. One of the factors influencing the relative strength of the
local real estate market, for example, is the reputation of the local public schools. Although this
demonstrates that those who are contemplating a move to the community consider the health of
local public schools, it is just as clear that local schools are considered important to those who
already reside in the community.
Schools also present substantial compatibility issues relating to neighboring properties.
Neighbors are justifiably concerned with the potential impact of new schools on a
neighborhood’s traffic, noise and general ambience. Many of these impacts can be classified as
environmental issues.
New residential development is evaluated with regard to new demand for school facilities and is
subject to environmental review under CEQA in order to identify impacts and appropriate
mitigation. Under current State law, the environmental impact of new development on school
facilities is considered fully mitigated through the payment of required development impact fees.
In the case of certain General Plan amendments, other conditions may be required, such as
annexation into community facilities districts or dedication of land.
The Public Services and Facilities Element makes it clear that schools are an important
community asset, and that the effect of new development on local schools should be taken into
consideration when development proposals are considered.
Domestic Water Service
The Placer County Water Agency (PCWA) provides domestic water service in the City of
Rocklin. As required by State law, the City of Rocklin has consulted with PCWA in the
development of this General Plan to assure that there will be an adequate water supply to serve
future development. In their August 2006 Integrated Water Resources Plan and 2010 Urban
Water Management Plan, PCWA concluded that its water entitlements were sufficient to meet
the projected demands based on current and proposed General Plans in western Placer County.
City of Rocklin General Plan                     4F-4                                  October 2012
Public Services & Facilities Element

The Public Services and Facilities Element includes policies to facilitate water conservation to
help maintain adequate water supply for the community.
Wastewater Treatment
The South Placer Municipal Utility District (SPMUD) provides sanitary sewer services to the
City of Rocklin. SPMUD is a partner in the South Placer Wastewater Authority (SPWA) which
provides wastewater treatment for the City of Rocklin via Regional Wastewater Treatment
Facilities.      SPMUD’s 1986 Sewer Master Plan envisioned that Rocklin would have
approximately 52,604 sewered equivalent dwelling units (EDUs) consisting of non-residential
and residential development within the City at ultimate buildout, and the sizing of sewer
infrastructure has been based on this projection. The City of Rocklin is expected to contain
29,283 housing units at buildout as well as industrial, commercial and retail development.
SPMUD has recently completed a new master plan (2008) and information from Rocklin’s
proposed General Plan Update has been used to determine the trunk sewer sizes needed to serve
the area. SPMUD has indicated that no additional SPMUD staff or equipment would be required
as a result of full implementation of the General Plan Update. Furthermore, the increase in
wastewater flows resulting from implementation of the General Plan Update would not result in
SPMUD exceeding its ability to maintain an acceptable level of service (Richard Stein,
Engineering Manager-SPMUD, July 2009). The City does not need to take actions to ensure the
availability of sewer infrastructure.
The SPWA provides wastewater treatment facilities for the cities of Roseville, Rocklin, Loomis
and the surrounding unincorporated areas of Placer County. The SPWA has recently constructed
an additional regional wastewater treatment facility to serve the western portions of Rocklin.
SPMUD has indicated it will be able to serve the City of Rocklin’s future wastewater treatment
needs during the planning period (Clark, Charles, General Manager-SPMUD, March 2008).
Storm Drainage
Flood control services in Placer County are provided by the Placer County Flood Control and
Water Conservation District (District). The District implements watershed master plans and
hydrologic models, sets standards for development, has developed a county flood warning
system, reviews development, and provides technical assistance in an effort to prevent flooding.
Portions of the City of Rocklin are located within the Dry Creek watershed, for which the
District prepared the Dry Creek Watershed Flood Control Plan in 1992. The District also
prepared the Stormwater Management Manual in 1990. Each of these documents provides
guidance for stormwater management.
The Placer County Flood Control and Water Conservation District encourages the District and
cooperating agencies, such as the City of Rocklin, to emphasize development of regional
detention efforts and other projects recommended in the Dry Creek Watershed Flood Control
Plan. The Public Services and Facilities Element policies address this issue. The District also
stresses the importance of continuing to ensure that new developments conform to storm water
City of Rocklin General Plan                  4F-5                                 October 2012
Public Services & Facilities Element

manual requirements. The Rocklin Engineering Division works closely with the District to
ensure compliance.
The City of Rocklin Public Works Department maintains the storm drainage infrastructure within
the City. The City has historically addressed the issue of storm drainage on a priority basis in the
various City neighborhoods. In order to properly plan and maintain storm drainage
infrastructure, the City must have access to creeks and waterways that collect drainage. The City
continues to pursue access to creeks and waterways located on private property through use of
easements. This issue is addressed in the Public Services and Facilities Element.
The City is required to maintain a program to prevent discharge of pollutants to the storm drain
system, which ultimately flow to waterways within the community and downstream. The
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, or NPDES, applies to such discharges, and the
City maintains compliance with the program’s requirements. The Public Services and Facilities
Element includes policy encouragement for such efforts.
Solid Waste
The Western Placer Waste Management Authority (WPWMA) provides recycling and waste
disposal services to the City of Rocklin. The WPWMA is a regional agency that was established
in 1978 through a Joint Exercise of Powers Agreement between the County of Placer and the
cities of Roseville, Rocklin and Lincoln to acquire, own, operate and maintain a sanitary landfill
site and all related improvements. A majority of the waste picked up in western Placer County is
transported to the WPWMA’s Materials Recovery Facility (MRF) for processing and material
recovery. Recology Auburn Placer is the agency that provides waste transport services in the
City of Rocklin. The WPWMA also operates the Western Regional Sanitary Landfill and a
Household Hazardous Waste Facility.
As a result of the California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 (AB 939), which
requires cities and counties to divert 50 percent of their waste stream from landfill disposal,
WPWMA built a Materials Recovery Facility (MRF) to divert solid waste from being disposed at
the landfill. The MRF is designed to sort through wastes to recover recyclable materials such as
paper, cardboard, wood and green waste, glass, plastics, metals, electronic wastes and inert
materials such as concrete, and is a key element of the WPWMA program to help Placer County
communities meet the requirements of AB 939. The MRF recently completed an expansion
process that included modernized equipment and eight additional sorting lines, which increased
both processing capacity and the amount of recyclable materials recovered from the waste
stream. Materials that cannot by recycled are taken to the landfill.
The WPWMA operates the 320-acre Western Regional Sanitary Landfill (WRSL), located to the
west of State Route 65 between Roseville and Lincoln. As of 2008, the WRSL has a total
capacity of approximately 38 million cubic yards, and a remaining capacity of approximately 27
million cubic yards. The current space available, together with recovery efforts by the MRF, will
enable the landfill to accept waste until approximately 2042. To the west of the WRSL,
WPWMA owns an additional 465 acres for potential facility expansion. A use permit allowing

Public Services & Facilities Element

for landfilling on this property has been issued, however a Solid Waste Facility Permit has yet to
be obtained.
Planning for rapid regional growth, WPWMA expanded its facilities to meet the area’s waste
management needs over the next ten years and continues to consider future needs.
The City of Rocklin prepared a Source Reduction and Recycling Element in 1995 in response to
a State mandate (AB 939) that set a solid waste diversion requirement of 50 percent for the year
2000. As of 2006, the City’s diversion rate was 58 percent, due in part to the success of the green
waste collection program that was initiated by the City.
The City has also partnered with Placer County and neighboring jurisdictions to become
designated as a Recycling Market Development Zone, offering economic incentives to new
businesses using post-consumer waste materials within the zone. The need to encourage
individuals and companies to reduce, recycle and reuse remains important, and is addressed in
the Public Services and Facilities Element.
There is a perception that City of Rocklin recycling efforts are limited because curbside
separation of recyclable materials is not required. This is due to the presence of the regional
MRF in western Placer County. Because solid waste collected in the City is first transported to
the MRF for sorting and recyclables recovery, curbside separation is not necessary. The Public
Services and Facilities Element will serve a public education function by recognizing this
approach to recycling.
Electricity and Natural Gas
Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) provides electrical and natural gas services to the
City of Rocklin and is required by the State Public Utilities Commission to update the systems to
meet any additional demand. PG&E builds infrastructure on an as-needed basis. PG&E’s
general interest is to ensure that the company and City cooperate to ensure that infrastructure is
developed in a timely manner and that the company continues to have adequate access for
operation and maintenance activities. See Figure 4-13 in the Community Safety Element
(Chapter IV(D)) for the location of major electric transmission lines.
The Edison Electric Institute (EEI) issued a paper in May 2000 discussing the pros and cons of
undergrounding utilities. Underground lines are more aesthetically pleasing and protected from
trees, vehicles, vandalism, wind, ice, and storms, leading to increased reliability. The negatives
of undergrounding wires are related to an increase in cost for installing and maintaining the lines.
Other factors not mentioned in the EEI papers are increased landscaping alternatives with
underground lines, and safety, which can be a problem with both overhead and underground
lines. The EEI paper states that the decision whether or not to underground utilities is ultimately
based on the needs and preferences of the individual community.
The City of Rocklin worked with PG&E and the State Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to
design and locate a major high voltage transmission line (115Kv) corridor through Rocklin. The
preferred PG&E route located the line along the Union Pacific Railroad right-of-way between
City of Rocklin General Plan                    4F-7                                  October 2012
Public Services & Facilities Element

the Roseville city limits and Sierra Meadows Drive to the Delmar substation. Because high
voltage transmission lines at this location would have created a significant aesthetic impact on
Downtown/Central Rocklin, the City, PG&E and the PUC agreed that PG&E would underground
that portion of the line proposed between Sunset Boulevard and Midas Avenue.
The City of Rocklin generally has control of how and where lines under 50 kilovolts are
constructed, and currently requires undergrounding of such lines in new developments. For lines
that are above 50Kv (such as the 115Kv line through Downtown/Central Rocklin), the City only
has review and comment authority to the California PUC. PG&E now requires the City or
developer to pay the costs of reconstruction or replacement of overhead transmission facilities if
needed to serve a specific new development. The City of Rocklin has expressed interest in
undergrounding their existing overhead utilities, and the Public Services and Facilities Element
reflects the continued strong desire for more utility undergrounding by PG&E.
Telecommunications
Surewest Communications and AT&T provide telephone service in the City of Rocklin. Cable
and digital television is provided by Wave Broadband, Surewest Communications, and AT&T.
Several providers, including Surewest Communications, Nextel, Cingular Wireless, Sprint PCS,
Verizon Wireless and AT&T Wireless, provide wireless telecommunications. Infrastructure for
telephone and cable is typically installed at the point of initial development. Wireless
infrastructure is market-driven and is installed following initial buildout. Similar to electrical
service, provision of telephone service is generally addressed by the providers in accordance
with service demand in accordance with State Public Utilities Commission rules.
Other than the issue of undergrounding of utilities discussed under Electricity and Natural Gas,
the local general plan’s role is limited, with the exception of siting of wireless communications
facilities, which are subject to local regulation on the basis of land use compatibility and
aesthetics.      Regulation with regard to health and safety is reserved to the Federal
Communications Commission. Because the siting of wireless antenna sites can be controversial,
policy establishing siting parameters has been included in the Public Services and Facilities
Element.
Other Public Services
The Rocklin Cemetery is part of the Newcastle, Rocklin, Gold Hill Cemetery District. The

supply of cemetery space is in the public interest, and the Public Services and Facilities Element
confirms this in a policy statement.

planning and analysis report directly to the Chief of Police and all others are divided into two
divisions: Operations and Support Services.
The Operations Division is the largest division making up about 80 percent of all sworn staff.
Patrol officers in Operations have the responsibility of being first responders to all police calls
for service, handling emergency and routine calls for service, traffic accidents, and initial
criminal investigations. In addition to patrol, units in the operations division include a Traffic
Unit, S.W.A.T. Team, Critical Incident Negotiation Team, canine program, Animal Control
Officers, and the Reserve Police Officers Program.
The City is divided geographically into four patrol beats and forty-two Reporting Districts. To
keep pace with planned commercial growth, the department is planning for expanded beats over
the next five years. While Operations personnel will occasionally utilize bicycle patrol and foot
patrol, the geographical proportions of the City require vehicular patrol to ensure a rapid
response to emergencies. Motorcycles are used for patrol and traffic enforcement. The Police
Department also has off-road motorcycles which assist with access in rough terrain areas of the
City.
The Support Services Division is responsible for providing seamless support to all areas of the
Police Department and is comprised of the Professional Standards Unit, Investigations Unit,
Crime Analysis Unit, Communications, Records, Community Programs, Crime Prevention, the
Volunteer Program, and Youth Services Unit.
The Rocklin Police Department began to expand its volunteer program in the later part of 2002.
New volunteers attend a mandatory 50-hour volunteer police academy designed to familiarize
them with the police department’s role in the community and to provide them with specific
training to help them become safe, productive and professional police volunteers. The volunteer
academy includes driver safety training and a ride-along with a police officer.
Over 100 Rocklin Police Volunteers currently perform a wide variety of duties including clerical
functions, front counter duties, dispatch assistance, preparing crime prevention newsletters,
deploying the traffic speed awareness trailer, traffic control, special events, etc. Other duties
include delivering crime prevention presentations, checking homes while people are on vacation,
marking abandoned vehicles, contacting the victims of crimes via telephone, crime analysis,
equipment and vehicle maintenance, assisting detectives with investigations and follow-up,
conducting citizen surveys, etc.
The Police Department employs a full-time Police Crime Prevention and Volunteer Coordinator,
who oversees the crime prevention and community education programs, non-paid Police
volunteers and neighborhood watch groups. As of mid-2010, there are 167 active Neighborhood
Watch Groups in the City of Rocklin.
The Rocklin Police Department responds to approximately 4,000 incidents per month, with over
400 of those resulting in criminal reports. Information on the numbers of major crimes in the
City of Rocklin for the period 2004-2007 is presented in Table 4-18.

The City of Rocklin has interagency agreements for assistance with all of the surrounding
jurisdictions, whereby each agency will assist with incidents such as emergency situations or on
vehicle stops on the border of our cities.
The closest California Highway Patrol (CHP) station is located north of Rocklin in Newcastle.
When necessary, the CHP provides back-up services to the Rocklin Police Department and
surrounding jurisdictions. The Placer County Sheriff’s Department provides County Coroner’s
services and serves legal papers throughout the county.
The City of Rocklin Police Department has a Public Safety Dispatch Center that provides E-911,
cellular 911 dispatch services and other communications functions. The center is staffed 24
hours a day, 365 days a year and handles emergency calls for both the Police Department and
Fire Department. Rocklin also has interoperation agreements with the Cities of Roseville and
Lincoln to provide emergency dispatch services if the Rocklin Dispatch Operation is interrupted.
In 2007, dispatchers handled over 117,000 telephone calls.
Jail services are performed by Placer County and the City of Roseville. The County’s detention
facility is located in Auburn, at the intersection of A Avenue and Richardson Avenue. The
Roseville facility is used for misdemeanor offenders and is located on Junction Boulevard in
Roseville. The Rocklin Police Department has a Temporary Detention Facility within its Police
Station to assist with processing persons in custody before being transported to jail.
The Placer County Sheriff’s Department serves those portions of the planning area outside the
City limits. The Department is currently staffed with sworn and non-sworn personnel, including
Deputy Sheriffs. The Sheriff’s Department does not maintain a designated level of service
standard of personnel-to-residents because of the variation in population and terrain within the
County. The Sheriff’s Department does, however, determine staffing levels necessary to meet its
requirements.
FIRE PROTECTION AND EMERGENCY SERVICES
The Rocklin Fire Department provides fire protection services in the City of Rocklin. The
Department has full time personnel including administration, prevention and suppression staff, as
well as an additional volunteer firefighting and support force. The Rocklin Fire Protection

District, through a contract with the City of Rocklin, serves the Greenbrae unincorporated
“island.” Fire protection outside the planning area is provided by Placer County, under a
contract with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire).
Rocklin belongs to a statewide mutual aid system, through which fire suppression assistance is
provided to a member agency requesting assistance when it has exhausted its own resources and
needs assistance. Bordering fire jurisdictions participate with Rocklin in the statewide mutual
aid system.
There are currently three fire stations in the city. Fire Station No. 1 is located at 4060 Rocklin
Road, Fire Station No. 2 is located at 3401 Crest Drive and Fire Station No. 3 is located at 2100
Wildcat Blvd. A fourth station is planned for at the future intersection of Park Drive and Valley
View Parkway, but is currently being postponed until adequate funds for construction and staff
needs are identified (see Figure 4-15).
While the major fire threat in the city is related to urban development, annexations in the early
1990’s brought land into the city that contains large areas of grassland and is subject to a threat
of wildfire. Areas of concern include Clover Valley, areas at the southern end of China Garden
Road, portions of Whitney Oaks, the Croftwood/Dias Lane area, Whitney Ranch, open-space
easements, and recreational properties.
The City has adopted the California Fire Code as part of its building regulations. The Code
governs the fire safety requirements in building and construction (Rocklin Municipal Code,
Chapter 15.04).
The Department currently has an Insurance Services Office (ISO) rating of 3. ISO ratings range
from 1 to 10, with 1 being the best rating.
The Fire Department responds to a variety of emergency situations in the community. During
calendar years 1994 through 2007, the Department responded to the calls as shown in Table 4-
19.

        The Department’s response time is the time interval that elapses from the time a call for
        assistance is received until the first unit is on the scene. The Fire Department’s current average
        response time for all incidents is 5 minutes 31 seconds.
        American Medical Response (AMR) serves the City with ambulance services, and maintains
        response times under 10 minutes for the majority of calls. AMR serves western Placer County
        and strategically locates ambulances throughout the region, including within the City of Rocklin.
        The City of Rocklin has a mutual aid contract with nearby fire agencies and the California
        Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire), which provides fire services to
        unincorporated areas surrounding Rocklin under agreement with the Placer County Fire
        Department.
        Funding for Fire Department operations primarily comes from the City’s general fund, with
        some fee-based revenue, grants and educational reimbursements through Sierra Community
        College. The City charges a construction tax that is used for the acquisition of fire equipment, as
        well as parks, open space, bike trails and public buildings, needed as a result of increased
        development within the City. The Fire Department also charges fees for some services, including
        fire inspections, false alarms response, and fire and rescue services. Additional funds for
        recently annexed areas are collected through Community Facilities District #1.

SCHOOLS
The Rocklin Unified School District office is located at 2615 Sierra Meadows Drive in Rocklin.
The Rocklin Unified School District’s boundaries roughly correspond to the Rocklin City
boundaries. The district currently operates ten elementary schools, two middle schools, two
comprehensive high schools, one continuation school and one independent study school. See
Figure 4-5, Parks, Schools and Recreation Facilities for school locations. In addition, there are a
number of private schools in Rocklin.
The District completed a Facilities Master Plan in April 2008. School capacity is a key
component in determining new facility requirements. When enrollment meets or exceeds
capacity of existing schools, construction or expansion of the facilities will be needed.
There are two different measures of capacity used in the RUSD: design capacity and maximum
capacity. Design capacity is the desired enrollment at a school to optimize the delivery of the
education program and meet the District goals for a safe and secure environment. The maximum
capacity is the greatest number of students that a school can accommodate by most efficiently
using its facilities and adding the maximum allowable number of portable classrooms (RUSD
Facilities Master Plan, 2008). Existing capacity is the capacity of the facility at the time of the
preparation of the Facilities Master Plan. Current enrollment, design and maximum capacities
in the Facilities Master Plan are shown in Table 4-20, and enrollment projections are presented
in Table 4-21.

The RUSD Facilities Master Plan states that in addition to the two existing middle schools, there
is one new middle school site proposed. The District had a design capacity norm for middle
schools of 800 students per site. The RUSD Facilities Master Plan projected 2019/20 enrollment
of grade 7-8 students ranges from 1,964 to 2,037.
The District’s High Schools have a design capacity of 1,800 per site. The RUSD Facilities
Master Plan projected 2019/20 enrollment of grade 9-12 students ranges from 3,674 to 3,811. No
new high schools are anticipated in the District’s Facilities Master Plan.
A portion of the Rocklin planning area is also served by the Loomis Union School District,
primarily the Croftwood area and Clover Valley Lakes along the eastern edge of Rocklin. More
specifically these areas are situated east of Sierra College Boulevard, south of Pacific Street, and
east of Del Mar Avenue, north of Pacific Street. The Loomis Union School District currently
operates seven K-8 elementary schools, including one charter school: Loomis Grammar (3505
Taylor Road), Franklin Elementary (7050 Franklin School Road), Placer Elementary (8650
Horseshoe Bar Road), H. Clarke Powers Elementary (3296 Humphrey Road) and Penryn
Elementary (6885 English Colony Way). As of February 22, 2008 the enrollment numbers at the
schools according to the Loomis Union School District were 422, 516, 515, 424 and 242
respectively, for a total enrollment in the district of 2120 students. Ophir Elementary School,
also K-8, became part of Loomis Union School District as of July 1st 2008; this school had an
enrollment of 197 students in 2008. Within the area served by the Loomis Union School District,
students within the Rocklin area north of I-80 attend H. Clarke Powers Elementary School.
Those south of I-80 within the Loomis Union School District attend Franklin Elementary School.
Students within the Loomis Union Elementary School District attend Del Oro High School (3301
Taylor Road), which is part of the Placer Union High School District. The fall 2007 enrollment
at Del Oro High School was 1,618 students.
The Placer Union High School District encompasses approximately 980 square miles in Placer
County. The District has served the communities of Loomis, Penryn, Newcastle, Ophir, Auburn,
Bowman, Christian Valley, Meadow Vista, Applegate, Weimar, Foresthill, Colfax, Dutch Flat,
and Alta for over 100 years. The schools of the District enroll approximately 4,590 students,
grades 9-12. The Placer School for Adults serves over 11,000 adults a year. A recently
completed master plan, prepared by community members, business leaders, and staff,
recommends the District continue to maintain small high schools in a community setting.
Also located within the planning area are Sierra Community College and William Jessup
University. Sierra College is a fully accredited, two-year community college serving Placer,
Nevada and portions of El Dorado and Sacramento counties. The main campus is located on
Rocklin Road at Sierra College Boulevard south of Interstate 80. Other facilities operated by the
College include a 100-acre Nevada County campus in Grass Valley, a 73-acre campus center in
Truckee and a satellite center in Roseville. The current enrollment of the College is over 20,000
with approximately 15,000 students attending the Rocklin campus. Sierra College offers a wide
range of opportunities including: Associate in Arts (AA) or Associate in Science (AS) Degrees,
certificate programs, first two years of pre-professional programs, and guaranteed transfer to
four-year colleges and universities.

William Jessup University is a private Christian college located at 333 Sunset Boulevard. The
University offers undergraduate degrees as well as professional studies programs. Total
enrollment in 2008 was approximately 575, including full- and part-time students. On-campus
housing is available in the form of residence halls.
LIBRARIES
Library services in Rocklin are provided by the Auburn-Placer County Library District, which
was formed in 1967 with the consolidation of Auburn Public Library and the Placer County
Library. This system of libraries serves all of Placer County with the exception of the Cities of
Roseville and Lincoln, which own and operate their own municipal library systems.
The specific powers of the Library District are to disseminate knowledge of the arts, sciences,
and general literature. The Auburn-Placer County Library District operates a main branch in the
City of Auburn, a law library, children’s programs, nine branch libraries and a mobile service
that serves many areas throughout rural Placer County. One of the branch libraries, the Rocklin
Community Library, recently relocated from 5460 Fifth Street and re-opened in January of 2011
at its new location at the corner of Granite Drive and Rocklin Road (4890 Granite Drive). The
Rocklin Community Library has a community room available to the public for meetings. The
County Facilities Services Department provides maintenance of library facilities.
The Auburn-Placer County Library Long-Range Plan, adopted in 1991, projects facilities needed
to serve the existing and future population. The Long-Range Plan identifies the current facility
standard as .30 square feet of library space per resident. The Long-Range Plan was revised and
published as the Auburn-Placer County Library Service Plan 2002-2010, and it will be updated
again in the near future since 2010 is the last year of the current plan.
DOMESTIC WATER SERVICE
Domestic water service is provided by the Placer County Water Agency (PCWA). PCWA
provides treated water to commercial and residential connections in several water systems
throughout Placer County and untreated water to agricultural users.
The Rocklin planning area is located entirely within PCWA Zone #1. Zone #1 includes the City
as well as Auburn, Newcastle, the Loomis Basin, the City of Lincoln, an industrial corridor along
Highway 65, and residential areas south of Baseline Road and west of Roseville. See Figure 4-
16, Existing and Proposed Water Infrastructure.
PCWA, in its 2006 Integrated Water Management Plan and 2010 Urban Water Management
Plan, indicates that the sources of water to meet demands in Zone #1 and Zone #5 were the
same. Zone #5 is a zone that consists primarily of agricultural lands near Highway 65.
PCWA surface water entitlements available to Zones #1 and #5 include:

•    100,400 acre feet of water per year (afy) from the Yuba/Bear system that is purchased from
     PG&E. This water supply is reliable during most years; however, during the 1977 drought,
     PG&E had to impose drought restrictions on customers.
•    120,000 afy from the Middle Fork Project (American River). This water supply has
     historically been very reliable, even during drought periods.
•    35,000 acre feet annually from the Central Valley Project. This water supply is subject to
     approximately 25% cut backs during dry years.
•    5,000 acre feet annually purchased from South Sutter Water District. This water has been
     made available to Zone #5 per PCWA Board direction.
The total water available to Zones #1 and #5 is 255,400 afy of permanent water supply and 5,000
afy of temporary water. It is anticipated that under drought conditions, the PCWA would need to
rely on groundwater, in conjunction with demand reductions, in order to meet demands when
surface water supply is reduced.
In 2004, the PCWA used 114,000 acre feet to meet the needs of Zones #1 and #5 customers, of
which 39,000 acre feet were for municipal and industrial use, and the remainder for agriculture
and irrigation delivery.
Middle Fork Project deliveries to Zones #1 and #5 are through a pumping plant in Auburn.
Additional water may become available from the Sacramento River. The development of
proposed Sacramento River diversion facilities would provide an additional 35,000 afy and 65
million gallons per day treatment capacity. This project is currently on hold temporarily because
the project will not likely be needed by the PCWA until 2018 to 2025 due to the economic
slowdown, which has greatly reduced the pace of development that, as of a few years ago,
caused the PCWA to undertake the preparation of an EIR/EIS for that project on the assumption
that it would be required much earlier.
The PCWA treats water for the City of Rocklin at two treatment facilities, the Foothill Water
Treatment Plant and Sunset Water Treatment Plant. In addition to serving the City of Rocklin,
the Foothill and Sunset Water Treatment plants serve Lincoln, parts of Roseville, west Placer (a
portion of Granite Bay), Penryn and Loomis. The Foothill plant is located one mile south of
Newcastle, northeast of Rocklin, and the Sunset plant is located in northeast Rocklin. The
maximum design flow for the Sunset plant is 8 million gallons per day (mgd). Recent
modifications to the Foothill plant have increased treatment capacity from 27 mgd to 55 mgd.
The total treatment capacity for the Sunset/Foothill system is 63 mgd.
Treated water is brought to the City of Rocklin via a series of transmission lines varying in size
from 16 to 42 inches.
Three 10-million gallon water storage tanks are proposed for eventual construction adjacent to
the Sunset Water Treatment Plant. The first tank has been constructed. Storage capacity in the
Foothill/Sunset system is presently 31 million gallons.
City of Rocklin General Plan                    4F-18                                October 2012

The PCWA has completed a 42-inch diameter treated water transmission line between Penryn
and Lincoln. The Agency’s transmission capacity is now equal to its treatment capacity in the
Foothill/Sunset system that serves Rocklin and the communities of Loomis, Lincoln, and
surrounding unincorporated areas.
As a planning estimate, PCWA uses 1,150 gallons per day per dwelling unit as the estimated
average peak-day potable water demand for residential development. According to the State
Department of Finance, as of January 1, 2008 Rocklin had 21,036 housing units. If each
household were to use 1,150 gallons per day (peak), 24.19 mgd of treated water per day would
be needed during peak water use times.
PCWA collects connection fees from new developments. These fees are used to finance the
expansion of treatment, groundwater, storage, and transmission facilities to serve new
development.
PCWA’s long-term water supply plan is set forth in its 2010 Urban Water Management Plan.
The Plan considered the anticipated water demand based on the provisions of the current General
Plans for Placer County and the various cities within the PCWA service area. In their 2006
Integrated Water Management Plan and 2010 Urban Water Management Plan, PCWA
concluded that its water entitlements were sufficient to meet the projected demands based on
current General Plan provisions. However, projects involving development often include
requests for densities greater than those allowed in current General Plans.
PCWA encourages regional water use efficiency measures in connection with particular projects.
An example of some measures that may be included are the following: testing samples to
confirm accuracy of water meters; employing a water conservation coordinator; and initiating
irrigation efficiency programs to monitor the use of irrigation water.
PCWA does not reserve water for proposed customers, developers or specific future projects.
Although PCWA seeks to obtain sufficient water supplies to serve the buildout of all local
General Plans in its service areas, the agency satisfies requests for water service only on a first-
come, first-served basis. PCWA follows a policy of extending water pipelines only when an
adequate supply of water exists, thus ensuring that it does not take on new customers without a
firm supply of water needed to serve them.
New projects in the City and PCWA service area would be subject to water use and conservation
measures as provided for in applicable codes. These include regulations concerning required fire
flows in the Uniform Fire Code, low flush toilets and low water use fixtures.
Water demands for new projects will be evaluated by PCWA, and a determination made in each
case as to whether the Agency has adequate water supplies to meet the long-term demands for
water service.

WASTEWATER TREATMENT
The South Placer Municipal Utility District (SPMUD) was created in 1956 to provide sewer
collection and treatment services for parts of the Loomis Basin. Wastewater collection and
treatment for the City of Rocklin is provided by the SPMUD in partnership with the South Placer
Wastewater Authority (SPWA). SPMUD operates and maintains the sewer collection system,
and provides sewer maintenance and engineering services. Conveyance and treatment facilities
are operated by the SPWA. To project future regional wastewater needs, the SPWA had the
South Placer Regional Wastewater and Recycled Water Systems Evaluation (Evaluation)
prepared in June 2007. The Evaluation documents wastewater facilities needed to serve the
SPWA’s 2005 Service Area Boundary (SAB), which includes the City of Rocklin Planning Area.
The Evaluation identified that redevelopment within the City of Rocklin would result in
increased system flows, but the increased system flows due to intensification and rezoning have
no adverse effects (above and beyond previously identified deficiencies) on the trunk sewer
collection system, and no changes are needed to the treatment plant expansion requirements as a
result of intensification and rezoning
SPMUD’s 1986 Sewer Master Plan envisioned that Rocklin would have approximately 52,604
sewered equivalent dwelling units (EDUs) consisting of non-residential and residential
development within the City at ultimate buildout. The City of Rocklin is expected to contain
29,283 housing units at buildout as well as industrial, commercial and retail development.
SPMUD has completed a new master plan (2009) and information in Rocklin’s proposed
General Plan Update has been used to determine the trunk sewer sizes needed to serve the area.
The City does not need to take actions to ensure the availability of sewer infrastructure. Sizing of
sewer infrastructure has been based on plan projections. Figure 4-17 shows the existing sewage
collection infrastructure for the City of Rocklin.
The Dry Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant located in the southern part of Roseville, provides
wastewater treatment facilities for the SPMUD. This plant serves the Dry Creek Basin,
consisting of the cities of Roseville, Rocklin, Loomis and the surrounding unincorporated areas.
The plant operates under a Federal NPDES permit and discharges its treated effluent into Dry
Creek under standards established by the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board.
The Dry Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant’s current design capacity is 18 million gallons per
day (mgd). The plant’s flows average 12 million gallons per day (mgd) Average Dry Weather
Flow (ADWF). Average Wet Weather Flows (AWWF) is 30 mgd. The Dry Creek Wastewater
Treatment Plant provides tertiary level wastewater treatment using conventional secondary
treatment, as well as full nitrification, filtration, chlorination and disinfection.
The Pleasant Grove Wastewater Treatment Plant (PGWWTP) was constructed in 2005 to
provide sewer treatment and conveyance service to the western portions of Rocklin, Roseville,
and Placer County. PGWWTP’s initial design capacity is 10.5 mgd ADWF and 30 mgd AWWF.
Construction included new sewerage transmission facilities and advanced secondary treatment.
The plant discharges its effluent into the Pleasant Grove Creek.

STORM DRAINAGE
The City’s Engineering Services Division reviews all development plans to ensure that the
drainage systems are adequate to handle stormwater flows. The Rocklin Public Works
Department is responsible for maintenance of all City-owned portions of the stormwater drainage
system in the City. The City’s urban drainage system discharges into the creeks that transect the
community.
Flood control services in Placer County are provided by the Placer County Flood Control and
Water Conservation District (District). The District was established in 1984 by the State
Legislature for the contiguous area of Placer County as a distinct special district, apart from
County government, to address flood control issues arising with growth. District boundaries are
the same as Placer County boundaries. It is governed by its own Board of Directors. The Board
membership consists of one representative from each of the six incorporated cities (including the
City of Rocklin) in Placer County, two representatives from the Board of Supervisors, and one
member-at-large appointed by the Board of Supervisors and representatives of various
organizations.
The purpose of the Flood Control and Water Conservation District is to protect lives and
property from the effects of flooding through comprehensive, coordinated flood prevention
planning. Standards have been developed to evaluate flood risk and flood control measures such
as the requirement for new flood control infrastructure for new development to mitigate resulting
impacts.
The District develops and implements watershed master plans and hydrologic models, and
provides technical support to the County, the cities and developers. The City of Rocklin Public
Works Department maintains flood control facilities within the City limits. The District has
developed a county flood warning system, sets standards for development, performs
development review and provides technical assistance to the Office of Emergency Services.
Portions of the southeast one-half of the City of Rocklin are located within the Dry Creek
watershed. In this area, the need for local detention is recommended by the District. See Figure
4-18, Dry Creek Watershed Flood Control Plan. This Plan, prepared in 1992, proposed policies
and programs to reduce flooding within the Dry Creek watershed. According to the Plan, it is
anticipated that future land use changes will increase impervious surface area in the watershed by
approximately 50 percent, resulting in increased flood flows. This Plan recommended several
strategies during the rainy season including the use of detention structures, flood maintenance
activities, and measures to ensure public safety and avoid erosion and degradation of water
quality (Dry Creek Plan, 1992). The District’s Stormwater Management Manual (1990)
provides specific guidance and requirements for stormwater management, including regulation
of the development process, to achieve stormwater management objectives.

The City, as a part of all new development, requires storm drain catchments and conveyance
facilities. Maintenance of storm drain facilities is performed by the City’s Public Works
Department.
SOLID WASTE
The City of Rocklin is a member of the Western Placer Waste Management Authority
(WPWMA), a regional agency comprised of the cities of Lincoln, Rocklin, Roseville and the
County of Placer. The WPWMA provides recycling and waste disposal services to these
agencies (including the City of Rocklin) as well as the cities of Auburn and Colfax and the Town
of Loomis. Collectively, these agencies are referred to as the “Participating Agencies”. Solid
waste generated in Rocklin is collected and hauled to the Materials Recovery Facility adjacent to
the Western Regional Sanitary Landfill by the Recology Auburn-Placer under contract with the
City.
The California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 (Act, AB 939) required the City of
Rocklin to prepare planning documents for achieving a 25 percent goal of diversion of solid
waste from the landfill for 1995 and a 50 percent diversion goal for 2000. Rocklin’s plan
included a solid waste generation study that quantified the amounts and identified the types of
solid waste disposed and diverted in its base year. Based upon the solid waste generation study
results, the City identified and selected appropriate programs to address the targeted waste
stream that would help achieve the diversion mandate. The California Integrated Waste
Management Board approved Rocklin’s Source Reduction and Recycling Element in 1995.
To help the Participating Agencies meet the State mandate, the Western Placer Waste
Management Authority developed the Materials Recovery Facility (MRF) at the southwest
corner of Athens Road and Fiddyment Road, west of the City of Rocklin. Consisting of 39.9
acres permitted for transfer and procession operations, the MRF is the region’s predominant
recycling strategy because of its potential to achieve high levels of diversion at a lower rate of
processing cost-per-ton than other recycling strategies. The MRF has the flexibility to handle
Rocklin’s solid waste, whether mixed waste from Recology Auburn-Placer, or source-separated
recyclables from other recycling programs in the community. The MRF recovers recyclable
materials such as glass, plastics, metals, paper, cardboard, plastics, wood waste and green waste,
electronic materials and inert materials such as concrete from the incoming waste stream. The
MRF has a composting facility that processes yard wastes into high-quality materials suitable for
use as a soil amendment or mulch. A Buy-back/Drop-off Center for source-separated
recyclables, as well as a Household Hazardous Waste Drop-off Facility, is also located at the
MRF. Materials not accepted at the WPWMA include medical waste, dead animals, asbestos and
ash.
Non-recyclable solid waste received at the MRF is then disposed of at the adjacent Western
Regional Sanitary Landfill that has a disposal area of 231 acres. WPWMA owns an additional
465 acres west of the current landfill site. The site may potentially serve to expand operations in
the future. In addition to municipal solid waste (MSW) from the MRF, the landfill directly
accepts sewage sludge and other materials. The landfill is permitted to accept Class II and Class
III wastes. The landfill is permitted to accept 1,900 tons of MSW per day. The service life of

the landfill is calculated and permitted at this time to the year 2042. The Placer County
Environmental Health Division of the Placer County Health and Human Services Department
serves as the Local Enforcement Agency for the landfill.
According to the California Integrated Waste Management Board’s (CIWMB) 2005 figures,
36,276 tons of municipal solid waste were generated within Rocklin. This figure is based upon a
residential generation rate of 2.8 pounds of municipal solid waste per person per day and a
business generation rate of 12 pounds per employee per day. Rocklin generated slightly less
municipal solid waste in both business and residential categories when compared to other
California cities of a similar size (CIWMB). Rocklin’s solid waste diversion rate for the year
2001 reached 42 percent (John Rowe, Manager, Auburn Disposal Service, pers. comm.,
September 2002). This diversion rate was similar to diversion rates achieved by the cities of
Roseville, Lincoln and the Town of Loomis. In an effort to continue improving Rocklin’s waste
diversion rate, the City implemented the Green Waste Toter program, by which residents
separate green waste from regular garbage for pickup. As of 2006, with this program in place,
the City’s solid waste diversion rate improved to 58 percent.
The City of Rocklin, in partnership with Placer County and several neighboring jurisdictions, has
been designated as a Recycling Market Development Zone (RMDZ). A RMDZ designation
includes various economic development incentives for the location of new businesses using post-
consumer waste materials if they locate within the zone.
Five certified used oil recycling centers are located in Rocklin. These include Auto Zone,
Kragen Auto Parts, Pick-N-Pull, Jiffy Lube and SpeeDee Oil Change and Tune-Up.
ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS
Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) provides electrical and natural gas services to the
City of Rocklin through State-regulated public utility contracts. Major gas and electrical lines
within the planning area are shown on Figure 4-13. Two 60 KV lines supply three electric
substations that serve the Rocklin planning area electric distribution load. Existing substations
within the planning area include the Rocklin Substation on South Grove Street and the Del Mar
Substation on Corporation Yard Road off Sierra Meadows Drive. The third substation is the
Pleasant Grove Substation located on Industrial Boulevard north of Sunset Boulevard.
PG&E provides underground electric service within all new subdivisions. The City of Rocklin
requires undergrounding of utilities in new developments. As new development occurs,
construction or reconstruction of existing overhead distribution facilities is needed to supply
underground circuits in new developments. PG&E now requires the City or developer to pay the
costs of reconstruction or replacement of overhead transmission facilities if needed to serve new
development.
In accordance with AB 1890 (energy deregulation), the generation of electricity is open to
competition, but the transmission and distribution systems are not. Utilities are required to
purchase all their electricity needs from the wholesale market. The goal of the legislation was to
open the state’s energy market to competition, with the expectation that competition would drive

down the cost of electricity. The legislation gave utility customers the ability to choose their
electric energy provider.
At the same time, the electricity industry was restructured and many power plants were sold to
out-of-state energy companies. During the 1990’s, the State experienced rapid increase in
electricity demand from population growth, a growing economy and a booming technology
industry. Few power plants have been constructed in California since the 1980’s. With many
electric plants powered by natural gas, and natural gas consumer rate caps removed in 2000,
energy prices and demand skyrocketed. As a result, many electric companies began to
experience financial problems, divestiture of power plants occurred, prices were no longer under
State control, and financial integrity of the utilities was compromised, leaving some companies
in bankruptcy.
Since 2000, the state’s energy supply has stabilized, additional power plants have come on line,
and the price of natural gas has declined. However, since the State has entered into long-term
energy contracts, energy costs will remain high in California until a solution is reached.
PG&E typically prepares 10-year growth plans to accommodate new development. Much of
PG&E’s local capacity has been used at a faster rate than anticipated due to recent land
developments in the area. However, PG&E typically feeds power to new development and will
build in new infrastructure as needed.
The California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) adopts rules and tariffs that relate to the
design, installation and management of California’s public utilities. The PUC regulates the
planning and construction of new transmission facilities, distribution facilities, and substations if
the voltages exceed 50 kilovolts.
TELECOMMUNICATIONS
Telephone service in the City of Rocklin is provided by SureWest Communications and AT&T.
Cable and digital television service in the City of Rocklin is provided by Wave Broadband,
Surewest Communications and AT&T.
ROCKLIN REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY
A Redevelopment Agency was established for the City of Rocklin in 1985, and a redevelopment
project survey area designated. A 635-acre Project Area was selected, and the Rocklin Planning
Commission adopted a Preliminary Redevelopment Plan in April 1985. The City Council acts as
the Redevelopment Agency Board and adopted the original Redevelopment Plan on July 10,
1986.
The Redevelopment Plan was amended in 1997 to add two areas to the Redevelopment Project
Area, totaling 1,005 acres and again in 2004. See Chapter IV.A. “Land Use Element” for a
description of the Redevelopment Plan.

The primary goal of the Rocklin Redevelopment Agency is to provide a quality environment in
the older areas of the City for industrial, commercial, and activities in accordance with the City’s
General Plan.
CEMETERY DISTRICT
The Newcastle, Rocklin, Gold Hill Cemetery District was formed in 1927. The District
maintains 15.5 developed acres and 12.5 undeveloped acres. The Rocklin City Cemetery is
located where South Grove Street dead-ends into the cemetery property on Kannasto Street. The
location of the cemetery is depicted on Figure 4-4.
The following information is excerpted from the Rocklin Historical Society’s brochure Discover
& Explore the Rocklin City Cemetery:
         Local lore has it that the cemetery was started in 1864 when a railroad worker was
         found dead and buried on the spot. Emma and Harry Trott were the first recorded
         burials in the cemetery, also in 1864. In 1889, the State of California granted the
         cemetery site to the Masons & Oddfellows Lodges. The cemetery was annexed
         into the Newcastle, Rocklin, Gold Hill Cemetery District in 1927.
ROAD MAINTENANCE
The City of Rocklin Department of Public Works is responsible for public road maintenance and
improvement within the City limits. The City has developed a Pavement Management System,
which is a database of the City’s road conditions. The Pavement Management System is updated
yearly and is used to prioritize road-related projects, consistent with the dollars available. As
roads are constructed and improved, the database is updated.
ROCKLIN CIVIC CENTER PLAN
In 1996, the City of Rocklin prepared a Rocklin Civic Center Plan to provide a set of goals,
policies, guidelines, regulations, and implementation measures for a 107-acre site bordered by
Rocklin Road on the north, Pacific Street on the west, South Grove Street on the east, and an
irregular boundary contiguous to the Woodside area of Rocklin to the south. See Figure 4-19,
Civic Center Plan Vicinity Map. The Plan area is located in the historic center of the City and
originally contained the City’s central administration, including police, fire and Government
Center functions. Revisions to portions of the Plan became necessary during the 2011 General
Plan Update to eliminate inconsistencies and overlap with the Rocklin Downtown Plan. The 64-
acre area covered by the revised plan is shown in Figure 4-2 in the Land Use Element.
It is the intent that the Rocklin Civic Center Plan, as revised, be consistent with the policies of
the Rocklin General Plan. The Plan as revised contains a Land Use Plan, a Circulation Plan, an
Infrastructure Plan, and Design Guidelines, as well as 6 goals each having several policy
statements. The Goals and Policies of the Rocklin Civic Center Plan Area are listed at the end of
the policy section in this chapter.

Land Use Plan
Figure 4-2 in the Land Use Element illustrates the updated boundaries of the Rocklin Civic
Center Land Use Plan Area. Land use acreages for the 64 acre Plan area include a total of 54
acres for medium density residential development and 10 acres in streets.
Circulation Plan
The Circulation component of the Rocklin Civic Center Plan includes the street network for the
Plan area and is designed to carry out the project goals and support the Land Use Plan. Bicycle
facilities are also included in the Circulation Plan. The major features of the circulation network
are as follows:
•    Ruhkala Road will be extended to Woodside Drive and widened from 48 to 54 feet and
     extended on a new alignment north of Winding Lane to connect to the new East-West Drive.
     There will be bike lanes and frontage parking on one side of the road with residential
     frontage.
•    Evelyn Avenue and Winding Lane will become cul-de-sacs.
•    Evelyn Avenue will be connected to Lost Avenue by a bike path from the end of the cul-de-
     sac.
•    A new East-West Drive will be constructed between South Grove Street and Pacific Street to
     access the Civic Center area and the new northern extension of Ruhkala Road.
•    No off-site road improvements are proposed.
Infrastructure Plan
The Infrastructure component of the Rocklin Civic Center Plan includes a plan for both on- and
offsite facilities for sewer service provided by South Placer Municipal Utility District. Some
upsizing of existing sewer lines will be needed.
Water service is provided by Placer County Water Agency. Off-site infrastructure is adequate to
handle water demands within the Plan area.
Drainage facilities are under the jurisdiction of Rocklin and the Placer County Flood Control and
Water Conservation District and the requirements of the Dry Creek Basin Plan. The Midwest
and South Drainage systems require substantial improvements because of existing deficiencies
and the proposed development in the Plan area.

Public Services & Facilities Element
Goal 4.           Provide opportunities for new residential development in keeping with the
                  character and scale of existing residences in the area.
Goal 5.           Revise the Rocklin Civic Center Plan area street network so that it adequately
                  serves the existing area residents, accommodates new growth consistent with the
                  approved plan, and integrates into the City of Rocklin's overall street system.
Goal 6.           Prepare plans for the infrastructure in the area to upgrade existing infrastructure to
                  comply with current standards and to accommodate new growth consistent with
                  the approved plan.
The realization of the foregoing Rocklin Civic Center Plan goals will be dependent upon the
implementation of the following policies.
Goal 1 Opportunities for Historic Understanding
Policy 1:         Enhance the identity of the downtown area as a central place in the City by
                  encouraging a complementary development pattern within the overall Rocklin
                  Civic Center Plan area.
Policy 2:         Enhance and preserve the special natural features of the area, as reasonably
                  possible, including unique trees, quarries, and rock crops.
Policy 3:         Establish a strong design character or theme for the area, in concert with the
                  "Downtown Plan".
Policy 4:         The plan for the nearby Government Center will consider opportunities for
                  display and interpretation of historic materials through the use of space in existing
                  or new building as well as outdoor displays.
Policy 5:         Preserve mining artifacts, as possible, by identifying and storing items on public
                  sites and encouraging preservation on private sites and or transfer to public sites.
Policy 6:         Provide visual, written, and mapped linkages between mining, history with other
                  historical aspects of the City such as railroading, trade, and agriculture.

Policy 7:         Establish guidelines to preserve and protect those unique quarries and rock
                  outcroppings within the Rocklin Civic Center Plan Area and nearby Government
                  Center.
Goal 3 Preserve Character of Existing Residential Areas
Policy 8:         The planned densities within existing undeveloped areas should enable the
                  preservation of those unique quarries, rock outcroppings, and trees as reasonably
                  possible.
Policy 9:         The existing narrow streets within the interior of the area should be used as a basis
                  to design a “rural lane” type of residential street cross-section.
Policy 10:        The street network should be designed to discourage external or through traffic
                  from the core residential areas.
Policy 11:        New residential developments should be in scale with the existing residential uses
                  in the area.

Goal 4 New Residential Developments
Policy 12:        Establish densities for new residential uses that will allow for economical
                  development and the provision of upgraded public facilities in the form of streets,
                  waterlines, sewer lines, and storm drainage facilities.

                  used to review and approve residential projects.

                  residential uses should be compatible with the existing residential structures.

                  through traffic.
Policy 17:        Provide for the continuity of a Woodside Drive-Ruhkala Lane alignment.
Policy 18:        Create a Civic Center street/drive network south of Rocklin Road that provides
