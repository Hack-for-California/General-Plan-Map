                           CITY OF MONTAGUE HOUSING ELEMENT
INTRODUCTION
1.       Contents of the Housing Element
The Housing Element of the General Plan is a comprehensive statement by the City of Montague of its
current and future housing needs and proposed actions to facilitate the provision of housing to meet
those needs for all income levels. This Housing Element is a stand-alone document intended to
replace the City’s previous Housing Element adopted in May 2010. It is intended to become an
integral part of the City’s existing General Plan.
The policies contained in this element are an expression of the statewide housing priority to allow for
the “attainment of decent housing and a suitable living environment for every Californian,” as well as
a reflection of the unique concerns of the community. The purpose of the Housing Element is to
establish specific goals, policies, and objectives relative to the provision of housing, and to adopt an
action plan toward this end. In addition, the element identifies and analyzes housing needs, resources,
and constraints to meeting those needs.
Additionally, the Housing Element is to provide clear policy and direction for making decisions
pertaining to zoning, subdivision approval, housing allocations, and capital improvements relative to
the housing goals. State law (Government Code Sections 65580 through 65589) mandates the
contents of the Housing Element. By law, the Housing Element must contain:
         •    An assessment of housing needs and an inventory of resources and constraints relevant to
              meeting those needs.
         •    A statement of the community’s goals, quantified objectives, and policies relevant to the
              maintenance, improvement, and development of housing.
         •    A program that sets forth a five-year schedule of actions that the local government is
              undertaking or intends to undertake to implement the policies and achieve the goals and
              objectives of the Housing Element.
The housing program must also identify adequate residential sites available for a variety of housing
types for all income levels; assist in developing adequate housing to meet the needs of very low-,
low-, and moderate-income households; address governmental constraints to housing maintenance,
improvement, and development; conserve and improve the condition of the existing affordable
housing stock; and promote housing opportunities for all persons.
Even though the focus of the Housing Element will be on lower- and moderate-income households,
the element must also address the housing needs and policy issues for the entire community. Thus, the
Housing Element’s focus is to balance the desire of residents, maintaining neighborhood character,
managing traffic, and minimizing visual and other impacts of new development while addressing the
needs of low- and moderate-income households and special needs groups (such as seniors and
individuals with disabilities).

2.       General Plan Consistency
The California Government Code requires internal consistency among the various elements of a
general plan. Section 65300.5 of the Government Code states that the general plan and the parts
and elements thereof shall comprise an integrated and internally consistent and compatible statement
of policies for the adopting agency. The City has reviewed the other elements of the general plan and
has determined that this element is consistent with the policies of those. The City will maintain this
consistency as future general plan amendments are processed by evaluating proposed amendments
for consistency with all elements of the general plan.
Section 65302 of the Government Code requires cities and counties to amend the safety and
conservation element of the general plan to include analysis and policies regarding flood hazard and
flood management information. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has mapped
the Montague planning area (FEMA Firm Map #060451 0001 A). The City does not feel that flood
hazards would adversely impact residential development within the city. Sites identified in the land
inventory do not have flood plain constraints. Therefore, the City will defer amendments to its
conservation element. If any disadvantaged unincorporated communities are identified in the City’s
sphere of influence due to analysis required to comply with Senate Bill (SB) 244, the City will amend
the Land Use and Housing Elements per SB 244 requirements.
3.       Analysis of the Previous Housing Element
An important aspect of the Housing Element is an evaluation of achievements under the
implementation programs included in the previously adopted Housing Element. The evaluation
provides valuable information on the extent to which programs have been successful in achieving
stated objectives and addressing local needs, and to which these programs continue to be relevant in
addressing current and future housing needs in the City of Montague. The evaluation also provides
the basis for recommended modifications to programs and the establishment of new objectives in the
Housing Element. The Housing Implementation Programs Summary contains a summary of the City’s
objective and programs for the past planning period (Appendix A).
4.       Public Participation
State law requires jurisdictions to make a diligent effort to achieve participation by all segments of the
community in preparing a Housing Element. The Housing Element was developed through the
combined efforts of City staff, the City Council, and the City’s consultant. Public input was solicited
during a public workshop on February 6, 2014. 14 members of the public attended the workshop. A
public notice was mailed to a number of interest groups (see list below), published in the Siskiyou
Daily News (a newspaper of Countywide circulation), posted at City Hall, the post office, and a local
grocery store. The City also held public hearings during review of the draft with the City Council
(acting as the Planning Commission) on March 6, 2014. This meeting was noticed in the same
manner as the February 6th workshop. [to be filled in later in public participation process] In an effort
to allow all economic segments of the community (including lower-income groups) to comment on the
draft Housing Element, the City placed review copies at City Hall. [fill in with attendance info]

SECTION ONE: GOALS, POLICIES, AND PROGRAMS
The following program sets forth a five-year schedule of actions that the City will undertake or intends
to undertake in an effort to implement the policies and achieve the goals and objectives of the
Housing Element. To the greatest extent possible, the objectives, housing policies, and implementation

QUANTIFIED OBJECTIVES
Table 1 summarizes the City’s quantified objectives for the 2014 through 2019 Housing Element
planning period. These objectives represent a reasonable expectation of the maximum number of
housing units that will be developed and conserved, and the households that will be assisted, over the
next planning period based on policies and program in this document.

SECTION TWO: HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
The Housing Needs Assessment provides a demographic profile of the City by analyzing the following
types of information: population, identified special housing needs, housing characteristics, costs and
housing conditions, and constraints to development. The assessment also provides other important
information to clarify and support the goals, policies, and programs to meet the housing needs of
current and future residents.
Much of the information presented in Housing Needs Assessment was compiled and vetted by the
California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) in a workbook of tables
known as the HCD Housing Data Packet. Other sources used include the US Census, completed
every ten years, an important source of information for the Housing Needs Assessment. The Census
provides the most reliable and in-depth data for demographic characteristics of a locality. The
California Department of Finance (DOF) and the US Census American Community Survey (ACS) also
provide valuable data that is more current. Where the US Census provides complete counts of various
demographic indicators, the ACS provides estimates based on statistically significant samples. Due to
the small size of the sample taken in Montague, the estimates reported by the ACS have large margins
of error. Where ACS data is used, the numbers should not be interpreted as absolute fact, but rather
as a tool to illustrate general proportion or scale. The data presented in the Housing Needs
Assessment not only guide the development of housing goals and policies, but also was integrated
into the body of the Housing Element to present the current status of housing and housing-related
issues in the City of Montague. Definitions of various US Census Bureau terms used throughout this
document are provided in Appendix E for clarification.
The needs assessment is organized into three main sections. The first section focuses on demographic
information, such as population trends, age, household composition, income, employment, housing
characteristics, general housing needs by income, and housing needs for special segments of the
population. This first section outlines the characteristics of the community, and identifies those
characteristics that may have significant impacts on housing needs in the community.
The second section identifies possible governmental and non-governmental constraints to housing
development in Montague. The City has planning, zoning, and building standards that guide and
affect residential development patterns and influence housing availability and affordability. There are
also environmental and housing market conditions that affect the location, availability, affordability,
and type of housing that is constructed in Montague. The “non-governmental” influences include such
factors as: the availability and cost of financing, land and materials for building homes; natural
conditions that affect the cost of preparing and developing land for housing; and the business factors
that influence decisions of individuals and organizations in home building, finance, real estate, and
rental housing, all of which impact housing costs and availability.
The third section identifies the City resources and opportunities for affordable housing, which includes
an inventory of adequate sites for affordable housing unit potential, funding resources and a
description of the current housing programs that can encourage and support the development of
affordable housing for residents of Montague.

1.       POPULATION AND EMPLOYMENT TRENDS
The population of Montague increased by 1 percent from 1,415 in 1990 to 1,429 in 2012, as shown
in Table 2. The US Census estimated the city’s 2010 population to be 1,443 persons, which
represented an increase of 2 percent from 1990. The trend within the county of slow growth or no
growth at all is fairly common for rural Siskiyou County, where a shortage of economic opportunities
deters growth.

Table 3 shows the population trends from 2000 to 2013 for neighboring jurisdictions. From 2000 to
2010, most of the communities saw decreases in population, with the exception of a notable percent
increase in the number of residents in Ft. Jones. The largest percent change from 2010 to 2013 was
also in Ft. Jones, with a 10.7 percent decrease in population over the three-year period.

Population projections are not currently available for the City of Montague. The DOF provides
projections for all counties through 2060 but does not provide them at the city level. Because of
Montague’s small size, no other data source for projections at the city level could be located. Table 4
shows the expected population for both the incorporated and unincorporated portions of Siskiyou
County from 2010 to 2050. While the County projections represent a wider, more diverse regional
perspective, they do represent an understanding of future regional growth of which Montague will be
a part. Based on DOF projections, the County is expected to experience a growth rate of
approximately 16 percent.

The distribution of Montague’s population by age group is shown in Table 5. The distribution for most
age groups has not changed significantly since 2000. The number of residents in the age group
between the ages of 25 and 34 increased by approximately 65 percent with the addition of 73
residents in that age group. Correspondingly, the 5 to 14 age group decreased by approximately 25
percent and the 15 to 24 age group decreased by 9 percent. The likely explanation for this change is
that younger residents are leaving the city in search of job opportunities. The number of residents 65
and older also decreased slightly.

2.        EMPLOYMENT
Employment, industry, and commuting pattern data for the City were provided by the California
Employment Development Department (EDD), the US Census, and the DOF. Table 6 shows
employment by industrial sector for both 2000 and 2010 in Siskiyou County. Data at the City level
was not available. The largest industrial sector in both 2000 and 2010 was Government, followed by
Trade, Transportation, & Utilities. Decreases in numbers of employees occurred in all but two
sectors—Education & Health Services and Government.

The region’s fastest-growing occupations are listed in Table 7. This information is only available for
the North Mountains Region of California, which includes Lassen, Modoc, Nevada, Plumas, Sierra,
Siskiyou and Trinity Counties, but provides some of the picture of labor trends in Montague as
Montague residents work both inside and outside of the city. The fastest-growing occupations for
2008 to 2014 is Pharmacy Technicians, followed by Fitness Trainers and Aerobics Instructors.

As shown in Table 8, the City had a jobs deficit in the year 2010 with 75 jobs available for the 633
housing units within the city. This jobs/housing ratio is a metric which can be used to estimate if the
number of available jobs match the number of available housing units. For example, a ratio of 1:1 is
the industry-recommended balance, meaning that for each job within the city, there is one home
available for that worker to occupy. This lack of jobs in the city is also evident in Table 9 which shows
the commuting patterns of residents of Montague.

With the very low jobs/housing ratio, the locations where residents of Montague are commuting to is
important in regional and local planning. As shown in Table 9, 42.9 percent of the 392 employed
residents of Montague work in Yreka and only 3.3 percent work within city limits. Neighboring
Redding and Weed each employ 5.4 percent of Montague workers.

Table 11 illustrates the number of households in each income group based on the 2006–2010 US
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Comprehensive Housing Affordability
Strategy (CHAS) dataset. Approximately 11.7 percent of all households fall into the extremely low-
income category, 26.1 percent of all households fall into the very low-income category, and 15.3
percent fall into the low-income category. When all three of the lower income categories are
combined, 53.1 percent of the City’s households have incomes at or below the low-income limit. The
remaining 46.8 percent of households earn incomes that fall into the moderate-income and above
moderate-income categories.

Income Limits and Housing Affordability
The state of California publishes annual income limits for each county that are used to determine
eligibility for assisted housing programs. The California Health and Safety Code requires that the state
limits for the low-, very low-, and extremely-low income categories will be the same as those in the
equivalent levels established by HUD for its Section 8 program. The income limits by household size
for Siskiyou County, which are applicable to the City of Montague, are shown in Table 12.

HCD defines “affordable” to mean that a household is not paying more than 30 percent of its income
in order to meet its housing needs, regardless of whether the house is rented or owned. This section
discusses the affordability of housing within Montague based on this criterion. This section also
analyzes the issue of substandard housing as it relates to affordability.
Table 13 illustrates the amount of rent or value of a house which extremely low-, very low-, low-, and
moderate-income households can afford. Based on the figures in Table 13, low- and moderate-
income households can afford to either rent or buy a home in Montague at market rates (See Table
25). However, very low- and extremely low-income households may not be able to afford median
market rents in the city. Based on this analysis, the market conditions in Montague reflect the lower
household income in the city. Very low- and extremely low-income households are not expected to be
able to afford rental housing unless they are able to find rentals that are less than $248 per month,
which is significantly below the average rent for a two-bedroom unit of $638 (see Table 26: Median
Monthly Rents, 2013).

Overpayment
Definitions of housing affordability can vary, but in general a household should spend no more than
30 percent of its monthly income on housing costs. Households that pay more than this are
considered “cost-burdened” and households that pay more than 50 percent are considered “severely
cost-burdened.” Measuring the amount of people paying more than this percentage helps define an
area’s affordability problem. Table 17 illustrates the extent of overpayment by tenure and income
category. The category with the highest percentage of households overpaying for housing was renter-
occupied, extremely low-income households, with an overpayment rate of 84.7 percent. Very low-
income renter-occupied households had the next highest overpayment rate with 81.2 percent of
households paying over 30 percent on housing costs.

Housing Composition
The composition of housing units in Montague is mostly single-family. Table 18 displays the estimated
number of each type of housing unit for 2000, and the 2006–2010 ACS estimate as reported by the
US Census. It should be noted that the ACS has a high amount of uncertainty since the survey is
calculated through estimates and models, and is not as accurate as the 2010 Census. The number of
multifamily housing units increased by 54 units since 2000 while the number of single-family units
decreased by 63 units.

4.       HOUSING CONDITIONS
Age of Housing
Housing Element law requires an estimate of substandard housing in the community. Determining the
percentage of units built prior to 1960 provides an estimate of major rehabilitation or replacement
need. One can also assume that homes built prior to 1980 may require some form of rehabilitation.
Table 19 indicates that approximately 58.6 percent of the units in the city were constructed prior to
1960 and 23.4 percent of units were constructed between 1960 and 1980. Therefore, based upon
age alone, it would appear that approximately 82 percent of homes in the city may require
rehabilitation or replacement depending on the level of maintenance these units have received.

Based on results of a 2002 Housing Conditions Survey conducted by Great Northern Corporation
(Table 20), 62 percent (equivalent to 298 housing units) was classified as deteriorating and in need of
rehabilitation, and 3.9 percent (13 units) were classified as dilapidated and in need of demolition and
replacement. Five additional housing units were identified as becoming suitable for rehabilitation
during the prior planning period. The survey did not include mobile home parks and was performed
as a “windshield survey.” Inclusion of the mobile home parks and a closer inspection would be
expected to result in an increase in the number of units needing rehabilitation or replacement. During
the period of 2001–2007, 13 single-family dwellings were rehabilitated with CDBG funding, which
represents 4.3 percent of the housing stock. Six housing units were rehabilitated during the 2008 to
2013 planning period. Rehabilitation needs have not changed significantly since the 2002 survey,
however the information is becoming dated. Implementation Measure II-1 calls for an updated
housing condition survey during the 2014-2019 planning period.

Housing Unit Size
Household size by tenure is shown in Table 21. In 2000 and 2010, the majority of owner-occupied
households were inhabited by two residents, while the majority of renter-occupied households were
inhabited by one resident. Between 2000 and 2010, large family households (five or more persons)
decreased by eight households among owner-occupied households and by seven households among
renter-occupied households.

Overcrowded Housing
The US Census Bureau defines overcrowding as more than 1.01 persons per room. Severe
overcrowding occurs when there are more than 1.5 persons per room. Table 22 illustrates the number
and percentage of units in the city according to occupants per room. Overall, the City of Montague
averaged about 0.50 persons per room. For owner-occupied housing units, there is minimal
overcrowding at 5.4 percent while renter-occupied households had an overcrowding rate of 8.4
percent, which is considered low when compared to other cities across California.

Housing Problems
According to HUD, housing problems can include a housing unit which lacks a kitchen or proper
plumbing, has more than one person per room (overcrowding), or has a cost burden greater than 30
percent. Table 23 shows the number of housing units which had one or more of these problems by
income category and tenure. According to the 2006–2010 CHAS dataset by HUD, 22.2 percent of
all renter-occupied households and 18.9 percent of all owner-occupied households had one or more
housing problems between 2006 and 2010. Overall, 41.1 percent of occupied households in
Montague had one or more housing problems with the largest number of households, 54, falling in
the renter-occupied, very low-income category.

Regional Home Value
Table 24 shows the median value of single-family homes in Siskiyou County since 2000. According to
the 2000 US Census, the median value of homes in Siskiyou County was about $100,000. This
increased dramatically, by 138.0 percent, according to the 2008–2011 ACS to $238,000. However,
the most recent statistics on housing value show that the median value is $104,000 in 2013, a 4.0
percent decrease from the value in 2000, reflecting the boom and bust trend in the housing market
over the last decade.

5.       SPECIAL HOUSING NEEDS ANALYSIS
Persons with Disabilities
Table 27 illustrates the population of persons with disabilities who may require housing with special
features such as wheelchair ramps, special doorbells, roll-in showers, high-set toilets, or other
adaptive devices or medical equipment. The majority of the population with disabilities is in the young
adult-to-senior group (16–64). Most of the disabilities in this group (70 percent) are employment-
related. Table 32 lists two care facilities for seniors and disabled persons within the city. Barker’s
Residential Care facility is subsidized by funds from the County’s Behavioral Health Services (BHS) and
provides a 24-hour residential setting for mentally ill adults (15-bed facility). Dutra’s Guest House has
capacity for six seniors. The city has a shortage of residential care facilities. There was interest
expressed in remodeling the former Martin’s Tack and Feed Store into a residential care facility;
however, no formal application has been filed with the City. This poses a problem as the community
ages and requires a variety of senior living options including assisted living and retirement
communities. However, the City of Yreka, which is less than seven miles away, has three residential
care facilities, and there are an additional five others throughout Siskiyou County, all of which are
listed in Table 32.

Large Households
A large family is one with five or more family members. Large families are considered a special needs
group because they require larger homes, but do not necessarily make enough money to afford many
of the larger homes available. Those homes are luxury homes out of the range of affordability for
lower-income families. Thus, a large family may struggle to find suitable affordable housing. The
number of large families in the city is shown in Table 21. The proportion of owner households as a
percentage of all large households decreased and the proportion of renter households increased by
1.2 percent. In 2000 and 2010, the majority of owner-occupied households were inhabited by two
residents, while the majority of renter-occupied households were inhabited by one resident. Between
2000 and 2010, large family households decreased by about eight households among owner-
occupied households and seven households among renter-occupied households.
As stated above, the HUB Communities Family Resource Center offers classes, resources and
information for seniors, parents, and children throughout 10 Siskiyou County communities. Services
available to families in the community include: emergency help such as job referrals, food, housing
referrals, heating bill assistance, health and nutritional instruction, adult and children literacy
programs, crisis support, playgrounds, toddler playgroups, parent and children together, parenting
component, parenting classes, newsletter, summer fun camps, resource and referral, healthy families,
medical, resumes, pre-literacy programs in tandem with licensed day care, library story times, summer
reading programs, kindergarten readiness, public health department bicycles, and car seats to low-
income families.

Farmworkers
Farmworkers are defined as those households whose wage-earners make their living through seasonal
agricultural work and who move with the seasons to different farming communities, or those who find
tree planting jobs and who also move throughout the forested regions on a seasonal basis.
Farmworkers can also be permanent residents of one area and work fields, nurseries, or timber yards
year-round, often working for more than one farm throughout the year.
The agricultural area in which the City of Montague is centered is primarily hay farming or cattle
ranching. Typically, these agricultural activities do not utilize the services of migrant farm workers.
According to representatives of the Modoc Siskiyou Community Action Agency, agricultural workers
are mostly found in those Siskiyou County communities that are closer to planting sites. The nearest
community employing seasonal farmworkers is Macdoel, which is approximately 25 miles northeast of
Montague. This is the closest area where intensive farming of strawberry and potato crops occurs.
Intensive farming of this nature does not occur anywhere near Montague. Soils in the Montague area
are considered to be too heavy for regular tillage, so they are used almost entirely for hay and
pasture.
Table 33 shows the total population of farmworkers in Siskiyou County according to the 2007 USDA
Census of Farmworkers. In total, 5,618 farmworkers were in Siskiyou County in 2007 on either a
seasonal or permanent basis. Seasonal farmworkers represented 76.8 percent of the farmworker
population, and permanent farmworkers made up the remaining 23.2 percent.

To meet the potential needs of farmworkers residing in Montague, in accordance with Health and
Safety Code Sections 17021.5 and 17021.6, housing for farmworkers in the City of Montague for six
or fewer persons shall be deemed a single-family structure with a residential land use designation, and
employee housing up to 12 units and with 36 beds shall be allowed in all zones where agricultural
uses are allowed (see Implementation Measure I-11). In addition, “dwelling groups” 2 are allowed with
issuance of a conditional use permit in the R-3 zone district.
2
  Dwelling groups means a group of two or more detached or semidetached one-family, two-family, or multiple dwellings
occupying a parcel of land in one ownership and having any yard or court in common, but not including automobile courts

Single-Parent Households
Single-parent households, and those headed by single females in particular, experience the full range
of housing problems. These problems include: affordability, since the individuals are often on public
assistance; overcrowding, because the individuals often cannot afford units large enough to
accommodate their families; insufficient housing choices; and sometimes discrimination. The City of
Montague recognizes these problems and has included policies and programs (Implementation
Measures I-2 and I-3 are included in this document to address affordability, overcrowding, and
discrimination for all segments of the population).
Table 34 illustrates the number of households that are headed by single parents. Single-parent
households comprise approximately 20 percent of all households in the city. Of this 20 percent,
female-headed households comprise approximately 59.5 percent while male-headed households
represent 40.5 percent of single-parent households.

Homelessness
The city has not had a large presence of homeless residents in the past. Siskiyou County Sheriff’s
Department that serves Montague does not keep records on their contact with homeless or transient
individuals. Recent discussions with City staff indicated that there are no known homeless individuals
currently residing within the city. However, if such individuals do exist, they are likely receiving any
food, housing, and shelter referral services from the providers located in Yreka. The City of Montague
has one facility, the Barker’s Board and Care facility on 200 S. 4th Street, which provides 24-hour
adult board and care services for mentally ill patients. Additional services for homeless individuals and
families are readily available in the City of Yreka and elsewhere in the County. Table 35 illustrates the
programs in the city and surrounding area that offer assistance. Contacts with these agencies indicate
2014–2019 Housing Element
City of Montague General Plan                            39

that the needs of homeless persons are adequately met by existing programs. Regardless, the City has
amended its Zoning Ordinance to facilitate the development of additional shelters should there be an
increased need for these facilities at some point in the future.

The following proposed programs relate to the City’s commitment to assist the homeless.
              •   Implementation Measure 1-8: Pursuant to SB 2, the City will amend the Zoning
                  Ordinance to include separate definitions of “supportive housing” and “transitional
                  housing” consistent with Government Code Sections 65582(f), (g), and (h). Further,
                  the City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to list supportive and transitional housing
                  as permitted uses within all zoning districts allowing residential development, subject
                  only to those regulations that apply to other residential dwelling of the same type in
                  the same zoning.
              •   Implementation Measure I-9: The City will support any public and/or nonprofit entity
                  who proposes to develop a shelter for homeless persons in the city.

6.       ENERGY CONSERVATION
During the winter months, utility costs are significant in the city, particularly for lower- and fixed-
income households. Pacific Power performs energy audits on both residential and commercial
properties and offers zero-interest weatherization loans as well as some limited weatherization-cost
rebates. The Great Northern Corporation operates both weatherization and energy-cost support
programs for lower-income households.
Opportunities for energy conservation can be found for both existing and future housing
developments. Conservation can be achieved through a variety of approaches including reducing the
use of energy-consuming appliances and features in a home, physical modification of existing
structures or land uses and reducing the reliance on automobiles by encouraging more mixed-use
and infill development, and providing pedestrian access to commercial and recreational facilities.
Some energy conservation features are incorporated into the design of residential structures in the City
of Montague due to the requirements of Title 24, which outlines measures to reduce energy
consumption in new construction. These measures include low-flow plumbing fixtures, efficient heating
and cooling opportunities, dual pane windows, and adequate insulation and weather stripping.
Incorporating new technology within residential developments offers developers a chance to design
projects that allow for maximum energy conservation opportunities. Although energy regulations
establish a uniform standard of energy efficiency, they do not ensure that all available conservation
features are incorporated into building design. Additional measures may further reduce heating,
cooling, and lighting loads and overall energy consumption. While it is not feasible that all possible
conservation features be included in every development, there are often a number of economically
feasible measures that may result in savings in excess of the minimum required by Title 24.
Constructing new homes with energy-conserving features, in addition to retrofitting existing structures,
will result in a reduction in monthly utility costs. There are many ways to determine how energy
efficient an existing building is and, if needed, what improvements can be made. Many modern
building design methods are used to reduce residential energy consumption and are based on proven
techniques. These methods can be categorized in three ways:
     1. Building design that keeps natural heat in during the winter and keeps natural heat out during
         the summer. Such design reduces air conditioning and heating demands. Proven building
         techniques in this category include:
             •   Location of windows and openings in relation to the path of the sun to minimize solar
                 gain in the summer and maximize solar gain in the winter.
             •   Use of “thermal mass,” earthen materials such as stone, brick, concrete, and tiles that
                 absorb heat during the day and release heat at night.
             •   Use of window coverings, insulation, and other materials to reduce heat exchange
                 between the interior of a home and the exterior.
             •   Location of openings and the use of ventilating devices that take advantage of natural
                 air flow.
                                                                                2014–2019 Housing Element

              •   Use of eaves and overhangs that block direct solar gain through window openings
                  during the summer but allow solar gain during the winter.
              •   Zone heating and cooling systems, which reduce heating and cooling in the unused
                  areas of a home.
     2. Building orientation that uses natural forces to maintain a comfortable interior temperature.
         Examples include:
              •   North-south orientation of the long axis of a dwelling.
              •   Minimizing the southern and western exposure of exterior surfaces.
              •   Location of dwellings to take advantage of natural air circulation and evening breezes.
     3. Use of landscaping features to moderate interior temperatures. Such techniques include:
              •   Use of deciduous shade trees and other plants to protect the home.
              •   Use of natural or artificial flowing water.
              •   Use of trees and hedges as windbreaks.
In addition to these naturally based techniques, modern methods include:
              •   Use of solar energy to heat water.
              •   Use of radiant barriers on roofs to keep attics cool.
              •   Use of solar panels and other devices to generate electricity.
              •   High efficiency coating on windows to repel summer heat and trap winter warmth.
              •   Weather stripping and other insulation to reduce heat gain and loss.
              •   Use of natural gas for dryers, stovetops and ranges.
              •   Use of energy-efficient home appliances.
              •   Use of low-flow showerheads and faucet aerators to reduce hot water use.
Major opportunities for residential energy conservation in the city will include insulation and
weatherproofing, landscaping and maximizing orientation, lowering appliance consumption, and
maximizing on solar energy.
The following proposed policies and programs relate to the City’s opportunities for energy
conservation:

• Implementation Measure IV-1: The City will continue support Pacific Power and Great
  Northern Corporation’s energy audit and weatherization programs, and will provide
  referrals and participate in informing households that would potentially benefit from
  these programs. The City has information available for the public at the front counter
  at City Hall and will distribute related information when appropriate, including
  distribution through the mail.
• Implementation Measure IV-2: Continue to enforce state requirements, including Title
  24 of the California Code of Regulations, for energy conservation in new residential
  projects and encourage residential developers to employ additional energy
  conservation measures for the siting of buildings, landscaping and solar access
  through development standards contained in the Zoning Ordinance and Building
  Code, as appropriate.

7.         HOUSING RESOURCES AND OPPORTUNITIES
Existing Affordable Housing
The City of Montague currently has only one subsidized multifamily project, Montague Apartments,
shown in Table 36. This project is subsidized through USDA Rural Development and provides
subsidies through its Section 515 program. There are several apartment complexes within the city and
the owners have stated that their tenants are low-income although their units are not subsidized. The
City has encouraged the development of affordable housing; however, there has been little interest
from developers.

At–Risk Housing
In 1989, the California Government Code was amended to include a requirement that localities
identify and develop a program in their housing elements for the preservation of assisted, affordable
multifamily units. Subsequent amendments have clarified the scope of the analysis to include units
developed pursuant to inclusionary housing and density bonus programs. In the preservation analysis,
localities are required to provide an inventory of assisted, affordable units that are eligible to convert
within 10 years of the beginning of the Housing Element planning period (through December 31,
2024). The Section 515 subsidies for the Montague Apartments will not expire until at least 2046;
therefore there are no assisted units at risk of converting to market-rate in Montague. Should any units
in the city become at risk, the City will implement Implementation Measure III-6 to preserve units at
risk of conversion to market rate.
The following nonprofit organizations are listed within Siskiyou County as entities with the capacity to
acquire multifamily developments if any units were to become at risk in the future.

Rehabilitation Program
The City’s rehabilitation loan program is currently funded by a revolving loan account. The City
applied for CDBG funds in the past that were used to grant rehabilitation loans. As repayments of
these loans are received, the money is put back into a loan account to give to new applicants. Loans
are made to households in target income groups and can be used for structural rehabilitation, room
additions to relieve overcrowding, and total reconstructions. There is roughly $77,000 in available
funding through this program (as of September 2013). Interest rates for owner-occupied units are
usually set at 3 percent but can be as low as 0 percent for very low income households and life of the
loan can be up to 30 years. No applications were received for use of funds through the City’s
Rehabilitation Program during the previous planning period.
Housing Authority
The state of California does not own or operate public housing; public housing is administered
directly through local public housing authorities. However, for those jurisdictions that do not have a
local public housing authority, HCD has a Housing Assistance Program that administers the Section 8
program in those counties.
Siskiyou County has no local public housing authority. As such, HCD receives an allocation of
Housing Choice Voucher rent assistance funds from HUD and contracts with the Shasta County
Housing Authority to administer the Housing Choice Voucher (Section 8) program at the county level.
The voucher program provides a voucher to recipients to use to help pay their rent for any rental unit
that accepts the voucher. The recipients pay part of the rent based on 30 percent of their income and
the Section 8 program pays the remaining amount. Based on personal correspondence with Tricia
Brendler of the Shasta County Housing Authority on September 30, 2013, there are currently 10
households receiving housing choice vouchers in Montague. The waitlist for future households to join
the program is currently open and there are 34 applicants on this list with a mailing address within the
City of Montague.
Future Housing Needs
Pursuant to the state Government Code Section 65584, HCD has developed a Regional Housing
Need Allocation (RHNA) Plan for Siskiyou County. The RHNA Plan identifies a need for 530 new
residential units in Siskiyou County over a 5.5-year period (January 1, 2014, to June 30, 2019). The
need for 530 units is shared and distributed amongst each of the communities in the county, with
each community’s share determined by its proportion of the county’s overall household population.
Thus, the City of Montague’s share of regional housing needs is 19 units, or about 3.5 units per year
                                                                               2014–2019 Housing Element

over the 5.5-year period. In an attempt to provide housing for all income groups in the city, these 19
units are further divided among the various income groups identified and defined in Table 37.
Regional housing need allocations are considered a minimum need. Many jurisdictions have existing
unmet housing needs due to overpayment or overcrowding issues that signal housing need and may
exceed the regional allocations.
According to the most recent 2014–2019 allocations, the City of Montague requires at least 19 new
housing units. A large portion of the allocation is for “above moderate” households.

8.       VACANT LAND INVENTORY
In the appendices to this Housing Element, Table B-1 lists available vacant land in the city that is
appropriate to meet its share of the regional housing needs. The realistic unit numbers in the table
reflect the development potential of each vacant parcel scaled down to 75 percent density for
multifamily and 60 percent for single family. There are a total of 13 acres of R-3 zoned lands
appropriate for lower-income higher density development with the potential to result in 172 units; 5
acres of R-2 with the potential to result in 41 units; and 38 acres of R-1/R-1A/R-A/R-AG zoned lands
with the potential to result in 71 units. Due to the availability of vacant, residentially zoned property, it
is unnecessary for the City to consider the rezoning of vacant nonresidentially zoned land or the
redevelopment of properties in order to generate adequate sites for new housing development. None
of the sites listed in Table B-1 are constrained due to lack of water or sewer service.
The vacant land inventory accounts for physical, environmental, access and utility constraints,
inconsistencies between the zoning and general plan designations, and/or parcel sizes that are too
small to develop without boundary line adjustments or mergers with adjacent parcels. Further conflicts
could result from wetland or topographic constraints reducing the “potential unit” yields noted on this
table. The development potential of each vacant parcel has been scaled down based on applicable
constraints and the average density that is typically achievable, regardless of the maximum density
allowed by zoning. Although a site-by-site investigation of each vacant parcel has not occurred, based
on general knowledge of the larger multiple family sites (those likely to be used for affordable
housing), neither wetlands nor topographic constraints exist. Constraints affecting density yield are
reflected in the projected realistic capacity identified in Table B-1.
Refer to Appendix C for the location of those sites identified in Table B-1.
Water and Sewer Infrastructure
The City maintains and operates its own water and sewer facilities. The City’s sewage treatment is
more than adequate to serve the projected growth for the next five years and beyond. The average
flows in the summer are about 0.075 MGD, winter flows at around .250 MGD. With some
modifications to the treatment system, the equivalent could accommodate a population of 2,500, well
beyond the projected population for the planning period.
The city is served by ground water sources from Little Shasta River in the winter and Lake Shastina in
the summer. The city’s water supply has a current capacity of 0.9 million gallons per day to service the
city, with the capacity to expand. The city’s water system, pipelines, and storage tanks are over 50
years old and in need of repairs and upgrades. The city installed a new 1 million water storage tank in
2008. The city experienced drinking water violations in 2009. The city’s current water capital
improvements funds are inadequate to cover the monthly costs of providing services and any
improvements. The City commissioned an engineering study in 2008 to evaluate the existing water
system and prioritization of improvements by 2014. In September 2009 the City informed consumers
that water and sewer rate increases may be necessary. In addition, the City is in the process of seeking
grants and/or loans to update and increase treatment capacity for future development. The City was
able to secure 5 million in grants and $851,572 in loans and is in the process of building a new
water treatment plant (currently under construction) with a completion date of spring of 2015.
                                                                                   2014–2019 Housing Element
                                                 48                               City of Montague General Plan

Certain portions of the city (e.g., R-AG-2 ½ zone district in the southeast end) are constrained by
limitations in the capacity of various elements of the community’s infrastructure, including water and
sewer. None of the sites in Table B-1 have water and sewer constraints.
Flood Hazards/Wetlands
The Montague planning area is located in the Shasta River drainage basin. The potential for flooding
in the City of Montague is minimal. Some areas of the city are mapped by FEMA as flood prone areas
and are marked as Zone AO and Zone B, although most of the city is in Zone C. While some
residential construction could occur in these areas in accordance with FEMA standards, the density of
development will likely be much lower than permitted by existing zoning. Other than the flood plain
and wetlands limitations noted on FEMA FIRM Map # 060451 0001 A, there are no other physical
limitations to residential development that characterizes the city.
The City can easily accommodate the RHNA projections without developing in areas that have
constraints due to flood hazards and/or wetlands.
Availability of Land to Meet RHNA
Due to the availability of vacant, residentially zoned property, it is unnecessary for the City to consider
the rezoning of vacant non-residentially zoned land or the redevelopment of properties in order to
generate adequate sites for new housing development. The sites identified in Table B-1 can support
the development of housing in excess of the City’s share of the 2014–2019 regional housing needs
as estimated by HCD. Therefore, it can be conclusively stated that the City has adequate,
appropriately zoned sites with supporting public services and utilities to accommodate its housing
needs over the current planning period.
Funding Sources
Many types of funding are available to the City and local nonprofit organizations to ensure the
availability of housing affordable to low- and moderate-income persons. Appendix D lists the grant
and loan options the City or other agencies can apply for to fund services for residents of Montague.
There are programs to help fund the development of multifamily rental housing, supportive housing,
homeless shelters and transitional housing, rehabilitation programs, second mortgages, and self-help
housing.

9.         HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
Governmental and Non-Governmental Constraints
Various interrelated factors may constrain the ability of the private and public sectors to provide
adequate housing that meets the needs of all economic segments of the community. These constraints
can be divided into two categories: governmental and non-governmental. Governmental constraints
consist of land use controls, development standards, processing fees, development impact fees, code
enforcement, site improvement costs, development permit and approval processing, and provision for
a variety of housing. Non-governmental constraints include land availability, land cost, construction
costs, and availability of financing.
Governmental Constraints
Land Use Controls
The City of Montague’s General Plan establishes policies that guide all new development, including
residential land uses. These policies, along with zoning regulations, control the amount and
distribution of land allocated for different land uses in the city. Table 38 shows the residential land use
designations established by the General Plan.

  * Note: The City has not adopted land use designations, but uses the City’s zoning designations as land use designations.
Residential Development Standards in Residential Zone District
Zoning regulations are designed to protect and promote the health, safety, and general welfare of
residents as well as implement the policies of the General Plan. The Zoning Ordinance also serves to
preserve the character and integrity of existing neighborhoods. Table 40 shows the residential zone
districts and permitted densities. The minimum residential lot sizes range from 7,500 square feet to
15,000 square feet. The maximum height limit for residential units in the R-1 and R-2 districts is 35
feet, and 45 feet in the R-3 district.
                                                                                                            2014–2019 Housing Element

Parking standards in the R-1, R-2 and R-3 districts require a minimum of 1.5 parking spaces per unit.
The requirements are minimal and none of these are considered a constraint to development.
The City’s two high-density multifamily zones are the Medium Density Residential (R-2) and High
Density Residential (R-3) zones. The zones are fairly similar in the type of housing units that are
allowed. The primary difference is the allowable densities in each. The R-2 allows a maximum of 10
units per acre and the R-3 allows a maximum of 17 units per acre.

Similar to most cities in this region of California, the City’s subdivision design criteria have been
adapted from those of the City of Redding. These criteria are the basic minimums necessary to protect
public health and safety.
               •    Local Streets:
                    o   Right-of-way: 55–60 feet
                    o   Pavement width: 40 feet
               •    Major Streets:
                    o   Right-of-way: 76–80 feet
                    o   Pavement width: 64 feet
               •    Sidewalks:     Provided when near schools, park, or public area
               •    Sewers:
                    o   Minimum pipe: 6 inches
                    o   Manholes: 500 foot maximum spacing
               •    Storm drains: Based on 10-year storm event
               •    Water mains and fire hydrants: As determined by the director of public works
While all development-related improvements add to the cost of housing, the City’s adopted standards
do not substantially or unnecessarily constrain the development of affordable housing. The greatest
constraints to the development of affordable housing continue to be the regional economy, the
scarcity of jobs, and the distance from major transportation routes.
Adequacy of Zoning Standards to Facilitate Affordable Housing
It is difficult to determine the dollar amount per dwelling unit for development-ready land suitable for
multifamily housing except when properties in the R-2 and R-3 zone districts become available for
sale. However, based on a survey of lots for sale in Montague in the fall of 2013, it can be
determined that land costs are fairly low. Given these low land costs, an increase in the base
residential density (before a density bonus for affordable housing) above 17 units per acre would not
significantly reduce residential development costs or significantly increase the feasibility of affordable
housing production. The City, therefore, believes the R-3 zone provides adequate density and
development standards to facilitate the production of housing affordable to very low- and low-income
households.
Provisions for a Variety of Housing
The Housing Element must identify adequate sites that are available for the development of housing
types for all economic segments of the population. Part of this entails evaluating the City’s zoning
code and its provision for a variety of housing types. Housing types include single-family dwellings,
duplexes, guest dwellings, mobile homes, group residential homes, multifamily dwellings,
convalescent homes, accessory structures, supportive housing, and single-room occupancy units.
                                                                                  2014–2019 Housing Element
                                                 52                             City of Montague General Plan

Some housing types are allowed by right and others are allowed with a conditional use permit.
Conditions of approval for developments may include but shall not be limited to requiring: special
yards; open spaces; buffers; fences; walls; installation and maintenance of landscaping; street
dedications and improvements; regulation of traffic circulation; regulation of signs; regulation of
hours of operation and methods of operations; control of potential nuisances; standards for
maintenance of building and grounds; prescription of development schedules and development
standards; and such other conditions as the Planning Commission may deem necessary to ensure
compatibility of the use with surrounding developments and uses and to preserve the public health,
safety, and welfare. Table 40 below summarizes the housing types permitted, conditionally permitted,
and prohibited under the City’s Zoning Ordinance.
Extremely Low Income Households and Transitional and Supportive Housing
Assembly Bill (AB) 2634 (Lieber, 2006) requires the quantification and analysis of existing and
projected housing needs of extremely low-income households. Elements must also identify zoning to
encourage and facilitate housing types that serve extremely low-income households including
supportive housing and single-room occupancy units. The City of Montague’s current Zoning Code
does not define supportive housing or identify any zones where this type of housing is permitted.
Proposed Implementation Measure I-12a in the 2009–2014 Housing Element stated the City would
revise the Zoning Code to specifically define transitional and supportive housing types and to consider
them a residential use in residential zones. The City amended its Zoning Ordinance in 2012 to
implement this implementation measure. However, the state has clarified the intent of SB 2 related to
transitional and supportive housing and Implementation Measure I-8 has been modified and will be
continued in the updated Housing Element. The modified implementation measure states the City will
amend the Zoning Code to allow transitional and supportive housing in the same way other
residential uses are allowed in all zones allowing residential uses. The definitions of transitional and
supportive housing will also need to be updated to comply with changes to the state-required
definitions due to the passage of SB 745.
Single-room occupancy units are often the most appropriate type of housing for extremely low-income
persons. Single-room occupancy units are allowed in the R-3 and C-2 districts without a conditional
use permit. Mobile homes and factory built housing also provide affordable housing for lower-income
persons. The City’s Zoning Codes allows mobile homes, manufactured homes, or modular homes on
individual lots within the R district (R-1, R-2, R-3 and RAG 2 ½ districts (Chapter 15.20, Mobile
Homes).
Second Dwelling Units Constraints
Another type of housing appropriate for lower-income persons are second dwelling units. "Second
unit" means an attached or a detached residential dwelling unit which provides complete independent
living facilities for one or more persons. It shall include permanent provisions for living, sleeping,
eating, cooking, and sanitation on the same parcel as the single-family dwelling is situated. A second
unit also includes the following: (A) An efficiency unit, as defined in Section 17958.1 of Health and
Safety Code; (B) A manufactured home, as defined in Section 18007 of the Health and Safety Code.
AB 1866 (Chapter 1062, Statutes of 2002), also known as the “second unit law,” amended the
California Government Code to facilitate the development of second units. This amendment now
requires localities to allow second units ministerially without discretionary review or hearings. To be
considered a ministerial review, the process used to approve second units must “apply predictable,
2014–2019 Housing Element
City of Montague General Plan                           53

objective, fixed, quantifiable and clear standards.” Applications for second units should not be subject
to onerous conditions of approval or public hearing process or public comment.
The second unit law established maximum standards for second units on lots zoned for residential use
that contain existing single-family dwellings. No other standards can be applied to the approval of
second units than those listed in Section 95852.2(b) of the Government Code, except the City may
require that the primary structure be owner-occupied. The City has adopted these standards which are
outlined in Section 17.30.100, Secondary Housing Units, of the Zoning Code:
              •  The unit is not intended for sale and may be rented.
              •  The lot is zoned for single-family or multifamily use.
              •  The lot contains an existing single-family dwelling.
              •  The second unit is either attached to the existing dwelling and located within the living
                 area of the existing dwelling or detached from the existing dwelling and located on the
                 same lot as the existing dwelling.
              •  The increased floor area of an attached second unit shall not exceed 50 percent of
                 the existing living area.
              •  The total area of floor space for a detached second unit shall not exceed 1,200
                 square feet.
              •  Requirements relating to height, setback, lot coverage, architectural review, site plan
                 review, fees, charges, and other zoning requirements are generally applicable to
                 residential construction in the zone in which the property is located.
Table 40 exhibits where second single-family dwelling units are allowed. Second units are a permitted
use in the single family and multifamily zoning districts (R-1, R-2 and R-3). In the City’s Zoning Code,
second unit performance standards are addressed separately within each of the residential zone
districts. Second units must meet all of the same requirements as the main structure, except that they
may not exceed 1,200 square feet unless located on lots that are at least 10,000 square feet (Section
17.30.100). Similar to the primary dwelling, second units must provide one off-street parking space. A
mobile or manufactured home may be installed as a secondary housing unit if it conforms with the
existing city regulations relating to the installation of such homes.
                                                                                  2014–2019 Housing Element

Housing for Persons with Disabilities Constraints
As part of a governmental constraints analysis, housing elements must analyze constraints upon the
development, maintenance and improvement of housing for persons with disabilities. The City
established a reasonable accommodation procedure in 2012 and it is codified as Chapter 17.56 of
the City’s Zoning Ordinance. The Zoning Ordinance currently provides a definition of group care
home that is based upon Health and Safety Code Section 1500 et seq. In accordance with state law,
the City must allow group facilities for six persons or less in any area zoned for residential use, and
may not require licensed residential care facilities for six or less individuals to obtain conditional use
permits or variances that are not required of other family dwellings. Consequently, group care
facilities for six and fewer individuals are allowed by right in all residential zones. Group care facilities
of more than six individuals are conditionally permitted in the R-1, R-2 and R-3 zone districts.
Implementation Measure I-11 states that the City shall revise the zoning ordinance to specifically
address group homes (or licensed residential care facilities) of six or fewer persons to comply with
state Health and Safety Code 1267.8.
BUILDING CODES
          Has the City adopted the Uniform              Yes, but local amendments do not affect disabled
          Building Code?                                access.
          Has the City adopted any universal            The City will encourage the incorporation of universal
          design element into the code?                 design in new construction.
          Does the City provide reasonable              Yes. Building permit applications and other building
          accommodation for persons with                code matters can be accommodated at the front
          disabilities in the enforcement of            counter of City Hall. If additional assistance is needed
          building codes and the issuance of            (e.g., sign language), a request can be made as
          building permits?                             addressed above. Chapter 17.56 of the Zoning
                                                        Ordinance      contains     the     City’s   Reasonable
                                                        Accommodation procedure.
Emergency Shelter Constraints
California Health and Safety Code (Section 50801) defines an emergency shelter as “housing with
minimal supportive services for homeless persons that is limited to occupancy of six months or less by
a homeless person. No individual or households may be denied emergency shelter because of an
inability to pay.” Current zoning allows emergency shelters for six and fewer individuals in any area
zoned for residential use similar to group care facilities, but does not specifically address “emergency
shelters” per se.
SB 2 (Cedillo, 2007) requires jurisdictions to allow emergency shelters and transitional housing
without a conditional use permit. Cities are required to identify a zone(s) where emergency shelters will
be allowed as a permitted use without a conditional use permit or other discretionary permit. The zone
or zones identified must have land available to accommodate an emergency shelter. The City’s
Housing Needs Assessment states that the Yreka Community Resource Center has had no contact with
homeless individuals in the City of Montague. The needs assessment also lists the locations of existing
services in the City of Yreka which is just 7 miles from Montague. However, the City has amended its
Zoning Ordinance to allow emergency shelters by right in the R-3 zone to comply with state law.
Pursuant to SB 2, the City conducted a staff level review of its zoning districts and available land
during the previous planning cycle. The City determined the R-3, High Density Residential Zone would
                                                                                      2014–2019 Housing Element

be the most appropriate for emergency shelters because it is intended as an area for commercial,
hotels, motels, and apartment building complexes and NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard) issues would be
minimized. Revisions to the Zoning Ordinance have been made and emergency shelters are now
allowed without discretionary review in the R-3 zone.
Housing for Farmworkers Constraints
In accordance with Health and Safety Code Sections 17021.5 and 17021.6, housing for farmworkers
in the City of Montague for six or fewer persons shall be deemed a single-family structure with a
residential land use designation and employee housing up to 12 units and with 36 beds shall be
allowed in all zones where agricultural uses are allowed (see Implementation Measure 1-11). In
addition, “dwelling groups” are allowed with issuance of a conditional use permit in the R-3 zone
district.
The City requires a conditional use permit for large-scale housing developments in all residential
zones. The conditional use permit process is in place to ensure compatibility with surrounding uses.
Conditions of approval vary from project to project, but most likely they will contain provisions for
landscaping, type of fencing, driveway locations, compatible lighting, and recreational facilities. This
process is not a constraint to the development of farmworker housing as the process is very
streamlined and projects can be approved in three months. Similarly, farmworker housing for six or
fewer persons is allowed in the R-1 zone.
Development and Processing Fees
Fees collected by the City typically do not support the full cost of regulating and accommodating new
development. The City attempts to keep the fees as low as possible as a means to encourage
development. The most significant fees typically associated with a residential building permit are the
building permit and utility connection fees. Development impact fees that apply to new residential
single-family and multifamily construction are listed in Table 41. The City also collects fees from
developers to help cover the costs of planning and processing permits. Processing fees are calculated
based on average staff time and material costs required to process a particular type of case. Planning
and processing fees are summarized in Table 42.
The City’s impact fees are much lower than other small cities in the region and Siskiyou County, which
has fees of approximately $5,700 per 1,500-square foot unit. For a typical single-family dwelling that
is on public water and sewer systems, the fees are approximately $2,380 per unit (plus 2 percent of
living space assessed valuation); and approximately $9,520 for multifamily development (based on a
four-unit dwelling), not including construction, school fees, permit and plan check fees. For those units
that require a permit for a well and septic, fees paid to the County are approximately $246 and
$270, respectively. Further, school impact fees are required by the school district and can result in an
additional $2,688 per unit (based on a 1,200-square-foot unit). Depending on housing unit size, type
and location, City and school district fees amount to 3.5 percent of the total cost of each new housing
unit. While these costs will likely be passed on to the ultimate product consumer, thus impacting
housing prices, these requirements are deemed necessary to ensure health and safety as well as
maintain the quality of life desired by City residents. The City will monitor annually any multifamily
development applications to identify any constraints to this type of development.

Permit Processing Times Constraints
The time involved in processing development applications can become a constraint to affordable
housing development. In Montague, most development applications for single-family and multifamily
developments take approximately two to three weeks to process as long as no discretionary approvals
                                                                                                       2014–2019 Housing Element

are needed. If an applicant proposes developments that require discretionary review, such as a use
that requires a conditional use permit, the processing time can extend to two months regardless if it is
a single-family or multifamily project. Table 43 lists the typical review times for each type of permit or
approval process in the city. These review periods do not present constraints to development as some
review is needed to ensure the maintenance of health and safety standards. The Planning Department
encourages developers to submit applications concurrently where possible to minimize the total
processing time and related cost for a project.

Conditional Use Permit
While approval of a use permit does require more detailed analysis and discretionary consideration
than a use allowed “by right,” this process does not appear to be a substantial constraint to
development of affordable housing. A conditional use permit for a multifamily housing project entails
a public hearing before the City Council, as well as notification of property owners within 300 feet of
the project. An environmental review pursuant to CEQA (typically a negative declaration) is conducted
and staff reviews the project for compliance with City and CEQA standards. There are no design
standards, architectural review or other criteria applied except normal setbacks, building height, lot
coverage, density and parking requirements. The City Council primarily considers potential
environmental impacts, as well as public improvements (e.g., curb, gutter, sidewalk and drainage
improvements), that may be necessary as conditions of approval to support the project. The entire
process from submittal to public hearing and project approval is typically about six to eight weeks.

While on the surface the conditional use permit process as an extra application step may seem to be a
constraint, actual practice has shown that residential projects have not been denied, nor have projects
been altered in a manner which would substantially affect project feasibility. Since processing fees are
moderate, as shown herein, the only real constraint is the approximately two-month period necessary
to process the application before the City Council. This processing time is minimal and has little to no
effect on the cost or feasibility of a multifamily housing project.
Variance
Where practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships may result from the strict application of the
Zoning Ordinance, the City may grant individuals relief from provisions of the ordinance in the form
of a variance. Similar to use permits, the processing of a variance requires an application to be filed
with the Planning Department, payment of a fee, and a public hearing before the Planning
Commission. Further, in deciding whether to grant a variance, the Planning Commission must be able
to make the following findings:
             •  That there are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions applying to the
                land, building, or use referred to in the application, which circumstances or conditions
                do not apply generally to land, buildings, or uses in the same district.
             •  That the granting of the application is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of
                substantial property rights to the petitioner.
             •  That the granting of such application will not, under the circumstances of the
                particular case, materially affect adversely the health or safety of persons residing or
                working in the neighborhood of the property of the applicant and will not, under the
                circumstances of the particular case, be materially detrimental to the public welfare or
                injurious to property or improvements in such neighborhood.
If the Planning Commission is able to make the findings, as well as ensure that the variance is, or can
be made, harmonious with the general purpose of the Zoning Ordinance, the variance can be
granted. Further, if the Planning Commission denies the variance request because the findings cannot
be made, or the variance is in conflict with the general purpose of the Zoning Ordinance, the
applicant(s) may appeal the decision to the City Council.
While the variance process provides considerable flexibility from the provisions of the Zoning
Ordinance in that it allows the Planning Commission to consider unusual circumstances surrounding
the use, building, and property, a variance may not be the appropriate mechanism for
accommodating the special needs of persons with disabilities. This is because the granting of a
variance is based upon the unique characteristics of the property, building, or use, and not upon the
unique characteristics of the property owner or prospective occupant. For this reason, the City has
incorporated reasonable accommodations for persons with disabilities into the Zoning Ordinance,
and no longer relies on the variance process to make reasonable accommodations (see Chapter
17.56).
                                                                                 2014–2019 Housing Element

Building Code and Enforcement Constraints
The City adopted the California Building Code for its code requirements and deviates from it only in
the case of requirements for snow load (i.e., the City has a higher standard for roofing due to local
conditions). Because the more stringent standards apply only in case of snow load, and thus serve to
protect public health and safely, the enforcement of the California Building Code does not pose a
significant constraint to the production or improvement of housing in Montague.
Code enforcement typically occurs when the building inspector or code enforcement officer is
processing other permits on the site, or when complaints are filed. The Building Department staff
works with the County Health Department when the complaint appears to be a matter of both health
and safety.
Most complaints come from renters who have complaints against their landlord. The inspection may
reveal building or health code violations that are then written up with a time line for correction and
follow-up inspections. If there are no code violations, but other non-code situations occur, the renter is
given a question and answer sheet prepared by the California State Department of Consumer Affairs,
which helps to define the renters’ rights and options in the matter. Complaints in mobile home parks
are referred to the enforcement section of HCD.
Chapter 8.08 of the City’s Municipal Code establishes a process for abating public nuisances. The
types of nuisances defined within the ordinance vary from unsightly storage and debris on a parcel, to
elements of disrepair of buildings. Code and nuisance enforcement is provided by a Code
Enforcement Officer, the Montague Police Department, and the Building Department.
Non-Governmental Constraints
Availability of Financing
The cost of borrowing money to finance the construction of housing or to purchase a house affects the
amount of affordably priced housing in Montague. Fluctuating interest rates can eliminate many
potential homebuyers from the housing market or render infeasible a housing project that could have
been developed at lower interest rates. When interest rates decline, sales increase. The reverse has
been true when interest rates increase. Table 44 illustrates interest rates as of September 2013. The
table presents both the interest rate and annual percentage rate (APR) for different types of home
loans. The interest rate is the percentage of an amount of money which is paid for its use for a
specified time and the APR is the yearly percentage rate that expresses the total finance charge on a
loan over its entire term. The APR includes the interest rate, fees, points, and mortgage insurance, and
is therefore a more complete measure of a loan's cost than the interest rate alone. However, the loan's
interest rate, not its APR, is used to calculate the monthly principal and interest payment.

Land Costs
The cost of raw, developable land creates a direct impact on the cost for a new home and is
considered a possible constraint. A higher cost of land raises the price of a new home. Therefore,
developers sometimes seek to obtain City approvals for the largest number of lots allowable on a
parcel of land. As of September 2013, residential land cost an average $9,600 per acre. A list of 50
properties for sale were analyzed from the Internet site www.realtor.com. Total costs per acre ranged
from $1,100/ac to $108,000/ac. Similarly, total size of the lots for sale ranged from 1,488 acres to
<1 acre.
Construction and Labor Costs
Factors that affect the cost of building a house include the type of construction, materials, site
conditions, finishing details, amenities, and structural configuration. An Internet source of construction
cost data (www.building-cost.net), provided by the Craftsman Book Company, estimates the per
square foot cost of a single-story four-cornered home in Montague to be approximately $160 per
square foot. This cost estimate is based on a 1,500-square-foot house of good-quality construction
including a two-car garage, central heating, and air conditioning. The total construction costs
excluding land costs are estimated to be about $240,000.
If labor or material costs increased substantially, the cost of construction in Montague could rise to a
level that significantly impacts the price of new construction and rehabilitation. Therefore, increased
construction costs have the potential to constrain new housing construction and rehabilitation of
existing housing.

DEFINITIONS OF HOUSING ELEMENT
         TERMINOLOGY

APPENDIX E
DEFINITION OF HOUSING ELEMENT TERMINOLOGY
The following glossary defines various acronyms and terminology used in the Housing Element,
including definitions of terms used by the US Census Bureau.
Accessible Units: Indicates certain units or all units in the property are wheelchair-accessible or can be
made wheelchair-accessible. Accessible units also may include those that are accessible to people
with sensory impairments or can be made accessible for people with sensory impairments.
Affordability: Annual cost of housing includes mortgage, principal, and interest payments as amortized
over 25 years with a 25 percent down payment, or gross rent that does not exceed 30 percent of
gross annual household income, or 30 percent of gross annual income devoted to rental housing,
including utilities are defined as "affordable."
Affordability Covenant: A property title agreement that places resale or rental restrictions on a housing
unit; also known as a deed restriction.
Affordable Housing: Refers to the relationship between the price of housing in a region (either sale
price or rent) and household income. Affordable housing is that which is affordable to households of
very low, low and moderate incomes. For housing to be affordable, shelter costs must not exceed 30
percent of the gross annual income of the household.
Assisted Housing: Refers to a unit that rents or sells for less than the prevailing market rate due to
governmental monetary intervention or contribution. The terms “assisted” and “subsidized” are often
used interchangeably.
At-Risk Housing: Applies to existing subsidized affordable rental housing units, especially federally
subsidized developments, that are threatened with conversion to market rents because of termination
of use restrictions, due to expiration or non-renewal of subsidy arrangements.
Below Market Rate Unit: A housing unit that sells or rents for less than the going market rate. It is
typically used in reference to housing units that are directly or indirectly subsidized or have other
restrictions in order to make them affordable to very low-, low-, or moderate-income households.
Community Development Block Grant (CDBG): The state CDBG program was established by the
federal Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended (42 USC 5301, et seq.).
The primary federal objective of the CDBG program is the development of viable urban communities
by providing decent housing and a suitable living environment and by expanding economic
opportunities, principally for persons of low and moderate income. "Persons of low and moderate
income" or the "targeted income group" are defined as families, households, and individuals whose
incomes do not exceed 80 percent of the county median income, with adjustments for family or
household size.
Condominium: A building or group of buildings in which units are owned individually, but the
structure, common areas, and facilities are owned by all owners on a proportional, undivided basis.

Continuum of Care: An approach that helps communities plan for and provide a full range of
emergency, transitional, and permanent housing and service resources to address the various needs
of homeless persons at the point in time that they need them. The approach is based on the
understanding that homelessness is not caused merely by a lack of shelter, but involves a variety of
underlying, unmet needs—physical, economic, and social. Designed to encourage localities to
develop a coordinated and comprehensive long-term approach to homelessness, the Continuum of
Care consolidates the planning, application, and reporting documents for the US Department of
Housing and Urban Development’s Shelter Plus Care, Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Single-Room
Occupancy Dwellings (SRO) Program, and Supportive Housing Program (U.S. House Bill 2163).
Cost Burden: A household has a "housing cost burden" if it spends 30 percent or more of its income
on housing costs. A household has a "severe housing cost burden" if it spends 50 percent or more of
its income on housing. Owner housing costs consist of payments for mortgages, deeds of trust,
contracts to purchase, or similar debts on the property; real estate taxes; fire, hazard, and flood
insurance on the property; utilities; and fuels. Where applicable, owner costs also include monthly
condominium fees. Renter calculations use gross rent, which is the contract rent plus the estimated
average monthly cost of utilities (electricity, gas, water and sewer) and fuels (oil, coal, kerosene,
wood, etc.) if these are paid by the renter (or paid for the renter by someone else). Household income
is the total pre-tax income of the householder and all other individuals at least 15 years old in the
household. In all estimates of housing cost burdens, owners and renters for whom housing cost-to-
income was not computed are excluded from the calculations.
Census: Every 10 years, the Census Bureau conducts a national household survey, producing the
richest source of nationally available small-area data. Article I of the Constitution requires that a
census be taken every 10 years for the purpose of reapportioning the US House of Representatives.
The federal government uses decennial census data for apportioning congressional seats, for
identifying distressed areas, and for many other activities. Census data are collected using two survey
forms: the short form and the long form. Short form information is collected on every person and
includes basic characteristics, such as age, sex, and race. The long form is sent to one out of every six
households and collects more detailed information, such as income, housing characteristics, and
employment. Most of the indicators in DataPlace are from the long form, and are thus estimates
based on the sample of households. These values may differ considerably from the same indicators
based on the short form data, particularly for small areas.
Density: This refers to the number of housing units on a unit of land (e.g., 10 units per acre).
Density Bonus Programs: Allows minimum density increase over the zoned maximum density of a
proposed residential development, if the developer makes a specified amount of units affordable to
lower-income households.
Disability: A long-lasting physical, mental, or emotional condition. This condition can make it difficult
for a person to do activities such as walking, climbing stairs, dressing, bathing, learning, or
remembering. This condition can also impede a person from being able to go outside the home alone
or to work at a job or business.
Down Payment Assistance: The most popular loans for these programs are with the Federal Housing
Administration (FHA). FHA allows 100 percent gift funds for your down payment and some allowable
closing costs. The gift can be from any relative or can be collected through charitable organizations
like Neighborhood Gold/The Buyer Fund. Another popular tactic, which can be used in a broader
                                                                                                 2014-2019

range of loan programs, is to borrow from a 401(k). A withdrawal can be made without a penalty and
paid back over a specified period.
Development Impact Fees: A fee or charge imposed on developers to pay for a jurisdiction’s costs of
providing services to new development.
Development Right: The right granted to a land owner or other authorized party to improve a
property. Such right is usually expressed in terms of a use and intensity allowed under existing zoning
regulation.
Dwelling Unit: Any residential structure, whether or not attached to real property, including
condominium and cooperative units and mobile or manufactured homes. It includes both one-to four-
family and multifamily structures. Vacation or second homes and rental properties are also included.
Elderly Units: Specific units in a development are restricted to residents over a certain age (as young
as 55 years and over). Persons with disabilities may share certain developments with the elderly.
Element: A division or chapter of the General Plan, Master Plan, or Comprehensive Plan.
Emergency Shelter: A facility designed to provide free temporary housing on a night-by-night basis to
homeless families and individuals.
Emergency Shelter Grants: A grant program administered by the US Department of Housing and
Urban Development (HUD) provided on a formula basis to large entitlement jurisdictions.
Extremely Low-Income Limit: The upper limit for the extremely low-income category, set at 30 percent
of the HUD area median family income. This is not an official program eligibility income limit, except
when associated with a specific family size (e.g., "single person," "family of two," "family of three,").
Fair Market Rent: Fair market rents are freely set rental rates defined by HUD as the median gross
rents charged for available standard units in a county or Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area. Fair
market rents are used for the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program and other HUD programs
and are published annually by HUD.
Farm Labor Housing (Farm Worker): Units for migrant farm workers that can be available for
transitional housing for the homeless when not occupied by migrant farm workers.
Family Income: In decennial census data, family income includes the incomes of all household
members 15 years old and over related to the householder. Although the family income statistics from
each census cover the preceding calendar year, the characteristics of individuals and the composition
of families refer to the time of enumeration (April 1 of the respective census years). Thus, the income
of the family does not include amounts received by individuals who were members of the family during
all or part of the calendar year prior to the census if these individuals no longer resided with the family
at the time of census enumeration. Similarly, income amounts reported by individuals who did not
reside with the family during the calendar year prior to the census but who were members of the family
at the time of enumeration are included. However, the composition of most families was the same
during the preceding calendar year as at the time of enumeration.

FHA-Insured: The Federal Housing Administration insured mortgages so that lower- and moderate-
income people can obtain financing for homeownership.
First-Time Homebuyer Program: Provides low-income first-time homebuyers down payment assistance
in the form of a second mortgage loan to serve as "gap financing." These loans can be up to $40,000
depending on the amount of assistance required by the individual homebuyer.
General Plan: The general plan is a legal document, adopted by the legislative body of a city or
county, setting forth policies regarding long-term development.
Groups Quarters: A facility which houses groups of unrelated persons not living in households such as

Bathrooms, toilet compartments, closets, storage or utility space, and similar areas, are not
considered habitable space.
Hispanic or Latino: In decennial census data, Hispanics or Latinos are those who classify themselves in
one of the specific Hispanic or Latino categories listed on the census questionnaire—‘‘Mexican,’’
‘‘Puerto Rican,’’ or ‘‘Cuban’’—as well as those who indicate that they are ‘‘other Spanish, Hispanic,
or Latino.’’ People who do not identify with one of the specific origins listed on the questionnaire but
indicate that they are ‘‘other Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino’’ are those whose origins are from Spain,
the Spanish-speaking countries of Central or South America, the Dominican Republic, or people
identifying themselves generally as Spanish, Spanish-American, Hispanic, Hispano, Latino, and so on.
People who are Hispanic or Latino may be of any race.
Home Investment Partnership Program (HOME): HOME provides formula grants to states and
localities that communities use—often in partnership with local nonprofit groups—to fund a wide
range of activities that build, buy, and/or rehabilitate affordable housing for rent or homeownership or
provide direct rental assistance to low-income people.
Homeless Person: An individual living outside or in a building not meant for human habitation, or
which they have no legal right to occupy, in an emergency shelter, or in a temporary housing program
which may include a transitional and supportive housing program if habitation time limits exist. This
definition includes substance abusers, mentally ill people, and sex offenders who are homeless (US
House Bill 2163).
Household: A household is made up of all persons living in a dwelling unit whether or not they are
related by blood, birth, or marriage.
Housing Authority: An organization established under state law to provide housing for low- and
moderate-income persons. Commissioners are appointed by the local governing body of the
jurisdiction in which they operate. Many housing authorities own their own housing or operate public
housing funded by HUD.
Housing Choice Voucher Program: Housing Choice Voucher Program (formerly known as Section 8)
is a subsidy program funded by the federal government and overseen by the California Department of
Housing and Community Development to provide low rents and/or housing payment contributions for
very low- and low-income households.
                                                                                                  2014-2019

US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD): The cabinet level department of the
federal government that oversees program and funding for affordable housing laws, development,
and federally funded financial assistance.
HUD Area Median Family Income: HUD is required by law to set income limits that determine the
eligibility of applicants for HUD's assisted housing programs. Income limits are calculated annually for
metropolitan areas and non-metropolitan counties in the United States. They are based on HUD
estimates of median family income, with adjustments for family size. Adjustments are also made for
areas that have unusually high or low income to housing cost relationships.
Income Categories: The federal and state governments require that local jurisdictions consider the
housing needs of households in various "income categories." Income categories are determined by the
median household income at the local level.
Large Family or Household: A household or family with five or more members.
Low-Income Households: Low-income households are defined as households with incomes between
50 percent and 80 percent of the area median household income.
Low-Income Housing: Housing that is made available at prices lower than market rates. These lower
prices are achieved through various financial mechanisms employed by state and local government
authorities.
Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC): An indirect federal subsidy used to finance the development
of affordable rental housing for low-income households. The LIHTC program may seem complicated,
but many local housing and community development agencies are effectively using these tax credits to
increase the supply of affordable housing in their communities.
Market Rate Housing: Housing that is not built or maintained with the help of government subsidy.
The prices of market rate homes are determined by the market and are subject to the laws of supply
and demand.
Manufactured Home: Housing that is constructed of manufactured components, assembled partly at
the site rather than totally at the site. Also referred to as modular housing.
Median-Income: Each year, the federal government calculates the median income for communities
across the country to use as guidelines for federal housing programs. Area median incomes are set
according family size.
Mental Illness: A serious and persistent mental or emotional impairment that significantly limits a
person’s ability to live independently.
Mixed Use: This refers to different types of development (e.g., residential, retail, office) occurring on
the same lot or in close proximity to each other. Cities and Counties sometimes allow mixed-use in
commercial zones, with housing typically located above primary commercial uses on the premises.
Mobile Home: A type of manufactured housing. A structure movable in one or more sections, which is
at least 8 feet in width and 32 feet in length, is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used
as a dwelling unit when connected to the required utilities, either with or without a permanent
foundation.

Mobile Home Park: A parcel or tract of land having as its principal use the rental, leasing, or
occupancy of space by two or more mobile homes on a permanent or semipermanent basis, including
accessory buildings, or uses customarily incidental thereto.
Mobile Home Subdivision: A subdivision of land, platted in conformance to NRS Chapter 278 and
applicable city ordinances for the purpose of providing mobile home lots.
Moderate Income Households: Defined as households with incomes between 80 percent and 120
percent of the county median.
Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC) Program: The MCC is a federal income tax credit program. An
MCC increases the loan amount an applicant qualifies for and increases an applicant's take-home
pay. The MCC entitles applicants to take a federal income tax credit of 20 percent of the annual
interest they pay on their home mortgage. Because the MCC reduces an applicant's federal income
taxes and increases their net earnings, it helps homebuyers qualify for a first home mortgage. The
MCC is registered with the IRS, and it continues to decrease federal income taxes each year for as
long as an applicant lives in the home.
Mortgage Revenue Bond: A state, county, or city program providing financing for the development of
housing through the sale of tax-exempt bonds.
Multifamily Dwelling: A structure containing two or more dwelling units for the use of individual
households; an apartment or condominium building is an example of this dwelling unit type.
Non-Hispanic: In decennial census data and in Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data after 2003, non-
Hispanics are those who indicate that they are not Spanish/Hispanic/Latino.
Permanent Housing: Housing which is intended to be the tenant’s home for as long as they choose. In
the supportive housing model, services are available to the tenant, but accepting services cannot be
required of tenants or in any way impact their tenancy. Tenants of permanent housing sign legal lease
documents (US House Bill 2163).
Permanent Supportive Housing: Long-term community-based housing and supportive services for
homeless persons with disabilities. The intent of this type of supportive housing is to enable this special
needs population to live as independently as possible in a permanent setting. The supportive services
may be provided by the organization managing the housing or provided by other public or private
service agencies. There is no definite length of stay. (US House Bill 2163).
Persons with a Disability: HUD’s Housing Choice Voucher (formerly Section 8) program defines a
“person with a disability” as: a person who is determined to: 1) have a physical, mental, or emotional
impairment that is expected to be of continued and indefinite duration, substantially impedes his or
her ability to live independently, and is of such a nature that the ability could be improved by more
suitable housing conditions; or 2) have a developmental disability, as defined in the Developmental
Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act (US House Bill 2163).
Project-Based Rental Assistance: Rental assistance provided for a project, not for a specific tenant. A
tenant receiving project-based rental assistance gives up the right to that assistance upon moving from
the project.
                                                                                                  2014-2019

Public Housing: HUD administers federal aid to local housing agencies that manage the housing for
low-income residents at rents they can afford. HUD furnishes technical and professional assistance in
planning, developing, and managing these developments. It provides decent and safe rental housing
for eligible low-income families, the elderly, and persons with disabilities. Public housing can be in the
form of high-rise apartments or scattered-site single-family homes.
Rehabilitation: The upgrading of a building previously in a dilapidated or substandard condition for
human habitation.
Rental Assistance: A rental subsidy for eligible low- and very low-income tenants. This assistance
provides the share of the monthly rent that exceeds 30 percent of the tenants’ adjusted monthly
income.
Rent-to-Own: A development is financed so that at a certain point in time, the rental units are
available for purchase based on certain restrictions and qualifications.
Rural Housing Service: A part of the US Department of Agriculture’s Rural Development. The Rural
Housing Service offers financial aid to low-income residents of rural areas.
Second Units: Also referred to as "granny" or "in-law apartments." Second units provide a second
housing unit on the same lot as a single-family dwelling unit.
Section 8: A subsidy program funded by the federal government and overseen by the California
Department of Housing and Community Development to provide low rents and/or housing payment
contributions for very low- and low-income households. Now known as the Housing Choice Voucher
program.
Service Needs: The particular services required by special populations, typically including needs such
as transportation, personal care, housekeeping, counseling, meals, case management, personal
emergency response, and other services preventing premature institutionalization and assisting
individuals to continue living independently.
Single-Room Occupancy Dwelling: Housing that contains units for occupancy by one person. These
units may contain food preparation or sanitary facilities, or both.
Special Needs Projects: Housing for a designated group of people who desire special
accommodations, such as services, in addition to the housing. Services may or may not be provided
as part of the rental project. Examples of special needs populations are people with physical
disabilities, developmental disabilities, mental illness, or those who need assisted living. It also
includes health care facilities.
Substandard Housing: This refers to housing where major repair or replacement may be needed to
make it structurally sound, weatherproofed and habitable.
Subsidized Housing: Typically refers to housing that rents for less than the market rate due to a direct
financial contribution from the government. There are two general types of housing subsidies. The first
is most commonly referred to as “project-based” where the subsidy is linked with a particular unit or
development; the other is known as “tenant-based” where the subsidy is linked to the low-income
individual or family. The terms “assisted” and “subsidized” are often used interchangeably.

Supportive Housing: Housing with no limit on length of stay, that is occupied by the target population,
and that is linked to an on-site or off-site service that assists the supportive housing resident in
retaining the housing, improving his or her health status, and maximizing his or her ability to live and,
when possible, work in the community. Target population means persons with low incomes who have
one or more disabilities, including mental illness, HIV or AIDS, substance abuse, or other chronic
health condition, or individuals eligible for services provided pursuant to the Lanterman
Developmental Disabilities Services Act (Division 4.5 (commencing with Section 4500) of the Welfare
and Institutions Code) and may include, among other populations, adults, emancipated minors,
families with children, elderly persons, young adults aging out of the foster care system, individuals
exiting from institutional settings, veterans, and homeless people.
Supportive Services: Services provided to residents of supportive housing for the purpose of facilitating
the independence of residents. Some examples are case management, medical or psychological
counseling and supervision, child care, transportation, and job training.
Transitional Housing: Buildings configured as rental housing developments, but operated under
program requirements that require the termination of assistance and recirculating of the assisted unit
to another eligible program recipient at a predetermined future point in time that shall be no less than
six months from the beginning of the assistance.
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)-Guaranteed: VA-guaranteed loans are made by private lenders to
eligible veterans for the purchase of a home which must be for their own personal occupancy. To get
a loan, a veteran must apply to a lender. If the loan is approved, VA will guarantee a portion of it to
the lender. This guaranty protects the lender against loss up to the amount guaranteed and allows a
veteran to obtain favorable financing terms.
Very Low-Income Limit: Defined as households with incomes less than 50 percent of the area median
household income.
Veteran: Anyone who has been discharged from the military generally after at least two years of
service, whether they served on active duty in a conflict or not (US House Bill 2163).
Workforce Housing: Refers to housing that is meant for residents making low-, moderate-, or above-
moderate area median income. Some programs focus on employers providing assistance to their
employees; some are instituting inclusionary programs, while others give preference to this group in
their homeownership programs. Some jurisdictions have programs for specific segments of the
workforce that are vital for the everyday function of the community such as teachers, policeman, and
other public employees.
Zoning: Zoning is an activity undertaken by local jurisdictions to direct and shape land development
activities. The intent of zoning is to protect the public health, safety, and welfare by ensuring that
incompatible land uses (e.g., residential versus heavy industrial) are not located next to each other.
Zoning also impacts land values, creating and taking away "capital" for and from property owners. For
example, a lot that is zoned for commercial development is more valuable (in financial terms) than a
lot that is zoned for open space. Typically, lots that are zoned for higher densities have greater value
on the market than lots that are zoned for lower densities. Zoning is one of the most important
regulatory functions performed by local jurisdictions.

U.S. Census Terms
Children: The term “children,” as used in tables on living arrangements of children under 18, are all
persons under 18 years, excluding people who maintain households, families, or subfamilies as a
reference person or spouse.
Own Children: Sons and daughters, including stepchildren and adopted children, of the householder.
Similarly, “own” children in a subfamily are sons and daughters of the married couple or parent in the
subfamily. (All children shown as members of related subfamilies are own children of the person(s)
maintaining the subfamily.) For each type of family unit identified in the CPS, the count of “own
children under 18 years old” is limited to never-married children; however, “own children under
25”and “own children of any age,” as the terms are used here, include all children regardless of
marital status. The counts include never-married children living away from home in college
dormitories.
Related Children: Includes all people in a household under the age of 18, regardless of marital status,
who are related to the householder. It does not include householder's spouse or foster children,
regardless of age.
Ethnic Origin: People of Hispanic origin were identified by a question that asked for self-identification
of the persons’ origin or descent. Respondents were asked to select their origin (and the origin of
other household members) from a “flash card” listing ethnic origins. People of Hispanic origin in
particular were those who indicated that their origin was Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or
South American, or some other Hispanic origin. It should be noted that people of Hispanic origin may
be of any race.
Family: A group of two or more people who reside together and who are related by birth, marriage,
or adoption.
Family Household (Family): A family includes a householder and one or more people living in the
same household who are related to the householder by birth, marriage, or adoption. All people in a
household who are related to the householder are regarded as members of his or her family. A family
household may contain people not related to the householder, but those people are not included as
part of the householder's family in census tabulations. Thus, the number of family households is equal
to the number of families, but family households may include more members than do families. A
household can contain only one family for purposes of census tabulations. Not all households contain
families since a household may comprise a group of unrelated people or one person living alone.
Family Size: Refers to the number of people in a family.
Family Type: Refers to how the members of a family are related to one another and the householder.
Families may be a "Married Couple Family," "Single Parent Family," "Stepfamily," or "Subfamily."
Household: A household includes all the people who occupy a housing unit as their usual place of
residence.
Household Income: The total income of all the persons living in a household. A household is usually
described as very low income, low income, moderate income, and above moderate income based on
household size and income, relative to regional median income.

Household Size: The total number of people living in a housing unit.
Household Type and Relationship: Households are classified by type according to the sex of the
householder and the presence of relatives. Examples include: married-couple family; male
householder, no wife present; female householder, no husband present; spouse (husband/wife); child;
and other relatives.
Householder: The person, or one of the people, in whose name the home is owned, being bought, or
rented. If there is no such person present, any household member 15 years old and over can serve as
the householder for the purposes of the census. Two types of householders are distinguished: a family
householder and a non-family householder. A family householder is a householder living with one or
more people related to him or her by birth, marriage, or adoption. The householder and all people in
the household related to him are family members. A non-family householder is a householder living
alone or with non-relatives only.
Housing Unit: A house, an apartment, a mobile home or trailer, a group of rooms, or a single room
occupied as separate living quarters, or if vacant, intended for occupancy as separate living quarters.
Separate living quarters are those in which the occupants live separately from any other individuals in
the building and which have direct access from outside the building or through a common hall. For
vacant units, the criteria of separateness and direct access are applied to the intended occupants
whenever possible.
Median: Represents the middle value (if n is odd) or the average of the two middle values (if n is even)
in an ordered list of data values. The median divides the total frequency distribution into two equal
parts: one-half of the cases fall below the median and one-half of the cases exceed the median.
Median Age: Divides the age distribution in a stated area into two equal parts: one-half of the
population falling below the median value and one-half above the median value.
Median Income: Divides the income distribution into two equal groups; one having incomes above
the median and the other having incomes below the median.
Occupied Housing Unit: A housing unit is classified as occupied if it is the usual place of residence of
the person or group of people living in it at the time of enumeration, or if the occupants are only
temporarily absent—that is, away on vacation or a business trip. The occupants may be a single
family, one person living alone, two or more families living together, or any other group of related or
unrelated people who share living quarters.
Overcrowded Units: Occupied housing units that have more than one person per room.
Per capita Income: Average obtained by dividing aggregate income by total population of an area.
Population Estimate Program: The Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program produces July 1
estimates for years after the last published decennial census (2010), as well as for past decades.
Existing data series such as births, deaths, federal tax returns, Medicare enrollment, and immigration
are used to update the decennial census base counts. Program estimates are used in federal funding
allocations, in setting the levels of national surveys, and in monitoring recent demographic changes.

Population Projections: Estimates of the population for future dates. They illustrate plausible courses of
future population change based on assumptions about future births, deaths, international migration,
and domestic migration. Projections are based on an estimated population consistent with the most
recent decennial census as enumerated. While projections and estimates may appear similar, there
are some distinct differences between the two measures. Estimates usually are for the past, while
projections typically are for future dates. Estimates generally use existing data, while projections must
assume what demographic trends will be in the future.
Poverty: Following the Office of Management and Budget's Directive 14, the Census Bureau uses a
set of money income thresholds that vary by family size and composition to detect who is poor. If the
total income for a family or unrelated individual falls below the relevant poverty threshold, then the
family or unrelated individual is classified as being "below the poverty level."
Poverty Rate: The percentage of people or families who are below poverty.
Race: The race of individuals was identified by a question that asked for self-identification of the
person’s race. Respondents were asked to select their race from a “flash card” listing racial groups.
Severely Overcrowded: Occupied housing units with 1.51 or more persons per room.
Single-Family Detached Homes: A one-unit residential structure detached from any other house (i.e.,
with open space on all four sides). A house is considered detached even if it has an adjoining shed or
garage.
Single-Family Attached Housing: This is a one-unit residential structure that has one or more walls
extending from ground to roof separating it from adjoining structures. This category includes row
houses, townhouses, and houses attached to nonresidential structures.
Tenure: Refers to the distinction between owner-occupied and renter-occupied housing units. A
housing unit is “owned” if the owner or co-owner lives in the unit, even if it is mortgaged or not fully
paid for. A cooperative or condominium unit is “owned only if the owner or co-owner lives in it.” All
other occupied units are classified as “rented,” including units rented for cash rent and those occupied
without payment of cash rent.
Two-Family Buildings: May also be referred to as single-family attached because a duplex with a
shared wall would qualify in both categories. Other two-family buildings would include older single-
family homes that have been converted into two separate living spaces or “flats” that do not share
walls, but a floor/ceiling.
Units in Structure: A structure is a separate building that either has open spaces on all sides or is
separated from other structures by dividing walls that extend from ground to roof. In determining the
number of units in a structure, all housing units, both occupied and vacant, are counted.
Unemployed: All civilians 16 years old and over are classified as unemployed if they (1) were neither
"at work" nor "with a job but not at work" during the reference week, and (2) were actively looking for
work during the last four weeks, and (3) were available to accept a job. Also included as unemployed
are civilians who did not work at all during the reference week, were waiting to be called back to a
job from which they had been laid off, and were available for work except for temporary illness.

Unemployment Rate: The proportion of the civilian labor force that is unemployed, expressed as a
percent.
Vacancy Rate: The housing vacancy rate is the proportion of the housing inventory that is available
‘‘for sale’’ or ‘‘for rent.’’ It is computed by dividing the number of available units by the sum of
occupied units and available units, and then multiplying by 100.
Vacant Housing Unit: A housing unit is vacant if no one is living in it at the time of enumeration,
unless its occupants are only temporarily absent. Units temporarily occupied at the time of
enumeration entirely by people who have a usual residence elsewhere are also classified as vacant.
New units not yet occupied are classified as vacant housing units if construction has reached a point
where all exterior windows and doors are installed and final usable floors are in place. Vacant units
are excluded from the housing inventory if they are open to the elements; that is, the roof, walls,
windows, and/or doors no longer protect the interior from the elements. Also excluded are vacant
units with a sign that they are condemned or they are to be demolished.
White: In decennial census data, the White category includes persons having origins in any of the
original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa. It includes people who indicate their race
as ‘‘White’’ or report entries such as Irish, German, Italian, Lebanese, Near Easterner, Arab, or Polish.
The "alone" designation, as used with decennial census data, indicates that the person reported only
one race.
Year Structure (Housing Unit) Built: Refers to when the building was first constructed, not when it was
remodeled, added to, or converted. The data relate to the number of units built during the specified
periods that were still in existence at the time of enumeration.
