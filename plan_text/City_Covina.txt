                                            EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Circulation Element is a plan concerning primarily the movement of people and goods. A city’s circulation and
transportation systems, which include all modes of travel, determine how and to what degree a city can be accessed,
navigated, and departed. These systems therefore play an important role in shaping the community’s overall structure
and form and are critical to the functioning of the local entity as well as surrounding region. Considering that Covina
is a small, Los Angeles-area (23 miles east of downtown Los Angeles) suburban municipality, automobiles, buses,
and trucks are and will continue to be the most important components of the existing circulation system, though a
recently started-up regional-oriented commuter rail line that traverses and stops in the community diversifies the
City’s viable transportation options.
The entire contents of this Circulation Element are based on requirements of Section 65302(b) of the California
Government Code and on provisions of the State Office of Planning and Research (OPR) General Plan Guidelines, an
advisory document on general plan preparation. Under law, the State establishes the overall data and analysis
requirements, while allowing local governments to address their circulation and transportation issues in a manner
tailored to local conditions and circumstances. State planning law also calls for this Element to address the circulation
of sewage, storm drainage, water, energy, and communications. And it is noted that the Circulation Element of the
General Plan is closely associated to the chapter on Land Use, which focuses on the long-term general distribution/
location and development intensity of residential, commercial, industrial, and other uses. There is a strong tie to the
Land Use Element because, again under law, the provisions of this Circulation chapter must be consistent with and
support the underlying land use development scenario. The Circulation Element has been organized and prepared in
a manner that the City feels is most appropriate and logical and best suited for carrying out planning activities.
Covina (population 46,452, 1997 estimate) is a mature, suburban community located in the eastern portion of the San
Gabriel Valley, approximately twenty-three miles east of downtown Los Angeles. The City is characterized by
predominantly low rise/low intensity residential, commercial, and light manufacturing uses. For a suburban city,
Covina has a relatively high percentage of commercial and industrial areas, which illustrates a strong, diversified,
economic base. Although the community is almost entirely built-out, future development is expected to occur on
remaining vacant as well as on underutilized properties. Covina is generally flat and organized upon a typical network
of intersecting and intercepting straight streets, though has a hilly enclave in the southeastern area (Covina Hills) with
many curvilinear roads. In addition, the City contains a historic downtown that is a key social and economic center of
the community. The Covina General Plan covers a ten square mile Planning Area, which includes seven square miles
of incorporated territory and a three square mile Sphere of Influence/unincorporated area (designated for eventual
Covina annexation). Refer to Section “A” of the Land Use Study of the Land Use Element for more information on
location, character, and the Covina Planning Area.
The Covina Circulation Element is divided into eight chapters. The first chapter introduces and presents general
information on the Circulation Element process, as mentioned above, as well as on below-described Element contents.
In section number two, the key existing circulation/transportation issues that have been ascertained by the City are
listed. Issues are important because they clarify matters warranting attention and help shape the subsequent goal and
policies and the Circulation/Infrastructure Plan. Some of the salient issues include: 1) maintaining the community’s
aging infrastructure, particularly deteriorating streets, and conducting necessary improvements to accommodate future
growth; 2) conducting needed traffic circulation improvements and congestion mitigation measures, such as traffic
signal synchronization, also to accommodate future growth; and 3) maintaining local transportation programs and
ensuring that regional-oriented bus and commuter train networks best serve Covina.
The third chapter discusses and analyzes Covina’s infrastructure and transportation systems, which, as required under
law, cover a wide range of areas, including: 1) major thoroughfares and transportation routes; 2) transportation
                                                            B-VII

terminals; 3) city transportation programs; 4) parking facilities; 5) transportation demand management; 6)
transportation system management; 7) sewer and storm drainage systems; 8) local public utilities and facilities; and
9) improvement and enhancement funding. Streets and highways, which come under the first area (Major
Thoroughfares and Transportation Routes), constitute the focus of this chapter. It is stated that the City of Covina is
supported by a network of streets that is substantially developed and that vary in size, traffic volume, and function.
Some of the larger streets have sections or stretches that have not been widened or improved to full width and/or
specifications. This area of discussion analyzes streets in terms of traffic volume and traffic flow quality (or “level of
service”), two common street utilization descriptors, for both present and future (i.e., General Plan build-out or 2010)
periods. Level of service varies from category “A” (the best traffic conditions) to “F” (the worst traffic conditions—
characterized by excessive congestion). Because of the long-term nature of the General Plan implementation process,
the “future” scenario, which is based on Land Use Element-described estimated growth, is the crux of the issue.
Projected development and redevelopment activities are also summarized in the accompanying, below-mentioned
Circulation Element Technical Appendix and discussed from a traffic-impact standpoint through the application of
generally accepted “trip generation” standards and methodology. The major roads that are expected to have the highest
traffic volumes and worst congestion or levels of service (i.e., “E” or “F”) are presented by general street direction (i.e.,
north-to-south and east-to-west). Applicable north-south oriented streets include Lark Ellen, Azusa, Citrus, Barranca,
and Grand Avenues; the appurtenant east-west running roads are Arrow Highway, San Bernardino Road, and Badillo
Street. These significant though deficient streets are actually analyzed by particular roadway segment. The traffic-
increasing impacts of growth and intensification in as well as around Covina (which the Element process also considers)
will be dispersed in various areas of the City. Because of their direct linkages to the northerly Foothill Freeway and
southerly San Bernardino Freeway (a small portion of which passes through Covina), the north-south directed
thoroughfares tend to and will continue to have greater traffic levels than the east-west running streets. To address what
would be the most impacted major streets and to best handle the increasing traffic in the City, the Element lists possible
mitigation measures. The four primary suggested actions call for: 1) analyzing at peak hours specific intersections
along the problematic streets, 2) adding a third through lane in each direction on certain (previously-designated)
primary arterials, 3) adding a raised median to particular four-lane (previously-designated) secondary arterials, and 4)
completing various portions of certain major roads currently deficient in design, particularly width.
Other key topics that fall under the third chapter include truck routes, of which many major streets are so designated
and are intended to serve businesses and to protect residential areas, and bus routes, which constitute the primary paths
of public transportation in the area and are located throughout the community. There is a regional-oriented transit hub
or major bus station at the Eastland Mall in West Covina, and a portion of the facility, on the northern side of Workman
Avenue, lies within Covina. Also discussed here are bicycle and pedestrian routes and the Metrolink Commuter Rail
Line. The east-west running Metrolink Rail Line is part of metropolitan Los Angeles’s new, expanding commuter rail
network, which, since its opening in 1992, has been playing an increasing role in serving the transportation needs of
Covina and surrounding communities. And the City is fortunate to have a Metrolink Station within its limits (just east
of Citrus Avenue). In addition, freight trains utilize the tracks during the late evening and early morning hours to serve
industrial users. Chapter three concludes with sections on City transportation programs, parking facilities, particularly
with respect to the unique downtown, Transportation Demand Management (TDM) and Transportation System
Management (TSM) measures, sewer and storm drainage systems, local public utilities and facilities, and funding
various needed or desirable improvements and enhancements. It is noted that the facts and information presented in
this third chapter of the Circulation Element have been combined with the previous section, Overview of Key Existing
Issues, to form the following or fourth chapter on the Element’s goal and policies.
The goal and policies are important in the circulation/transportation planning process because they supplement and
serve as the primary basis for the Element’s key Circulation/Infrastructure Plan, presented in the subsequent chapter,
and therefore function in a direction-setting capacity and as a foundation for evaluating and making decisions and
conducting actions on private developments and public projects. A goal is defined as a general expression of an ideal
future condition or state toward which the community wishes to advance. A policy, on the other hand, is a statement
that most directly guides decision-making and actions. In applying the two terms to Covina in the fourth section, one
                                                           B-VIII

goal and several policies are utilized. The Circulation Element goal is:
          A well-balanced infrastructure system and related circulation network that provide functional, viable, safe,
          efficient, economical, and attractive transportation, movement, and transmission and applicable services for
          current and future Covina residents, employers, workers, business patrons and service recipients, visitors, and
          passers-by.
The policies are listed within a framework relative to the following six topical areas:
          1.        Maintenance and improvement of public rights-of-way and related infrastructure to accommodate
                    future growth.
          2.        Public transit and transportation programs.
          3.        Downtown Covina.
          4.        Sewer, storm drainage, and public utilities and related systems.
          5.        General circulation and infrastructure matters.
          6.        Funding.
Key policies call for the City to sustain a network of public streets, under an appropriate classification system, that
enables the City to accommodate future moderate growth and revitalization and that will preserve the community’s
low-rise character; to maintain and, where possible, enhance streets that are aging and/or deficient in design; to perform
various traffic circulation improvements and congestion mitigation measures, such as focused roadway segment and
intersection analyses, lane additions via street restriping and/or widening, median installation, and traffic signal
synchronization; and, where necessary and feasible, to more thoroughly study and consider enhancements to downtown
circulation and parking that respect the unique character of the district and consider mixed use developments therein
via “urban village” or livable cities concepts that reduce vehicular trips. In addition, the City would maintain local
transportation programs and activities; ensure that regional-oriented bus and commuter train networks best serve and
most reasonably operate in Covina; and best link the Metrolink Commuter Train Station to other local-serving
transportation networks as well as to ongoing downtown Covina revitalization and economic development activities.
Furthermore, Circulation Element policies state that the City will ensure that adequate access, circulation, maneuverability,
and parking standards are utilized to facilitate safety and functionality with respect to both public and private developments
and areas; ensure the continued maintenance and adequacy of and, where necessary, improvements to Covina’s storm
drainage, water supply, and sewage disposal systems to accommodate future growth and redevelopment; and handle
the needed street and related infrastructure and circulation improvements with appropriate funding and on a viable,
prioritized, and cost-effective basis.
Section number five discusses the Circulation/Infrastructure Plan, which, along with the goal and policies, serves as the
backbone of the Circulation Element. This Plan indicates the location and functional classification and accompanying
standards of the various roadways that transport primarily cars, buses, and trucks through and within Covina. The
Metrolink Commuter Railroad Line and various flood-control channels have also been included in the Plan’s seven-
category hierarchy, which is as follows:
          1.        Freeway
          2.        Primary Arterial Street
                                                               B-IX

          3.       Secondary Arterial Street
          4.       Collector Street*
          5.       Local Street
          6.       Railroad Line
          7.       Flood Control Channel
*Note: this category includes Citrus Avenue in the downtown. Circulation Element policy calls for further analysis of
the unique characteristics of the street within a framework that balances traffic/circulation matters and business/economic
development needs.
Chapter V concludes with tables that illustrate the specific design standards for the public streets. The Circulation/
Infrastructure Plan is illustrated on the Land Use Map of the Land Use Element, which has been done in accordance
with State general plan preparation guidelines and underscores the inextricable relationship between circulation and
land use. Generally, future travel demands are directly related to future land uses. When changes are made in the type
and/or density of land use, travel demand changes accordingly. Conversely, any modification to the circulation system
impacts some aspect of land use.
Section number VI discusses the Circulation Element’s relation to and consistency with other General Plan chapters.
The Circulation Element is most closely related to the Land Use Element, the central chapter that focuses on the long-
term general distribution/location and development intensity of residential, commercial, industrial, and other uses.
There is, as previously stated, a close tie to the Land Use Element because, under law, the circulation and transportation
networks and facilities of this Circulation chapter must be consistent with and support the underlying land use development
scenario or Land Use Plan. In addition, California planning law specifies that the Circulation Element must be consistent
with all other chapters, and vice versa, in terms of everything from supporting data and information to policy orientation
to implementation. The City of Covina has met this consistency requirement by updating all General Plan Elements
simultaneously, including utilizing one common data and information base and cross-checking all goals, policies, and
plans/implementation measures among the various Elements. This inter-Element consistency will also ensure that
implementation of the Circulation and all other Elements will realize the same results. In addition, if the Circulation
Element is amended in the future, the City will verify that the change is consistent with other chapters and/or modify
the accompanying Elements to maintain overall conformity.
The seventh chapter lists the various measures that the City has undertaken to guide citizen participation in the General
Plan update process. These items include questionnaires; public forums; cable television segments; and flyers, press
releases, and articles. In addition, City staff received numerous citizen and business comments on the phone, at the
public counter, and in the course of site-specific project reviews and met with and elicited the views of various City
advisory bodies involved with circulation/infrastructure and transportation issues. Public comments elicited from the
measures were carefully studied by the City and have been incorporated into the body of data and information that was
used in formulating the circulation/transportation issues and, therefore, in developing the applicable goal, policies, and
Circulation/Infrastructure Plan. State planning law places a strong emphasis on citizen participation in the General
Plan preparation as well as implementation and amendment processes.
The eighth and final chapter discusses monitoring Circulation Element implementation, which is also a State requirement
and is important to ensure that the Element fulfills its primary purpose of maintaining and, where necessary, improving
Covina’s circulation/infrastructure network and facilities. The City will fulfill its obligation to monitor implementation
by preparing a State-required annual report on this matter to the Planning Commission and City Council. Any identified
underutilized policies or provisions will be adequately handled and problems or deficiencies will be carefully studied
                                                             B-X

and appropriately managed to ensure that the desired Circulation Element goal is met. Because the Circulation Element
is, as previously stated, a prominent chapter and closely tied to the central Land Use Element, monitoring is particularly
relevant here.
Much of the background information and facts and analysis of data for this Element appear in the accompanying
Covina Traffic and Circulation Report, a compilation of the City’s existing street conditions, traffic volumes, and
public transportation resources, projected traffic increases, and recommended, traffic-accommodating roadway
improvements. Though separate the Traffic and Circulation Report or Technical Appendix is legally part of the Circulation
Element process. It is believed that this two-document organization best addresses applicable planning statutes and
policies as well as local conditions and needs.

I. INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND
   The Circulation Element is a plan concerning primarily the movement of people and goods. A city’s circulation
   and transportation systems play an important role in shaping the community’s overall structure and form and
   are critical to the functioning of the local entity as well as surrounding region. Circulation and transportation
   systems, which include all modes of travel, determine how and to what degree a city can be accessed, navigated,
   and departed and how efficiently goods and services can be moved throughout the community. In other
   words, quality of life and economic activity are substantially degraded by inadequate circulation and excessive
   congestion. But on the other hand, development of too extensive a circulation/transportation system places a
   substantial economic and social burden on a locality. Therefore, it is appropriate for a circulation element to
   provide for adequate, safe circulation and transportation networks and facilities that meet present and future
   growth-generated needs at an affordable economic and social cost. These networks/facilities include freeways
   and surface streets for automobiles, trucks, buses, and bicycles, rail lines, and pedestrian routes. Because
   Covina is a small, Los Angeles-area suburban municipality, automobiles, buses, and trucks are and will continue
   to be the most important components of the existing circulation system, though a regional-serving commuter
   rail line traversing the community recently opened and will likely increase in ridership in the years ahead.
   This Element also addresses the circulation of sewage, storm drainage, water, energy, and communications.
   The Circulation Element of the General Plan is most closely associated to the chapter on Land Use, which
   focuses on the long-term general distribution/location and development intensity of residential, commercial,
   industrial, and other uses. There is a strong tie to the Land Use Element because, under State law, the provisions
   of this Circulation chapter must be consistent with and support the underlying land use development scenario.
   Conversely, the Land Use Element must reflect and conform to the Circulation chapter’s goal, policies, and
   Circulation/Infrastructure Plan.
   Much of the circulation- and transportation-related background information and facts and analysis of data for
   this Element appear in the accompanying Covina Traffic and Circulation Report, a compilation of the City’s
   existing street conditions, traffic volumes, and public transportation resources, projected traffic increases, and
   recommended, traffic-accommodating roadway improvements. Though separate, the Traffic and Circulation
   Report or Technical Appendix is legally part of the Circulation Element process. Many topics in the Element
   are referenced and detailed in the Appendix, a format that minimizes redundancies and facilitates Circulation
   Element implementation by emphasizing and clarifying the goal, policies, and Circulation Plan, the most
   important components. It is believed that this two-document organization best addresses applicable State and
   regional circulation and transportation statutes, goals, and policies as well as local conditions and needs.
   The Covina Circulation Element is divided into eight chapters. Following this Background chapter, the second
   section presents an overview of Covina’s key existing circulation/transportation issues, as ascertained by the
   City based on particular trends and characteristics as well as citizen input. The third area describes the
   infrastructure and transportation systems, with a great deal of reference made to the accompanying Technical
   Appendix. Section number four presents the goal and policies, an important component that bridges the gap
   between where the City is and what type of community it wishes to become. The fifth chapter describes the
   Circulation/Infrastructure Plan, a key area that supplements and ensures fruition of the goal and policies.
   Sections six, seven, and eight conclude the Circulation Element by discussing, respectively, the relation to and
   consistency with other General Plan chapters, citizen participation in Element formation, and monitoring
   Circulation Element implementation.
   The entire contents of the Circulation Element are based on State planning law requirements (Section 65302(b)
   of the California Government Code) and the California Office of Planning and Research (OPR) General Plan
   Guidelines, an advisory document on general plan preparation. Under law, the State establishes the overall
   data and analysis requirements, while allowing local governments to address their circulation and transportation
                                                         B-1

issues in a manner tailored to local conditions and circumstances. The Covina Circulation Element has therefore
been prepared and, as previously stated, organized in a manner that the City feels is most complete and logical
as well as best suited for carrying out planning activities and accommodating future growth and revitalization.
Covina (population 46,452, 1997 estimate) is a mature, suburban community located in the eastern portion of
the San Gabriel Valley, approximately twenty-three miles east of downtown Los Angeles. The City is
characterized by predominantly low rise/low intensity residential, commercial, and light manufacturing uses.
For a suburban city, Covina has a relatively high percentage of commercial and industrial areas, which illustrates
a strong, diversified, economic base. Although the community is almost entirely built-out, future development
is expected to occur on remaining vacant as well as on underutilized properties. Covina is generally flat and
organized upon a typical network of intersecting and intercepting straight streets, though has a hilly enclave in
the southeastern area (Covina Hills) with many curvilinear roads. In addition, the City contains a historic
downtown that is a key social and economic center of the community. The Covina General Plan covers a ten
square mile Planning Area, which includes seven square miles of incorporated territory and a three square
mile Sphere of Influence/unincorporated area (designated for eventual Covina annexation). Refer to Section
“A” of the Land Use Study of the Land Use Element for more information on location, character, and the
Covina Planning Area.

II. OVERVIEW OF KEY EXISTING CIRCULATION/TRANSPORTATION ISSUES
A.  General
    This chapter lists the key existing Covina circulation/transportation issues, which have been ascertained by
    the City, based on Covina’s overall circulation- and transportation-related facts, trends, characteristics, and
    citizen input (see Chapter VII for clarification). Issues are important because they clarify key circulation/
    transportation matters warranting attention and because, along with a detailed description and assessment of
    infrastructure and transportation systems (the following chapter), issues form the basis for the below-described
    goal and policies and the Circulation/Infrastructure Plan. Refer to the accompanying Technical Appendix and
    to Chapter III for clarification on these issues and needs and for underlying data and information. (In addition,
    see the Land Use Element and Land Use Study for an expanded discussion on matters relating to land use.)
B.  Key Existing Circulation/Transportation Issues
    The circulation and transportation issues are listed below in no particular order. It should be noted that the
    issues are not necessarily mutually exclusive.
1.  Maintaining the community’s aging infrastructure, particularly deteriorating streets.
2.  Conducting necessary improvements, such as concerning roads deficient in width, to accommodate future
    growth.
3.  Conducting needed traffic circulation improvements and congestion mitigation measures, such as traffic signal
    synchronization, also to accommodate future growth.
4.  Handling needed street and related infrastructure and circulation improvements on a viable, prioritized, and
    cost effective basis.
5.  Considering making certain major streets six lanes to ease increasing traffic congestion and, if undertaken,
    deciding the most practical approach to convert the roads.
6.  Considering adding raised medians to particular submajor streets to ease increasing traffic congestion, and, if
    undertaken, deciding the most practical approach to add the medians.
7.  Directing through traffic and heavy truck traffic away from local, residential-oriented streets.
8.  Conducting in the future focused traffic and circulation studies for special areas and situations, such as Citrus
    Avenue, San Bernardino Road, and Badillo Street in the downtown.
9.  Ensuring that streets and infrastructure continue to accommodate public transportation routes and stops.
10. Maintaining and improving local transportation programs.
11. Through liaison efforts, ensuring that regional-oriented buses and the Metrolink Commuter Rail Station
    adequately serve Covina.
12. Maintaining the Metrolink Commuter Rail Station, recognizing all its existing and potential positive impacts,
    best linking the station to ongoing downtown revitalization efforts, and considering whether to improve and/
    or expand the facility.
                                                        B-3

13. Ensuring that noises, vibrations, and other environmental disturbances resulting from the Metrolink system
    and other public transportation networks are minimized through appropriate, viable operational procedures
    and/or mitigation measures.
14. Maintaining and considering enhancements to downtown traffic, circulation, parking, and pedestrian movement
    and safety.
15. Maintaining and continuing to accommodate vibrant and quality retail activities and mixed uses in the downtown
    to reduce vehicle trips, to facilitate pedestrian movement, and to bolster overall district vitality but without
    overburdening parking, traffic, and circulation.
16. Ensuring, through direct or liaison efforts, the continued maintenance and adequacy of Covina sewage disposal
    and storm drainage systems.
17. Ensuring, through direct or liaison efforts, the continued adequacy of Covina’s public utility and communication
    services.
18. Continuing to reasonably follow applicable portions of Federal, State, regional, and County transportation
    plans promoting traffic congestion mitigation and air pollution reduction.
19. Reconciling Covina’s circulation and transportation needs with those of the overall region.
20. Ensuring that the community’s street network, circulation systems, and overall infrastructure will preserve
    Covina’s low-rise character, protect residential neighborhoods, bolster citywide economic development and
    beautification, best facilitate movement of goods and materials, and enhance the City’s image, character, and
    quality of life.
21. Ensuring that existing and future street and overall infrastructure maintenance and improvement funding
    sources are viable, recurring, and stable and that existing appropriate mechanisms, entities, and inter-
    jurisdictional agreements are retained.
22. Accommodating safe pedestrian circulation in both public and private areas, particularly with respect to the
    disabled.
23. Committing to follow various General Plan/Circulation Element implementation tools, including the Zoning
    Ordinance and Design Guidelines, Subdivision Ordinance, and Capital Improvement Program.

III. INFRASTRUCTURE AND TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS
A.   Major Thoroughfares and Transportation Routes
1.   Streets and Highways
a.   General information, street types, and street characteristics and amenities
     The City of Covina and accompanying County islands are supported by a network of predominately linear
     streets that vary in size, traffic volume, and function. The street system was established when the community
     was originally founded in the late 1800s and improved and expanded over the years to accommodate more
     and more growth, particularly during the post-World War II building boom period (late 1940s through ‘60s).
     Today, the street system, like the remainder of Covina, is substantially developed—or the locations of streets
     are generally fixed.
     Figure 2 of the accompanying Technical Appendix shows Covina’s larger or arterial public streets. Presently,
     all public roads (i.e., these streets and the small, local roads, which are not illustrated) total 109 linear miles.
     Many of the larger, more heavily traveled streets were originally developed at less-than-full width and were
     widened incrementally as properties developed, redeveloped, or intensified and/or as public funding was
     made available. As a result, many streets today have sections or stretches that are deficient in width and/or
     improvement. In other words, one or more traffic lanes and sidewalks and/or curbs and gutters may be
     missing. The best examples of this situation would be San Bernardino Road and Badillo Street in the downtown
     and Puente and Workman Streets in the southern portion of the community.
     The previous Circulation Element and related documents classified the streets of Covina according to four
     types: 1) freeways, 2) primary arterial streets, 3) secondary arterial streets, and 4) collector and local streets.
     (THIS IS NOT THE STREET HIERARCHY FOR THE REVISED ELEMENT. SEE CHAPTER V BELOW
     FOR CLARIFICATION). Freeways, being designed to serve regional and national transportation needs,
     typically have four or more lanes in each direction with limited access at one-mile or greater intervals and
     carry high volumes of traffic. A portion of the San Bernardino Freeway (Interstate 10) lies in the southeastern
     portion of the community. Other nearby Freeways that indirectly serve Covina are the Foothill Freeway
     (Interstate 210, which is 2 1/2 miles to the north), the San Gabriel River Freeway (Interstate 605, about 4 miles
     to the west), and the Orange Freeway (both Interstate 210 and State Highway 57, which is slightly over 1 mile
     to the east).
     Primary arterial streets, moreover, are designed to serve as the principal streets traversing the community.
     They serve both local and regional transportation needs and must be designed to safely carry high volumes of
     traffic while providing access to adjacent properties. The current City standard for primary arterial streets
     calls for a 100-foot wide right-of-way with two lanes in each direction separated by a median island.
     In addition, the secondary arterial streets, which carry moderate to high volumes of traffic within the community,
     collect traffic and carry it to primary arterials and freeways, provide access to adjacent properties, and, to a
     lesser extent, carry regional traffic passing through Covina. The City standard for secondary arterial streets is
     an 80-foot wide right-of-way with two lanes in each direction and with no median separation.
     Lastly, the collector and local streets are designed to provide access to abutting, typically residential properties.
     Local streets have 2 lanes and are generally between 50 feet and 60 feet in width. They are intended to
     minimize traffic, to efficiently carry people to primary and secondary arterial streets, and to discourage long
     distance, regional traffic. Figure 1 of the Technical Appendix illustrates Covina’s above-noted primary arterial
     and secondary arterial streets in cross-sectional detail, while Appendix Section 11-B as well as applicable
                                                         B-5

   material on file in the Covina Planning Division specify street characteristics, including through travel lanes
   and any deficiencies plus the locations of traffic signals.
b. Existing traffic volumes and traffic flow quality or level of service (LOS)
   In order to fulfill their roles, arterial streets must adequately meet the traffic demands placed upon them. And
   traffic demands typically are addressed in terms of commonly used street descriptors. Two important street
   utilization descriptors, as defined and discussed in depth in Section 11-B of the Technical Appendix and in
   material on file with the City, are traffic volume and traffic flow quality. Traffic volume is the number of
   vehicles passing a given point in both directions in a typical 24-hour period. For this Circulation Element,
   traffic volumes for various segments of all currently-designated primary and secondary arterial streets were
   measured. Volumes or counts were taken midweek and during normal conditions to measure typical workday
   traffic. (Counts were not taken on holidays or during periods of unusual construction or traffic disruption.)
   Also, as indicated above, on most streets, counts were identified for multiple street segments to note intra-
   road traffic variations. For the San Bernardino Freeway and its ranges, traffic counts were taken from California
   Department of Transportation publications. The current daily aggregate, section-by-section counts for the
   major or previously-designated primary and secondary arterial streets are described in Section 11-B (along
   with general street characteristics) and illustrated in Figure 3 and on Table 1. The most heavily traveled east-
   west roads are generally Arrow Highway, Cypress Street, San Bernardino Road, and Badillo Street, while
   Azusa, Citrus, Barranca, and Grand Avenues tend to have the highest traffic volumes for the north-south
   running streets. Because of their direct linkages to both northerly (Foothill) and southerly (San Bernardino)
   freeways and land uses, Covina’s north-south running arterials tend to have greater traffic levels than the east-
   west directed thoroughfares. All of the above and other major roadways have generally slightly varying
   counts for their respective different segments, however. Traffic volumes are also broken down by direction of
   travel in the filed material.
   Traffic flow quality, the second street utilization descriptor, is referred to as “level of service” or simply LOS.
   Level of service is determined based on the relationship between traffic volume and the vehicular capacity of
   a street, which is a function of various factors, such as the number and width of lanes, the mix of vehicles and
   speed traveled, traffic control devices, intersections, the extent of side accesses, and alignments and grades.
   Level of service ranges from category “A” to classification “F.” LOS A (the best), which is calculated as
   occurring when the traffic volume is less than 50% of the capacity of a street, is characterized by a free flow
   of traffic. LOS F (the worst) occurs when the volume of traffic exceeds the capacity of a road and is typified
   by gridlock and excessive delays at intersections.
   Level of service varies during the day with peaks in the morning and evening rush hours as people commute
   to and from work. In urban areas of southern California, level of service D is typically viewed as the maximum
   acceptable standard. (However, under the below-discussed, regional-oriented Congestion Management Program
   (CMP), which aims to relieve traffic congestion and which encompasses freeways and major roads, including
   Azusa Avenue, a maximum LOS E is considered appropriate, if the condition previously existed.) Cities and
   government agencies that must maintain streets generally have limited funds and cannot afford to construct
   unnecessary roads. Higher volumes of traffic result in lower capital and maintenance costs for each vehicle
   trip. This lowers the societal expenditures for roadways. However, if traffic volumes become too high, then
   congestion, excessive delay, increased fuel consumption, and greater air pollution occur. At LOS E and
   below, in general, the applicable costs of congestion exceed the benefits associated with a lower unit value of
   each vehicle trip.
   Existing LOS designations for Covina’s major or previously-designated primary and secondary arterial streets
   are, again, listed in Table 1 of the accompanying Appendix. Most streets fall within or above LOS D, though
   portions of three north-south and one east-west running thoroughfares fall below this standard because of
   high traffic volume, inadequate right-of-way, insufficient traffic signals, and/or a lack of full improvements.
   These streets are:

   *It is noted that these designations constitute general indicators of existing traffic conditions only, as determined
   by standard reference material. In some cases, actual roadway operations may function better than the
   corresponding classifications would signify.
   The above streets constitute key areas warranting attention in the Covina General Plan update process. Potential
   mitigation or traffic improvement measures are discussed below following the proceeding section on the
   traffic impacts of future growth. The reason for this organization is that the traffic mitigation strategy of a
   general plan update program should be presented within the context of long-term or plan horizon year build-
   out conditions (i.e., which would be inclusive of both streets identified in Table A above as well as roads that
   may now be at or above LOS D but could later fall below the threshold as a result of infill growth and/or land
   use intensification).
c. Future traffic volumes and traffic flow quality or level of service (LOS)
   Because streets must meet existing as well as future traffic demands placed upon them, it is essential for a
   circulation element to consider long-term traffic conditions generated from development and changes (over
   the period leading to the horizon year of the general plan, which for Covina is 2010). In Covina over the next
   several years, traffic volumes are expected to increase because of 1) infill development on the few, remaining
   vacant Covina sites, 2) redevelopment of currently underutilized Covina properties with more intense uses, 3)
   continuing regionwide development and redevelopment activities (i.e., occurring outside the boundaries of
   the community), and 4) general increasing mobility among the population. These factors underscore the
   inextricable, previously mentioned relationship between traffic/transportation and land use. When changes in
   the type and/or intensity of land use take place, travel demand varies as well. Conversely, any modification to
   the circulation system would also impact land use.
                                                      B-7
In Chapter III of the accompanying Technical Appendix, future or 2010 primary and secondary street daily
traffic volumes, the first of the two employed street utilization descriptors, have been computed (see Figure
7). The future traffic volumes are based on the sum of existing traffic levels and, first, counts extrapolated
from estimated future Covina residential, commercial, and industrial expansion, as allowed under the Land
Use Element (see Figure 5 and Table 4) plus, second, a 1% factor of annual ambient/regional growth that
would account for both unforeseen growth within the City of Covina and that would occur regardless of City
General Plan actions. Technically, the latter 1% ambient/regional growth factor is actually applied to the
existing daily traffic volumes to project baseline conditions for 2010. It should be noted that in estimating
and allocating to different streets the additional, future-oriented traffic volumes, generally accepted “trip
generation” standards and methodology were employed (refer to Table 3), and the 1% annual growth rate is
consistent with below-described Los Angeles County Congestion Management Program (CMP) guidelines.
As was done with the current traffic volumes above, the extent of future/2010 traffic is documented for the
City’s primary and secondary arterials on a section-by-section basis in terms of level of service (LOS). For
clarification on LOS, which is the second street utilization descriptor employed in this Element, and related
material, refer to the Technical Appendix or the previous section. In general, LOS ranges from “A” to “F.”
LOS “A” is characterized by a free flow of traffic; LOS F is typified by gridlock and excessive delays at
intersections. In urban areas of southern California, level of service D is typically viewed as the optimal
standard. However, roads like Azusa Avenue that fall under the countywide Congestion Management Program
(CMP) may reflect a LOS of E. The traffic projected for 2010 is largely based on estimated growth throughout
Covina that would occur in accordance with General Plan policies and standards of the Land Use Element. In
general, this central chapter of the Plan calls for maintaining the community’s existing land use pattern and
low-rise character, though accommodating moderate overall residential and, in particular, commercial and
industrial development and redevelopment in appropriate areas. Refer to Land Use Element for clarification.
In Table 4 and Figures 5, 6, and 7 and related, underlying material of the Technical Appendix, the estimated
growth is summarized and quantified from a traffic impact standpoint. These items reflect the influence of
previously-noted probable regional expansion as well.
Future LOS designations for Covina’s major or previously-designated primary and secondary arterials are,
again, listed in Table 1 of the Appendix, which also shows the current LOSs. Table 1 reveals that in 2010, as
a result of projected local and regional growth, 16 portions of several of the major or primary and secondary
arterial streets would be classified as LOS E or F. Nine of these segments would be in addition to the 7
deficient road sections previously identified under the discussion on existing conditions. Moreover, the LOSs
for most of the currently insufficient segments would be downgraded. The street sections under study are
listed below:

   * It is noted that these designations constitute general indicators of future traffic conditions only, as determined
   by standard reference material. In some cases, actual roadway operations may function better than the
   corresponding classifications would signify.
   Table B illustrates that the traffic-increasing impacts of growth and intensification in and around Covina will
   be dispersed in various areas of the City. This information expands on Table A above (existing deficiencies)
   by further highlighting key roads in the community warranting attention in the Covina General Plan update as
   well as implementation processes because of excessive traffic congestion, street width deficiencies, improvement
   shortcomings, signal inadequacies, and/or other problems. In fact, Table B could therefore serve as a basis for
   developing appropriate strategies to address the major traffic congestion-related challenges in Covina in the
   years ahead. As previously indicated, this Circulation Element is, accordingly, also comprised of recommended
   mitigation measures and/or street improvements that aim to bring the applicable deficient streets to appropriate
   LOSs. These items are presented in Subsection “e” and under the policies below.
d. Los Angeles County Congestion Management Program (CMP)
   The Los Angeles County Congestion Management Program (CMP) was adopted in 1992 in response to
   Proposition 111 (June 1990) and accompanying State legislation. The CMP is a countywide measure that
   aims to relieve traffic congestion as well as to improve air quality and encourage growth management by
   linking land use, transportation, and air quality decisions. Traffic congestion reduction is measured from a
   particular network of major streets, State highways, and freeways. In Covina, Azusa Avenue (State Highway
   39) is on the CMP network. The basis for gauging traffic mitigation itself is a County-overseen “credit bank”
   system, whereby a city can either earn credits for having congestion management/reduction proposals or can
   accumulate debits because of new development or redevelopment that causes or exacerbates traffic problems.
   Debits cancel out the credits. If the bank has a negative balance on May 31st of any year, then a city is
   considered out of compliance with the CMP and, accordingly, the State could withhold a portion of the
   jurisdiction’s State gas tax funds. Another component of the CMP process requires cities to incorporate
   provisions into their plan review procedures that require that certain large developments, regardless of location,
   to conduct special traffic impact analyses and to incorporate trip reduction features, such as carpool and
   vanpool facilities and appropriate sidewalk-connecting pathways.
   Examples of credit-earning projects would be traffic signal synchronization enhancements, road restriping to
   accommodate additional traffic lanes, and commuter train station parking lot construction and expansion.
   Credits are obtained regardless of whether such proposals take place on a CMP-designated street or on a
   nearby major road. (For instance, synchronizing a local thoroughfare near a street on the CMP network
   would arguably eliminate trips on the CMP route.) Cities also receive special consideration for developments
   near major public transit stations. On the other hand, a city would accumulate debits for, say, new or expanded
   retail shopping facilities or housing complexes on or near CMP-listed roads. The link among land use,
   transportation, and air quality decisions is established by the fact that the CMP process encourages new
   developments of all types and sizes to be located as far off of the CMP-designated arterials as feasible and/or
   around public transportation facilities, thus creating more concentrated urban activities and mixed uses. In
   theory, this clustering of uses would result in less traffic pressures and reduced vehicular pollution. And for
   projects that are desired to be built on or near a street listed on the CMP network, the proposal can take
   place—but its traffic impacts must be mitigated in order for there to be no net loss in credits.
   As of 1996, the City of Covina had a positive CMP credit balance (approximately 2,500). However, the
   present construction of several commercial developments along Azusa Avenue could result in a negative
   balance in the near future unless the City undertakes one or more appropriate congestion mitigating actions,
   such as expanding the Metrolink Commuter Rail Station parking lot, synchronizing traffic signals along
   Azusa Avenue, better analyzing particular intersections in conjunction with future development/expansion
   activities, and/or restriping either Azusa or Grand Avenue to accommodate three lanes in each direction. The
   latter two alternatives are also presented in the Technical Appendix as possible approaches to improve the
   streets’ level of service (LOS) F rating and are expanded on in the following section. And as also stated in the
                                                       B-10

   Appendix, the CMP was considered in preparation of this Circulation Element.
e. Potential street deficiency mitigation measures
   The previous topics of this discussion on streets and highways presented information on Covina primary and
   secondary arterial street types and characteristics and focused on the need to address deficiencies in the design
   and/or capacity of the roads, the appurtenant traffic of which will be exacerbated because of both local and
   regional growth. In particular, Table B on page 9 listed 16 street segments warranting the greatest attention.
   References were repeatedly made to the accompanying Technical Appendix, which also discusses the below-
   listed street deficiency mitigation measures.
   The four primary mitigation measures recommended in the Appendix call for:
   1.        Analyzing at peak hours specific intersections along road segments that are currently operating at an
             unacceptable level of service (LOS) or are projected to function at an unsatisfactory LOS in the
             future because of primarily anticipated development and redevelopment activities in the City;
   2.        Adding a third through lane in each direction on certain major streets or previously-designated primary
             arterials by modifying traffic lanes and other elements within the existing (100-foot) right-of-way;
   3.        Adding a raised median to particular major streets or previously-designated four-lane secondary
             arterials by modifying traffic lanes and other elements within the existing (80-foot) right-of-way;
             and
   4.        Completing various portions of the major or previously-designated primary and secondary streets
             that are not yet fully developed to the typical design standards of the proposed General Plan, particularly
             with respect to ultimately having four through lanes.
   The Technical Appendix, Section III-C, presents suggested traffic alleviation actions for what are projected to
   be the major roads with the greatest deficiencies in terms of operating capacity. These roads were initially
   discussed in Subsection “C” and listed under Table B. In general, one or more of the four mitigation measures
   noted above are recommended for consideration on each street. Table C summarizes this information.
                                                       B-11

                                             (along particular areas) (2).
5.     Grand Avenue                          Analyze signalized intersections; and add third through lanes (3).
B.     East-West Oriented
1.     Arrow Highway                         Add third through lanes and (for stretch between Vincent and
                                             Lark Ellen Avenues) develop street to appropriate standards (3).
2.     San Bernardino Road                   Analyze signalized intersections; and develop street to
                                             appropriate standards (for area between Hollenbeck and Citrus
                                             Avenues) (5).
3.     Badillo Street                        Develop street to appropriate standards (for area between
                                             Third and Citrus Avenues) (5).
Notes:
(1)    Recommendations are from Technical Appendix and constitute suggested actions only. In some
       cases, additional specific analyses for certain areas or segments may be necessary. All above streets
       were classified under the previous General Plan as primary or secondary arterials.
(2)    The Appendix acknowledges that adding a raised median would entail removal of on-street parking,
       which would disrupt abutting, long-standing residential and commercial uses of property. Nevertheless,
       this strategy would serve to better balance the need to improve the circulation system with the social
       and economic costs of street widening.
(3)    The Appendix acknowledges that adding third through lanes would entail removing on-street parking,
       narrowing median islands, where present, and removing dedicated right turn lanes. Although this
       measure would disrupt long-standing residential and commercial uses of property, in most cases, the
       strategy would serve to better balance the need to improve the circulation system with the social and
       economic costs of street widening.
(4)    Widening would probably not be possible for the segment between Badillo Street and San Bernardino
       Road in the heart of the downtown. A special, focused analysis, inclusive of the signalized intersections,
       recognizing the unique characteristics of the district, would be needed here. This study would have
       to balance the need to maintain on Citrus Avenue a reasonably smooth traffic flow and acceptable
       level of service and the business and economic development needs of downtown property owners,
       merchants, and City officials.
                                                B-12
   (5)       As an alternative mitigation measure, in conjunction with focused, signalized intersection analyses,
             the Appendix states that an additional lane could be installed within the existing right-of-way at the
             most narrow segment. However, on-street parking would have to be eliminated and some street
             widening would have to occur. Although abutting, long-standing residential and commercial uses of
             land would be affected, this strategy would serve to better balance the need to improve the circulation
             system with the social and economic costs of additional right-of-way acquisition or full broadening
             to future Plan standards.
   The above recommended mitigation measures provide the City with a viable framework for addressing various
   circulation and transportation issues and needs in the General Plan update and implementation processes.
   Specifically, the mitigation measures and related items serve as a guide to decision-making and actions, as
   illustrated in Chapters IV (Goal and Policies) and V (Circulation/Infrastructure Plan). The Circulation/
   Infrastructure Plan, again, establishes the functional classification and accompanying standards of the various
   roadways and therefore is particularly related to the above mitigation measures. Moreover, and perhaps most
   importantly, the suggested focused and/or peak hour intersection studies and analyses will function as a
   foundation for viable solutions to current and future deficiencies. In a city like Covina that has increasing
   traffic but faces physical, financial, business, and resident constraints in carrying out large-scale street widening
   activities, such studies and analyses, which typically occur in conjunction with specific development proposals,
   provide a more detailed tool for determining acceptable or close to satisfactory roadway operations. The
   studies and analyses are further appropriate because, as stated previously, the theoretical daily street capacities
   contain many inherent assumptions that can result in variances from the operating capacities. Therefore, the
   daily figures constitute general indicators of future traffic conditions only. The fact that the figures are
   “indicators” warrants consideration when reviewing the studies and analyses and when recommending
   improvements to the street system.
2. Truck Routes
   A key purpose of a circulation element is to provide for the adequate, safe, and efficient movement of large,
   heavy commercial trucks, as, most importantly, is required of industrial and commercial uses that constitute
   the foundation of Covina’s economy. To facilitate truck access and to meet this purpose, cities designate truck
   routes on typically major streets. In general, industrial uses require truck access for the delivery of raw
   materials and/or unfinished products, the shifting of inventories, and the shipping of finished products to retail
   outlets; commercial activities need to be able to receive their goods, supplies, and merchandise and to transfer
   inventories as well. Also, truck routes are necessary to protect, to the greatest extent possible, persons in
   sensitive uses (such as residential, schools, nursing homes, churches, hospitals, and recreational facilities)
   from truck noise, vibrations, and other disturbances. Generally, large trucks are considered incompatible with
   residential neighborhoods, though, on a limited basis, trucks branching off from the major streets do of course
   serve residential activities in various capacities like delivery and moving.
   Truck routes in Covina are further defined and discussed in documents on file with the City, particularly
   Chapter 10.44 of the Covina Municipal Code. A truck route map in Chapter 10.44 of the Code illustrates that
   the routes exist primarily on entire portions of or various stretches of the previously-designated primary and
   secondary arterials and, to a lesser extent, on particular industrial-serving collector and local streets. From a
   land use standpoint, the truck routes tend to run through or near the industrial and commercial areas, which
   underscore the routes’ function. Moreover, the truck routes lead directly or indirectly to similar routes in
   adjoining communities. This fact indicates the inter-jurisdictional relationship of truck route networks and
   points to the fact that probably much of Covina’s truck traffic is comprised of “pass-through” trips (i.e., in
   which a Covina business is neither an origin nor a destination).
   Presently, truck routes appear to adequately serve the various land uses in Covina, which also illustrates the
   above mentioned inter-relatedness between circulation and land use issues. In general, both matters are
   dependent upon each other, and any changes in one area would affect the other. The City will continue to
   monitor the viability of truck routes from a locational standpoint and make changes when either land use
   conditions or truck dimensions so warrant. Covina must also ensure that route-designated streets maintain
                                                       B-13

   their structural integrity and pavement condition, which tend to be susceptible to damage because of the
   greater weight associated with large trucks. Street maintenance is generally addressed by the City on an
   annual basis through the Capital Improvement Program review and approval process, which is done in
   conjunction with City Budget adoption activities. The matter is addressed in this Element in Section “I”
   below. Lastly, to ensure their appropriate usage, the City may wish to explore identifying truck routes with
   appropriate signage. Currently, most of the routes have no such signs.
3. Bus Routes
   Public bus service in, to, and from Covina is provided by Foothill Transit Zone (FTZ) and the Metropolitan
   Transportation Authority (MTA—formerly Southern California Rapid Transit District, RTD). Foothill Transit
   was established by Los Angeles County and several San Gabriel Valley cities through a joint powers agreement
   and provides bus service for San Gabriel Valley communities. The MTA is the chief transportation agency
   serving greater Los Angeles and provides an extensive bus system (in addition to commuter rail and the
   downtown Los Angeles-oriented subway). These two carriers operate several fixed routes in and near the
   community, the line numbers and ridership figures of which are presented in Chapter 11-C of the Technical
   Appendix. The corresponding routes are illustrated in Figure 4. Covina-serving bus routes provide commuters,
   shoppers, and others with direct or connecting transportation to virtually all portions of the San Gabriel
   Valley, via basic surface street lines, as well as to major business and employment centers in other areas of Los
   Angeles County, such as downtown Los Angeles, and in Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside Counties.
   Access to the surrounding centers and regions is primarily attained through freeway-oriented express buses.
   The Eastland Mall in West Covina, located just south of Workman Avenue between Barranca and Citrus
   Avenues and adjacent to the San Bernardino Freeway, as well as abutting major streets function as the area’s
   regional transportation hub, a facility that is discussed in Section B2 below. And part of this hub (north side
   of Workman Avenue) presently falls within Covina territory.
   Figure 4 of the Appendix illustrates that the bus routes located within Covina, which have been established by
   the two bus servers, pervade on typically the most heavily traveled primary and secondary arterials as well as
   a few less busy streets. The routes tend to pass through all land use types, though the most common adjacent
   activities are residential medium to high density, commercial, and industrial. In addition, except for the
   Covina Hills neighborhood in the southeastern portion of the community, the bus network extends through all
   Covina areas. No neighborhood is more than approximately one-half mile away from at least one bus line.
   As in most areas of greater Los Angeles, in Covina the bus system constitutes the primary form of public
   transportation. However, Covina buses make up a relatively small share of the total travel because of land use
   patterns, the location of major employment and commercial centers, local socio-economic factors, and lower
   quality service when compared to more urbanized and populated areas. In general, bus ridership is influenced
   by two factors: cost (i.e., transit fares, particularly in relation to car expenses) and convenience (i.e., routing
   and scheduling, often when compared to automobile parking). Again, refer to the filed material for clarification
   on this issue. It should also be noted that the above “cost and convenience” factors are considered by persons
   in deciding whether to use the below-discussed Metrolink Commuter Train System, of which the area’s bus
   network greatly serves.
   As a policy matter, the City should consider following reasonable measures to ensure the continued availability,
   efficiency, and attractiveness of bus usage. This can be achieved through possibly working with transit operators
   to monitor the viability of various routes, by ensuring that future land use patterns concentrate development in
   centers or clusters along transit corridors, and by assuring that potential mixed use developments, such as
   residential dwellings atop of commercial businesses (see Sections A6 and B3 below), are located near bus
   stops. Under the previously mentioned Congestion Management Program (CMP-Section 1d), the City will be
   required to incorporate bus facilities in particular major commercial and industrial developments, and the
   community may receive “credits” for various bus enhancements. In sum, while the present transportation
   network will continue to be dominated by automobiles, it would be in the City’s best interest to accommodate
   the maintenance and expansion of bus routes.
                                                        B-14

4. Commuter Rail/Railroad Line
   The middle and northeastern sections of Covina are traversed by the generally east-west running San Bernardino
   Line of the Metrolink Commuter Rail system, which is owned and operated by the Southern California Regional
   Rail Authority (SCRRA), an independent rail-oriented agency. Metrolink is the greater Los Angeles area’s
   commuter transport network that is based on six regional routes (the Santa Clarita, Ventura County, San
   Bernardino, Riverside, Orange County, and Inland Empire-Orange County Lines), and Union Station in
   downtown Los Angeles serves as the hub of the system. Metrolink is one component of metropolitan Los
   Angeles’s expanding rail network, which includes the Blue Line (out to Long Beach) and Green Line (out to
   El Segundo) commuter trains and the Red Line subway. All of these elements are linked to Union Station as
   well. The tax payer-supported rail system was conceived and is being implemented primarily as a means of
   alleviating the region’s worsening traffic congestion, air pollution, and population dispersion problems by
   offering (like the bus network) an alternative to automobile travel.
   The San Bernardino Line of Metrolink is served by twelve stations, one of which is located in Covina at Citrus
   Avenue. (See Figure 4 of Technical Appendix.) Specifics regarding this facility/terminal are presented in
   Section B3 below. Commuter trains run throughout the day, though are most frequent during the morning and
   late afternoon to early evening periods. In addition, freight trains utilize the tracks during the late evening and
   early morning hours to serve certain industrial facilities in Covina and other communities. Freight operations
   are managed by the Southern Pacific Transportation Company, the previous rail owner, who leases the rail
   from SCRRA. Southern Pacific originally developed the rail line in the late 1800s to serve the flourishing
   citrus industry and to facilitate growth. Many citrus packing warehouses in Covina and elsewhere were
   constructed adjacent to the line. As the character of the region changed from agricultural to suburban after
   World War II, a large number of Covina and surrounding jurisdictions’ rail-fronting properties and areas with
   citrus packing facilities became industrial/manufacturing businesses and districts, which often tend to have
   direct rail transportation needs. In Covina, this shift is evidenced by the fact that much of the community’s
   current industrial properties and enclaves are located along or near the rail line. But the system, the right-of-
   way of which varies between thirty-three and fifty feet in width, also passes through residential and commercial
   areas, where separation typically occurs in the form of relatively high sound attenuation walls. It should be
   noted that presently there are no changes proposed in either the size or alignment of the right-of-way.
   There are twelve locations along Covina’s major streets or previously-designated primary and secondary
   arterials with rail crossings, and all are at-grade. The crossings themselves are modern, state-of-the-art
   components consisting of double gates, flashing lights and ringing bells, signage, and street pavement markings,
   they being installed, along with new tracks, by SCRRA in 1992 as the system was undergoing conversion to
   commuter rail. All rail crossings are deemed adequate from functional and safety standpoints.
   Besides serving the transportation needs for certain segments of the community, the Commuter Rail Line and
   Covina Station provide the City with major opportunities for supplementing current revitalization and economic
   development opportunities in and around the downtown, including the construction of mixed use projects
   (e.g., apartments above commercial businesses). Such proposals could further reduce vehicular trips while
   enhancing Covina’s overall appearance, image, and quality of life. Refer to Sections A6 and B3 below and the
   Land Use Element for clarification on mixed uses.
5. Bicycle Routes and Lanes
   The City of Covina has a small, 3 1/2-mile network of bicycle routes on portions of various generally or
   currently-designated primary and secondary arterial streets, namely Lark Ellen, Hollenbeck, and Grand Avenues
   and Badillo Street, as well as a single, approximately mile-long bike lane on a stretch of Glendora Avenue,
   from Badillo to Cienega Streets. In general, routes provide for sign-designated bike travel on streets on a
   basis that is nonrestricted or shared with vehicles. Bicycle lanes, on the other hand, provide for restricted
   (during school hours only), one-way bike travel within a specially-striped portion of a street. Material on file
   with the City of Covina provides more background information, including a map, on Covina’s bikeways.
                                                    B-15

   The bikeways of Covina were established in the 1970s as part of a regional network of bike lanes and routes
   and today constitute a viable alternative means of transportation. It is believed, however, that much of Covina’s
   bike usage occurs on non-bikeway streets as well. Despite the fact that in the future most local trips are
   expected to come from vehicles, the bicycle will continue to fulfill both functional and recreational needs.
   From a functional standpoint, nonmotorized transportation is important to persons such as students, workers
   who cannot afford a car, and individuals running an errand. On the recreational side, bicycles provide an
   opportunity for persons, families, and groups to get exercise, socialize, and experience the outdoors. Many
   private retail stores and commercial and public centers in Covina have bike racks, which facilitate bicycle
   usage.
   Although presently the City is not aware of any portions of its bikeway system that pose a circulation hazard
   or conflict, the City should continue monitoring its bicycle-serving network to ensure continued safety as well
   as to consider expansion and/or improvement, where feasible and funding permits. Regarding the latter point,
   for example, Covina officials could add new routes or lanes on additional primary or secondary arterial and/
   or collector streets, particularly roads that would better link existing schools, parks, and employment centers.
   Another potential amenity could be the addition of, again where feasible, public bicycle parking areas along
   the routes/paths at appropriate locations.
6. Pedestrian Routes
   A circulation element must also consider the oldest type of movement, foot travel. Pedestrian circulation can
   be discussed according to two dimensions, off-site and on-site. Off-site pedestrian trips are normally made on
   public sidewalks, where provided. In Covina today, sidewalks pervade on virtually all major or previously-
   designated primary and secondary arterials and on many smaller streets. A public sidewalk is now required
   with practically all new construction and expansion activities, and the sidewalk must meet minimum City
   standards for width, clearance, and handicap accessibility. (Regarding the latter point, over the years the City
   has installed curb cuts at most major intersections to comply with applicable laws and to assist the disabled.)
   The reason sidewalks do not exist on an abundance of local, residential streets is that years ago housing was
   often not conditioned upon sidewalk installation (as well as, in many cases, basic curb and gutter construction).
   On-site pedestrian activity takes place within private developments, such as retail businesses, offices, and
   industrial facilities, and typically occurs on walkways and parking lot driveways and aisles. In new and
   remodeled developments, the City attempts to make walkways as wide and functional as possible so that
   pedestrian movement in driveways, aisles, and vehicle maneuvering areas is minimized. The City also tries,
   where feasible, to adequately link on-site walkways with off-site sidewalks to allow for pedestrian in addition
   to vehicular access. Under the recently approved State standards relating to the (Federal) Americans with
   Disabilities Act, minimum public-private “linkage” provisions for persons with disabilities must be met.
   Although the City of Covina supports and will continue to facilitate pedestrian circulation, unfortunately land
   use patterns and jobs-to-housing relationships in the community and with respect to overall Metropolitan Los
   Angeles tend to preclude the shifting of large numbers of trips from vehicles to feet. In other words, the
   majority of pedestrian trips will continue to be generated from primarily a few types of activities, such as
   various errands, students walking to school, or persons seeking recreation or passivity. However, with Covina’s
   ongoing and future revitalization and mixed use projects in its historic downtown and considering the adjacent
   Metrolink Commuter Rail Station, there are and will continue to be at least some opportunities for reducing
   vehicular trips. The reason is that as more housing and commercial uses and, if possible, employment facilities
   are developed within close proximity to each other, trips that would typically require cars can be made on
   foot. (Refer to Land Use Element for clarification on this topic.) To encourage pedestrian circulation, pedestrian
   ways in and around the downtown must be safe and pleasant and adequately separated from vehicular traffic,
   to the greatest extent feasible. In general, pedestrian safety should be a major concern throughout Covina,
   particularly on all larger or previously-designated primary and secondary arterial streets during peak driving
   hours, when potential safety hazards are greatest.
                                                     B-16

B. Transportation Terminals
1. Truck
   Currently, the City of Covina does not have specific “truck terminals.” All heavy truck access to commercial
   and industrial properties is attained through on-site loading facilities, which are required and regulated under
   Zoning provisions. The subject terminals are located in outlying communities. It is believed that this setup
   adequately serves Covina. Truck travel to these properties is nevertheless facilitated through designated truck
   routes (typically on certain primary and secondary arterials), as previously discussed in Section A2 above.
2. Bus
   As was the case with trucks, Covina does not have any “bus terminals.” But as indicated in Section A3 above,
   the Eastland Mall in West Covina, which is just south of Covina’s limits and bordered by Workman, Citrus,
   and Barranca Avenues and the San Bernardino Freeway, and abutting major streets function as a hub for
   several major- or regional-oriented bus routes of the Foothill Transit Zone and Metropolitan Transportation
   Authority. In the City of Covina, bus routes of these providers run on various generally larger streets. A
   portion of the Eastland Mall transit facility (north side of Workman Avenue) technically lies just within Covina’s
   limits. Current proposals call for the Eastland hub to be relocated to a bigger, more functional transit center
   entirely within the boundaries of the Eastland Mall. It is noted that this hub currently is not a bus terminal per
   se. The closest such facilities are in El Monte, to the west, and Montclair, toward the east. Lastly, the above-
   mentioned major bus providers and small, locally-run transportation servers operate feeder lines to and near
   the Metrolink Commuter Train Station, which is discussed in the following area. At a future date, an official
   mini-bus depot or transfer facility could be developed adjacent to the Station.
3. Commuter Rail/Railroad
   The City of Covina is fortunate to have a station along the San Bernardino Line of the regional-oriented
   Metrolink Commuter Rail system. An overview of Metrolink, which is a key component of the Los Angeles
   area’s new and expanding commuter transport network, is presented in Section A4 above. In general, commuter
   trains run throughout the day, though are most frequent during the morning and late afternoon to early evening
   periods. Recent ridership figures indicate that the Covina facility is the busiest on the twelve station San
   Bernardino Line, with 535 average daily boardings and 59 average daily alightings during morning peak
   periods. The average number of daily boardings constitutes almost one-fifth of the corresponding figure for
   the entire line. Also, since the system and Covina Station opened in October 1992, both numbers have risen,
   indicating that more persons are using the train—or at least Covina’s facility—and that Covina is becoming
   more of a destination, not just an origin. The San Bernardino Line presently stretches from its westerly
   terminus and Metrolink hub at downtown Los Angeles’s Union Station (the primary morning destination) to
   San Bernardino City on the east.
   The Covina Station, which is at the northern part of the downtown on the eastern side of Citrus Avenue,
   adjoins a 240-space “park and ride” lot. During its initial years of operation, because the parking lot was
   generally full each weekday morning toward the end of the peak boarding period and because of the overall
   success of the Covina Station, the City opted to construct a new 236-stall Metrolink lot on a vacant parcel one-
   half block west of Citrus. This parking addition greatly bolstered the viability of the Covina Station, which
   therefore could be considered a vital link in Metrolink’s traffic congestion and air pollution reduction objectives.
                                                       B-17

   Although, as mentioned in Section A4 above, freight trains also utilize the Metrolink tracks during the late
   evening and early morning hours to serve certain industrial facilities in Covina and other communities, the
   Covina Station is not used for this purpose. Instead, freight trains go directly to the applicable industrial
   buildings. Hence, there are no “general railroad terminals” in the community.
   As previously stated, Metrolink’s primary objectives relate to reducing traffic congestion and concomitant air
   pollution. But another key purpose of the commuter train network calls for facilitating and complementing
   community revitalization and economic development activities. In Covina, the City proposes to strongly
   pursue these objectives by attempting to link the Train Station to, first of all, current and future use enhancement,
   image improvement, and beautification efforts in the downtown’s principal core, on Citrus Avenue between
   Badillo Street and San Bernardino Road, as well as to now-under-study redevelopment proposals for several
   deteriorating and/or underutilized residential, commercial, and industrial properties north of San Bernardino
   Road, adjacent to the facility. In both areas, the City will consider permitting revitalized commercial and
   industrial activities, vibrant retail businesses, and mixed uses.
   Current urban planning practice recognizes the above listed regional congestion relief and local government
   benefits that can be realized from pursuing revitalized, pedestrian-friendly, and/or mixed use developments
   within close proximity to train stations. Design concepts such as “urban village” or livable cities promote and
   establish guidelines on these community-enhancing ideals. Also, southern California growth-related trends
   point to greater Metrolink San Bernardino Line ridership. Therefore, it is appropriate for the City of Covina
   to continue recognizing these land use and transportation realities and trends by persisting to support the
   community’s Metrolink Station and to pursue desired and beneficial proposals in and around the facility.
C. City Transportation Programs
   To meet the transportation needs of the less mobile segments of Covina’s population, such as seniors and the
   disabled, the City of Covina administers special programs. These transportation programs are reviewed and
   evaluated on an annual basis in accordance with the City’s Budget adoption process and other activities.
   Modifications in the type or scope of ongoing proposals are often made because of changing needs, City
   Council policy orientations, and/or funding decisions. Discussed below are the most current local transportation
   programs. IT IS EXPRESSLY STATED, HOWEVER, THAT THE NATURE OF THESE PROGRAMS IS
   SUCH THAT CHANGES MAY OCCUR WITHOUT TRIGGERING A GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENT
   REQUIREMENT. IT IS ALSO STATED THAT THE CITY’S TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS COMPLY
   WITH THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT.
   The chief local transportation effort is a dial-a-cab service for senior and disabled Covina residents. The dial-
   a-cab program, which is operated by a private company and is overseen by City staff, provides low cost/
   subsidized rides on an as-called basis to anywhere in Covina and to surrounding communities that fall within
   a particular service radius. In a typical month, dial-a-cab provides rides to approximately 1,200 persons, of
   which generally about ninety percent are senior citizens, for a total of around 2,100 service miles. Virtually
   all dial-a-cab calls are one-person trips, and the average trip is just under two miles. The service is available
   twenty-four hours a day and provides basic taxi-type vehicles and specially-equipped vans to serve persons in
   wheelchairs and with other disabilities. Dial-a-cab is funded by Proposition A, a countywide sales tax-related
   measure. Covina is constantly looking to address the transportation needs of its senior and disabled residents
   through efficient, effective, and reliable services. The dial-a-cab measure is utilized to provide this function,
   though the City is always monitoring and evaluating privately-operated services to identify where improvements
   can be made.
   In addition to dial-a-cab, the City currently subsidizes bus passes for senior, disabled, and student residents of
   Covina, another program that addresses special transportation needs. This has been a viable measure for
   several years. Other programs pertain to maintaining and improving bus stops/shelters and the Metrolink
   Commuter Train Station, which address more broad concerns. Regarding the Train Station, as discussed in
   Section B3 above, the City recently expanded the Station’s parking capacity. And lastly, the City administers
   a capital improvement effort that funds projects such as wheelchair ramp construction at street intersections.
                                                      B-18

   These latter programs are funded through Proposition A, grants, and other sources. As mentioned at the start
   of this section, changes in the type, nature, and/or scope of programs are considered and may occur on an
   annual or so basis.
D. Parking Facilities
   Parking facilities for Covina residential, commercial, and industrial uses are either on-site or off-site/on the
   street. Despite the increasing usage of alternative forms of transportation, such as the Metrolink Commuter
   Train network, and the fact that, under the previously-mentioned Los Angeles County Congestion Management
   Program (CMP), the City must better accommodate public transit and ridesharing in major developments,
   because of land use relationships both in Covina and with respect to the overall region, the automobile will
   remain the primary mode of transportation in the future. Therefore, it is appropriate for the City to reasonably
   accommodate and manage the parking of cars in relation to activities occurring on private property.
   Since Covina’s Zoning Ordinance was adopted in 1948, the City has required that all new and expanded
   developments provide on-site parking. The amount of parking is determined by the use, and over the years
   standards have been revised to reflect changing private conditions and lifestyles and City desires. The importance
   of adequate on-site parking cannot be understated, as the City has observed that older multiple-family residential
   and commercial properties with deficient numbers of stalls tend to generate street overcrowding and sometimes
   other problems. Today, the City’s parking standards are considered to be a good mechanism for ensuring the
   viability of developments and the integrity of neighborhoods.
   In the older downtown area, particularly along Citrus Avenue and Badillo Street, properties were originally
   developed long before the utilization of zoning and the ubiquitousness of cars. Many buildings front directly
   on the sidewalks and have minimal (accessible through rear alleys) or no on-site parking. To address this
   unique situation and to recognize the special needs of downtown properties and business owners, in the ‘50s
   the City encouraged the formation of an independent parking district, which is governed by a three-member
   board and empowered to levy assessments on downtown properties for purposes of developing and maintaining
   parking. Today, the downtown parking district, which is officially called Parking District No. 1, manages
   seven downtown parking lots with approximately 500 aggregate stalls, and future expansions are likely to best
   serve the public. Also, the parking district is regarded as an important entity for maintaining and enhancing
   the social and economic vitality of the downtown area, which is an important center of the community and in
   recent years has undergone extensive public improvements and has attracted new, successful businesses. In
   addition to the parking district process, it is noted that the City’s Zoning code maintains parking standards for
   this area, though, for most commercial activities, at a much lower threshold than required of newer projects.
   (The parking standards are usually met through a detailed district-related “credit bank” system, whereby
   properties are given credits that are based on previously paid assessments and that are applied toward meeting
   City parking requirements.) For some uses of which the Zoning Ordinance does not grant an automatic
   reduction in the minimum parking standard because of the uses’ potential to generate excessive traffic, such as
   restaurants and theatres, the City grants parking exceptions on a case-by-case basis if the proposed activity is
   found to be a major asset to the area from economic development and image enhancement standpoints. Over
   the past five years, the City has permitted a few vibrant restaurants and other uses through this process. Lastly
   regarding the downtown, there is an abundance of on-street diagonal parking along Citrus Avenue (also discussed
   below), another indication of development patterns from a long-ago era. Although this parking is of major
   importance to downtown businesses, as stated in Section A1 above, it has created circulation concerns along
   the street, and, as also previously mentioned, further analysis of the situation, recognizing the needs of all
   parties involved, is warranted.
   The second type of parking, off-site or simply street parking, pervades throughout the community and typically
   follows provisions of applicable sections of the Covina Municipal Code. Although presently street parking
   cannot be used to meet Zoning requirements, this parking nevertheless is often considered as an important
   supplement to on-site stalls for commercial and industrial businesses and residential properties. Most large
   and small Covina roads have street parking, the exception being certain portions of generally major streets,
   where such parking cannot be accommodated because of inadequate width or improvement or the necessity to
                                                       B-19

   have red curbing to facilitate turning and other traffic movements. (The City’s parking codes also specify
   conditions where parking on the streets should be prohibited.) Virtually all street parking is parallel in nature,
   thus minimizing conflicts with through traffic. However, there is angled parking in two older commercial
   areas, Citrus Avenue in the downtown (mentioned above) and Shoppers’ Lane, which is just southeast from
   Citrus Avenue and Rowland Street. Because Shoppers’ Lane is a small, local street, problems are minimal.
   But the unique arrangement of Citrus Avenue, which is a four-lane secondary arterial north and south of the
   downtown and then narrows in this district to two lanes with the diagonal parking on both sides, again as
   discussed in the Technical Appendix and above, presents challenges and calls for a focused study. Whatever
   measures are ultimately followed must balance circulation issues with the parking and business needs of
   downtown property owners and merchants plus the economic development and revitalization goals of the City
   and Redevelopment Agency.
   Other roads where changes in street parking could occur are various presently congested primary and secondary
   arterials, which, as mentioned in Section A1 above and in the Technical Appendix, could be alleviated by
   adding a third travel lane in each direction. The adoption of this measure for any road would require the
   elimination of on-street parking, an action that calls for considerable cost-benefit analysis and local resident
   and business input.
   Lastly, it is noted that like many cities Covina prohibits overnight on-street parking for security and other
   reasons, though the community sells quarterly overnight permits to residents with personal hardships or who
   reside in older, specifically designated multi-family neighborhoods with apartments that have inadequate on-
   site parking facilities. The City also offers to anyone, on a limited basis, an overnight permit for a single 24-
   hour period. Considering the permit exception process, it is believed that the general overnight ban on street
   parking is appropriate and has not negatively impacted residents or businesses. Those commercial and industrial
   activities that do operate during the late evening and early morning hours typically are able to accommodate
   the generally limited number of patrons and/or employees through on-site parking areas.
E. Transportation Demand Management
   Transportation Demand Management (TDM) means managing traffic demand during peak travel periods
   before it gets on the streets. In theory, managing demand creates moving capacity on existing roads, and
   therefore this matter is appropriate for discussion in the Circulation Element. TDM measures include
   ridesharing, carpooling, vanpooling, flextime, modified work weeks, telecommuting, and parking management.
   The measures all share a common goal of seeking to modify individual travel behavior to reduce peak period
   congestion associated with single-occupant vehicle trips. Mitigating traffic congestion, in turn, benefits both
   society, relating to lesser air pollution, and individuals, regarding greater free time and lower mental stress.
   TDM is a key strategy employed in regional-oriented congestion mitigation plans that are discussed in detail
   in Chapter J of the Land Use Study of the Land Use Element.
   Under regulations of the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD), all employers in the
   region with one-hundred or more workers must adopt one or more TDM-type measures. The City has adopted
   for its employees a modified work week as well as offers ridesharing/carpooling services and incentives,
   though program modifications may occur in the near future, as permitted under law and/or to best meet
   municipal circumstances and needs. SCAQMD’s trip reduction requirement also applies to the approximately
   twenty-eight Covina businesses and organizations that exceed the worker threshold. The aggregate number
   of local trips (or trips on major City streets) that have been eliminated as a result of this directive is not known.
   Another facet of TDM concerns the Los Angeles County Congestion Management Program (CMP), the
   countywide congestion relief measure that penalizes cities for major traffic-exacerbating projects and offers
   “credits” for congestion mitigation efforts (a measure that was first discussed in Section A1 above). In terms
   of this area, the CMP requires, among other things, that cities adopt a transportation demand management
   (TDM) ordinance, which requires new nonresidential developments of 25,000 or more square feet to contain
   certain facilities that encourage the use of alternatives to traditional single-occupant auto use, ranging from
   the display of basic transit information to the development of specific areas for vanpool and carpool vehicles.
                                                       B-20

   As previously stated, the CMP process also requires traffic and transit impact analyses for particular major
   developments. The City believed that the most efficient approach to address its CMP responsibilities was to
   incorporate the TDM ordinance and related development impact analyses into the existing Site Plan Review
   process of the Zoning Ordinance. Thus, Covina will continue to implement the TDM ordinance for the
   betterment of local and regional transportation and make changes, when needed or mandated. And, where
   reasonable and feasible, the City may wish to consider encouraging existing retail, office, and industrial
   activities to utilize general TDM programs.
F. Transportation System Management
   Transportation system management (TSM) refers to employing measures to attain the maximum utilization
   and capacity out of a community’s existing transportation-related infrastructure. Examples of common TSM
   measures include signal synchronization programs and intersection movement/channelization improvements
   plus, for freeways, high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes and improved freeway message signs. Although not
   required by any particular congestion relief plan or program, the City should consider exploring TSM measures,
   where financially, technically, and administratively possible, to remedy transportation and/or circulation
   deficiencies.
G. Sewer and Storm Drainage Systems
1. Sewer system
   The overwhelming majority of properties in Covina are connected to a network of public sewers, which is
   comprised of local, City-owned lines and major, County-operated trunk lines. All local sewers feed into the
   County lines, they leading to large, regional-oriented sewage treatment facilities in surrounding areas. City
   sewer lines are operated and managed by the Covina Public Works Department and contractually maintained
   by other jurisdictions. The County system, on the other hand, is completely managed and maintained by Los
   Angeles County Sanitation District (LACSD) No. 22. All Covina properties lie within a Sewer Maintenance
   District, whereby special assessments are levied on each lot to provide for routine maintenance and repair.
   The few properties currently not connected to public sewers consist primarily of 1950s-era and older houses
   in various portions of the community.
   According to officials with both County Sanitation District No. 22 and the City Public Works Department,
   there are no apparent problems with, respectively, any County or City lines that serve Covina. Related sewage
   treatment facilities are considered adequate as well. In addition, all components are able to accommodate
   projected future growth and changes, as presented in the Land Use Element. General repairs and basic
   expansions and improvements will therefore occur on an as-needed or development-induced basis.
2. Storm drainage system
   The storm drainage system of Covina, designed to accommodate local runoff and to eliminate or reduce
   localized flooding and ponding during rainstorms, is comprised of six large, fully improved, and predominantly
   open concrete-lined channels, which are operated and maintained by the Los Angeles County Flood Control
   District, and numerous smaller, below-ground channels that are the responsibility of the Covina Public Works
   Department. The large, open channels or washes, of which the small lines feed into, traverse Covina in
   various areas and are illustrated in the accompanying Existing Land Use and General Plan Maps. It is also
   noted that segments of two flood control channels, one in the Covina Hills neighborhood and the other in
   Wingate Park (just south of Rail Line between Grand and Glendora Avenues) are unimproved or were never
   reinforced with concrete and steel to appropriate engineering standards because of their value as an important
   natural resource (riparian habitat) and, in the case of the Covina Hills facility, because of use as a County
   horse and hiking trail. Refer to the Land Use and Natural Resources and Open Space Elements for clarification
   on these special, sensitive areas. Another component of the County-operated flood control infrastructure are
                                                     B-21

   two large flood control spreading grounds (at the southwest corner of Arrow Highway and Barranca Avenue
   and at the easterly terminus of Workman Avenue), facilities that serve as generally temporary catch basins for
   waters diverted from channels and washes in the region and function to reduce pressure on the overall system.
   Collected water subsequently percolates into the ground, thus also serving as ground water recharge facilities
   (an aspect of the spreading grounds clarified in the Natural Resources and Open Space Element). As also
   described in the Land Use and Natural Resources and Open Space chapters, the spreading grounds may
   eventually serve a recreation function as well. The large, above-noted channels are components of an extensive,
   countywide flood control network that ultimately sends stormwater out to the Pacific Ocean.
   In accordance with general plan preparation/presentation guidelines, the subject of flooding itself is discussed
   in the Land Use, Natural Resources and Open Space, and Safety Elements. Generally, flooding currently is
   not a major problem in Covina because most portions of the major streets and most districts and neighborhoods
   have stormdrains or are linked to the flood control system. (However, the area around the unimproved section
   of Walnut Creek in Covina Hills does get inundated during rain storms primarily because of the release of
   water from the upstream Puddingstone Reservoir and Dam complex by County Flood Control District officials.
   Because of the uniqueness of the situation and greater applicability of the matter to other General Plan chapters,
   as previously indicated, this issue is focused upon in the Land Use, Natural Resources and Open Space, and
   Safety Elements.) The few streets with minor flooding problems tend to be older areas, developed at a time
   when such improvements were not always required. Over the years, the City and Los Angeles County have
   constructed many new storm drains and appurtenant facilities and enhanced existing infrastructure, thus
   eliminating more and more deficiencies, and similar public improvements will continue in the years ahead.
   Officials from the Covina Public Works Department and Los Angeles County Flood Control District have
   stated that the existing flood control system serving Covina is functionally sufficient and can accommodate
   the type of moderate growth (refer to Land Use Element for clarification) the City envisions and desires.
H. Local Public Utilities and Facilities
1. Water
   Water service in Covina, including the surrounding County islands, is provided by four entities, the City of
   Covina, Azusa Valley Water Company, Southern California Water Company, and Suburban Water Systems.
   The City of Covina, the dominant water purveyor, services approximately two-thirds of the residents and
   businesses in the community and generally covers the central and southern portions of the municipality.
   Azusa Valley Water accommodates the northwestern section of Covina. And Southern California Water and
   Suburban Water generally serve, respectively, the northeast and southwest territories.
   Each water purveyor obtains its water from various sources, including underground wells and purchases from
   other agencies, such as the Metropolitan Water District (MWD). The four water suppliers own, operate, and
   maintain their respective infrastructures, which are comprised of reservoirs and storage tanks and distribution
   systems. A distribution system typically consists of pipes, water mains, transmission lines, and booster pumping
   stations. The infrastructure elements pervade in Covina and in adjacent jurisdictions and are located and
   described in information on file with the Covina Planning Division. According to officials with the four water
   purveyors, the existing infrastructure and estimated future supplies are adequate to handle projected Covina
   growth. Water distribution systems and related facilities, which are now structurally and mechanically adequate
   and generally function appropriately during peak periods, will continue to be improved, expanded, and/or
   modified, where necessary, to meet future service demands.
   All water purveyor officials have also reported that their respective distribution systems tend to provide for
   sufficient water pressure and fireflow rates in all areas, which are important indicators. Lastly, water quality
   has been stated to be adequate—or to meet applicable Federal and State standards. These and related water
   topics such as conservation are further discussed in the Natural Resources and Open Space and Safety Elements.
                                                      B-22

2. Electricity, Gas, and Telephone/Communications
   Electricity for Covina is provided by the Southern California Edison Company. The Southern California Gas
   Company serves the community’s gas needs. And telephone/communications service is furnished by General
   Telephone Company. Information regarding utility company transmission/supply lines and distribution/
   regulating stations has been provided to the City by utility company officials and is on file with the Covina
   Planning Division. In addition, all utility companies have reported that their respective networks currently
   meet existing average and peak levels of usage and that future service capabilities should accommodate
   estimated, long-term growth. Where needed, as was the case with water utilities mentioned above, some
   system enhancements and modifications may be needed/performed.
I. Improvement and Enhancement Funding
1. Streets
   As stated in Section A1 above (Streets and Highways) and in the accompanying Technical Appendix, the City
   should strongly consider pursuing various street improvements and enhancements to address existing
   deficiencies, such as poor-conditioned paving, the lack of curbs, gutters, and/or sidewalks, inadequate rights-
   of-way width, and insufficient traffic signals. However, the funding of desired improvements warrants
   discussion, particularly in light of increasing City financial constraints over the last two decades. In recent
   years, street improvements have been funded by project-specific developer conditions, City General Fund and
   Covina Redevelopment Agency monies, and Federal Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and
   Federal-Aid Urban (FAU) subventions. Although these sources have been viable and are likely to continue
   over the long-term implementation of the General Plan, the City may wish to explore supplemental measures,
   including, but not limited to, additional General Fund monies (though the new utility tax partially meets this
   need), direct land condemnation (for widening certain streets under particular conditions), special assessment
   districts, development impact fees, and/or general obligation bonds. This topic will require further study, and,
   as implied in the general discussion of street conditions and capacities above, must be addressed if future
   growth is to be appropriately handled.
   General street maintenance funding, a related matter, is also important, particularly in a mature community
   like Covina, where most of the roads have been fully constructed, though many streets have such problems as
   cracking or eroding asphalt and large potholes. Unfortunately, maintenance expenditures in recent years have
   lagged behind needs because of limited funding and changing City priorities. But unless its deteriorating
   streets are addressed, then Covina’s circulation network may not adequately fulfill its primary function. Also,
   community image and appearance would be tarnished and liability problems would be exacerbated. Street
   maintenance focuses on keeping up or reconditioning/replacing asphalt and concrete pavement, though also
   includes street cleaning, street landscape maintenance, street lighting, pavement striping, and traffic signing
   as well as other activities. Presently, street maintenance is funded by various sources, such as General Fund
   monies, the Federal CDBG program, State gas tax and County transit assistance (Proposition C) funds, and
   miscellaneous grants. Two potential sources include (as mentioned previously under “improvements”)
   allocating additional General Fund monies and enacting special assessment districts, but, in general, existing
   City policy constraints will limit options. Regardless of the community’s long-term approach for funding
   street maintenance, the strategy should be realistic, viable, and prioritized so that deficiencies and problems
   are addressed on a consistent, systematic basis.
2. Public Buses
   Public bus service changes and improvements would be funded by the two entities that now provide bus
   service to Covina, Foothill Transit Zone (FTZ) and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA). But
   the City pays for bus benches, bus shelters, and related facilities that fall along various City routes and at the
   community’s portion of the Eastland Mall transit hub via appropriate transportation funds, such as Propositions
   A and C. Other bus stop-related expenditures, particularly in relation to the Metrolink Commuter Train
   Station, may be considered in the future as well.
                                                     B-23

3. Commuter Railroad Line/Station
   The rail apparatus itself has been and will continue to be financed by the Southern California Regional Rail
   Authority (SCRRA), the system owner. However, because the City of Covina owns the Covina Station site,
   the City financed construction of the train station (i.e., platform, canopies, and related items) and accompanying
   parking lot. The City would also fund any future Station expansions. (Covina is the legal owner of the present
   station site and leases the land to the SCRRA for a nominal amount.) Commuter Train Station funding
   generally comes from the countywide transportation fund, Proposition A, as well as special State grants. In
   the future, other sources may be considered, if available.
4. Bicycle Routes and Facilities
   Covina’s bicycle routes are financed by the City through State grants and other sources. Depending on the
   location, bicycle-accommodating facilities would be funded by public or private monies.
5. Public Parking Facilities
   The development, expansion, and maintenance of public parking lots in downtown Covina, as discussed in
   Section D, are generally funded by the Parking District, a special entity empowered to handle these matters.
   In the future, the City may consider utilizing other sources in dealing with public parking facilities.
6. City Transportation Programs
   The City’s transportation programs, such as the current dial-a-cab measure for seniors and the disabled, are
   funded and are likely to continue to be paid through the countywide Proposition A (again, the primary Los
   Angeles County transportation fund). But the City could, at its discretion, utilize other monies in this area.
7. Transportation Demand Management and Transportation System Management
   Transportation demand management (TDM) and transportation system management (TSM), which were defined
   and discussed in, respectively, Sections E and F above, are now and would continue to be funded by both
   public and private sources.
8. Sewer and Storm Drainage Systems and Utility Facilities
   Public sewer and storm drainage systems are funded primarily from Los Angeles County revenues, generated
   from basic taxes and special property tax assessments, and, to a lesser extent, City resources. This arrangement
   is not likely to change in the years ahead. Basic public utilities, including water, electricity, gas, and telephone,
   are financed through the respective utility companies. Covina’s only involvement in this area concerns a
   portion of the community that is provided water by the City. All utility funding is generally based on specific,
   user-oriented fees, a mechanism that is expected to continue.
J. Listing of Key Infrastructure and Transportation Systems Issues
   This area of discussion lists the key issues concerning infrastructure and transportation systems and is based
   on the facts and information presented in the previous sections and related salient material. As stated in
   Chapter II (Overview of Key Existing Circulation/Transportation Issues, which emanates more from points
   derived out of staff general knowledge and observations and identified through community input), issues are
   important because they clarify key matters warranting attention and because, along with the detailed description
   and analysis of the local circulation/transportation conditions (in the preceding sections and Technical
   Appendix), issues form the basis for the below-listed goal and policies and the Circulation/Infrastructure
   Plan. (Issues of Chapter II are thus similarly regarded and applied.) Refer to the previous sections and to the
                                                       B-24

accompanying Technical Appendix for clarification on this material and for underlying data and information.
(In addition, see the Land Use Element and Land Use Study for an expanded discussion on matters relating to
land use.)
The major infrastructure and transportation systems issues are listed below in no particular order. It should be
noted that the issues are not necessarily mutually exclusive.
1.        Stating that Covina is presently supported by a substantially developed 109-mile network of
          predominately linear public streets that vary in size, traffic volume, and function.
2.        Acknowledging that many streets have sections or stretches that are deficient in width (relating to the
          number of through traffic lanes) and/or improvement (referring to curbs, gutters, and/or sidewalks).
3.        Stating that the two key street utilization descriptors are traffic volume, which is the number of
          vehicles passing a given point in both directions in a typical 24-hour period, and traffic flow quality
          or level of service (LOS), which ranges from category “A” (the best) to “F” (the worst). And indicating
          that in urban areas of southern California, LOS D is typically viewed as the maximum acceptable
          standard.
4.        Declaring that portions of the following four major streets presently fall below LOS D or are
          characterized by excessive congestion during peak periods: 1) Azusa Avenue, 2) Citrus Avenue, 3)
          Grand Avenue, and 4) Badillo Street.
5.        Conceding that in Covina over the next several years, traffic volumes and concomitant congestion
          are expected to increase primarily because of 1) infill development on the few remaining vacant
          local sites and redevelopment of currently underutilized properties, in accordance with policies and
          standards of the accompanying, central Land Use Element and 2) continuing regionwide growth.
6.        Acknowledging that, utilizing what are called “trip generation” standards and methodology to estimate
          future-oriented traffic volumes, sections of the following major streets would have LOS E or F
          (indicating the greatest probable congestion during peak periods): 1) Lark Ellen Avenue, 2) Azusa
          Avenue, 3) Citrus Avenue, 4) Barranca Avenue, 5) Grand Avenue, 6) Arrow Highway, 7) San
          Bernardino Road, and 8) Badillo Street.
7.        Following the deficient segments of the streets identified in item #6 above, which are dispersed in
          various areas of the community, as a basis for developing appropriate strategies to address the major
          traffic congestion-related challenges in Covina in the years ahead.
8.        Complying with the Los Angeles County Congestion Management Program (CMP), which aims to
          relieve traffic congestion as well as improve air quality on a regional basis by linking land use,
          transportation, and air quality decisions and which encompasses a network of all freeways and the
          major roads in the County, including Azusa Avenue in Covina.
9.        To address documented (or, referenced in item #6 above) deficiencies in the major Covina streets,
          which would be exacerbated in the future because of both local and regional growth, considering to
          follow various mitigation measures recommended in the Technical Appendix, particularly: 1)
          analyzing at peak hours specific intersections in conjunction with future development/redevelopment
          proposals, 2) adding a third through lane in each direction on certain major or previously-designated
          primary arterials (generally, by restriping lanes and performing minor reconstruction actions), 3)
          adding a raised median to particular major streets or previously-designated four-lane secondary arterials
          (generally, by restriping lanes), and 4) completing certain larger streets with General Plan-related
          design shortfalls such that they would have four through lanes and other features.
                                                   B-25

10. Recognizing physical and/or City policy constraints in approaching traffic impact mitigation in the
    downtown and possibly in other places and acknowledging the need to conduct specific, focused
    analyses for all street segments in the special or unique areas.
11. Maintaining truck routes to accommodate and serve commercial and industrial activities and to best
    protect residential and other sensitive uses from truck disturbances, such as noise and vibration.
12. As the primary form of public transportation in Covina, ensuring the continued viability and
    appropriateness of bus routes and bus service in the City, which exist throughout the community, to
    best serve system users and to conform to adjacent land uses.
13. Ensuring that the major bus stops or regional hub at and abutting the Eastland Mall in the City of
    West Covina, a portion of which lies in Covina, best serves Covina users and maintains harmony
    with City land uses and streets.
14. Ensuring that the San Bernardino Line of the Metrolink Commuter Rail system, which traverses
    Covina, best serves system users, mechanically operates in a reasonable manner, and maintains
    appropriate and safe crossings over City streets.
15. Ensuring that the Metrolink Commuter Train Station and accompanying “park and ride” lots at
    Citrus Avenue continue to most functionally serve system users and best complement existing and
    potential community revitalization and economic development activities relating to adjacent properties
    and the downtown’s principal core, on Citrus Avenue between Badillo Street and San Bernardino
    Road, including encouraging the creation of vibrant, pedestrian-friendly, and mixed uses under a
    framework of “urban village” or livable cities design concepts.
16. Maintaining and possibly expanding Covina’s relatively small network of bicycle routes and bicycle
    lanes to fulfill both functional and recreational needs.
17. Maintaining opportunities for sufficient pedestrian movement in public rights-of-way and areas and
    on private properties.
18. Maintaining, continuously evaluating, and, where possible, improving City-administered
    transportation programs, such as dial-a-cab, bus pass subsidy, bus stop/shelter installation (along
    various routes and at the City’s portion of the Eastland Mall transit hub), and Metrolink Commuter
    Train Station enhancement, to meet the transportation needs of the less mobile segments of Covina’s
    population.
19. Continuing to require adequate on-site parking in relation to most development/redevelopment
    proposals, through the Zoning Ordinance, to best serve the community.
20. Dealing with either limited or often nonexisting on-site parking for various properties in the older
    downtown by continuing to follow applicable sections of the Zoning Ordinance that provide special
    consideration to this key, central area and by continuing to support the downtown Parking District,
    an independent entity, as a viable mechanism for developing and maintaining parking and thus
    preserving and enhancing the social and economic vitality of the area.
21. Pertaining to various mandatory plans and programs of higher levels of government or regional
    agencies, acknowledging the City of Covina’s responsibility to adopt and follow what are called
    Transportation Demand Management (TDM) measures, which seek to modify individual travel
    behavior to reduce peak period congestion associated with single-occupant vehicle trips. TDM
                                            B-26

    measures include ridesharing, carpooling, and flextime for City employees and requiring, through
    Zoning, that major nonresidential developments contain facilities that encourage the use of alternatives
    to traditional single-occupant automobile use.
22. Considering what are called Transportation System Management (TSM) measures that include signal
    synchronization programs and intersection movement/channelization improvements and that aim to
    attain the maximum utilization and capacity out of a community’s existing transportation-related
    infrastructure, where possible, to remedy identified deficiencies.
23. Continuing to maintain and, where necessary, improve, through City and/or County efforts, the
    generally adequate sewer and storm drainage systems and related facilities that serve Covina.
24. Continuing to maintain and, where necessary, improve, through City or other utility provider efforts,
    the sufficient water, electricity, gas, and telephone distribution networks and related facilities that
    serve Covina.
25. Selecting appropriate, viable funding sources to finance future street improvements and enhancements
    to address existing deficiencies, such as inadequate rights-of-way and insufficient traffic signals, so
    that future growth is adequately handled.
26. Selecting appropriate, viable funding sources to finance future street maintenance to address existing
    problems, such as cracking or eroding asphalt and large potholes, and to keep up general functions
    like street cleaning, signing, restriping, lighting, and landscape maintenance to retain community
    safety as well as image and appearance.
27. Selecting appropriate, viable funding sources to support City-administered transportation programs
    (such as those mentioned in item #18 above).
                                             B-27

V. CIRCULATION/INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN
A. General
   This section presents the Circulation/Infrastructure Plan, which, along with the goal and policies, serves as the
   backbone of the Circulation Element. As stated in the Introduction, the Circulation/Infrastructure Plan indicates
   the location and functional classification and accompanying standards of the various roadways that transport
   primarily cars, buses, and trucks through and within Covina. Street classifications and standards have been
   assigned based on the existing roadway configurations and dimensions, expected future travel demands,
   recommendations from the accompanying Technical Appendix, and community input. The Metrolink
   Commuter Railroad Line and various flood control channels have also been included in the circulation hierarchy.
   It is noted that the circulation/infrastructure criteria presented herein are recommended as design guidelines
   for accommodating long-term growth and to assist in the development of a viable, efficient, functional, and
   safe circulation system. However, the criteria may not be readily applicable to certain areas, such as the
   downtown, because of existing, unique conditions and major physical constraints (and, therefore, as previously
   described, focused analyses are warranted in particular situations). Nevertheless, the criteria can serve as an
   overall meaningful directing measure for new development or redevelopment. Any deviation from these
   standards should thus be based upon an appropriate review or a finding by the City that community goals,
   objectives, and policies would be best furthered.
B. Circulation/Infrastructure Plan
   Covina’s Circulation/Infrastructure Plan is described below and illustrated on the accompanying Land Use
   Map of the Land Use Element, which has been done in accordance with State general plan preparation guidelines
   and underscores the inextricable relationship between circulation and land use. Regarding the latter point, as
   previously stated, future travel demands are directly related to future land uses. When changes are made in
   the type and/or density of land use, travel demand changes accordingly. Conversely, any modification to the
   circulation system impacts some aspect of land use. Or as also mentioned above, the provisions of the Circulation
   Element support the goal, objectives, policies, and Land Use Plan of the Land Use chapter, while, in turn, the
   Land Use Element is a reflection of the community’s circulation/transportation and infrastructure networks
   and concomitant Plan for those systems. Thus, the Covina Circulation Element has been prepared in conjunction
   with the Land Use Element update process. (If desired, refer to the Land Use Element and Land Use Study for
   all information pertaining to this area.)
   Covina’s Circulation/Infrastructure Plan is comprised of five public roadway categories and two designations
   relating to the Commuter Railroad Line and the flood control channels. The framework of the Plan is as
   follows:
   1.        Freeway
   2.        Primary Arterial Street
   3.        Secondary Arterial Street
   4.        Collector Street
   5.        Local Street*
   6.        Railroad Line
   7.        Flood Control Channel
                                                       B-39

   * Locations not shown on Land Use Map.
1. Freeway
   Freeways are designed to expedite movement between relatively distant areas in a community or region.
   Urban freeways typically have four or more lanes in each direction, with limited access at one-mile or greater
   intervals, and carry high volumes of traffic. Covina is directly served by the San Bernardino Freeway (Interstate
   10), which, as illustrated on the Land Use Map, passes through the southeastern portion of the community,
   with full interchanges at Vincent, Azusa, Citrus, Barranca, Grand, Holt, and Via Verde Avenues (the major
   north-south running streets).
2. Primary Arterial Street
   Primary arterial streets link principal elements within the City to each other and to adjacent areas. In other
   words, they serve both local and regional transportation needs. Primary arterials function to move relatively
   high volumes of high speed traffic easily and swiftly between generators and freeways, though also provide
   access to adjacent properties. All primary arterial streets are illustrated on the attached map. The minimum
   overall right-of-way width should be 100 feet with 4 or 6 through lanes. Six through lanes can be accommodated
   if on-street parking is prohibited. All alternatives include a raised median. Other standards are described in
   Table D below.
3. Secondary Arterial Street
   Secondary arterial streets serve primarily locally destined, moderate- to high-volume, traffic, tying together
   the different areas of the City and connecting them to primary arterials as well as the freeways and to nearby
   communities. They also carry some regional traffic passing through the community and, more typically than
   primary arterials, provide access to adjacent properties. The secondary arterial streets are shown on the Land
   Use Map. Minimum overall right-of-way width should be 80 feet with 4 through lanes. As an alternative, a
   raised median can be provided if on-street parking is prohibited. Refer to Table D below for additional
   standards.
4. Collector Street
   Collector streets serve traffic of a primarily local orientation, provide access to adjacent properties, and collect
   and carry moderate to high traffic to the primary and secondary arterials and indirectly lead to the freeways.
   But unlike the secondary arterials, collector streets have less of a regional focus and tend to serve more
   confined areas. All collector streets are illustrated on the attached map. The minimum overall right-of-way
   width should be 55 to 80 feet with 2 to 4 through lanes. Other standards are described in Table E below.
   (Note: this category encompasses Citrus Avenue in the downtown. Circulation Element policy calls for
   further analysis of the unique characteristics of the street within a framework that balances traffic/circulation
   matters and business/economic development needs.)
5. Local Street
   Local streets are designed to provide access to abutting, generally residential properties and to link these
   properties to the arterial and collector street network. (In a few cases, however, such streets serve commercial
   and industrial uses.) Relatively minor traffic volumes are accommodated, and street designs discourage high
   speed, through or commuter traffic. Because these streets are relatively small and constitute the most common/
   abundant street-type, they are not shown on the accompanying Land Use Map. Minimum overall right-of-
   way width should be approximately 52 to 56 feet with 2 unmarked lanes. Refer to Table E below for additional
   standards.
                                                      B-40
6. Railroad Line
   The railroad line, part of the Metrolink Commuter Rail system, serves generally a commuter function and, to
   a lesser extent, freight operations. The railroad system traverses the central and northeastern portions of the
   community, as indicated on the Land Use Map. All railroad components within the rail right-of-way and at-
   grade street crossings shall continue to meet each and every applicable Federal, State, local, and other operation-
   related standard and provision. A Metrolink Commuter Rail Station and parking facilities lie around the
   intersection of the railroad line and Citrus Avenue.
7. Flood Control Channel
   Flood control channels pervade in various portions of Covina, and they are connected to a regional stormwater
   runoff management network. The functional- and design-related aspects of the channels shall continue to
   meet all applicable standards and provisions.
   Tables D and E list all recommended criteria or design standards for, respectively, public arterial streets and
   public collector and local streets. Accompanying cross-sectional details are presented in the Technical Appendix.
   Design standards for private roads (in private developments) shall be based on applicable provisions of the
   Zoning Ordinance and Design Guidelines and determined on a case by case basis during project review.

VI. RELATION TO AND CONSISTENCY WITH OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
    This Circulation chapter of the General Plan is most closely related to the Land Use Element, the central
    chapter that, as stated in the above Background section, focuses on the long-term general distribution/location
    and development intensity of residential, commercial, industrial, and other uses. There is a close tie to the
    Land Use Element because, under law, the circulation and transportation networks and facilities of this
    Circulation chapter must be consistent with and support the underlying land use development scenario or
    Land Use Plan. Conversely, the Land Use Plan and overall Land Use Element must reflect and conform to the
    Circulation chapter’s goal, policies, and Circulation/Infrastructure Plan. Any changes in either Element therefore
    will have a resultant impact upon the other. The inextricable connection between the two chapters is best
    illustrated by the fact that the Circulation Plan is superimposed upon the Land Use Plan/Map. Moreover, the
    Circulation Element is most directly related to the General Plan chapters pertaining to Housing, Natural
    Resources and Open Space, Noise, and Safety.
    It is also important for the Circulation Element to be consistent with all other chapters, and vice versa, in terms
    of everything from supporting data and information to policy orientation to implementation. This necessity
    for overall congruence is underscored by State law as well. Section 65300.5 of the California Government
    Code states that “the Legislature intends that the general plan and elements and parts thereof comprise an
    integrated, internally consistent and compatible statement of policies for the adopting agency.”
    The City of Covina has met this consistency requirement. Because the City has updated all General Plan
    Elements simultaneously, one common data and information base, with the same community input, has been
    used for the entire project. This means that the goals, objectives (if applicable), and policies for all Elements
    will have been (when all Elements are completed) prepared based on the same foundation and according to
    the same or similar methodology, thus ensuring consistency. Also, and perhaps most importantly, revising all
    General Plan Elements together guarantees inter-Element program/plan conformity because, according to
    planning law, implementation measures or circulation/infrastructure, land use, and other plans must be developed
    upon the existing conditions/data and issues plus the stated goals, objectives (if applicable), and policies in
    question. In sum, the nature of the Covina General Plan update process has greatly facilitated consistency
    among all Elements. During Circulation Element preparation, the topical goal and policies and the Circulation/
    Infrastructure Plan have been cross-checked with comparable components of other Elements, particularly
    Land Use and Housing, the other key General Plan chapters, to maintain and verify this necessary congruence.
    The above-noted inter-Element consistency will also ensure that implementation of the Circulation and each
    and every Element will realize the same results. Furthermore, if the Circulation Element is amended in the
    future, the City will confirm that the change is consistent with other chapters and/or modify the accompanying
    Elements to maintain overall conformity. Moreover, as stated in Policy “G25,” the City will monitor all major
    aspects of Circulation Element implementation through decision-making activities and other processes to
    verify this consistency. In other words, the City regards all Elements as having equal legal status and is
    therefore committed to appropriate Circulation chapter implementation, particularly with respect to inter-
    Element unity and coherence.

            B-48
VII. CITIZEN PARTICIPATION IN CIRCULATION ELEMENT FORMATION
     State planning law (Government Code Section 65351) requires local governments, during the amendment of
     a general plan, to “provide opportunities for the involvement of citizens, public agencies, public utility
     companies, and civic, education, and other community groups, through public hearings and any other means
     the city or county deems appropriate.” In fulfilling its citizen participation obligations and in identifying
     issues for the Circulation as well as for all other Elements, the City has:
1.   Prepared and distributed a “short” questionnaire to all Covina households.
2.   Prepared and distributed a “long” questionnaire on a random basis to approximately 10% of all Covina area
     households.
3.   Conducted “town hall meetings” and public forums.
4.   Prepared a cable television commercial on the General Plan update and public forums and had a staff member
     appear on the local cable television station to discuss the General Plan update process and answer public
     questions.
5.   Prepared and distributed several General Plan update flyers at City Hall and at various public functions. Also
     prepared press releases and articles in various newspapers and City publications on the update process and on
     the public forums.
6.   Received numerous comments from the public (in this case regarding circulation/infrastructure and
     transportation matters) on the phone, at the counter, and in the course of site-specific project reviews.
7.   Met with and elicited the views of Covina’s Traffic Advisory Committee.
8.   Met with and elicited the views of Covina’s Parking (District) Board.
9.   Organized, met with, and elicited the views of a circulation/infrastructure subcommittee of Covina’s General
     Plan Update Committee.
10.  Met with and elicited the views of City of Covina employees who deal with circulation/infrastructure and
     transportation issues.
11.  Received numerous comments from representatives of other public or quasi-public entities, such as transit
     agencies, utility companies, regional organizations, and adjacent municipalities as well as local civic
     organizations.
     The public comments elicited from measures 1 through 11 above have been carefully studied by the City and
     have been incorporated into the body of data and information that was used in formulating this Element’s
     identification and discussion of circulation/transportation issues and, therefore, in developing the applicable
     goal, policies, and Circulation/Infrastructure Plan as well. All material and information as well as specific
     input received pertaining to these items are on file in the City Planning Division. Thus, Covina has made a
     reasonable effort to reach out to the important segments, views, and organizations in drafting this Circulation
     Element.

VIII. MONITORING CIRCULATION ELEMENT IMPLEMENTATION
      In order for the General Plan Circulation Element’s goal, policies, and Circulation/Infrastructure Plan to be
      realized, or to ensure that the Element serves to maintain and, where necessary, improve Covina’s circulation/
      infrastructure network and facilities, the Element must be implemented as proposed through effective decision-
      making and actions. Also, to ensure that implementation is achieved to the maximum degree possible, consistent
      Circulation Element monitoring must also occur. This subject is addressed by Section 65400(b) of the
      Government Code, which states that following general plan adoption or revision, a city shall “provide an
      annual report to the legislative body on the status of the plan and progress in its implementation . . .” Because
      the Circulation Element is an important chapter and is, as previously stated, closely tied to the central Land
      Use Element, monitoring is particularly relevant here.
      The City of Covina will fulfill its obligation to monitor implementation by preparing the State-required report
      for the Planning Commission and for the City Council. This procedure, in fact, has been incorporated into the
      Circulation Element implementation framework as Policy “G25,” which calls for the monitoring of all aspects
      of the implementation effort, including, as stated in Section VI, assurances that inter-Element consistency is
      achieved. One such facet of the monitoring process is ensuring that any underutilized policies or provisions
      are adequately handled. Also, any identified problems or deficiencies will be carefully studied and appropriately
      managed to ensure that desired Circulation Element results are met. The City believes that many potential
      problems should be avoided by maintaining a commitment to appropriate Element implementation through
      the decision-making process. Besides, then, furthering the established circulation/infrastructure goal, this
      approach will facilitate preparing General Plan amendments.

1.1 OVERVIEW OF COVINA
This Housing Element is concerned with the
identification and implementation of a long-range
housing policy for the City of Covina. The City of
Covina is a mature, suburban community located in
the easterly portion of the San Gabriel Valley
approximately twen ty-three miles east of downtown
Los Angeles. The City is bounded by a number of
other incorporated cities that include West Covina
on the south, Baldwin Park on the west, Azusa and
Glendora on the north, and San Dimas on the east.       1.2 STATUTORY AUTHORITY

The focus of this Housing Element is to continue the
implementation of a comprehensive and long-range
planning strategy that specifically addresses housing.
This Element builds on past planning efforts
associated with the City’s last comprehensive
General Plan update that was adopted in April 2000.
 The City has initiated this Housing Element update
prior to a more comprehensive update of the current
general plan. As a result, the policy framework
outlined in this Housing Element will be reflected in
any future updating of the Covina General Plan.

the 1960s and 1970s was largely due to suburban           1996           45,005         16,349           2.79

 Another source of population increase was related
to the City’s annexation of several unincorporated        1998           45,567         16,364           2.82

General Plan build-out figure exceeds the existing
number of housing units by 1,372 units. Assuming
that the Town Center would be a focal point of
increased residential densities (as described below);
the downtown share of citywide housing demand
could be as much as 15% to 25% (over 900 housing
units). There are a number of factors that
contribute to this demand, such as the growing
senior population and desire of young professionals
and older, pre-retirement "empty nesters" to live in
urban environments.

2.9.1.5 PROCESSING PROCEDURES
If an application for Zoning and Site Plan Review is
complete and in conformance with City
requirements, the processing time is relatively brief.
The policy of the City of Covina is to discourage the
backlog of such cases. Depending upon the
complexity of a project, building plan check for new
construction averages approximately two weeks as
long as the application is complete.
The City of Covina Zoning Ordinance stipulates the
residential types permitted, conditionally permitted,
or prohibited in each of the residential zone

 METHODOLOGY AND ASSUMPTIONS USED IN IDENTIFYING AVAILABLE SITES
Review of the Town Center Specific Plan
The current zoning within the Town Center Specific Plan (TCSP) permits residential and mixed use
development at densities of up to 35 units per acre which exceeds the 30 unit per acre minimum
required under the State’s housing requirements. The TCSP permits the following maximum
development density for various geographic designations supported by the TCSP:
     ●   The maximum residential development density within the TCSP-1 zone is 35 units per acre.
     ●   The maximum residential development density within the TCSP-2 zone is 25 units per acre.
     ●   The maximum residential development density within the TCSP-3 zone is 35 units per acre.
     ●   The maximum density for residential and mixed use development within the TCSP-4 zone is 35
         units per acre.
For purposes of identifying available sites, those areas that were included within the TCSP-4
designation were only selected for further study. The rationale for the elimination of the other areas
within the remaining areas designated TCSP 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 includes the following:
     ●   TCSP-1. The area designated as TCSP-1 is developed in office professional uses that are largely
         medical. Uses within this geographic area generally support the local hospital located in this
         zone.
     ●   TCSP-2. Two noncontiguous areas are included in the TCSP-2 designation. These two smaller
         areas are presently developed as residential and would not likely contribute a significant
         amount of new units towards the City’s unmet RHNA.
     ●   TCSP-3. The area designated as TCSP-3 is located to the east of the downtown business district
         and includes institutional uses such as the City Hall, the Fire Station, and the Police Station.
     ●   TCSP-5. Residential development is not permitted in the TCSP-5 zone. This zone includes the
         downtown commercial business district that extends along both sides of Citrus Avenue. Because
         of the nature and intensity of the existing commercial development and the historic character
         of the downtown area, this area was excluded from the inventory of available sites.
     ●   TCSP-6. Residential development is not permitted in the TCSP-6 zone. The area designated as
         TCSP-6 is a City park.
Survey of the those Areas Designated as TCSP-4
Once the candidate housing sites were narrowed down to those areas within the TCSP-4 zones, the next
step was to identify the specific properties that would be more likely to accommodate residential or
mixed used development. There are four larger distinct areas included in the TSCP-4 designation that
was identified as candidates for the available housing sites inventory and these areas are referred to as
Area 1 through Area 4. The location and extent of these four areas are shown in Exhibit 1. It is
important to note that residential and mixed use development is currently a permitted use for the
TCSP-4 designation and that the maximum permitted residential development density for the TSCP-4
designation is 35 units per acre.
A field survey was completed to document existing land uses and development for those parcels located
within the four designated TCSP-4 areas. The four TSCP-4 areas were further subdivided into Sub-areas
for a more detailed examination of the potential for residential or mixed use development. The first
step involved surveys of the four areas to identify the existing land uses and development. The next

    CITY OF COVINA HOUSING ELEMENT
step involved the identification of parcels (available sites) where infill residential or mixed use
development would be most likely to occur. Those variables that were considered in the identification
of potential candidate sites for new infill residential and mixed use development included the
following:
     ●   Parcels where the buildings were older;
     ●   Parcels that were clearly underutilized with vacant buildings or sites;
     ●   Parcels that were vacant and being used for storage and/or parking;
     ●   Parcels where there was an observed high vacancy rate where the owners might be more likely
         to convert to a residential use to generate revenue; and
     ●   Parcels that were blighted or contained structures that were dilapidated.
A number of parcels located in the TCSP-4 study areas were occupied by uses that would limit their
potential for being converted to a residential or mixed use development. For example, one of the
parcels eliminated from consideration was occupied by an older historic church. Another property was
occupied by a post office. Other properties that contained higher density commercial development or
newer commercial development that would be less likely to convert in the near term were also
excluded from the available sites inventory.
The potential build-out calculated for the individual properties included in the inventory assumed a
residential development density of 35 units per acre (as indicated previously, the maximum permitted
density within the TCSP-4 zone is 35 units per acre). In addition to the overall development densities,
the City also will permit increased building heights in the Town Center Specific Plan area.
Information Included in Survey
The remainder of this section of the Appendix to the Covina Housing Element details the sites identified
as being able to accommodate the City’s unmet RHNA need. The format of this assessment is as
follows:
     ●   An aerial photograph of each individual area (Area 1 through Area 4) is provided along with an
         inset map indicating the location of the sub-areas. A detailed description of the individual sub-
         areas that comprise the larger area follows.
     ●   A parcel map is provided for each sub-area. The parcel map indicates the legal lot lines of the
         parcels located in the sub-area, the parcels that were selected as available sites, the parcel’s
         dimensions, and those lots that are under common ownership.
     ●   An aerial photograph of the sub-area is then provided. The aerial photograph denotes those
         properties selected as a candidate site by a yellow box containing a number. This number
         corresponds to the parcel number identified in both the parcel map and the summary table that
         follows.
     ●   The final element of the sub-area site inventory is a general description of the sub-area
         followed by a table that indicates the parcel number, the parcel’s land area, the parcel’s zoning
         designation, the parcel’s general plan designation, a description of the site characteristics, the
         maximum permitted development density defined in the number of permitted units per acre,
         and the potential number of units.

Sub-area 1A (continued)
Sub-area 1A is located on the north side of Badillo Street between 4th Street (on the west) and 3rd
Street (on the east) and includes the entire block. Within this sub-area, four parcels were selected.
These four parcels have a total land area of 54,910 square feet or 1.26-acres. This sub-area could
theoretically support a total of 42 units assuming a density of 35 units per acre. The parcels included in
this sub-area are occupied by single-level medical offices located on lots with surface parking provided
to the rear of the buildings. The floor area ratio for these properties is relatively low given the demand
for surface parking. Some of the buildings are currently experiencing vacancies and the potential
vacancy rates are likely to increase in coming years with changes in the health care industry. The
future recycling of these sites to other forms of commercial office or retail development is unlikely
given the amount of available office and retail provided in the TCSP-5 area (the downtown) located
along Citrus Avenue, just to the east. Mixed use and residential development is currently permitted
within these parcels, further increasing the likelihood of the properties recycling to residential
development. The TCSP-4 designation permits residential development and mixed use development
within these parcels at a maximum density of 35 units per acre.
The sub-area is well served by water and sewer lines with a 12-inch water line located in Badillo Street
and a 10-inch sewer line located in the alley that extends along the sub-area’s north side.

Sub-area 1B (continued)
Sub-area 1B is located on the south side of Badillo Street between 4th Street (on the west) and 3rd
Street (on the east) and includes the entire block. This sub-area includes eight parcels with a total
land area of 55,500 square feet (1.27acres). This sub-area could theoretically support a total of 43
units assuming a density of 35 units per acre. The parcels included in this sub-area are mostly occupied
by single-level commercial uses located on smaller lots. Surface parking is located to the rear of the
medical/dental office buildings. The parcels included in this sub-area are also occupied by single-level
medical offices located on lots with surface parking provided to the rear of the buildings. All of the
buildings that occupy these parcels are small in relation to the parcel size. The resulting floor area
ratio is well under 0.5 to 1.0. The buildings included in the inventory are occupied by specialty medical
and dental uses. The future recycling of these sites to other forms of commercial office or retail
development is unlikely given the special nature of the existing uses. In addition, a number of
vacancies were noted during field surveys. Finally, there are other opportunities for office and retail
uses provided in the TCSP-5 area (the downtown) located along Citrus Avenue just to the east. Mixed
use and residential development is currently permitted within these parcels, further increasing the
likelihood of the properties recycling to residential development. In addition, single family residential
development abuts the parcels on the southerly side. The TCSP-4 designation permits residential
development and mixed use development within these parcels at a maximum density of 35 units per
acre.
The sub-area is well served by water and sewer lines with a 12-inch water line located in Badillo Street
and 8-inch lines located in 3rd and 4th Streets. A sewer line is located in 4th Street.

Sub-area 2A (continued)
Sub-area 2A is located between Badillo Street (on the south) and College Street (on the north) and west
of 2nd Street. This sub-area includes three parcels with a total land area of 52,710 square feet (1.21
acres). This sub-area could theoretically support a total of 41 units assuming a density of 35 units per
acre. The parcel excluded from this sub-area (Parcel 901) is occupied by a Post Office. The remaining
parcels are occupied by a bank and a single-level commercial building. The floor area ratio for both
sites is relatively low given the surface parking requirements. These sites were included in the
inventory because of the potential for future vacancies and the need for the property owners to
convert to income generating uses. There is a substantial amount of commercial floor area that is
available in the immediate area including vacant floor area in the downtown area along Citrus Avenue.
 In addition to commercial uses, the TCSP-4 designation permits residential development and mixed use
development within these parcels at a maximum density of 35 units per acre.
 The sub-area is well served by water and sewer lines with a 12-inch water line located in Badillo Street
and 8-inch lines located in 2nd Street and College Street. A 10-inch sewer line is located in the alley
that divides the sub-area.

Sub-area 2B (continued)
Sub-area 2B is located between Badillo Street (on the south) and College Street (on the north) and east
of 2nd Street. This sub-area includes nine properties with a total land area of 97,900 square feet (2.25
acres). This sub-area could theoretically support a total of 83 units assuming a density of 35 units per
acre. The TCSP-4 designation permits residential and mixed use development within these parcels at a
maximum density of 35 units per acre. The properties were selected for inclusion into the sites
inventory for a number of reasons. First, the sites exhibit underutilization due to building vacancies
and lower intensity development characterized by a low floor area ratio due to parking. Two of the
sites are also occupied by single family homes that are surrounded by parking lots or dissimilar land
uses. Overall, approximately 60% of the land area is devoted to surface parking. Finally, a bank
building (Parcel 8) has been previously closed.
The sub-area is well served by water and sewer lines with a 12-inch water line located in Badillo Street,
a 12-inch water line located in 1st Street, and an 8-inch line in College Street. A 10-inch sewer line is
located in the alley that divides the sub-area.

Sub-area 2C (continued)
Sub-area 2D is located between School Street (on the north) and Italia Street (on the south) and is
located west of 2nd Street. This sub-area includes twelve parcels with a total land area of 55,450
square feet (1.3 acres). This sub-area could theoretically support a total of 44 units assuming a density
of 35 units per acre.
The primary reason for including these parcels into the available sites inventory is that the existing
improvements found within the sub-area have a low floor area ratio due to the substantial area devoted
to surface parking. Of the seven properties included in the inventory, four are used for surface
parking, two are occupied by single-family units, and last one is occupied by a bank that has
experienced a change in ownership in the recent past. The TCSP-4 designation permits residential
development and mixed use development within these parcels at a maximum density of 35 units per
acre.
The sub-area is well served by water and sewer lines with 8-inch water lines located in School Street
and Italia Street and an 8-inch sewer line located in 2nd Street.

Sub-area 3A (continued)
Sub-area 3A is bounded by Front Street on the north, 1st Street on the east, San Bernardino Road on the
south, and Howard Avenue on the west. This sub-area includes 18 parcels that have a total land area of
99,760 square feet (2.3 acres). This sub-area could theoretically support a total of 80 units assuming a
density of 35 units per acre. This area was selected for inclusion into the available sites inventory for a
variety of reasons. First, the sub-area contains many older buildings that include single-family homes
that are now occupied by nonresidential uses. The great majority of these building are nonconforming
and the entire area is blighted due to the poor maintenance. The mix of uses within the sub-area has
also lead to incompatible uses. The great majority of the lots are under joint ownership which will
facilitate future lot consolidation when recycling occurs. One of the newest residential developments
occurred to the west of this sub-area in an area that was similar to this one. The TCSP-4 designation
permits residential development and mixed use development within these parcels at a maximum
density of 35 units per acre.
The sub-area is well served by water and sewer lines with 8-inch water lines located in Front Street and
San Bernardino Road. Smaller 3-inch lines are located in Howard Avenue and 1st Street. An 8-inch
sewer line is located in the alley that separates the sub-area into east and west halves.

Sub-area 3B (continued)
Sub-area 3B is bounded by Front Street on the north, Howard Avenue on the east, San Bernardino Road
on the south, and 2nd Street on the west. This sub-area includes 15 parcels that have a total land area
of 85,830 square feet (1.9 acres). This sub-area could theoretically support a total of 69 units assuming
a density of 35 units per acre.
This area exhibits many of the same characteristics discussed previously for sub-area 3A. This sub-area
contains older buildings on many of the properties. The great majority of these building are
nonconforming and the entire area is blighted due to the poor maintenance. The mix of uses within the
sub-area has also lead to incompatible land uses. About half of the lots are under joint ownership
which will facilitate future lot consolidation when recycling occurs. One of the newest residential
developments occurred to the west of this sub-area in an area that was similar to this one. The TCSP-4
designation permits residential development and mixed use development within these parcels at a
maximum density of 35 units per acre.
The sub-area is well served by water and sewer lines with 8-inch water lines located in Front Street and
San Bernardino Road. Smaller 3-inch and 4-inch lines are located in Howard Avenue and 2nd Street. An
8-inch sewer line is located in the alley that separates the sub-area into east and west halves.

Sub-area 3C (continued)
Sub-area 3C is bounded by Front Street on the north, Park Avenue on the west, San Bernardino Road on
the south, and 2nd Street on the east. This sub-area includes five parcels that have a total land area of
79,980 square feet (1.84 acres). This sub-area could theoretically support a total of 64 units assuming a
density of 35 units per acre.
The sites selected as available sites are largely vacant and underutilized. One of the four sites is a
vacant parking area that is being used for outside storage while two other sites contain commercial
buildings that are vacant. The sites and the buildings are also blighted. The only property in use is
occupied by an automotive-related business (Parcel 15). The parcels are relatively large in area making
future recycling easier. The TCSP-4 designation permits residential development and mixed use
development within these parcels at a maximum density of 35 units per acre.
The sub-area is well served by water and sewer lines with 8-inch water lines located in Front Street and
San Bernardino Road. An 8-inch sewer line is located in the alley that separates the sub-area into east
and west halves.

Sub-area 3D (continued)
Sub-area 3D is bounded by Front Street on the north, Park Avenue on the east, San Bernardino Road on
the south, and Citrus Avenue on the west. This sub-area includes five parcels that have a total land
area of 100,248 square feet (2.3 acres). This sub-area could theoretically support a total of 81 units
assuming a density of 35 units per acre. The parcels included in this sub-area are under single
ownership. Similar to the sub-areas that follow in Area 4, this site is now vacant and was formerly
occupied by Clippinger Chevrolet. The buildings and site are now vacant. The TCSP-4 designation
that is applicable to this sub-area permits residential development and mixed use development within
these parcels at a maximum density of 35 units per acre.
The sub-area is well served by water and sewer lines with 8-inch water lines located in Front Street and
San Bernardino Road. An 8-inch sewer line is located in the alley that separates the sub-area into east
and west halves.

Sub-area 3E (continued)
Sub-area 3D is bounded by Front Street on the south, 1st Street on the east, and Citrus Avenue on the
west. This sub-area includes three parcels that have a total land area of 145,215 square feet (3.3
acres). This sub-area could theoretically support a total of 117 units assuming a density of 35 units per
acre. The northern half of this sub-area is occupied by older metal structures. The southern portion of
the sub-area is occupied by two concrete tilt up warehouse structures. The sub-area is located just
adjacent to and south of the Metrolink line and station. Future industrial development within this sub-
area is limited due to the local street consisting of two travel lanes and suitable access and loading
areas for larger trucks. The eastern two thirds of the sub-area is under single ownership. The western
portion near Citrus Avenue is under a second ownership. The sub-areas proximity to public transit, the
downtown area, local services, and a city park enhance the sub-areas suitability for redevelopment.
The sub-area is well served by water and sewer lines with an 8-inch water line located in Front Street
and an 8-inch sewer line located in Citrus Avenue.

Sub-area 4A (continued)
Sub-area 4A is located north of Geneva Plan, south of the MTA right of way, and west of Citrus Avenue.
 This sub-area includes five parcels that have a total land area of 54,279 square feet (1.24 acres). This
sub-area could theoretically support a total of 43 units assuming a density of 35 units per acre.
This sub-area is located along the west side of the Citrus Avenue frontage and is bisected by an access
road (Front Street) that provides a connection to a new three level parking structure that serves a new
higher density residential located along 3rd Avenue. The businesses located in this sub-area include a
restaurant and surface parking lot south of Front Street and a single-level strip center containing
various small commercial manufacturing and automotive related uses. This entire area was selected
due its proximity to the City-owned parking structure (for the nearby Metrolionk station) and the
potential opportunities for shared parking. The TCSP-4 permits residential development and mixed use
development within these parcels at a maximum density of 35 units per acre.
The sub-area is well served by water and sewer lines with a 16-inch water line and an 8-inch sewer line
located in Citrus Avenue.

Sub-area 4B (continued)
Sub-area 4B is bounded by Geneva Place on the south and 3rd Street on the west. This sub-area
includes two parcels that have a total land area of 57,450 square feet (1.3 acres). This sub-area could
theoretically support a total of 46 units assuming a density of 35 units per acre.
The two properties that occupy this site are under single ownership. Similar to the sub-areas that
follow, this site is now vacant and was formerly occupied by Clippinger Chevrolet as the facilities auto
body shop. The likelihood of the property’s reuse as a car dealership is limited given the nature of the
economy, in general, and the automotive sales sector, in particular. Prior to the collapse of the local
housing market in 2008, the property owner expressed interest in redeveloping the site as a mixed use
development. The TCSP-4 designation permits residential development and mixed use development
within these parcels at a maximum density of 35 units per acre.

Sub-area 4C (continued)
Sub-area 4C is bounded by Front Street on the south, 1st Street on the east, and Citrus Avenue on the
west. This sub-area includes three parcels that have a total land area of 145,215 square feet (3.3
acres). This sub-area could theoretically support a total of 121 units assuming a density of 35 units per
acre.
This large site is now vacant and was formerly occupied by Clippinger Chevrolet that has since moved to
another location. The likelihood of the property’s reuse as a car dealership is limited given the nature
of the economy, in general, and the automotive sales sector, in particular. Unlike the photograph
provided in Exhibit 31 (refer to the previous page), no cars are located onsite. The surface parking
area and the buildings are not being used at the present time. Prior to the collapse of the local housing
market in 2008, the property owner did express interest in redeveloping the site as a mixed use

Sub-area 4D (continued)
Sub-area 4C is bounded by Orange Street on the south, San Bernardino Road on the north, Citrus
Avenue on the east, and 3rd Street on the west. This sub-area includes twelve parcels that are under a
single ownership that have a total land area of 128,585 square feet (3.0 acres). This sub-area could
theoretically support a total of 103 units assuming a density of 35 units per acre.
Similar to the previous sub-area, this large site is now vacant and was formerly occupied by Clippinger
Chevrolet that has since moved to another location. The likelihood of the property’s reuse as a car
dealership is limited given the nature of the economy, in general, and the automotive sales sector, in
particular. Unlike the photograph provided in Exhibit 33 (refer to the previous page), no cars are
located onsite. The surface parking area and the buildings are not being used at the present time.
Prior to the collapse of the local housing market in 2008, the property owner expressed interest in
redeveloping the site as a mixed use development. The TCSP-4 designation permits residential
development and mixed use development within these parcels at a maximum density of 35 units per
acre.
The sub-area is well served by water and sewer lines with a 12-inch water line extending along the sub-
area’s east side and a second 8-inch water line in Orange Street. An 8-inch sewer line bisects the
property.

                                      EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Land use is the central General Plan Element. The Land Use component correlates land use and related
issues among all Elements and is the most frequently referenced General Plan section. The backbone of
the Land Use Element is a Land Use Plan, comprised of a map and accompanying explanatory text, that
must show and define the proposed or long term general distribution/location and development intensity
of residential, commercial, industrial, and other uses, such as parks, schools, and public buildings.
“Development intensity” refers to residential density (correlation of the number of dwelling units for
each acre of land and the average number of persons for each dwelling unit) and commercial and industrial
floor area ratio (the ratio of building floor area to total site area).
The Land Use Plan, which establishes the foundation for administering zoning, subdivision, and other,
more site-specific and day-to-day oriented tools regulating development and uses, is based on as well as
supplements and implements the related goal and the objectives and policies. By illustrating where and to
what extent various uses will be distributed around the community, the Land Use Element, therefore,
serves as the cornerstone of the community’s General Plan program and building standards, as the chief
land use policy tool, and as a blueprint for future physical development. The Element also functions as
the primary vehicle for addressing applicable State and regional land use- and development-related statutes,
goals, and policies. In other words, the Land Use component serves as the basis for local decision-making
and actions on all growth and revitalization matters. And, as previously stated, another key purpose of the
Land Use Element is to serve as a framework for objectives, policies, and standards in all required General
Plan topical chapters. Land Use is particularly intertwined with the Circulation, Housing, and Safety
chapters (refer to below-noted State General Plan Guidelines for clarification).
Much of the land use-related background information and facts and analysis of data for this Element
appear in the Land Use Study, an all-inclusive compilation of Covina’s existing land use and development
resources, characteristics, and issues. Though separate, the Study is legally part of the Land Use Element
process. Most topics in this Element are referenced and detailed in the Study, a format that eliminates
redundancies and facilitates Land Use Element implementation by emphasizing and clarifying goals,
objectives, policies, the Land Use Plan, and programs/implementation measures, the most important
components.
The entire contents of the Land Use Element are based on State planning law requirements (Section 65302(a)
of the California Government Code) and the California Office of Planning and Research (OPR) General
Plan Guidelines, an advisory document on general plan preparation. Under law, the State establishes the
overall data and analysis requirements, while allowing local governments to address their land use and
development issues in a manner tailored to local conditions and circumstances. The Covina Land Use
Element has therefore been prepared and, as previously stated, organized in a manner that the City feels is
most appropriate and logical and best suited for carrying out planning activities.
Covina (population 46,452, 1997 estimate) is a mature, suburban community located in the eastern portion
of the San Gabriel Valley, approximately twenty-three miles east of downtown Los Angeles. The City is
characterized by predominantly low rise/low intensity residential, commercial, and light manufacturing
uses. For a suburban city, Covina has a relatively high percentage of commercial and industrial areas,
which indicates a strong, diversified economic base. Although the community is almost entirely built out,
future development is expected to occur on remaining vacant as well as on underutilized properties. Covina
is generally flat, though has a hilly enclave in the southeastern area (Covina Hills), and contains a historic
downtown that is a key social and economic center of the community. The Covina General Plan covers a
ten square mile Planning Area, which includes seven square miles of incorporated territory and a three
square mile Sphere of Influence/unincorporated area (designated for eventual Covina annexation). Refer
to Section “A” of the Land Use Study for more information on location, character, and the Covina Planning
Area.
The Land Use Element document is comprised of eight chapters: Background; Overview of Key Existing
Land Use Issues; Goal, Objectives, and Policies; Land Use Plan; and Programs/Implementation Measures.
                                                     A-VII

Concluding sections include: Relation to and Consistency With Other General Plan Elements; Citizen
Participation in Land Use Element Formation; and Monitoring Land Use Element Implementation. The
Land Use Study-based “Issues” chapter serves as the foundation for the Element’s goal, objectives, policies,
and Land Use Plan. Issues typically address matters ranging from physical development and land use to
community image and appearance to economic and social conditions and in this document are discussed
according to the following five-topic framework:
         1.       The type and amount of future development and redevelopment activities.
         2.       Land use categories, quantities, standards, distribution, and compatibility.
         3.       Community image and appearance.
         4.       Economic and social conditions.
         5.       The provision of public facilities and services.
The Element addresses Covina’s various land use issues through what the City believes is a sufficient and
viable policy orientation, Land Use Plan, and program framework, the three most important areas. The
policy orientation, first of all, is comprised of a general land use goal and several objectives and policies
that, along with the accompanying Land Use Plan and programs, function as a bridge between where
Covina is (which is clarified in the previous “Issues” chapter and the Land Use Study) and what type of
city it wishes to become. In other words, the goal and objectives and policies, as stated above, guide
decision-making and actions on all land use and development matters. The Land Use Element goal is:
         A physical environment that provides for the housing, employment, business, service, recreational,
         social, educational, cultural, and entertainment needs of and maintains and enhances a high quality
         of life for its residents.
Policies are presented under six objectives, each of which, like the structure of the above issues, pertains
to a different topic area. The policy areas are:
         1.       A climate where moderate residential, commercial, and industrial development and
                  redevelopment are accommodated.
         2.       An adequate amount and distribution of and compatibility of adjacent land uses throughout
                  the community.
         3.       A community that is attractive and maintains a good image and small-town atmosphere.
         4.       Economic and social vitality in all areas of the community.
         5.       The provision of sufficient public facilities and services.
Generally, the various policies that are presented under the five objectives focus on: maintaining the
existing land use distribution and Covina’s low rise/low intensity character; accommodating moderate
residential growth of various types for all economic segments, though limiting the rate of higher density
apartment and condominium/townhouse construction; preserving existing commercial and industrial areas
and maintaining and facilitating the expansion and/or revitalization of businesses for employment,
community image, and sales tax enhancement purposes; and maintaining the downtown as a key economic
and social center of the City by promoting commercial revitalization and mixed use developments via
“urban village” or livable cities concepts and by encouraging better linkages to the Metrolink Commuter
Train Station. Other policy orientations deal with: preserving the very low density character, sensitive
environmental resources, and natural appearance of Covina Hills by minimizing future grading and
                                                     A-VIII

development; protecting existing parklands and open space resources from conversion to other uses;
attempting to preserve structures, resources, and/or areas that are of local historic and/or architectural
significance; and discouraging illogical, conflicting, and/or peculiar land use arrangements. Final key
policy orientations pertain to: following reasonable residential density and commercial and industrial
floor area ratio provisions; maintaining appropriate development standards, design provisions, and
inspections to ensure the safety, functionality, and attractiveness of development; ensuring that all properties
and uses are physically, aesthetically, and functionally maintained to retain community appearance, image,
and stability; and accommodating future growth, redevelopment, and revitalization with adequate public
facilities, with sufficient community services, and that respect physical and environmental resources and
constraints.
The Covina Land Use Plan, which is based on and augments the Land Use Element’s goal and objectives
and policies, is the cornerstone of the Element process. The Plan, as stated above, establishes and divides
the community into districts that identify the permitted types of uses, building character, and extent of
new and remodeled development, is comprised of nine land use categories, the primary ones of which are
three residential, two commercial, and one industrial designations. Land use categories have been selected
and applied in a manner that best meets existing and future local conditions, circumstances, and needs,
and the overall land use strategy is based heavily on previously existing conditions. The following
categories comprise the Land Use Plan:
         A.       Residential
                  1.      Low Density
                  2.      Medium Density
                  3.      High Density
         B.       Commercial
                  1.      General
                  2.      Town Center
         C.       Industrial
         D.       School
         E.       Park
         F.       Open Space
The “Residential” use hierarchy thus consists of “Low” (0 - 6.0 dwelling units per net acre of land),
“Medium” (6.1 - 14.0), and “High” (14.1 - 22.0) groupings. “Low Density” refers primarily to single-
family detached houses, the dominant land use category, which pervades throughout the community. The
“Medium” and “High” classifications accommodate apartments, condominiums/townhomes, and mobile
homes, and the two categories are generally oriented in and around the downtown and in various
neighborhoods. Moreover, the “Commercial” land use hierarchy is, as illustrated above, comprised of
“General” (maximum floor area ratio 1.5) and “Town Center” (maximum floor area ratio 2.5) categories.
“General Commercial,” the chief commercial designation, refers to an array of uses and building types,
including retail, office, and services, and pervades in various districts generally along the major streets or
at primary street intersections. On the other hand, the “Town Center” category pertains to the downtown
area only. This designation allows for limited, specialized commercial and mixed uses that are intended
to best address the downtown’s unique character, development pattern, and needs. Finally, the City’s
“Industrial” land use category, which exists generally along or near the Metrolink Commuter Railroad
Line and at various stretches of San Bernardino Road and Arrow Highway, has been created to permit
light manufacturing, processing, assembly, warehousing, and related activities plus ancillary administrative
                                                       A-IX

offices. For economic development purposes, the Land Use Plan is comprised of what is believed to be,
for a suburban community, a relatively large percentage of commercial and industrial land (over 12% for
the Planning Area). Nevertheless, Covina is envisioned to remain a primarily residential city.
Despite the fact that, as stated above, the Land Use Plan is based heavily on previously existing conditions,
in order to ensure goal and objective realization and to best meet community needs and desires, minor
changes in land use allocations and development intensity standards have been made. For example, the
“Medium” and “High” density limits have been reduced. Considering existing City boundaries, the Plan
calls for theoretical dwelling unit and household population counts of, respectively, 17,905 units (11.8%
increase over 1992 figure) and 49,149 persons (a rise of 14.7%). But typically, actual build-out numbers
are 80% of theoretical capacity. Notwithstanding this fact, the Covina Land Use Plan’s land use hierarchy
and development intensity framework underscore the community’s commitment to moderate growth and
revitalization/redevelopment for above-noted reasons like economic development, housing accommodation,
and image and appearance enhancement.
Covina’s land use proposal is described on two maps, a primary land use and circulation route diagram,
which is comprised of the previously noted land use-related facts, and a map that shows the location of
public facilities, such as City Hall, the local library, and fire stations. The City believes that separating
public facilities from the primary Land Use Map clarifies the overall land use strategy and related policies.
Basically, the Map shows all existing resources. In accordance with established objectives and policies,
new facilities are not indicated but are to be considered as future growth occurs and as circumstances
would strongly warrant consideration thereof. This approach is particularly applicable to schools, parks,
and public safety.
Land Use Element programs/implementation measures are important because, as again stated above, they
supplement as well as ensure the realization of the goal, objectives, policies, and Land Use Plan. The
programs thus serve as a key implementation mechanism. Several programs are presented, some of which
currently exist and others that would commence upon Land Use Element adoption. The programs are
divided into the following three areas:
         1.       Codes, standards, and plans.
         2.       Procedural matters.
         3.       General administration.
Within the above framework, a variety of land use programs are presented. For example, existing, important
measures, such as Zoning, Design Guidelines, Subdivision Ordinance, and Capital Improvement Program,
Code Enforcement, and (development application) Site Plan Review, are to be continued and, where
necessary, revised to achieve consistency with the updated General Plan. The City’s Planned Community
Development (PCD) process, which facilitates all types of development to best reach community goals
and objectives, is to be maintained and sanctioned as well. In addition, many new measures are proposed
to better address Covina’s land use and development needs. These programs generally build upon the
above-noted policy foundation and include such measures as allowing building intensity to be increased
beyond the basic limits if the project affords the City with major benefits; promoting the maintenance and
expansion of commercial and industrial areas for economic development purposes; studying future
development projects and trends to ensure overall community service and infrastructure adequacy; exploring
potential positive impacts from the Metrolink Commuter Train Station; and establishing a framework for
reviewing and revising the General Plan.
As previously mentioned, the Land Use Element concludes with sections discussing the relation of the
Land Use Element to and consistency with other General Plan chapters, citizen participation in Land Use
Element formation, and monitoring Land Use Element implementation. Relating to the first chapter, as
required by State law, the Land Use Element has been prepared in a manner consistent with all other
                                                      A-X

General Plan sections. For example, the land use and development framework, population and housing
unit build-out projections, and goal, objectives, policies, and programs employed here reflect and conform
to the circulation and transportation systems of the Circulation Element and the housing construction-
and preservation-related provisions of the Housing Element. Furthermore, because the City has updated
all General Plan components simultaneously, one common data and information foundation, based on the
same community input and data and analysis activities, has been used for the entire project. This has
ensured inter-Element goal, objective, policy, and program consistency and therefore will greatly assist in
overall General Plan implementation as well.
Moreover, in the Land Use Element update process, local governments must conduct citizen participation
activities to ensure that the views of all residents are addressed and considered. The City has complied
with this requirement through developing and distributing questionnaires, conducting public forums,
preparing a cable television commercial on the General Plan update and forums, creating and distributing
update flyers and handouts, and publishing press releases and articles in various newspapers and City
brochures. Other more general measures/activities have been employed as well. Also, the community
received numerous comments from representatives of other public or quasi-public agencies, such as school
districts, utility companies, regional agencies, and adjacent municipalities as well as local civic
organizations. All public comments elicited through the various citizen participation measures have been
carefully studied by the City and incorporated into the body of data and information that was used in
identifying and discussing issues and, therefore, in developing the applicable goal, objectives, policies,
and programs/implementation measures.
In addition, again in accordance with State planning law, the City will monitor all major aspects of Land
Use Element implementation to verify continual inter-Element consistency and to ensure that the policies
and programs of the Land Use chapter are carried out effectively and that needs are adequately addressed
so that the desired Element goal and objectives are met. Monitoring is to be handled through providing
annual reports to the Planning Commission and City Council and through related actions. Any identified
problems, deficiencies, or underutilized policies or programs will be carefully studied and appropriately
handled. Because Land Use is the central General Plan chapter, monitoring in this area is particularly
important.

I. INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND
   Land Use is the central General Plan Element. The Land Use component correlates Land Use and
   related issues among all Elements and is the most frequently referenced General Plan section.
   The backbone of the Land Use Element is a Land Use Plan, comprised of a map and accompanying
   explanatory text, that must show and define the proposed or long-term general distribution/location
   and development intensity of residential, commercial, industrial, and other uses. Also, parks and
   open space, schools, public buildings, (any) waste disposal facilities, and areas subject to flooding
   have to be shown as well. “Development intensity” refers to two types of building concentration
   standards applicable to residential and nonresidential structures. Regarding residential buildings,
   intensity means the correlation of the number of dwelling units for each acre of land and the
   average number of persons for every dwelling unit (for each density subcategory of a particular
   Land Use classification hierarchy, such as “low” and “medium”); commercial and industrial
   intensities refer to floor area ratio (the ratio of building floor area to total site area).
   The Land Use Plan itself is based on and implements the related goal and the objectives and
   policies. By illustrating where and to what extent various uses will be distributed around the
   community, the Land Use Element, therefore, serves as the foundation of the community’s General
   Plan program and building standards, as the chief land use policy tool, and as a blueprint for
   future physical development. The Element also functions as the primary vehicle for addressing
   applicable State and regional land use- and development-related statutes, goals, and policies. In
   other words, the Land Use component serves as a basis for local decision-making and actions on
   all growth and revitalization matters.
   When defining the function of the General Plan Land Use Element, it is important to describe the
   relation between the Element and the Zoning Ordinance. General Plan Land Use designations, as
   stated above, are oriented toward the future, while Zoning classifications indicate current use and
   intensity standards. Zoning provides a basis for day-to-day Land Use decisions and implements
   the General Plan by enabling the Plan’s goals, objectives, and policies to be realized. For any
   property in a jurisdiction, General Plan and Zoning designations (again, such as “residential” or
   “open space”) typically must be consistent, variations being allowed only when explained/justified
   in the plan text, though the number of General Plan and Zoning use categories need not be identical.
   Although parcel-specific designations for both maps must be identifiable, in cases such as the
   location of a proposed/future public facility, the plan may show the facility’s general location
   only.
   Considering the fact that the Land Use Element serves as a framework for objectives, policies,
   and standards in all required General Plan topical chapters or Elements, Land Use contents and
   policy direction are related to Circulation, Housing, and the three other mandatory Elements
   (Natural Resources and Open Space, Noise, and Safety). Land Use is, however, most closely
   intertwined with the Circulation, Housing, and Safety chapters. There is a close tie to Circulation
   because a plan’s street network and related components must be consistent with and support the
   proposed Land Use development scenario. In relation to Housing, the Land Use Element establishes
   the residential use categories and development intensities that serve as the foundation for the
   Housing Element and its State-required, ambitious housing program (refer to the Housing Element
   and accompanying Housing Study for clarification). Moreover, the Land Use Element is related
   to the Safety Element in that the former must identify flood-prone areas, which is an important
   consideration and expanded upon in the latter chapter.
   Much of the Land Use-related background information and facts and analysis of data for this
   Element appear in the Land Use Study, an all-inclusive compilation of Covina’s existing Land
   Use and development resources, characteristics, and issues. Though separate, the Study is legally
   part of the Land Use Element process. Most topics in this Element are referenced and detailed in
   the Study, a format that eliminates redundancies and facilitates Land Use Element implementation
                                                  A-1

by emphasizing and clarifying goals, objectives, policies, the Land Use Plan, and programs/
implementation measures, the most important components. In other words, the two-document
structure allows for this Element to focus on policy orientations and program directives, key
portions that could be obscured if interspersed with too much background data and analysis. It is
believed that this organization best addresses State and regional Land Use and development statutes,
goals, and policies and local conditions and desires.
The entire contents of the Land Use Element are based on State planning law requirements (Section
65302(a) of the California Government Code) and the California Office of Planning and Research
(OPR) General Plan Guidelines, an advisory document on General Plan preparation. Under law,
the State establishes the overall data and analysis requirements, while allowing local governments
to address their land use and development issues in a manner tailored to local conditions and
circumstances. The Covina Land Use Element has therefore been prepared and, as previously
stated, organized in a manner that the City feels is most appropriate and logical and best suited
for carrying out planning activities.
The Covina Land Use Element is divided into eight chapters. Following this Background chapter,
the second section presents an overview of Covina’s existing land use issues, with a great deal of
reference made to the underlying Study. The third area details the Land Use Element’s primary
goal and related objectives and policies, which, as implied above, bridge the gap between where
the City is and what type of community it wishes to become. Section number four describes the
Land Use Plan, which, again, serves as the foundation for this Element. The fifth chapter presents
the programs/implementation measures, a key area that supplements and ensures fruition of the
goal, objectives, policies, and Land Use Plan. Programs, like general policies and the Land Use
Plan, thus guide planning and development decisions and actions. Sections six, seven, and eight
conclude the Land Use Element by discussing, respectively, the relation to and consistency with
other General Plan chapters, citizen participation in Element formation, and monitoring Land Use
Element implementation.
Covina (population 46,452, 1997 estimate) is a mature, suburban community located in the eastern
portion of the San Gabriel Valley, approximately twenty-three miles east of downtown Los Angeles.
The City is characterized by predominantly low rise/low intensity residential, commercial, and
light manufacturing uses. For a suburban city, Covina has a relatively high percentage of
commercial and industrial areas, which indicates a strong, diversified, economic base. Although
the community is almost entirely built-out, future development is expected to occur on remaining
vacant as well as on underutilized properties. Covina is generally flat, though has a hilly enclave
in the southeastern area (Covina Hills), and contains a historic downtown that is a key social and
economic center of the community. The Covina General Plan covers a ten square mile Planning
Area, which includes seven square miles of incorporated territory and a three square mile Sphere
of Influence/unincorporated area (designated for eventual Covina annexation). Refer to Section
“A” of the Land Use Study for more information on location, character, and the Covina Planning
Area.

II. OVERVIEW OF KEY EXISTING LAND USE ISSUES
A.  General
    This chapter lists the key Covina land use issues, which have been expanded on from Section “K”
    of the background Land Use Study. All issues have been ascertained by the City, based on Covina’s
    overall land use-related facts, trends, characteristics, and citizen input, and are important because
    they clarify key land use matters warranting attention. Issues also form the basis for the below-
    described goal, objectives, policies, the Land Use Plan, and programs/implementation measures.
    Refer to the Land Use Study for clarification on these issues and needs and for underlying data
    and information. (In addition, see the Housing Study and accompanying Element for an expanded
    listing on matters relating to housing.)
B.  Key Existing Land Use Issues
    The land use issues are presented within the following five-topic framework:
1.  The Type and Amount of Future Development and Redevelopment Activities.
2.  Land Use Categories, Quantities, Standards, Distribution, and Compatibility.
3.  Community Image and Appearance.
4.  Economic and Social Conditions.
5.  The Provision of Public Facilities and Services.
    For each topic, the issues are listed in no particular order. It should also be noted that the issues
    and associated topics are not mutually exclusive.
1.  The Type and Amount of Future Development and Redevelopment Activities.
a.  Accommodating growth and revitalization that is consistent with established land use patterns,
    revised General Plan and Zoning intensity and development standards and policies, and applicable
    provisions of any other City plans and that respect local and regional physical, infrastructure,
    service, and environmental constraints.
b.  Maintaining and/or accommodating the expansion of existing and accommodating new commercial
    and industrial businesses as a high priority for reasons pertaining to employment, sales tax
    generation, and related economic development benefits and City image enhancement.
c.  Encouraging the capturing of a greater variety of retail stores, shops, and restaurants to attract
    more patrons, generate more sales tax, and further improve the community’s image.
d.  Balancing the City’s obligation to provide more housing, within a policy and program framework
    that meets the intent of the regional “housing needs” accommodation process, with Covina’s need
    to maintain and bolster local economic development efforts in terms of attaining as high a jobs-
    to-housing ratio as feasible and as great a retail sales generation amount as possible.
e.  Paying particular attention to the special needs and character of the downtown through continuing
    ongoing revitalization activities, attaining a greater variety of retail businesses, establishing better
    links to the recently-opened Metrolink Commuter Train Station, and promoting mixed use

III. GOAL, OBJECTIVES, AND POLICIES
A.   General
     As stated in the Introduction above, the land use goal and the objectives and policies of this key
     General Plan chapter are particularly important because, along with the below-presented Land
     Use Plan and programs/implementation measures, they serve a central direction-setting function
     concerning and as the chief tools with respect to evaluating and making decisions and conducting
     actions on all land use and development matters. The goal, objectives, and policies, again as
     previously indicated, are based on the community’s key land use issues (listed in the previous
     chapter) and on a detailed description and assessment of Covina’s land use features and conditions
     (presented in the accompanying Land Use Study), which were both identified by City staff and
     ascertained through public comment. In theory, then, the three terms (as well as the Land Use
     Plan and programs/implementation measures) bridge the gap between where the community is
     and what type of city it wishes to become.
     A goal is defined as a general expression of an ideal future condition or state toward which the
     community wishes to advance. An objective, on the other hand, is similar to a goal but more
     specific in focus. Several objectives generally “branch off” or clarify the state or direction to
     which the goal leads. Lastly, a policy is a statement that is based on one or more objectives and
     most directly guides decision-making and actions. In order for policies to be meaningful and
     useful, they must be clear and unambiguous, a guideline that this Element has followed. Policies
     should also indicate local government commitment. Therefore, all below policies are listed within
     the context of “The City shall . . .” and are worded in plain English.
B.   Goal, Objectives, and Policies
     In applying the three terms to Covina, one goal and five objectives, covering various areas
     pertaining to land use, are utilized as the overall framework. Each objective is expanded upon
     with several policies. The goal is:
              A physical environment that provides for the housing, employment, business, service,
              recreational, social, educational, cultural, and entertainment needs of and maintains and
              enhances a high quality of life for its residents.
     The remainder of this chapter is devoted to the objectives and policies, which, it should be noted,
     are listed in no particular order. The five land use objectives are:
     1.       A climate where moderate residential, commercial, and industrial development and
              redevelopment are accommodated.
     2.       An adequate amount and distribution of and compatibility of adjacent land uses throughout
              the community.
     3.       A community that is attractive and maintains a good image and small-town atmosphere.
     4.       Economic and social vitality in all areas of the community.
     5.       The provision of sufficient public facilities and services.
     The objectives are not mutually exclusive, and, therefore, several policies from different groupings
     are similar or identical. This is particularly common pertaining to the first two objectives, which
     are closely intertwined. Areas “A” and “B” also are divided according to residential, commercial,
                                                  A-9

   and industrial uses to facilitate implementation. It should be stated that the goal, objectives, and
   policies are applied on a citywide basis, unless expressly stated otherwise.
C. Objective 1
   A climate where moderate residential, commercial, and industrial development and
   redevelopment are accommodated.
1. General Land Use
a. Policies
   The City shall:
1) Ensure that the type, location, and intensity of all new and intensified developments adhere to the
   requirements and standards specified for their particular land use categories and the rest of the
   General Plan, Zoning, plus any other applicable plans or programs, except where community goals,
   objectives, and policies are best furthered.
2) Ensure that major land use change proposals, particularly those regarding vacated schools, utility
   sites, and other institutional surplus properties, carefully consider many factors, including, but
   not limited to:
a) Land use impacts, on both neighborhood and citywide levels.
b) Street capacity, public facilities, and other infrastructure impacts.
c) Effects on the local circulation, public transportation, and regional circulation/transportation
   networks.
d) The local economy.
e) The provision of services and utilities.
f) All relevant environmental and physical constraints and resources.
g) Covina’s image and character.
h) The quality of life for Covina residents, workers, shoppers, and others.
3) Regard the maintenance and, where appropriate, expansion of commercial and industrial uses as a
   high priority for reasons pertaining to employment, sales tax generation, and related economic
   development spillover effects.
4) Accommodate growth that adequately serves existing and future residents, workers, shoppers,
   and others while protecting their health, safety, and welfare.
5) Accommodate growth that is consistent with current general land use patterns, that maintains
   existing relative land use quantities, and that respects physical and environmental resources and
   constraints.
6) Facilitate, through Zoning provisions and applicable procedures, infill development, development
   of now-underutilized or vacant parcels, and, where necessary, redevelopment of deteriorating
                                                A-10

    properties, particularly for housing creation and rehabilitation and economic development purposes.
7)  Require that new or expanded commercial, industrial, and medium- to high-density residential
    projects, when adjacent to single-family residences, hospitals, nursing homes, schools, day care
    centers, and other sensitive uses, incorporate sufficient physical and visual buffers to ensure
    compatibility. Such buffers shall include, but not be limited to, building setback and architecture,
    landscaping, walls, and other physical and aesthetic elements and shall adequately protect the
    single family residences or sensitive uses from noise, light, trash, vehicular traffic, and other
    visual and environmental disturbances.
8)  Discourage illogical, conflicting, or peculiar land use arrangements or land use configurations or
    uses that could lead to blight and deterioration or induce unlawful or criminal activity, and
    discourage the excessive continuation of “major” nonconforming uses.
9)  Provide for the continuation of existing and development of new or expanded public streets and
    facilities, storm drains and other infrastructure, parking amenities, and utilities to support the
    City’s land uses and meet all needs.
10) Preserve the predominantly low-rise, low- to medium-intensity character of Covina’s residential
    neighborhoods and commercial and industrial districts.
11) Regard the preservation of and protection of single-family detached areas as a high priority.
12) Preserve all existing parks and open space from conversion to other uses and from incompatible
    encroachments.
13) Be receptive to special residential, commercial, or industrial development applications that would
    add to the community’s vitality by providing a particular type of needed housing, a well-recognized
    business or store, or a high sales-tax generating or job-providing operation.
14) Require that future growth, infill, and revitalization activities be consistent with City-adopted
    positions, policies, and programs regarding regional planning and growth management matters—
    such as air quality attainment, recycling, hazardous waste management, trip reduction, congestion
    management, stormwater runoff, water quality, housing, transportation, and circulation.
15) Monitor land use, traffic, and circulation pressures associated with the Metrolink Commuter Train
    Station near the downtown and best capitalize on potentially beneficial impacts by adopting
    strategies such as an “urban village” or livable cities concept, incorporating mixed uses (like
    residential on top of commercial), sufficient businesses, and attractive and functional public and
    private improvements.
16) Understand and address future land use intensification pressures resulting from population growth,
    increasing property values, increasing foreign investment, market demand, changing consumer
    habits, and other factors.
17) Maintain consistency between the Land Use Element and implementation mechanisms including,
    but not limited to, the Zoning and Subdivision Ordinances, the Design Guidelines, and the Capital
    Improvement Program.
18) Study and comment on major developments in adjacent jurisdictions and in the County that could
    generate land use pressures, traffic increases, and other impacts in Covina. Where feasible and
    reasonable, Covina should encourage General Plan consistency with the portions of adjoining
    jurisdictions that abut the City’s Planning Area.
                                                 A-11

19) Whenever possible, promote annexations on a planned rather than piecemeal basis by encouraging
    the filing of multi-property annexation requests. Action should be taken when appropriate General
    Plan Amendments, prezoning, and environmental review have been performed.
20) Encourage LAFCO to adjust Sphere of Influence lines when natural landforms, transportation
    routes, and/or locational factors make Covina an appropriate provider of public services for any
    non-Sphere area.
21) Enforce all Zoning, Design Guidelines, and related City Code provisions and Code Enforcement
    procedures and practices, except where community goals, objectives, and policies are best furthered,
    to maintain individual health, safety, and welfare.
22) Capture all potential benefits resulting from the Metrolink Commuter Train Station, downtown
    revitalization, Azusa Avenue beautification, and other major programs/efforts.
23) Identify and encourage the retention and preservation of significant architectural, historical, and/
    or cultural resources, such as the Adams Park residential neighborhood (just west of Covina Park).
24) Balance the City’s obligation to provide more housing with the need to maintain and bolster local
    economic development efforts in terms of attaining as high a jobs-to-housing ratio as feasible and
    as great a retail sales tax generation amount as possible.
25) Utilize Zoning’s Planned Community Development (PCD) process (which allows for development
    standard modifications if certain conditions are met) as a vehicle for attaining spatially compatible,
    attractive, functional, and innovative projects, thus facilitating residential and non-residential
    development and General Plan implementation.
26) Continue requiring developers to mitigate development impacts in the form of street improvements
    and public dedications as well as other reasonable requirements.
27) Address its park/open space deficiency and attempt to mitigate the problem to the greatest extent
    possible.
28) Evaluate the potential land use impacts of any newly identified sensitive environmental or geologic
    resources, particularly new earthquake faults or areas subject to flooding.
29) Observe the requirements imposed by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) when
    reviewing any public or private proposals, including, but not limited to, infrastructure changes or
    the development, redevelopment, modification, or expansion/remodeling of properties, to address
    all applicable potential land use and related impacts.
2.  Residential
a.  Policies
    The City shall:
1)  Permit development at density ranges and quantities that reflect existing and desired scales of
    building construction and revitalization in the community, as well as physical and environmental
    constraints, that address the intent of regional housing obligations, that will allow for moderate
    future growth, and that will not inhibit the City’s ability to meet street capacities and to provide
    other infrastructure, adequate community services, and utilities.
2)  Develop, based on #1 above, maximum future net densities as follows: low, 6.0 dwelling units
    per acre; medium, 14.0 dwelling units per acre; and high, 22.0 dwelling units per acre. (Net

    streets.) The above standards shall be followed, except where community goals, objectives, and
    policies are best furthered.
3)  Accommodate various new and rehabilitated housing types, such as single-family detached houses,
    apartments, and condominiums/townhouses, for a variety of existing and future economic segments,
    including lower and moderate income households, at quantities that address the intent of State
    and regional/SCAG housing statutes and policies as well as meet Covina Redevelopment Agency
    affordable housing targets and that do not adversely affect the integrity of established residential
    areas.
4)  Preserve the predominantly low-rise, low- to medium-density character of Covina’s neighborhoods.
5)  Protect, to the greatest extent possible, single-family detached neighborhoods from incompatible
    encroachments.
6)  Ensure that the overall amount, locations, and timing of development reflect community desires
    and needs as well as physical and environmental constraints and will not inhibit the City’s ability
    to meet street capacities and to provide other infrastructure, utilities, and adequate community
    services.
7)  Preserve the very low density character and sensitive environmental resources of Covina Hills by
    minimizing future grading, limiting development around Walnut Creek, maintaining large-lot,
    low density residential as the primary permitted use type, and following the City’s hillside and
    related standards and provisions.
8)  Encourage the construction of owner-occupied housing.
9)  Encourage that medium- to high-density complexes be developed in appropriately designated areas
    and replace old, deteriorating residential structures.
10) Whenever possible, encourage lot consolidation for apartment, condominium, and townhouse
    parcels, particularly substandard properties, as a means of facilitating Zoning and Design
    Guidelines compliance.
11) Permit only single-family detached residences to be developed on large, underutilized single-
    family or “R-1”-designated parcels, in single-family detached neighborhoods, to ensure land use
    compatibility.
12) Permit second units or “granny flats” on single-family lots and State-defined density bonuses and
    projects built with the City-defined “two for one” dwelling unit provision on medium- and high-
    density parcels as a vehicle for enhancing the supply of affordable housing.
13) Accommodate in single-family neighborhoods small child care centers, small group homes, and
    other uses that are mandated by the State and required to address changing social and societal
    needs.
14) Require, except where community goals, objectives, and policies are best furthered, that both new
    and remodeled residential developments comply with Zoning and other standards, incorporate
    adequate amenities, and achieve a high level of architectural and site design quality to ensure a
    high quality of life for local residents and to ensure long-term building maintenance and viability.
15) Encourage that residential developments incorporate areas or facilities to accommodate State-
    and regional agency-mandated environmental programs, including, but not limited to, on-site
                                                  A-13

    storage areas for collecting recyclable materials and telecommuting rooms.

3.  Commercial and Industrial
a.  Policies
    The City shall:
1)  Permit development at intensity ranges, site locations, and quantities that reflect existing and
    desired scales of building construction and revitalization in the community, as well as physical
    and environmental constraints, that will allow for moderate future growth, and that will not inhibit
    the City’s ability to meet street capacities and to provide other infrastructure, adequate community
    services, and utilities.
2)  Develop, based on #1 above, maximum future net intensities (floor area ratios) as follows: general
    commercial, 1.5; town center (downtown area), 2.5; and industrial, 2.0. (Net intensity means
    private property after any right-of-way dedication, or exclusive of sidewalks and streets.) The
    above standards shall be followed, except where community goals, objectives, and policies are
    best furthered.
3)  Preserve the predominantly low-rise, low- to medium-intensity character of Covina’s commercial
    and industrial districts and corridors.
4)  Maintain its variety of functional commercial office, retail, and service businesses for reasons

    from potentially adverse impacts associated with industrial operations.
7)  Accommodate new and expanded commercial and industrial developments, for community
    economic betterment and image enhancement and related reasons, in a fashion that neither adversely
    affects the integrity of established commercial and/or industrial areas nor unreasonably encroaches
    into residential neighborhoods and that does not impose an undue burden on local infrastructure
    or services.
                                                  A-14

8)  Accommodate new and expanded commercial and industrial developments in a manner that considers
    various Federal, State, and/or regional planning measures to reduce traffic congestion, air pollution,
    waste generation, polluted water runoff, and other problems.
9)  Ensure that the overall amount, locations, and timing of development reflect community desires and
    needs as well as physical and environmental constraints and will not inhibit the City’s ability to meet
    street capacities and to provide other infrastructure, utilities, and adequate community services.
10) Pay particular attention to the special needs and character of the downtown, continue appropriate
    economic revitalization, physical enhancement, and use refinement activities that will attain a greater
    variety of retail businesses, attract more people, and generate more sales tax and overall vitality, and
    consider incorporating mixed uses within an “urban village” or livable cities concept, including residential
    on top of commercial, to bolster social and economic activity, to best exploit Metrolink Commuter
    Train Station proximity, to provide needed housing, and to reduce vehicular trips.
11) Accommodate new or expanded institutional uses, such as hospitals, medical clinics, nursing homes,
    congregate care facilities, and churches, to meet existing and future needs, providing compatibility
    with adjacent land uses can be achieved.
12) Maintain new and expanded commercial and industrial uses at areas where they now exist, which are
    along and around major streets, at larger intersections, in appropriate “pockets,” and in particular
    complexes.
13) Encourage the capturing of a greater variety of retail businesses, including stores, shops, and restaurants,
    so as to attract more patrons, generate more sales tax, and improve the community’s image.
14) Whenever possible, encourage lot consolidation, particularly regarding substandard properties, as a
    means of facilitating Zoning and Design Guidelines compliance.
15) Require that new and remodeled/expanded commercial and industrial structures comply with Zoning,
    Design Guidelines, and other standards and incorporate adequate amenities that contribute to a high
    quality of life for workers and patrons, except in appropriate cases, such as PCD (Planned Community
    Development) overlay district application, where community goals, objectives, and policies are best
    furthered.
16) Ensure that all commercial and industrial properties are physically, functionally, and aesthetically
    maintained, and, if necessary, rehabilitated through the City’s proposed Neighborhood Preservation or
    other ongoing programs.

    are ample in terms of quantity and location, and, where feasible and practical, accessible to the
    general public.
6)  Ensure that school sites and educational facilities are adequate in number, type, and location for
    existing and future populations.
7)  When feasible, cooperate with owners of schools, utility facilities, governmental agency properties,
    and other uses that are outside of City land use control and monitor their major redevelopment
    activities.
8)  Ensure that hazardous waste and similar facilities are located in appropriate industrial areas and
    operated in a manner that maximizes public safety.
 D. Objective 2
    An adequate amount and distribution of and compatibility of adjacent land uses throughout
    the community.
1.  General Land Use
a.  Policies
    The City shall:
1)  Ensure that all developments adhere to the requirements and standards specified for their particular
    land use categories and the rest of the General Plan plus any other applicable plans or programs,
    except where community goals, objectives, and policies are best furthered.
2)  Maintain the general amount, distribution, and intensity of residential, commercial, and industrial
    uses so as to adequately serve existing and future residents, workers, shoppers, and others.
3)  Regard the maintenance and, where appropriate, expansion of commercial and industrial uses as a
    high priority for reasons pertaining to employment, sales tax generation, and related economic
    development spillover effects, as well as community image enhancement.
4)  Maintain an adequate amount of and distribution of public and quasi-public facilities.
5)  Ensure that major land use change proposals, particularly those regarding vacated schools, utility
    sites, and other institutional surplus properties, carefully consider many factors, including, but
    not limited to:
a)  Land use impacts, on both neighborhood and citywide levels.
                                               A-16

g)  Covina’s image and character.
h)  The quality of life for Covina residents, workers, shoppers, and others.
6)  Require that parcels developed for commercial or industrial uses, when abutting residential
    properties, incorporate buffers that adequately protect the residential properties from noise, light,
    trash, visual and environmental disturbances, vehicular traffic, and other factors. Such buffers
    shall include, but are not limited to, building setback and architecture, landscaping, walls, and
    other physical and aesthetic features.
7)  Provide for the continuation of existing and development of new or expanded public streets and
    facilities, storm drains and other infrastructure, parking amenities, and utilities to support the
    City’s land uses and meet all needs.
8)  Monitor land use, traffic, and circulation pressures associated with the Metrolink Commuter Train
    Station in and near the downtown and best capitalize on potentially beneficial impacts by adopting
    strategies such as an “urban village” or livable cities concept, incorporating mixed uses (like
    residential on top of commercial), sufficient businesses, and attractive and functional public and
    private improvements.
9)  Discourage illogical or peculiar land use arrangements or land use configurations that could lead
    to blight or physical and/or visual conflicts or that could induce unlawful or criminal activity.
10) Achieve General Plan and Zoning Ordinance consistency in all areas and make properties
    nonconforming, as necessary.
11) Where necessary and/or appropriate, consider abatement of Zoning Ordinance-defined major or
    “detrimental” nonconforming residential properties (i.e., those that generally are in established
    industrial or commercial areas) to promote land use compatibility, physical betterment, and/or
    economic development, and maintain or improve those Zoning Ordinance-defined minor or
    “nondetrimental” nonconforming residential properties (i.e., those that generally are in established
    residential areas) to preserve affordable housing units.
12) As a means of facilitating General Plan implementation, eliminate the application of two land use
    and zoning designations on single parcels, such as along East San Bernardino Road.
13) Permit mixed uses (residential and commercial) in appropriate areas in the downtown and, if
    possible, elsewhere, in a manner consistent with special, applicable standards, to provide needed
    housing in an alternative setting and to complement districtwide physical and economic
    revitalization activities.
14) Where feasible, encourage annexations as a means of potentially mitigating land use conflicts,
    preferably on a multi-lot or comprehensive, as opposed to piecemeal, basis.
                                                A-17

    and welfare.
19) Revise the Covina Zoning Ordinance, Design Guidelines, and related implementation tools to
    reflect General Plan changes, to make uses nonconforming, as necessary, and to amortize and/or
    reclassify all existing “major” nonconforming uses and signs.
20) Designate appropriate areas to accommodate miscellaneous State-mandated facilities, such as
    hazardous waste disposal sites and homeless shelters.
21) Be receptive to special residential, commercial, or industrial development applications that would
    add to the community’s vitality by providing a particular type of needed housing, a well-recognized
    business or store, or a high sales-tax generating or job-providing operation.
22) Evaluate the potential land use impacts of any newly identified sensitive environmental or geologic
    resources, particularly new earthquake faults or areas subject to flooding.
23) Observe the requirements imposed by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) when
    reviewing any public or private proposals, including, but not limited to, infrastructure changes or
    the development, redevelopment, modification, or expansion/remodeling of properties, to address
    all applicable potential land use and related impacts.
 2. Residential
 a. Policies

     to land uses within close proximity to electric transmission lines/transformers.
 16) Permit only single-family detached residences to be developed on large, underutilized single-
     family or “R-1”-designated parcels, in single-family detached neighborhoods, to ensure land use
     compatibility.
 17) Adopt and implement density ranges that reflect existing and desired scales of development in the
     community, that allow for moderate future growth, that address the intent of regional housing
     obligations, and that will not inhibit the City’s ability to meet street capacities and to provide
     other infrastructure, utilities, and adequate community services.
 18) Develop, based on #17 above, maximum future net residential densities as follows: low, 6.0
     dwelling units per net acre; medium, 14.0 dwelling units per net acre; and high, 22.0 dwelling
     units per net acre. (Net density means private property after any right-of-way dedication, or

r.  Consider to develop and implement a tree preservation ordinance to maintain locally-determined significant
    public and private trees.
s.  Work with regional and other transportation officials and local residents to screen the commuter railroad
    right-of-way from residential neighborhoods with decorative sound walls. Such walls should also
    accommodate appropriate landscaping to discourage graffiti and, therefore, project a good community image
    to passengers on trains.
t.  Recognize that unincorporated areas do play a role in the City of Covina’s overall appearance and image
    and, therefore, where appropriate and feasible, encourage annexations to be filed on a “comprehensive,” as
    opposed to piecemeal, basis as a means of controlling and/or abating unsightly neighborhood conditions.
u.  Attempt to preserve structures, resources, areas, blocks, and/or streets that are of local historic and/or
    architectural significance, such as the Adams Park residential district (just west of Covina Park).

w.  Preserve existing parklands and open space resources and consider to develop additional parks of all types
    and sizes at various areas.
x.  Oppose or, at a minimum, take appropriate action on uses in abutting jurisdictions that could impose land
    use, traffic, or other incursions and/or adversely affect Covina’s appearance, image, and/or character.
y.  Utilize the Zoning Ordinance’s Planned Community Development (PCD) process (which allows for
    development standard modifications if certain conditions are met) as a vehicle for getting attractive, functional,
    compatible, and innovative projects, thus facilitating residential and nonresidential development and General
    Plan implementation.
z.  Preserve the sensitive environmental resources and the rural, low-density character of the Covina Hills area
    by minimizing grading, limiting development around Walnut Creek, and maintaining the large-lot residential
    and other Zoning requirements for the area, including hillside and related standards.

                                                     A-23

    met.
hh. When dealing with code enforcement matters, attempt to abate first the most serious violations or those
    nuisances that constitute the greatest threat to public health, safety, and welfare.
ii. Develop a downtown area “urban village” or livable cities concept, which would be based on mixed uses in
    an attractive, spirited, and functional arrangement, to best complement existing revitalization activities in
    the district, to capture positive spillover Metrolink Commuter Train Station benefits, to provide more medium-
    and/or high-density housing, and to reduce vehicular trips.
jj. Where necessary and/or appropriate, consider abatement of Zoning Ordinance-defined major or “detrimental”
    nonconforming residential properties (i.e., those that generally are in established industrial or commercial
    areas) to promote land use compatibility, physical betterment, and/or economic development, and maintain
    or improve those Zoning Ordinance-defined minor or “nondetrimental” nonconforming residential properties
    (i.e., those that generally are in established residential areas) to preserve affordable housing units.
kk. Observe the requirements imposed by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) when reviewing
    any public or private proposals, including, but not limited to, infrastructure changes or the development,
    redevelopment, modification, or expansion/remodeling of properties, to address all applicable potential land
    use and related impacts.

IV. LAND USE PLAN
A.  General
    This section presents the Land Use Plan, the backbone of the Land Use Element and the entire Covina
    General Plan process. As stated in previous sections of this document and in the Land Use Study, the
    Land Use Plan, which is based on and augments the Element’s goal and objectives and policies, establishes
    land use districts and is therefore the most important and most often used General Plan component.
    The land use districts or designations, which are applied throughout the community, identify the permitted
    type of uses, building character, and extent of new development and redevelopment for any particular
    area. In other words, the Land Use Plan describes the nature and general pattern and intensity of land
    uses at build-out. According to State planning law, each land use category must list 1) development
    intensity (density for residential; floor area ratio for commercial and industrial) and 2) general permitted
    uses. Refer to the Land Use Study and to Chapters I and III herein for clarification on these terms and
    on background land use matters.
B.  Land Use Plan
    Covina’s land use proposal is described below and illustrated on two maps, a primary land use and
    circulation route diagram and a map that shows the location of public facilities, such as City Hall, the
    local library, and fire stations. (Refer to the Circulation Element for a discussion of the circulation
    network.) The City believes that separating public facilities from the primary land use map clarifies the
    overall land use strategy and related policies. (In Covina, public facilities compose a very small
    percentage of the land uses, and, therefore, including the facilities on the land use map would obscure
    land use distributions and jumble the map legend.) This approach is not intended, however, to undermine
    the importance of public facilities for the community’s long-term development. Indeed, public facility
    (as well as public service) adequacy is underscored throughout this General Plan’s goals, objectives,
    policies, and programs.
    Covina’s Land Use Plan is comprised of nine land use categories, the primary ones of which are three
    residential, two commercial, and one industrial designations. In addition, the following classifications
    have been included: school, park, and open space. Categories have been selected and applied in a
    manner that best meets existing and future local conditions, circumstances, and needs. (Refer to the
    background Land Use Study for clarification.) The respective land use category permitted uses and
    development intensities are described below and followed by a table listing both land use and population
    build-out figures. Also, see the accompanying Land Use Map for a graphic illustration of the land use
    distribution and clarification of current City/County and Planning Area boundaries. (As stated in the
    Background section above, the outlined “Study Area” in the southeastern part of the City refers to an
    area that is of community interest because of proximity to Covina and possible Covina Sphere of Influence
    incorporation in the near future. Therefore, the City believes it is reasonable to include this demarcation.)
    This Land Use Plan originally was conceived and presented in the Land Use Study as the “Moderate
    Growth Scenario,” one of three development alternatives. The other growth alternatives were the
    “Existing General Plan” and a “High Growth Scenario,” which was a derivative of the “moderate” land
    use proposal. Three scenarios had been employed to adequately meet State planning and environmental
    impact review requirements and to serve as a framework for land use discussion and analysis purposes.
    Because it was believed to best address local desires and conditions, the Moderate Growth Scenario
    was selected. (Again, refer to Land Use Study for specifics.)
                                                     A-29

Notes:
1.     Densities are: 0-6.0 (dwelling units per net acre), 6.1-14.0, and 14.1-22.0. It should be noted that all
       Low Density Residential maximum dwelling unit numbers have been adjusted to reflect the lower
       density character of Covina Hills. Specifically, maximum residential densities in this area are computed
       at two units per acre.
2.     Residential acres consist only of properties expected to be residential in future. (See text for
       clarification.)
3.     Population estimates based on State Finance Department 2.745 person per household figure.
4.     Incorporated and unincorporated boundaries based on current City and Sphere of Influence limits.
                                               A-35
   5.        The population figures are household counts only (referring to persons living in regular dwelling
             units), they not being inclusive of individuals residing in group quarters facilities. Pertaining to the
             City build-out scenario, for example, the projected group quarters population is 666. Thus, the
             actual total theoretical population projection for this area at build-out could be interpreted as 49,815.
   Thus, considering current City boundaries, the household population build-out figure is 49,149, a 13.1 percent
   increase over the 1992 municipal count. Also, a total planning area build-out of over 71,000 is projected. The
   land use percentages show that Covina will remain a community that is primarily residential in character but
   with a relatively sizable amount of commercial and industrial properties. (Refer to following section for a
   discussion on overall Land Use Plan strategy.) It must be stated that the above dwelling unit and population
   figures are theoretical capacities, created primarily for discussion and alternative plan and respective
   environmental impact comparison purposes. Actual build-out numbers, which are based on some combination
   of the extent of General Plan implementation, annexations, future social, demographic, and economic conditions,
   and future market demand and community image and vitality, cannot be predicted but typically are around 80
   percent of capacity. This means that the actual maximum housing and household population counts for the
   current City area could be interpreted as, respectively, 17,528 dwelling units (a 9.4% increase) and 48,114
   residents (a 12.3% increase). It should also be noted that the theoretical projections do not consider additional
   dwelling units that could be created through granny flats/second units, density bonuses, and the City’s special
   density computation procedure for particular lower and/or moderate income housing projects. (For clarification
   on all matters presented here, refer to Sections “C” of the Land Use Study and “E7” of the Housing Study.)
D. Land Use Plan Strategy
   The following section touches upon the rationale behind the Covina Land Use Plan distribution of uses.
   (Again, for background details and additional information, refer to the Land Use Study.) The strategy of the
   revised Land Use Plan, as with all facets of the General Plan update process, is based on a synthesis of
   resident, City Council, and Planning Commission input from various City-administered citizen participation
   measures, such as special committees and meetings, questionnaires, and public forums, which are discussed
   in Chapter VII below.
   In general, compared to the previous Land Use Plan, this Plan retains existing, established land use patterns
   and, where appropriate, makes changes to eliminate land use inconsistencies and to take advantage of future
   development opportunities. The plan preserves, for example, single-family detached as the predominant
   residential and overall use category and focuses medium to high density developments in and around the
   downtown and in already existing areas along certain major streets and in various pockets. In a few cases, the
   two higher density categories have been applied to now-low density areas or properties that would be more
   logically suited for apartment or condominium/townhouse purposes. Conversely, the apartment or condominium
   designations have been removed from existing “isolated” complexes or upper density facilities with little or
   no linkage to similar uses or to commercial properties.
   Moreover, again in response to received input and as described in the Land Use and Housing Studies, the City
   has reduced slightly the Medium and High Density limits over what was permitted in the previous General
   Plan. Nevertheless, the Plan does allow for moderate growth on remaining underutilized and vacant sites.
   The City is attempting to balance, on the one hand, its obligations to provide more housing, to respect individual
   property rights, and to comply with State and regional housing policies with, on the other hand, the need to
   maintain and bolster local economic development efforts through, for example, attaining as high a jobs-to-
   housing ratio as feasible and as great a retail sales tax generation amount as possible. (The jobs-to-housing
   ratio maximization approach is, in fact, advocated by regional and State agencies as a strategy for reducing
   long, often single-occupant, vehicle commutes, thereby mitigating air pollution, traffic congestion, lost
   individual time, and related problems.) This economic development-oriented approach has therefore also
   strongly influenced the City’s commercial and industrial land use strategies, which is discussed below. It is
                                                     A-36

   believed that the employed density limits, which can be implemented in a reasonable manner with, as detailed
   in the Land Use Study, minimal adverse impacts, best reflect existing conditions and circumstances and
   resident views, most logically complement current Zoning standards, and would best lead to desired overall
   community goals and objectives.
   Commercial and industrial areas have been designated generally where they currently prevail, such as along
   various major streets and at certain chief intersections, as illustrated on the Land Use Map and described
   above. The only modifications pertain to a few sites, totaling about thirteen acres, that have been changed
   from commercial to residential or vice versa or from commercial to industrial or vice versa. These and other
   modifications, such as the utilization of only two commercial categories, as opposed to four in the previous
   Plan, will better reflect existing and future conditions, provide the City with flexibility in making development
   and use decisions, achieve greater land use compatibility, improve the quality of life, and bolster economic
   development, thus facilitating growth in a manner that suits Covina’s needs.
   Moreover, the selected development intensity maximums or floor area ratios (1.5 for General Commercial,
   2.5 for Town Center Commercial, and 2.0 for Industrial) generally reflect existing development, though,
   again, allow for flexibility in project reviews. Regarding General Commercial, for example, the most widespread
   of the three categories, as stated in the Land Use Study, nearly all existing intensities are under 0.6. Because
   of the downtown area’s unique character, which includes many old, relatively high intensity buildings, and
   because of desired types of development thereat, a 2.5 floor area ratio standard has been included, as opposed
   to 1.5 for General Commercial. Moreover, the Industrial standard, 2.0, is reflective of the fact that these types
   of properties typically occupy more land than General Commercial because of a lower parking requirement.
   It should be noted that the previous Land Use Plan did not contain floor area ratio standards, so there is no
   basis for comparison in this regard.
   Lastly, the Plan retains the existing 24 schools, 11 parks and ball fields, and 2 open space sites. These
   facilities pervade throughout the Planning Area. The schools generally pertain to various primary and secondary
   educational facilities. The park sites, as detailed in the Land Use Study and Natural Resources and Open
   Space Element, vary in size and function from Three Oak Park, a 0.2 acre Village Oaks Office Park passive
   area oriented for nearby employees, to Wingate Park, a 16.6 acre site with softball/baseball fields and other
   amenities. Moreover, the Open Space designation has been applied to the Ben Lomond and Walnut Wash
   Spreading Grounds. The City believes that the latter three designations adequately cover essential facilities
   that support Covina’s residential, commercial, and industrial uses.
   Although no additional schools, parks, or open space resources have been designated through this General
   Plan update process, new facilities could be deemed necessary at a future date. For example, as described in
   the Land Use and Housing Studies and in the Natural Resources and Open Space Element, the City has a
   longstanding parkland deficiency that warrants attention and, accordingly, applicable policies and programs
   call for the City to consider increasing park resources and exploring concomitant funding mechanisms. Also,
   if certain demographic shifts continue, more schools may be needed. Therefore, school conditions will be
   examined as well. The City believes that additional facilities of these types should be designated on the Land
   Use Map after detailed site-specific analyses only.
E. Public Facilities
   A separate map entitled “Future Public and Quasi-Public Facilities” illustrates the location of eighteen major
   facilities that provide and will continue to contribute important, necessary services to the community. They
   are:
1. City Hall - 125 E. College Street
2. Parks and Recreation Department Headquarters (Hollenbeck Park) - 1250 N. Hollenbeck Avenue
                                                       A-37

3.  City Library - 234 N. Second Avenue
4.  Joslyn Senior Center - 815 N. Barranca Avenue
5.  City Yard - 534 N. Barranca Avenue
6.  Police Station - 444 N. Citrus Avenue
7.  Fire Station (Main) - 400 N. Citrus Avenue
8.  Fire Station (#2) - 1577 E. Cypress Street
9.  Fire Station (#3) - 807 W. Cypress Street
10. Covina Historical Society Museum - 125 E. College Street
11. United States Post Office (Federal Station) - 170 E. College Street
12. United States Post Office (Covina Main) - 545 N. Rimsdale Avenue
13. State of California Office Building - 233 N. Second Avenue
14. Inter-Community Medical Center - 210 W. San Bernardino Road
15. Magan Medical Clinic - 420 W. Rowland Street
16. Charter Oak Hospital - 1161 E. Covina Boulevard
17. Metrolink Commuter Train Station - East side of Citrus Avenue, just north of Metrolink Railroad Line. (As
    previously mentioned, the Metrolink Station is part of the Metrolink regional rail system, connecting downtown
    Los Angeles to San Bernardino County. See Circulation Element for more information.)
18. Waste Treatment Facility - location(s) not yet determined. (This was discussed in detail in Section “J” of the
    Land Use Study. Pursuant to AB 2948, the City will have to designate sites to accommodate hazardous waste
    facilities, which will be the topic of future planning and environmental studies.)
    As stated above, because Covina public facilities compose a relatively small land use percentage, it is believed
    that illustrating these facilities on a separate map best clarifies overall land use and growth strategies and
    policies. Basically, all existing resources have been retained. In land use planning, there is a strong relationship
    between public facility siting and overall, particularly residential, land use designation. Generally, long-term
    growth tends to demand greater services, which translates to showing additional public facilities on a land use
    map. In Covina, based on City planning analyses, existing facilities appear adequate in terms of location and
    resources, both for now and the immediate future. However, because this General Plan calls for moderate
    growth over the long-term planning horizon (again, a potential 12.3 percent population increase over the
    following twenty years, at build-out) and because the City will continue to annex more unincorporated land,
    additional public facilities and/or public facility resources (primarily personnel and equipment) may be needed.
    (Refer to the Land Use Study for clarification.) Therefore, as was the case with parks and schools, in accordance
    with applicable Land Use Element and Housing Element policies and programs, public facilities and related
    resources are to be monitored to identify any deficiencies and, accordingly, to address and attempt to mitigate
    potential problems.
                                                        A-38

V. PROGRAMS/IMPLEMENTATION MEASURES
   Programs supplement the goal, objectives, and policies plus the Land Use Plan and serve as a key implementation
   mechanism. In other words, as stated in the Introduction, programs ensure that the Land Use Element’s goal,
   objectives, policies, and Plan will reach fruition. For clarification on these previously-discussed items, refer to
   Chapters III (Goal, Objectives, and Policies) and IV (Land Use Plan).
   Covina Land Use Element programs/implementation measures are listed below. Some of the programs/measures
   are currently active, though many would commence upon Element adoption. Programs that are proposed are
   believed best suited and viable for the City.
   For reasons of simplicity and clarity, the programs/implementation measures are divided into three below-
   listed subject areas. Within each topical area, the programs are presented in no particular order. The measures
   are listed by description, responsible City department/division, funding source, and implementation timeframe.
   The three subject areas are:
   A.        Codes, Standards, and Plans
   B.        Procedural Matters
   C.        General Administration
A. Codes, Standards, and Plans
1. Zoning Ordinance
a. Background - Zoning is the most important and most often used implementation tool. Covina’s Zoning
   Ordinance contains specific Land Use Element-based use regulations and development standards that are
   administered to manage the type, location, design, and intensity of new and expanded buildings, to achieve
   land use compatibility, to preserve trees and other sensitive resources, to amortize, abate, and/or deal with
   “major” nonconforming uses, and to establish the procedures and guidelines by which development applications
   are reviewed and decisions are made. The City will continue adherence to all applicable use regulations and
   development and density standards and, relating to the Housing Element, will ensure that sufficient numbers
   of vacant and underutilized sites are designated to accommodate multiple-family, upper density, and/or rental
   housing so that regional housing needs obligations can be best addressed.
b. Responsible City Department - Planning Division.
c. Funding Source - City general fund and Redevelopment Agency tax increment fund (refer to General Plan
   Housing Study for clarification on Redevelopment Agency funding).
d. Implementation Timeframe - Ongoing.
2. Design Guidelines
a. Background - Covina’s Design Guidelines manual supplements the Zoning Ordinance and is also administered
   through the below-described project or Site Plan Review process. The Guidelines is comprised of various
   architecture, site design, and building materials, landscaping, parking lot, and sign standards and provisions
   that seek to enhance building appearance, function, and suitability with neighborhood activities, thereby
   furthering overall community image, appearance, quality of life, and land use compatibility goals, objectives,
   and policies.
                                                      A-39

b. Responsible City Department - Planning Division.
c. Funding Source - City general fund and Redevelopment Agency tax increment fund.
d. Implementation Timeframe - Ongoing.
3. Planned Community Development (PCD) Overlay Zone
a. Background - The PCD is a Zoning-related overlay zone that establishes a precise development plan for a
   specific site and is applied on an as-requested, project-by-project basis to all types of uses. A PCD resulting
   in assisting the City to meet the Southern California Association of Governments’ Regional Housing Needs
   Assessment that increases residential density above the General Plan maximums as set forth in the Land Use
   Element Section IV.B.1.a-c. is allowed under the General Plan. A PCD resulting in a zone change that
   increases residential density above the General Plan maximums as set forth in the Land Use Element Section
   IV.B.1a-c. is allowed under the General Plan as long as the overall growth rate is maintained citywide as
   determined by the City Council. The PCD process allows for reductions in development standards, which
   can, for example, increase housing affordability or generate economic development benefits if the proposal
   is particularly attractive, functional, and/or innovative, relates well to adjoining properties, and strongly
   furthers overall General Plan implementation.
b. Responsible City Department - Planning Division.
c. Funding Source - City general fund and Redevelopment Agency tax increment fund.
d. Implementation Timeframe - Ongoing.
4. Capital Improvement Program
a. Background - The City operates on an annually updated five-year Capital Improvement Program that funds,
   or at least states the need to pay for, various capital projects, such as street widenings and improvements,
   water main replacement, storm drain construction, or park facility enhancement, on a prioritized basis. Capital
   projects must be consistent with the General Plan. Public improvements and capital facilities further land
   use objectives and policies and therefore implement the Land Use Plan.
b. Responsible City Department - Engineering Services Department, Planning Division, and Special Projects Division.
c. Funding Source - City general fund, Redevelopment Agency tax increment fund, and Federal Community
   Development Block Grant (CDBG) monies.
d. Implementation Timeframe - Ongoing.
5. Subdivision Ordinance
a. Background - This is the City’s body of regulations that control the manner in which land is divided. Like
   Zoning, Subdivision activities and decisions must be consistent with the General Plan. Therefore, Subdivision
   Ordinance provisions do affect land use regulations and long-term growth issues. Upon General Plan adoption,
   the Subdivision Ordinance should be amended as necessary to reflect revised land use (and Zoning) objectives,
   policies, and standards.
b. Responsible City Department - Engineering Services Department and Planning Division.
c. Funding Source - City general fund and Redevelopment Agency tax increment fund.
d. Implementation Timeframe - Ongoing.
                                                    A-40

6. Chapter 11 of Municipal Code
a. Background - Chapter 11 is the Covina Municipal Code section where Engineering Services, in the Site Plan
   Review process, imposes on private developers land dedications, for street widening and other purposes, and
   street improvement requirements, such as curbs, gutters, and sidewalks and street lights. These requirements
   work toward realizing General Plan goals, objectives, and standards and thus relate to the distribution of land
   use.
b. Responsible City Department - Engineering Services Department.
c. Funding Source - City general fund.
d. Implementation Timeframe - Ongoing.
7. Building, Housing, and Related Codes
a. Background - The City will continue to enforce the Building and related structural Codes and the Housing,
   Energy, and other Codes to protect public health, safety, and welfare, thus also maintaining and improving
   community appearance, image, and vitality. All of this relates to land use.
b. Responsible City Department - Building and Safety Division, Fire and Police Departments, and any other
   applicable departments.
c. Funding Source - City general fund and any other sources.
d. Implementation Timeframe - Ongoing.
8. Redevelopment Agency Plans
a. Background - The Covina Redevelopment Agency (CRA) administers several revitalization projects that
   collectively form an overall Redevelopment Plan. The project areas, which are comprised of various non-
   contiguous, residential-, commercial-, and industrial-designated properties and districts, seek to eliminate
   blight, improve local economic opportunities (e.g., sales tax generation and job creation), and enhance
   community image by remodeling existing deteriorating properties, erecting new buildings, and/or constructing
   infrastructure improvements. This is done through various financing mechanisms and/or agreements with
   private developers. One of the most ambitious efforts has been in the downtown, where major street
   improvements have been constructed and a storefront facade enhancement program has been in operation.
   Other major redevelopment activities pertain to expanding the City’s automobile sales district and attracting
   more nationally recognized retailers along Azusa Avenue. The Redevelopment Agency, through a special
   housing fund, also administers several viable local housing programs, which seek to preserve existing and
   create new lower and moderate income housing opportunities. (See Program “A-10” below for clarification.)
   Thus, Redevelopment activities, which target areas/properties for physical and economic betterment, affect
   the type, character, and intensity of land use and bolster community image and economic and social stability.
b. Responsible City Department - Redevelopment Agency and, when applicable, Planning Division.
c. Funding Source - Redevelopment Agency tax increment fund and, if necessary, City general fund and any
   other available sources.
d. Implementation Timeframe - Ongoing.
                                                     A-41

9.  Town Center Specific Plan
a.  Background - The City shall develop a specific plan for the Town Center or downtown area to best deal with
    the district’s unique features so that physical, economic, and business objectives and policies can be realized
    and that mixed use projects (residential and commercial) can be accommodated, which would further affordable
    housing and economic development goals. State law authorizes cities to adopt specific plans for implementing
    their general plans in designated areas. Specific plans, which are most often used to ensure that multiple
    property owners and developers adhere to a common design criteria to benefit an overall neighborhood or
    area, provide more finite, though flexible development and circulation standards than Zoning. Another major
    intent of this specific plan process is to better link the downtown to the recently opened Metrolink Commuter
    Train Station. Thus, an “urban village” or livable cities component is sought, whereby housing, business,
    recreation, and transportation functions are considered in a planned and comprehensive fashion and vehicular
    trips are reduced (thus mitigating air pollution).
b.  Responsible City Department - Planning Division and Redevelopment Agency.
c.  Funding Source - City general fund and Redevelopment Agency tax increment fund.
d.  Implementation Timeframe - Process will commence upon Land Use Element adoption.
10. Various Housing Measures
a.  Background - The City will continue its existing and, where feasible, begin new Housing Element-listed
    programs, such as rent subsidy, code enforcement, rehabilitation, Neighborhood Preservation, deteriorating
    structure purchase, density bonus, granny flat/second unit, mixed use, and continued infill development
    acceptance, to maintain and improve the physical, aesthetic, economic, and social conditions of Covina’s
    neighborhoods, to preserve and, where possible, expand the supply of lower and moderate income housing,
    and thus to sustain overall community stability and integrity as well.
b.  Responsible City Department - Building and Safety Division, Planning Division, and Redevelopment Agency.
c.  Funding Source - City general fund, Redevelopment Agency tax increment fund, Federal Community
    Development Block Grant (CDBG) monies, and code violator fines and tax liens.
d.  Implementation Timeframe - Ongoing for some measures; other housing programs will commence upon
    adoption of the Land Use and Housing Elements.
11. Special Intensity Allowance
a.  Background - In accordance with applicable intensity provisions established in the above Land Use Plan
    Chapter, the City will establish guidelines for permitting exceptions to the Medium and High Density and the
    Commercial and Industrial floor area ratio (FAR) limits as a means of creating flexibility in land use planning
    and decision-making activities. Specifically, pertaining to the Residential Medium and High Density categories,
    in a lower (or lower and moderate) income housing project that is deemed to strongly address Covina’s
    housing situation and needs and best implement established General Plan goals, objectives, and policies, two
    dwelling units would be considered as one for density computation purposes. Regarding the Commercial and
    Industrial land use category floor area ratio maximums, which are 1.5 for General Commercial, 2.5 for Town
    Center Commercial, and 2.0 for Industrial, an FAR-exceeding project that affords the City with exceptionally
    high economic development, functional viability, architectural integrity, and/or image enhancement benefits
    and that, again, furthers overall Covina growth and revitalization goals and objectives shall be deemed
    acceptable. For exceptions in development intensity pertaining to both residential and nonresidential uses,
    applicable, implementing ordinances shall be prepared.

d.  Implementation Timeframe - Commencing upon Land Use Element adoption.
12. Noise and Environmental Disturbances Ordinances
a.  Background - The City will continue to reasonably enforce its Noise and Environmental Disturbances
    Ordinances and related provisions and policies as vehicles for ensuring land use compatibility, particularly
    between commercial or industrial and residential or other “sensitive” uses.
b.  Responsible City Department - Building and Safety Division and Planning Division.

13. Regional Planning Mandate Accommodation
a.  Background - The City will ensure that applicable portions of all Federal, State, regional, and County planning
    measures to reduce, control, and/or prevent traffic congestion, air pollution, household and business waste
    generation, storm water runoff, and other environmental problems are implemented and appropriately monitored
    to identify changing conditions. The air pollution and traffic congestion mitigation measures, which directly
    or indirectly affect land use, will essentially require the City to focus on economic development matters to,
    among other things, create as high a jobs-to-housing ratio as feasible (which reduces vehicle trips—refer to
    Section “J” of the Land Use Study for background information. See also Program “B-6” below.)
b.  Responsible City Department - Planning Division and Environmental Services Department.
c.  Funding Source - City general fund, Redevelopment Agency tax increment fund, and various funds and grants
    pertaining to Environmental Services.
d.  Implementation Timeframe - Commencing upon Land Use Element adoption.
14. Los Angeles County Hazardous Waste Management Plan Accommodation
a.  Background - In response to a particular State law (AB 2948), which requires local governments to establish
    guidelines for handling industry-generated untreated hazardous wastes, the City will have to designate sites or
    zoning districts for the treatment of such wastes. In this process, to ensure that all future hazardous waste
    disposal will be accommodated in an environmentally safe, physically isolated, and affective manner, land
    use factors will have to be strongly considered.
b.  Responsible City Department - Planning Division, Environmental Services Department, and/or possibly other
    departments/divisions.
c.  Funding Source - City general fund, Redevelopment Agency tax increment fund, applicable grants, and any
    other sources.

15. Covina Park Master Plan
a.  Background - The City Parks and Recreation Department is finalizing a master plan for all City parks and
    recreational facilities, which will serve as a blueprint for park expansion and the improvement of existing
    open space resources. This document is in part based on the Land Use Plan and expands on park issues and
    needs discussed herein. The City will work to ensure overall consistency between these two proposals and
    assure that the Park Plan fulfills the intent of the Land Use Element goal and objectives.
b.  Responsible City Department - Parks and Recreation Department and Planning Division.
c.  Funding Source - City general fund, Redevelopment Agency tax increment fund, and special park-related
    sources.
d.  Implementation Timeframe - Commencing upon Land Use Element adoption and Park Master Plan adoption.
B.  Procedural Matters
1.  Zoning Ordinance Revision to Achieve General Plan Consistency
a.  Background - As required by State planning law, the Zoning text and Map will be revised to conform to the
    new General Plan land use distribution, policy orientation, program framework, building intensity provisions
    and limits, and development standards to streamline and clarify key portions of the document and to incorporate
    applicable new State requirements, such as open space zoning. As part of the Zoning Ordinance/General Plan
    consistency activity, the City will appropriately handle existing and newly created major or “detrimental”
    nonconforming uses, such as old residential properties in commercial or industrial areas, considering land use
    compatibility, physical betterment, economic development, and related factors.
b.  Responsible City Department - Planning Division.
c.  Funding Source - City general fund and Redevelopment Agency tax increment fund.
d.  Implementation Timeframe - Commencing upon Land Use Element adoption.
2.  Consistency Between General Plan and Other Plans/Documents
a.  Background - City Departments and the Redevelopment Agency administer various plans and measures that
    directly or indirectly relate to land use. Where necessary, the Planning Division will ensure consistency
    between the revised Land Use Element and these other germane plans/documents, which include, but are not
    limited to, the Redevelopment Project Area Plans, Park Master Plan, the Subdivision Ordinance, and the
    Capital Improvement Program, to the greatest extent possible.
b.  Responsible City Department - Planning Division and possibly other departments/divisions.
c.  Funding Source - City general fund, Redevelopment Agency tax increment fund, and any other potential
    sources.
d.  Implementation Timeframe - Commencing upon Land Use Element adoption.
3.  Site Plan Review Process
                                                       A-44

a. Background - This is the process by which private development and use applications and certain public proposals
   are reviewed and by which General Plan, Zoning Ordinance, and Design Guidelines provisions are administered.
   Site Plan Review also serves as a mechanism for determining General Plan/Zoning consistency, for ascertaining
   whether the PCD process (see Program “A-3”) can be applied, for routing projects to other City departments/
   divisions for study and comment, and for addressing overall City service and infrastructure accommodation
   issues and related matters. When reviewing applications, the City may impose reasonable conditions to
   ensure conformance with respect to the General Plan, Zoning Ordinance, Design Guidelines, and other
   documents. This process shall continue.
b. Responsible City Department - Planning Division (primarily) and other City departments/divisions.
c. Funding Source - City general fund and Redevelopment Agency tax increment fund.
d. Implementation Timeframe - Ongoing.
4. Environmental Impact Review Process
a. Background - The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires examination of environmental and
   physical and certain social and economic impacts when reviewing generally major use or development
   applications, general plan amendments, zone changes, and/or related matters. The analysis occurs during the
   Site Plan Review process. For applicable projects, typical areas of concern pertain to site geology and grading,
   proximity to any active earthquake faults, potential erosion, storm water runoff and/or flooding, species
   degradation, vehicular traffic, noise, and/or land use compatibility. The City will continue to follow all applicable
   CEQA provisions at all levels in its planning activities.
b. Responsible City Department - Planning Division.
c. Funding Source - City general fund and Redevelopment Agency tax increment fund.
d. Implementation Timeframe - Ongoing.
5. Code Enforcement
a. Background - In situations where Zoning-, Site Plan Review-, and/or Building and Safety-related Code
   requirements are not met, particularly when there is a major threat to public health, safety, and welfare, the
   City attempts to abate or at least mitigate the violation(s). When residential properties are involved, the City
   administers two particular Ordinances, Property Maintenance and Abatement of Real Property Nuisances.
   Code violations range from greatly unkempt property to structural inadequacy to illegal dwelling units, which,
   if left unchecked, in the aggregate, not only could jeopardize individual health and safety but could diminish
   overall community image, appearance, character, social stability, and economic vitality, all of which directly
   or indirectly relate to land use. Aside from abating nuisances, a key function of Code Enforcement is to
   educate the public on the general importance of maintaining their properties. To ensure that all land use and
   other General Plan goals, objectives, and policies are furthered, the City will continue with its existing, and,
   where possible, expand, Code Enforcement and related matters pertaining to both residential neighborhoods
   and commercial and/or industrial districts. Particular emphasis shall be placed on achieving a comprehensive,
   coordinated approach among various City departments/divisions and abating problems on a target area basis
   (Neighborhood Preservation Program). In general, Covina will attempt to abate first the most serious violations
   or those nuisances that constitute the greatest threat to public health, safety, and welfare.
b. Responsible City Department - Building and Safety Division, Planning Division, Special Programs Division,
   and any other applicable City departments/divisions.
                                                       A-45

c. Funding Source - City general fund, Redevelopment Agency tax increment fund, violator fines/tax liens,
   Federal Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) monies, and any other available sources.
d. Implementation Timeframe - Ongoing and, for program expansion, commencing upon Land Use Element
   adoption.
6. Infrastructure and Service Level Accommodation
a. Background - The City will monitor the impacts of all future development on City services and on the
   infrastructure and prepare appropriate responses in terms of general project conditions and the consideration
   of new funding mechanisms. The maintenance of the local infrastructure, including, but not limited to, the
   street and storm drain systems, and municipal services, is essential to realize Covina General Plan goals,
   objectives, and policies pertaining to preserving residential as well as commercial and industrial uses, supporting
   moderate growth, and encouraging revitalization. As stated in the policy section above, attention will be
   made to considering new funding mechanisms to deal with needed street repairs as well as potential park/open
   space development and expansion. Also, City public safety resources and public school facilities will have to
   be periodically analyzed as well to ensure their sufficiency.
b. Responsible City Department - Planning Division (possibly working with other departments/divisions).
c. Funding Source - City General Fund, Redevelopment Agency tax increment fund, and potentially other sources.
d. Implementation Timeframe - Commencing upon Land Use Element adoption.
7. Local Economy Accommodation
a. Background - The City will monitor the development and preservation of housing units and commercial and
   industrial properties from the standpoint of necessary economic development obligations, particularly in terms
   of an approach that retains and bolsters as high a jobs-to-housing ratio and as strong a sales tax generation
   amount as possible, that enhances Covina’s image and appearance, and that maintains community businesses.
   In recognition of the high regard the City has for economic development matters, through working with the
   newly established Economic Development Committee, the City Chamber of Commerce, and/or other groups,
   the community will take reasonable, appropriate measures (like, as described in Program “C-11” below,
   attempting to remove constraints on development) to make the City more attractive to prospective and existing,
   potentially expanding businesses. Besides the obvious job creation and sales tax increase benefits that new
   and expanded businesses afford, as stated above, economic development also implements land use,
   beautification/revitalization, community image enhancement, and related General Plan goals, objectives, and
   policies.
b. Responsible City Department - Planning Division and Special Programs Division (possibly working with
   other departments/divisions).
c. Funding Source - General Fund, Redevelopment Agency Tax Increment Fund, and any other available sources.
d. Implementation Timeframe - Commencing upon Land Use Element adoption.
8. Monitoring of Metrolink Commuter Train Station Impacts
a. Background - The recently-opened Metrolink Commuter Train Station, located on the east side of Citrus
   Avenue, just north of the railroad tracks, will have land use, traffic, circulation, and other impacts that the City
   should monitor and, if appropriate, attempt to best exploit in relation to ongoing and potential downtown
                                                     A-46

    revitalization activities, such as, respectively, the storefront facade improvement program, various public and
    private improvements, and mixed use developments that reflect “urban village” or livable cities concepts.
    (Refer also to Program “A-9” above.)
b.  Responsible City Department - Planning Division (possibly working with other departments/divisions).
c.  Funding Source - City General Fund, Redevelopment Agency tax increment fund, and any other potential
    sources.
d.  Implementation Timeframe - Commencing upon Land Use Element adoption.
9.  Preservation of Special Residential Districts and/or Buildings
a.  Background - The City will designate and attempt to preserve local residential and other areas and/or buildings
    that are deemed architecturally and/or historically significant.
b.  Responsible City Department - Covina Valley Historical Society and Planning Division.
d.  Funding Source - City general fund, Redevelopment Agency tax increment fund, and (pertaining to the Historical
    Society) volunteer assistance.
d.  Implementation Timeframe - Commencing upon Land Use Element adoption.
10. Graffiti and Crime Abatement
a.  Background - The City will continue to support and, if possible, through reasonable means, expand the voluntary
    graffiti abatement program, which, along with general Code Enforcement activities, will improve the vitality
    of Covina neighborhoods. Also, through the Code Enforcement-related Neighborhood Preservation Program,
    the City will continue to attempt to reduce the incidence of crime, which has been a major factor in structural
    and/or area deterioration.
b.  Responsible City Department - Administration Department, Building and Safety Division, Planning Division,
    and City Gang and Graffiti Task Force.
c.  Funding Source - Volunteer assistance, with funds received from donations and, if possible, fines and/or tax
    penalties imposed on owners of delinquent properties. Also, City general fund, Redevelopment Agency tax
    increment fund, and Federal Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) monies.
d.  Implementation Timeframe - Ongoing and continuing after Land Use Element adoption.
11. Removal of Governmental Development Constraints
a.  Background - The City will review all development Codes, notably Zoning, and modify those found to be
    unnecessary or burdensome in constructing or improving housing and in maintaining and attracting new
    businesses. In addition, the City will study its project and use application review processes and streamline any
    identified over-lengthy procedures to create a more efficient, reasonable, and “business friendly” atmosphere.
b.  Responsible City Department - Building and Safety Division and Planning Division.
c.  Funding Source - City general fund and Redevelopment Agency tax increment fund.
d.  Implementation Timeframe - Commencing upon Land Use Element adoption.
                                                        A-47

12. Monitoring For Any Changes in Land Use and Related Issues
a.  Background - The City will monitor its identified land use and related issues from time to time to detect any
    changes warranting modification in the City’s strategies, policies, or programs.
b.  Responsible City Department - Planning Division.
c.  Funding Source - City general fund and Redevelopment Agency tax increment fund.
d.  Implementation Timeframe - Commencing upon Land Use Element adoption.
13. Consideration of New Programs and Maintaining Information on Existing and Potential Funding Sources
    and Programs
a.  Background - The City shall study and consider the feasibility of utilizing any other applicable, potentially
    viable programs and will compile and maintain updated information on existing and potential funding sources
    and land use programs.
b.  Responsible City Department - Planning Division.
c.  Funding Source - City general fund and Redevelopment Agency tax increment fund.
d.  Implementation Timeframe - Commencing upon Land Use Element adoption.
14. Annexations and Sphere of Influence Matters
a.  Background - Working with willing property owners or developers in the unincorporated/Sphere of Influence
    area and with the County, the City will continue to process and, where appropriate, encourage annexation
    requests. Expanding the City limits will give Covina authority over more areas and therefore additional
    leverage for implementing the General Plan. However, the provision of services and infrastructure must also
    be considered. In addition, changes in the Covina Sphere of Influence itself should also be considered where
    the City has an interest in a particular location or area (such as the designated “Study Area” on the Land Use
    Map) and where City services and adequate infrastructure can be provided.
b.  Responsible City Department - Administration Department and Planning Division.
c.  Funding Source - City general fund and Redevelopment Agency tax increment fund.
d.  Implementation Timeframe - Commencing upon Land Use Element adoption.
15. Utilization of Development Agreements
a.  Background - Whether handled by the City or the Redevelopment Agency, this approach could be utilized in
    the development of certain major projects, particularly those built in phases, to attain uses that would facilitate
    General Plan implementation. The basic development agreement, which is authorized by State law, enables a
    City to enter into a binding contract with a builder that, in addition to underlying proposal conditions, assures
    the City as to the type, character, amenities, public improvements, and “benefits” of the development, while
    guaranteeing the project sponsor that the necessary building permits will be issued regardless of changes in
    regulations. Other types of development agreements, such as Redevelopment Agency assistance to builders
    of needed lower income housing units or economically beneficial commercial uses, may be appropriate as
                                                      A-48

    well.
b.  Responsible City Department - Administration Department, Planning Division, and/or Redevelopment Agency.
c.  Funding Source - City general fund and Redevelopment Agency tax increment fund; in some cases private
    (developer) funds may be used in creating an agreement or in another aspect of this process.
d.  Implementation Timeframe - Ongoing and continuing upon Land Use Element adoption.
16. Utilization of Market Studies and Fiscal Impact Analyses
a.  Background - If deemed necessary to determine project feasibility, economic costs and benefits to the City,
    and/or land use, circulation, community image, and/or other impacts, the City should require developers,
    project sponsors, or others to submit appropriate market studies and/or fiscal impact analyses. The findings of
    these reports would be considered in the City’s project evaluation and decision-making processes. Thus, this
    type of information could also verify development consistency with the General Plan.
b.  Responsible City Department - Administration Department, Planning Division, and/or Redevelopment Agency.
c.  Funding Source - City general fund and Redevelopment Agency tax increment fund; in many cases, however,
    private (developer) funds would be used in preparing a study/analysis or in another aspect of this process.
d.  Implementation Timeframe - Ongoing and continuing upon Land Use Element adoption.
C.  General Administration
1.  Inter-governmental Coordination
a.  Background - To most fairly and best deal with land use, traffic, and other issues at or near Covina’s border
    areas, the City will continue routing various plans and documents to and reviewing development and public
    proposals from neighboring communities and Los Angeles County. When necessary, Covina will also be in
    contact with other governmental entities and/or relevant groups, including, but not limited to, the State, school
    districts, and utility companies. In the case of reviewing, for example, an expanding school site, the City will
    strive to ensure, to the greatest extent possible, that the altered facility complies with all applicable Covina
    codes, standards, and policies. This inter-governmental activity will, among other things, acknowledge City
    concerns, desires, and/or intentions over particular developments and related actions in an atmosphere of
    respect and cooperation.
b.  Responsible City Department - Planning Division.
c.  Funding Source - City general fund and Redevelopment Agency tax increment fund.
d.  Implementation Timeframe - Ongoing.
2.  Intra-governmental Coordination
a.  Background - In carrying out its various land use-related and planning activities and programs/measures,
    where appropriate and feasible, such as in the Code Enforcement-related Neighborhood Preservation Program,
    the Planning Division will attempt to work with other City departments/divisions to best approach and handle
    various developments, proposals, issues, and problems. In light of changing Covina demographic, social,
    economic, and housing conditions as well as other trends, it is believed that this holistic orientation is essential
                                                       A-49

   and thus will best implement General Plan goals, objectives, and policies.
b. Responsible City Department - Planning Division.
c. Funding Source - City general fund and Redevelopment Agency tax increment fund.
d. Implementation Timeframe - Ongoing.
3. Public Involvement
a. Background - In compliance with State planning law, the City will endeavor to promote the importance of the
   General Plan as well as implementing programs/measures, such as economic development and code enforcement
   matters, to the public, businesses, developers, Covina employees, and other interested parties and groups at
   the public counter, on the phone, at meetings, at City-sponsored events, and at additional available opportunities
   through informational handouts, brochures, press releases, and any other mediums deemed appropriate. When
   General Plan updates are done, persons, groups, and organizations shall be notified through State-defined
   public hearings and, if appropriate, by way of other means. Frequent public education is an important ingredient
   in successful general plan implementation.
b. Responsible City Department - Planning Division.
c. Funding Source - City general fund and Redevelopment Agency tax increment fund.
d. Implementation Timeframe - Commencing upon adoption of last phase of the General Plan update.
4. General Plan Review and Revisions
a. Background - State planning law requires the City to annually report to the Planning Commission and City
   Council on progress in General Plan implementation, with an emphasis on Housing Element-defined needs
   accommodation. The report must then be filed with the State Office of Planning and Research (OPR). The
   intent of this process is to ensure the viability, effectiveness, and coordination of adopted General Plan goals,
   objectives, policies, and programs/implementation measures, which impact not only the community but,
   technically, the State as well. The City of Covina will continue with this activity and, when an amendment to
   the revised General Plan is made, will review the change in relation to the entire Plan to ensure inter-Element
   consistency. An example of this situation will occur in 1996, when the Housing Element will have to be
   revised to incorporate new regional “housing needs” figures. Moreover, appropriate, occasional monitoring
   of the General Plan components shall occur. Lastly, no later than five years following adoption of the last
   phase of the General Plan update, a detailed analysis of the entire Plan will be conducted.
b. Responsible City Department - Planning Division.
c. Funding Source - City general fund and Redevelopment Agency tax increment fund.
d. Implementation Timeframe - Commencing upon adoption of the last phase of the General Plan update.
5. Land Use Element Implementation
a. Background - In accordance with the State planning law/Government Code criteria, the City will implement
   the Covina Land Use Element in a manner compatible to the desired implementation/administration of all
   other General Plan Elements, as presented in those chapters, City and Redevelopment Agency plans, and
   community goals and, in a fashion consistent with the intent of this chapter, monitor all facets of Element
                                                       A-50

   implementation, conduct necessary tasks so as to best prepare for future versions, annually report its findings
   to the Planning Commission and City Council, and, when legally required, necessary, and/or in the public
   interest, update the Element.
b. Responsible City Department - Planning Division.
c. Funding Source - City general fund and Redevelopment Agency tax increment fund.
d. Implementation Timeframe - Commencing upon Land Use Element adoption.
6. Maintenance of City Departments/Divisions Responsible for Land Use Matters
a. Background - In order to carry out its various land use and related responsibilities and obligations, the City
   will maintain departments/divisions to, among other things, appropriately administer and monitor the General
   Plan, Zoning Ordinance, Design Guidelines, and various non-Planning Codes as well as to control and monitor
   various accompanying processes, such as Site Plan Review and Environmental Impact Review. In addition,
   Covina will maintain resources to administer and monitor City land use programs, to preserve and improve
   the community’s housing stock, to maintain and expand the economic base, and to disseminate applicable
   information and provide assistance to the public.
b. Responsible City Department - Building and Safety Division, Planning Division, Redevelopment Agency,
   and Special Programs Division.

VI. RELATION TO AND CONSISTENCY WITH OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
    As stated in the above Background section, Land Use is the central General Plan Element, the one that correlates
    land use and related issues among all chapters. However, the Land Use Element is most closely tied to the
    Circulation, Housing, and Safety chapters. There is a close relationship to the Circulation Element, which
    establishes circulation and transportation systems and facilities, because, under law, the Land Use Plan must
    be consistent with and bolstered by circulation and transportation components. Conversely, the Circulation
    Element’s provisions reflect the goal, objectives, policies, and Land Use Plan of the Land Use Element. Any
    changes in either Element therefore will have a resultant impact upon the other. This inextricable connection
    between the two chapters is best illustrated by the fact that the Circulation Plan is superimposed upon the
    Land Use Map. In relation to the Housing Element, which aims to identify and meet housing needs and
    problems, the Housing component utilizes the same land use and building density frameworks and population
    and dwelling unit projections put forth in the Land Use Element/Map in accommodating growth, addressing
    housing-related challenges, and administering its State-required, ambitious housing program/implementation
    measures (relating to preservation, improvement, and similar issues). Moreover, the Land Use chapter is
    closely associated with the Safety Element, the General Plan component that serves to protect the community
    from any unreasonable risks associated with the effects of various potential disasters. In the Safety chapter,
    areas prone to flooding or other major hazards are identified from and handled in a manner conforming to that
    of the Land Use Element. The Land Use chapter similarly establishes a foundation for the Natural Resources
    and Open Space Element, which strives to protect local natural resources and open space areas, and the Noise
    chapter, a component that addresses excessive noise exposure. Although the strength of the relationship of the
    above Elements to the central Land Use chapter varies, all six mandatory General Plan Elements are important
    in that they address specific areas and needs pertaining to a community’s physical development, appearance,
    character, and quality of life and, therefore, as documented under State law and mentioned below, the six
    chapters carry equal legal status.
    Thus, it is important for the Land Use Element to be consistent with all chapters, and vice versa, in terms of
    everything from supporting data and information to policy orientation to implementation. This necessity for
    overall congruence is, again, underscored by State law as well. Section 65300.5 of the California Government
    Code states that “. . . the Legislature intends that the general plan and elements and parts thereof comprise an
    integrated, internally consistent and compatible statement of policies for the adopting agency.”
    The City of Covina has met this consistency requirement. Because the City has updated all General Plan
    Elements simultaneously, one common data and information base, with the same community input, has been
    used for the entire project. This means that the goals, objectives, and policies for all Elements will have been
    (when all Elements are completed) prepared based on the same foundation and according to the same or
    similar methodology, thus ensuring consistency. Also, and perhaps most importantly, revising all General
    Plan Elements together guarantees inter-Element program conformity because, according to planning law,
    implementation measures or land use, circulation/infrastructure, and other plans must be developed upon the
    existing conditions/data and issues plus the stated goals, objectives, and policies in question. In sum, the
    nature of the Covina General Plan update process has greatly facilitated consistency among all Elements.
    During Land Use Element preparation, topical goals, objectives, policies, and programs/implementation
    measures have been cross-checked with those in other Elements, particularly Circulation, Housing, and Safety,
    the other key General Plan chapters, to maintain and verify this necessary congruence.
    The above-noted inter-Element consistency will also ensure that implementation of the Land Use and each and
    every Element will realize the same results. Furthermore, if the Land Use Element is amended in the future,
    the City will confirm that the change is consistent with other chapters and/or modify the accompanying Elements
    to maintain overall conformity. Moreover, as stated in Program “C4,” the City will monitor all major aspects
    of Land Use Element implementation through decision-making activities and other processes to verify this
    consistency. In other words, the City regards all Elements as having equal legal status and is therefore committed
    to appropriate Land Use chapter implementation, particularly with respect to inter-Element unity and coherence.

VII. CITIZEN PARTICIPATION IN LAND USE ELEMENT FORMATION
     State planning law (Government Code Section 65351) requires local governments, during the amendment of a
     general plan, to “provide opportunities for the involvement of citizens, public agencies, public utility companies,
     and civic, education, and other community groups, through public hearings and any other means the city or
     county deems appropriate.” In fulfilling its citizen participation obligations and in identifying issues for Land
     Use as well as for all other Elements, the City has:
1.   Prepared and distributed a “short” questionnaire to all Covina households.
2.   Prepared and distributed a “long” questionnaire on a random basis to approximately 10% of all Covina area
     households.
3.   Conducted “town hall meetings” and public forums.
4.   Prepared a cable television commercial on the General Plan update and public forums and had a staff member
     appear on the local cable television station to discuss the General Plan update process and answer public
     questions.
5.   Prepared and distributed several General Plan update flyers at City Hall and at various public functions. Also
     prepared press releases and articles in various newspapers and City publications on the update process and on
     the public forums.
6.   Received numerous comments from the public (in this case regarding land use) on the phone, at the counter,
     and in the course of site-specific project reviews.
7.   Met with and elicited the views of Covina’s Housing Advisory Committee.
8.   Organized, met with, and elicited the views of a land use subcommittee of Covina’s General Plan Update
     Committee that addressed land use and related issues.
9.   Met with and elicited the views of City of Covina employees who deal with land use and development matters.
10.  Received numerous comments from representatives of other public or quasi-public agencies, such as school
     districts, utility companies, regional agencies, and adjacent municipalities as well as local civic organizations.
     The public comments elicited from measures 1 through 10 have been carefully studied by the City and have
     been incorporated into the body of data and information that was used in formulating this Element’s identification
     and discussion of land use issues and, therefore, in developing the applicable goal, objectives, policies, Land
     Use Plan, and programs/implementation measures as well. Refer to the Land Use and Housing Studies for
     clarification on the above activities and on the input received from the respective measures. Also, related
     material and information pertaining to these items are on file in the City Planning Division. Thus, the City of
     Covina has made a reasonable effort to reach out to the important segments, views, and organizations in
     drafting this Land Use Element.

VIII. MONITORING LAND USE ELEMENT IMPLEMENTATION
      In order for the General Plan Land Use Element’s goal and the objectives, policies, and Land Use Plan to be
      realized, or to ensure that the Element serves to maintain and, where necessary, improve Covina physically,
      economically, socially, and aesthetically, the Element must be implemented as proposed though effective
      decision-making and actions. Also, to ensure that implementation is achieved to the maximum degree possible,
      consistent Land Use Element monitoring must also occur. This subject is addressed by Section 65400(b) of
      the Government Code, which states that following general plan adoption or revision, a City shall “provide an
      annual report to the legislative body on the status of the plan and progress in its implementation, including the
      progress in meeting its share of (housing element-related) regional housing needs. . .” Because Land Use is the
      most important chapter, monitoring is particularly relevant here.
      The City of Covina will fulfill its obligation to monitor implementation by preparing the State-required report
      for the Planning Commission and for the City Council. This procedure, in fact, has been incorporated into the
      Land Use Element implementation framework as Program “C4,” which calls for the monitoring of all aspects
      of the implementation effort, including, as stated in Section VI, assurances that inter-Element consistency is
      achieved. One such facet of the monitoring process is ensuring that any underutilized policies or programs are
      adequately handled. Also, any identified problems or deficiencies will be carefully studied and appropriately
      managed to ensure that desired Land Use Element results are met. The City believes that many potential
      problems should be avoided by maintaining a commitment to appropriate Element implementation through the
      decision-making process. Besides, then, furthering the established land use goal and objectives, this approach
      will facilitate preparing General Plan amendments.

                                                EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Natural Resources and Open Space is the Element of the General Plan that serves 1) to identify, protect, and conserve
local natural resources and 2) to establish a framework for preserving, managing, and enhancing the community’s
open space areas. Because Covina is a flat, mature, and generally built-out community in the urbanized east San
Gabriel Valley (an inland subregion), natural resource issues are restricted primarily to ground water and surface water
quality and conservation, the preservation of existing limited vegetation, wildlife and wildlife habitat, and air quality.
Furthermore, open space matters in Covina focus primarily on citywide parks and related recreational facilities and
trails. In an urban environment such as Covina, natural and recreational issues/resources are usually closely linked
because the most visible concentrations of natural resources are located in public parks and similar uses. Conserving
and protecting natural resources and open space lands are important for maintaining a community’s overall functionality,
vitality, image, and quality of life.
The entire contents of this Element are based on State planning law requirements (Sections 65302(d) and 65302(e) of
the California Government Code) and the California Office of Planning and Research (OPR) General Plan Guidelines,
an advisory document on general plan preparation. Under law, as is the case with all chapters of the general plan, the
State establishes the overall data and analysis requirements, while allowing local governments to address their natural
resource and open space issues and challenges in a manner tailored to local conditions and circumstances. Therefore,
the Element has been organized and prepared in a manner that the City feels is most appropriate and logical and best
suited for carrying out planning activities.
Covina (population 46,452, 1997 estimate) is a mature, suburban community located in the eastern portion of the San
Gabriel Valley, approximately twenty-three miles east of downtown Los Angeles. Because Covina is, as previously
indicated, generally flat and is today almost completely built-out or has experienced much urbanization over the years,
many of the natural resource concerns relevant in coastal, rural, or less-developed local governments are not applicable
to the City. However, there are some noteworthy resources in Covina’s hilly southeastern enclave (the Covina Hills
neighborhood), which, along with other factors, this Element explores. The community is characterized by predominantly
low rise/low intensity residential, commercial, and light manufacturing uses. For a suburban city, Covina has a relatively
high percentage of commercial and industrial areas, which illustrates a strong, diversified economic base. Despite the
community’s generally built-out character, future development is expected to occur on remaining vacant as well as on
underutilized properties, thus posing additional direct or indirect impacts on natural resources and open space lands.
Concerning the latter, recreational facilities in Covina consist of nine City parks and two leased ball fields, though the
community is deficient on a park acreage for every one-thousand resident basis. Covina has a historic downtown that
is a key social and economic center of the community. The Covina General Plan covers a ten square mile Planning
Area, which includes seven square miles of incorporated territory and a three square mile Sphere of Influence/
unincorporated area (designated for eventual Covina annexation). Refer to Section “A” of the Land Use Study of the
Land Use Element for more information on location, character, and the Covina Planning Area.
The Covina Natural Resources and Open Space Element is divided into eight chapters. The first chapter introduces and
presents general information on the Element process, as mentioned above, as well as on below-described Element
contents.
In section number two, the below-listed natural resources are identified and discussed to the extent that important
matters apply to Covina:
           1.      Water Resources
                   a.        Ground water
                   b.        Unimproved flood control channels
                   c.        Surface water
           2.      Vegetation and Flora
           3.      Wildlife and Wildlife Habitat, Sensitive Species, and Fauna
                                                           D-VII

          4.       Air Quality
          5.       Soils
          6.       Minerals
The key issues in this area include: 1) monitoring and regulating water quality and conditions; 2) protecting ground
water resources and remedying and handling existing ground water pollution problems; 3) preserving and protecting
unimproved segments of two flood control channels and concomitant riparian communities (Walnut Creek in Covina
Hills and Charter Oak Wash in Wingate Park) for ecological, aesthetic, and other reasons, and 4) ensuring the adequacy
of water supplies to meet existing and future demands and applications. Other salient natural resource issues pertain to:
5) continuing to follow various water conservation measures; 6) complying with the plans and programs of all levels
of government pertaining to air pollution mitigation with various land use and transportation control measures outlined
in the Land Use and Circulation Elements; 7) preserving and protecting parks and recreational facilities for recreational
as well as ecological and aesthetic reasons; and 8) limiting development and minimizing grading in Covina Hills to
preserve oak and other significant mature trees as well as natural features in the area. Issues are important because they
clarify matters warranting attention and help shape goals and policies and programs/implementation measures, which
constitute the chief sections of this Element.
The third chapter discusses and analyzes topics pertaining to open space lands, again to the extent that important
matters apply to Covina. These items are:
          1.       Open Space for the Preservation of Natural Resources
                   a.       Riparian woodland communities
          2.       Open Space for the Managed Production of Resources
                   a.       Flood control spreading grounds
                   b.       Improved flood control channels
          3.       Open Space for Outdoor Recreation
                   a.       City parks and related facilities
                   b.       Trails
                            1)        Bikeways
                            2)        Equestrian trail
The following presents the key open space issues. Again, issues clarify matters warranting attention and are utilized in
formulating the all-important goals and policies and programs/implementation measures. The chief open space issues
are: 1) preserving and protecting all parks, ball fields, and schools to maintain recreational opportunities; 2) maintaining
joint-use agreements with school districts to provide Covina residents with open space lands that supplement the City’s
park system; 3) preserving and protecting unimproved segments of two flood control channels and concomitant
riparian communities (Walnut Creek in Covina Hills and Charter Oak Wash in Wingate Park) for recreational, ecological,
aesthetic, and other reasons; 4) recognizing that the City has an open space deficiency and attempting to resolve the
problem by acquiring and developing additional parkland, whenever feasible; 5) considering creative approaches to
parkland acquisition; and 6) continuing efforts to enhance existing parks and recreational facilities to improve overall
park use, safety, and appearance. The other key issues relating to open space include: 7) placing a higher priority on
park enhancement and rehabilitation than park development, in general; 8) considering the Covina Park System
Master Plan as a framework for addressing and resolving various park-related deficiencies; 9) paying particular attention
to the recreational needs of the City’s less mobile segments; 10) offering sufficient, cost-effective programs and
services to address local needs and interests; 11) handling and maintaining the City’s limited networks of bicycle ways
and equestrian/hiking trails; and 12) prioritizing needed park amenities and facility enhancements, focusing on the
Covina Park System Master Plan and City Capital Improvement Program as bases for decision-making.
                                                            D-VIII

In section number four, the goals and policies of the Natural Resources and Open Space Element are presented. Goals
and policies are important because they serve as the chief tools with respect to private development and public project
evaluation and decision-making and overall local direction setting as well as the primary basis for the Element’s
implementation measures, discussed in the subsequent chapter. A goal is defined as a general expression of an ideal
future condition or state toward which the community wishes to advance. A policy, on the other hand, is a statement
that most directly guides decision-making and actions. In applying the two terms to Covina, one goal and several
policies are utilized for each subject of the Element. Under natural resources, to begin with, the goal is:
          A setting in which a high environmental quality is achieved through the bona fide conservation and protection
          of existing natural resources.
The policies are listed within a framework relative to the following three topical areas:
          1.        Water resources and air quality.
          2.        Vegetation and wildlife.
          3.        General matters.
Key policies call for the City to support the efforts at all levels of government to monitor and regulate water quality and
conditions; to support the efforts at and various codes and standards of all applicable government entities to protect
ground water resources from depletion and sources of pollution; to support Federal, State, and regional efforts to
remedy existing ground water pollution problems; to preserve and protect in their natural conditions, through appropriate
land use controls and development standards, the unimproved segments of two flood control channels running through
Covina (Walnut Creek in the Covina Hills/southeastern area and Charter Oak Wash in Wingate Park), which contain
riparian woodland communities, as important functional, ecological, biological, aesthetic, and passive open space
resources; to minimize the alteration of drainage patterns in and hillside grading in Covina Hills to best preserve
existing resources and conditions in the area; and to handle existing soil erosion along the banks of the unimproved
portion of Walnut Creek in the Covina Hills area. Furthermore, the City would ensure the adequacy of water supplies
and water pressure to meet all existing and future demands and applications; follow the Covina Water Conservation
and Water-Efficient Landscape Ordinances, where appropriate, as viable conservation tools; comply with applicable
portions of Federal, State, regional, and County plans and programs pertaining to air pollution mitigation/air quality
enhancement by following various vehicular emissions-reducing and traffic congestion-reducing land use and
transportation control and energy conservation measures, proposals, and policies outlined in the Land Use and Circulation
Elements; encourage and support the use of mass transit and work with transit providers to provide efficient service for
local residents and businesses to reduce vehicular travel and air pollution; continue to enforce the Covina Oak Tree
Ordinance as a means of protecting oak tree resources and, whenever feasible, preserve existing mature trees in
conjunction with private development proposals and public works projects; and require that new and significantly
expanded/remodeled properties incorporate adequate landscaping, in accordance with all City standards, for both
aesthetic and ecological reasons.
As indicated above, a separate goal and distinct policies are presented for the open space topic as well. Thus, pertaining
to open space, the goal is:
          A complete, well-balanced, and functional system of parks, open space facilities, and trails and appurtenant
          thorough, viable programs and services that meet the diverse active and passive recreational needs of current
          and future Covina residents.
The policies are listed by seven subject areas, which are:
          1.        Retention, development, and enhancement of park and recreational facilities.
                                                             D-IX

          2.        Recreational programs.
          3.        Trail facilities.
          4.        Design and landscaping of parks, trails, and recreational facilities.
          5.        Maintenance of parks, trails, and recreational facilities.
          6.        Safety, accessibility, security, and miscellaneous matters.
          7.        Funding.
For this topic, the chief policies call for the City to preserve all local parks, ball fields, and schools through appropriate
General Plan and Zoning designations to best maintain recreational opportunities as well as community appearance
and image and vitality; to maintain joint-use agreements with school districts to provide Covina residents with open
space lands that supplement the City’s park system; to endeavor to provide for its citizens a total park acreage equal to
2.0 acres for each 1,000 population at General Plan buildout (as opposed to 1.4 at General Plan adoption); to consider
creative, practical approaches to acquiring additional open space acreage, including developing mini-parks, small
neighborhood parks, and specialty parks; to continue to upgrade, enhance, redesign and/or replace existing parks and
recreational areas and appurtenant facilities and amenities; and to generally regard the rehabilitation, renovation, or
enhancement of existing parks and facilities as taking precedence over the establishment of new parks and facilities. In
accordance with other salient policies, the City would consider the Covina Park System Master Plan as a viable framework
for identifying, addressing, and resolving needed park improvements and, therefore, implement the Plan to the greatest
extent feasible, continue to offer quality and diverse park/recreational programs, activities, and services to address
local needs and interests, pay particular attention to the open space and recreational needs of the City’s generally less
mobile segments, including young people and senior citizens; continue to support and, where reasonable, expand and
improve the City’s bicycle ways for recreational as well as functional purposes; and support County efforts to preserve
and, where appropriate, expand and improve local- and regional-oriented equestrian/hiking trails and reasonable linkages
thereto that run through southeastern Covina (including along or near Walnut Creek). Finally, the City proposes to
consider appropriate site design, architecture, functionality, landscaping, land use compatibility, and public safety
standards and provisions in developing new or enhancing existing parks and recreational facilities; to continue providing
for adequate maintenance of all City parks and recreational facilities as well as support County efforts to keep up
County facilities used by Covina residents; to ensure that all playgrounds and trail facilities comply with Federal and
State safety standards; and to prioritize and systematically schedule on a long-term basis needed improvements to the
Covina park system, using as a basis for decision-making and actions Covina’s Park System Master Plan, City Capital
Improvement Program, and any other appropriate documents as well as community desires.
The fifth chapter discusses the programs/implementation measures, which, along with the goals and policies, serve as
the backbone of the Natural Resources and Open Space Element. Programs ensure that the Element’s goals and
policies will reach fruition. The programs and measures are divided into three below-listed subject areas that generally
follow the categorization of the policies. The subject areas are:
          1.        Natural Resources.
          2.        Open Space Lands.
          3.        Inter-Topic General Matters.
Various specific and general programs are presented, which, again, supplement and further the previously-listed goal
and policies.
                                                              D-X

Section number six discusses the Natural Resources and Open Space Element’s relation to and consistency with other
General Plan chapters. The Natural Resources and Open Space Element is most closely related to the Land Use
Element, the central chapter that focuses on the long-term general distribution/location and development intensity of
residential, commercial, industrial, and other uses. There is a close tie to the Land Use Element because, under State
law, the proposed land use development scenario must reflect the community’s desires with respect to natural resource
and open space matters. In addition, State law calls for the Natural Resources and Open Space Element to be consistent
with all other chapters, and vice versa, in terms of everything from supporting data and information to policy orientation
to implementation. The City of Covina has met this consistency requirement by updating all General Plan Elements
simultaneously, including utilizing one common data and information base and cross-checking all goals, policies, and
plans/implementation measures among the various chapters. This inter-Element consistency will also ensure that
implementation of the Natural Resources and Open Space and all other Elements will realize the same results.
Furthermore, if the Natural Resources and Open Space Element is amended in the future, the City will verify that the
change is consistent with other chapters and/or modify the accompanying Elements to maintain overall conformity.
The seventh chapter lists the various measures that the City has undertaken to guide citizen participation in the General
Plan update process. These items include questionnaires; public forums; cable television segments; and flyers, press
releases, and articles. In addition, City staff received numerous citizen and business comments on the phone, at the
public counter, and in the course of site-specific project reviews and met with and elicited the views of various City
advisory bodies involved with natural resources and open space issues. Public comments elicited from the measures
were carefully studied by the City and have been incorporated into the body of data and information that was used in
formulating the natural resources and open space issues and, therefore, in developing the goals, policies, and programs/
implementation measures. State planning law places a strong emphasis on citizen participation in the General Plan
preparation as well as implementation and amendment processes.
The eighth and final chapter discusses monitoring Natural Resources and Open Space Element implementation, which
is also a State requirement and is important to ensure that the Element fulfills its primary purpose of maintaining and,
where necessary, improving Covina’s natural resources and open space facilities. The City will fulfill its obligation to
monitor implementation by preparing a State-required annual report on this matter to the Planning Commission and
City Council. Any identified underutilized policies or programs will be adequately handled and problems or deficiencies
will be carefully studied and appropriately managed to ensure that the desired Natural Resource and Open Space
Element goals are met. Because the Natural Resources and Open Space Element is, as previously stated, a prominent
chapter and closely tied to the central Land Use Element, monitoring is particularly relevant here.
Much of the background information and facts and analysis of data for this Element appear in the accompanying
Biological Study, a consultant-prepared compilation of primarily natural resources in Covina, with some material on
open space facilities. Though separate, the Biological Study or Technical Appendix is legally part of the Natural
Resources and Open Space Element. The City believes that this two-document organization best addresses applicable
planning statutes and policies as well as local conditions and needs. Lastly, it is noted that much of the background
information and recommendations for improvement of the Covina Park System Master Plan have been incorporated
into the “open space” sections of the Element, though this Plan is not considered to be adopted by reference. The Park
System Master Plan, developed by the Covina Parks and Recreation Department, was prepared based on an extensive
citizen input process and on a thorough identification of applicable issues, mandates, considerations, and user demands,
contains an inventory and assessment of existing recreational facilities, and sets standards and guidelines for the
improvement, development, maintenance, and utilization of all open space lands.

I. INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND
   Natural Resources and Open Space is the Element of the General Plan that serves 1) to identify, protect, and
   conserve local natural resources and 2) to establish a framework for preserving, managing, and enhancing the
   community’s open space areas. Under State planning law (discussed below), natural resources include: 1)
   water and its hydraulic force; 2) forests; 3) soils (particularly those conducive to agriculture); 4) rivers and
   other waters; 5) harbors; 6) fisheries; 7) wildlife; 8) minerals; and 9) other resources, such as agricultural
   lands and air quality. Moreover, open space uses must be discussed within the context of: 1) preserving
   natural resources (such as plant or animal life or wildlife habitat); 2) managing the production of resources
   (like forest lands, rivers, or ground water recharge basins); 3) maintaining areas for outdoor recreation (e.g.,
   parks and trails); and 4) protecting areas for public health and safety (relating to, for example, earthquake
   fault zones, flood plains, or unstable soil areas). Concerning the first area, because Covina is a flat, mature,
   and generally built-out community in the urbanized east San Gabriel Valley (an inland subregion), natural
   resource issues are restricted primarily to ground water and surface water quality and conservation, the
   preservation of existing limited vegetation, wildlife and wildlife habitat, and air quality. And regarding the
   second facet of this Element, open space matters in Covina focus primarily on citywide parks and related
   recreational facilities and trails. In an urban environment such as Covina, natural and recreational issues/
   resources are usually closely linked because the most visible concentrations of natural resources are located in
   public parks and similar uses. Conserving and protecting natural resources and open space lands are important
   for maintaining a community’s overall functionality, vitality, image, and quality of life. From the standpoint
   of the overall General Plan process, the Natural Resources and Open Space Element is closely related to the
   chapters on Land Use, Circulation, Housing, Safety, and Noise.
   The entire contents of this Element are based on State planning law requirements (Sections 65302(d) and
   65302(e) of the California Government Code) and the California Office of Planning and Research (OPR)
   General Plan Guidelines, an advisory document on general plan preparation. The State actually promulgates
   matters contained in this General Plan chapter as two elements, natural resources or conservation (Section
   65302(d)) and open space (Section 65302(e)). Under law, as is the case with all chapters of the general plan,
   the State establishes the overall data and analysis requirements, while allowing local governments to address
   their natural resource and open space issues and challenges in a manner tailored to local conditions and
   circumstances. Therefore, because of the community’s above-mentioned generally urbanized, built-out, and
   inland character and concomitant interrelatedness of natural resource and open space issues, this Element
   incorporates in one document the required components of both previously stated chapters. And as indicated
   below, the chapter has been organized in a manner that the City feels is most appropriate and logical and best
   suited for carrying out planning activities.
   The Covina Natural Resources and Open Space Element is divided into eight chapters. Following this
   Background chapter, the second section presents an identification and discussion of the natural resource
   issues, which, again, focus on ground water and surface water quality and conservation, the preservation of
   existing, generally limited vegetation, wildlife and wildlife habitat, and air quality. Here, reference is made to
   an accompanying communitywide biological assessment that functions as the Technical Appendix to this
   Element. The third area exhibits an identification and discussion on the open space lands, with, as mentioned
   above, an emphasis on City parks and related recreational facilities and trails. Recreational programs are also
   mentioned. Section number four presents the natural resources and open space goals and policies, an important
   component that bridges the gap between where the City is and what type of community it wishes to become.
   The fifth chapter describes programs/implementation measures, again for both topical areas, which supplement
   and ensure the fruition of the goals and policies. Sections six, seven, and eight conclude the Element by
   discussing, respectively, the relation to and consistency with other General Plan chapters, citizen participation
   in Element formation, and monitoring Natural Resources and Open Space Element implementation.
                                                      D-1

Covina (population 46,452, 1997 estimate) is a mature, suburban community located in the eastern portion of
the San Gabriel Valley, approximately twenty-three miles east of downtown Los Angeles. Because Covina is
generally flat and is today almost completely built-out or has experienced much urbanization over the years,
many of the natural resource concerns relevant in coastal, rural, or less-developed local governments are not
applicable to the City. However, there are some noteworthy resources in Covina’s hilly southeastern enclave
(the Covina Hills neighborhood). The community is characterized by predominantly low rise/low intensity
residential, commercial, and light manufacturing uses. For a suburban city, Covina has a relatively high
percentage of commercial and industrial areas, which illustrates a strong, diversified economic base. Despite
the community’s generally built-out character, future development is expected to occur on remaining vacant
as well as on underutilized properties, thus posing additional direct or indirect impacts on natural resources
and limited open space lands, as described below. Covina has a historic downtown that is a key social and
economic center of the community. The Covina General Plan covers a ten square mile Planning Area, which
includes seven square miles of incorporated territory and a three square mile Sphere of Influence/unincorporated
area (designated for eventual Covina annexation). Refer to Section “A” of the Land Use Study of the Land
Use Element for more information on location, character, and the Covina Planning Area.
                                                  D-2

II. IDENTIFICATION AND DISCUSSION OF NATURAL RESOURCES
A.  General
    As stated in the previous chapter, under this topic, State law requires the identification of existing natural
    resources, including water and its hydraulic force; forests; soils (particularly those conducive to agriculture);
    rivers and other waters; harbors; fisheries; wildlife; minerals; and other resources, such as agricultural lands
    and air quality. This identification is intended to serve as a basis for goals, policies, and programs on resource
    conservation, development, and utilization.
    Because Covina is a flat, inland, mature, and generally built-out community, there are limited natural resources.
    (According to the Land Use Element, approximately 99% of the territory in Covina has been built upon.) The
    City does not contain any forests; noteworthy, usable agricultural soils (as verified by information received
    from the State Department of Conservation); rivers, lakes or related water bodies; harbors; fisheries; significant,
    endangered wildlife; extractable minerals; or important agricultural areas. In other words, because of long-
    term urbanization, many of the natural resource concerns relevant in coastal, rural, or less-developed cities are
    not applicable to Covina. Key natural resource issues, which are identified and discussed below, are restricted
    primarily to ground water and surface water quality and conservation, the preservation of existing, generally
    limited vegetation, wildlife and wildlife habitat, and air quality. Many of the noteworthy resource issues
    pertain to the community’s hilly southeastern enclave (the Covina Hills area). For documentation purposes,
    two resources that technically exist but from a planning or conservation standpoint are insignificant, soils and
    minerals, are also mentioned.
    It is noted that information and facts pertaining to the community’s vegetation, wildlife and wildlife habitat,
    and soils are clarified in the accompanying Technical Appendix, which is a detailed, consultant-prepared
    report on existing City natural resource conditions. Though separate, the Technical Appendix is legally part
    of this Element. Matters relating to other areas, as stated below, are referenced from general documents and
    correspondence on file in the Covina Planning Division.
B.  Identification and Discussion of Covina Natural Resources
    As stated above, the below-listed natural resources are discussed to the extent that important matters thereon,
    if any, are applicable to Covina:
    1.        Water Resources
              a.        Ground water
              b.        Unimproved flood control channels
              c.        Surface water
    2.        Vegetation and Flora
    3.        Wildlife and Wildlife Habitat, Sensitive Species, and Fauna
    4.        Air Quality
    5.        Soils
    6.        Minerals
1.  Water Resources
    The water resources of Covina consist of the following:
    a.        Ground water
    b.        Unimproved flood control channels
    c.        Surface water
    Each water resource is discussed in the respective three sections below. Applicable facts and information are
    presented within a framework relative to Covina utilization and conservation issues.
                                                       D-3

   In recognition of the importance of water and water bodies in the general plan update process, particularly
   relating to accommodating future water demands, State law (Government Code Section 65302d) requires that
   the portion of this Element pertaining to waters be prepared in coordination with any agency, district, or entity
   that has developed, served, controlled, or conserved water for the city in which the plan is composed. It is
   hereby stated that the City of Covina has complied with all aspects of this provision. (But as stated above and
   below, because Covina is generally built-out and because long-term water demands can be met, water supply
   is not seen as a critical issue.) Information received from various, applicable water agencies and entities is on
   file in the Covina Planning Division.
a. Ground water
   The City of Covina is one of several communities in the area that overlies a major ground water basin.
   Because of its constant, everyday use by Covina residents, businesses, and facilities (see third section for
   clarification), ground water is certainly one of Covina’s key water resources. The responsibility for monitoring
   and regulating ground water quality and conditions in the region rests with the Federal Environmental Protection
   Agency (EPA), the State Department of Health Services (DHS), the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality
   Control Board, and Los Angeles County. In addition, Covina water service, much of which relates to this
   resource, is provided by the City of Covina, through its Water Department, and three other purveyors (also
   discussed in third section). Therefore, the City does not have direct control over ground water quality and
   extraction. Covina’s role in protecting ground water resources is limited to 1) preventing hazardous materials
   from leaching through soils (into ground water supplies) and 2) ensuring that existing flood control system-
   related (ground water) recharge areas or spreading grounds are protected via land use regulations and, when
   utilized, guarded against illegal discharge into the surface waters (that feed groundwater basins).
   Regarding the second item mentioned above, there are two flood control spreading grounds within Covina’s
   City limits: 1) Walnut Wash at the easterly terminus of Workman Avenue and 2) Ben Lomond at the southwest
   corner of Arrow Highway and Barranca Avenue. (Refer to Existing Land Use Map for clarification.) During
   heavy storms, the spreading grounds, which are part of the Los Angeles County-owned and -managed flood
   control system, fill up with water diverted from flood control channels and washes and thus serve to reduce
   pressure on the overall network. Collected water subsequently percolates into the ground water. Although
   generally the Ben Lomond Spreading Grounds has water during and immediately after heavy rains only, the
   Walnut Wash facility typically maintains at least some water year-round. Other major ground water recharge
   areas in the City consist of unimproved segments of two flood control channels, which are discussed in the
   following section. For a more detailed discussion on the flood control system, refer to the Circulation and
   Safety Elements.
   Concerning ground water in general, in recent years, the San Gabriel Valley, particularly areas west of Covina,
   has been plagued by ground water pollution problems. Trichlorolthylene (TCE), perchloroethylene (PCE),
   and/or nitrates, all suspected cancer-causing agents, have been found in amounts high enough to warrant the
   shutting down of or restricting the use of many wells in the region. Much of this contamination occurred in
   prior decades as a result of little or no regulation of certain commercial and industrial businesses. Today, strict
   controls relating to chemical discharge are in effect, though, in some recent cases, the contamination has been
   exacerbated by illegal dumping, careless handling, and inadequate environmental enforcement. Since the
   1970s, State and Federal officials have been working with communities in the area to remedy the problem to
   the greatest extent possible.
   In Covina, water wells (operated by the City and three other purveyors) have been found to contain varying
   concentrations of nitrates. Some of the wells have been shut down immediately and others have been treated
   to meet applicable water quality standards. Therefore, in a general sense, the primary long-term effect of the
   contamination problem is one of water supply limitation, not of public health. However, this supply limitation
   will not seriously affect Covina demands because, as explained below, over the last few years the City has
   been acquiring more and more surface water (from other entities). According to local water officials, all
                                                        D-4

   demands, again, despite the contamination problem, will be met. The only downside for Covina consumers
   would be slightly high water rates resulting from the additional surface water that must be obtained.
b. Unimproved flood control channels
   There are two flood control channel segments in the community that are unimproved or were never reinforced
   with concrete and steel to appropriate engineering standards. The segments are 1) a stretch of the Charter
   Oak Wash running through the southern section of Wingate Park (just south of the Metrolink Commuter Rail
   Line, between Grand and Glendora Avenues) and 2) the northerly portion of Walnut Creek (between Puente
   Street and an area near the terminus of Chaparro Road). Both segments, which are illustrated on the
   accompanying Natural Resources and Open Space Map, are typically slightly to moderately inundated or at
   least damp during and immediately after the rainy seasons, and the areas are usually dry in the summer and in
   early fall. Thus, as previously mentioned, during certain periods, these flood control channel segments function
   as ground water recharge areas. (Flood control issues are discussed in the Circulation and Safety Elements.)
   In addition, the unimproved flood control facilities support riparian vegetation that, in turn, serves as habitat
   for certain animals and birds. This function of the unimproved channels is elaborated on below. Moreover, a
   portion of a popular horse trail runs along part of the Walnut Creek facility (discussed in Chapter III), which
   indicates a recreational purpose for one of the channels as well. In sum, these areas warrant special consideration
   in terms of land use protection and conservation.
c. Surface water
   The overwhelming majority of water supplied to Covina residents and businesses comes from surface sources
   (i.e., from various major rivers in northern California or the Colorado River, sent to the community through an
   elaborate water distribution system and then stored in local reservoirs). Because this water is inextricably
   related to and identified with its suppliers, it is appropriate to discuss surface water according to the community’s
   chief water purveyor, the Covina Water Department. (As mentioned in Section “a” above, four water agencies
   supply Covina residents and businesses with this resource, the City of Covina as well as Azusa Valley Water,
   Southern California Water Co., and Suburban Water Systems. But the City of Covina serves about two-thirds
   of the properties in the community.) In fiscal year 1995-96, 93% of the City’s water came from surface
   sources and only 7% was from underground sources—produced at its only operational well site on Grand
   Avenue, just south of Cypress Street. All surface water, it is noted, was actually purchased from the Metropolitan
   Water District (MWD, whose share of all water provided was 11%) and Covina Irrigating Company (CIC,
   82% of all water provided) and then, prior to customer transmission via an elaborate distribution system, had
   been stored in eight reservoirs at six locations. The locations are as follows: 1) 1051 East Cypress Street (1
   tank); 2) 2081 Rancho La Merced Drive (1); 3) 502 Rancho Simi Drive (1); 4) 3001 North Roycove Drive
   (1, in County); 5) 739 East Ruddock Street (1); and 701 North Sunflower Avenue (3). For clarification on
   location, refer to the accompanying City Street Map. The eight reservoirs range in size from 100,000 to 3
   million gallon capacity.
   The City of Covina Water Department has approximately 8,000 meters, which are broken down into the
   following use categories: 1) residential, 75%, 2) commercial, 12%, 3) industrial, 10%, 4) governmental,
   3%. The exact number of customers served is not known, though, according to officials with the Water
   Department, typical daily consumption averages approximately 9 to 10 million gallons per day, and all current
   water demands are being met. Average water pressures for both general consumer and fire suppression purposes
   are regarded as good, and water quality meets all applicable standards. (As mentioned previously, the relatively
   little water that the City extracts from the ground, which has been slightly contaminated with nitrates, is
   appropriately treated.) Moreover, Water Department officials believe that the City will continue to meet
   future water demands as moderate growth occurs. (Refer to Land Use Element for clarification on this area.)
                                                          D-5

   Regarding conservation, a key topic of this Element, in 1991, during the height of a drought, the City adopted
   a Water Conservation Ordinance, which defines water conservation measures and establishes progressive
   rates and over-usage penalties to be followed throughout a water shortage emergency. During the course of
   implementing the Ordinance, the City Water Department monitors and evaluates projected supply and demand
   of water by local customers and issues progress reports to the City Council. The overall intent of the Ordinance
   is to conserve water during shortages without jeopardizing public health and safety. The City Water Department
   also offers residents and businesses conservation kits and provides occasional conservation-related inserts in
   utility bills. All City efforts in this area are consistent with and further the goal and policies of this Element
   (listed below).
   Another key Covina water conservation activity concerns the Water-Efficient Landscape Ordinance, which
   was adopted in 1992 pursuant to State legislation. The Ordinance establishes clear, reasonable water conserving
   requirements pertaining to landscape and irrigation techniques and applies to all new or significantly enhanced/
   expanded developments citywide. (For existing landscaped areas, excessive water use is discouraged through
   progressive water rates.) This tool, which actually was developed as a model ordinance for east San Gabriel
   Valley communities and is administered by the City Planning Division on a project-by-project basis in the Site
   Plan Review process, has worked well in conserving water.
   As mentioned above, besides the City of Covina, three other water entities (Azusa Valley Water, Southern
   California Water, and Suburban Water Systems) provide water to approximately one-third of Covina properties.
   According to information received from these purveyors, the entities obtain their water from both ground
   water and surface sources, and all water, like that from the City, is monitored and meets the various water
   quality standards. Moreover, existing and future water pressures are deemed adequate, and all current and
   long-term demands can be met. Lastly, the three water providers also supply household conservation kits and
   furnish customers with general information on this topic.
2. Vegetation and flora
   (Regarding the following three sections, as previously mentioned, detailed facts and information are described
   in the accompanying Technical Appendix.) Because of extensive development that has occurred in Covina
   over the years and considering the fact that about 90% of the community is flat, presently most vegetation
   consists of common annual grasslands, plants, and ornamental trees, which pervade in various public (e.g.,
   street rights-of-way and parks) and private places. However, in addition to the above resources, there are
   areas of some biological significance in the generally hilly southeastern district (Covina Hills—refer to
   accompanying Natural Resources and Open Space Map), including eucalyptus, English walnut, pepper, and
   coast live oak tree species. One of the most significant ecological resources here—and in the entire City for
   that matter—is the riparian woodland community, which is situated in and around the previously mentioned
   unimproved portion of Walnut Creek. The riparian community, as described in the Technical Appendix,
   supports a wide variety of plant and animal species, though none in the Covina area are believed to be classified
   by the Federal or State government as “threatened” or “endangered.” There is also a similar, second riparian
   area in the unimproved flood control facility along the southerly portion of Wingate Park. Both such
   communities are, again, illustrated on the accompanying Natural Resources and Open Space Map and are
   further discussed below under “wildlife and wildlife habitat.”
   Another important ecological resource in the southeastern portion of Covina is the coast live oak woodland
   (tree) community, which typically grows in ravines or on north-facing slopes and is supported by mesic soil
   and moderate weather conditions. Coast live oaks also serve a wildlife habitat function as well as enhance the
   district’s unique ambience and appearance. It is further noted that other types of oak trees pervade both in
   Covina Hills and in sporadic locations of the flatlands. All oak trees in Covina are protected under local
   ordinance, a preservation mechanism that was established years ago in recognition of their statewide ecological
   and aesthetic value.
                                                       D-6

3. Wildlife and wildlife habitat, sensitive species, and fauna
   Although Covina is a mature, generally built-out suburban municipality, the City flatlands, which constitute
   most of the area in the community, provide habitat for various wildlife species common to the region. Street
   trees provide cover, feeding, and nesting habitat for small birds and reptiles. Moreover, the annual grassland
   community, which pervades on most of Covina’s private and public properties, serves as a feeding area for the
   small birds and reptiles and is used by burrowing mammals, such as pocket gophers, California ground squirrels,
   and deer mice. While the various accompanying plant species also provide habitat for many small mammals,
   both grassland and plant communities further support various raptorial birds.
   The largest number and greatest diversity of bird, reptile, and animal species occur in the above noted riparian
   woodland and coast live oak woodland communities of the southeastern Covina Hills area. Riparian zones,
   another of which, as previously mentioned, runs through Wingate Park, provide wildlife and, to a lesser
   extent, aquatic life with basic habitat, space, movement corridors, food, and cover for various reptiles, birds,
   mammals, and amphibians. Also, these zones are utilized by birds of prey as well as by migratory birds and
   amphibians.
   Furthermore, coast live oak woodlands are valuable habitat, as they provide acorn-related food, thermal cover,
   escape cover, and, because of their extensive canopies and dense foliage, nesting and perching for several
   species of reptiles, birds, and mammals. The leaves and twigs of oaks are a valuable browse material for
   foraging mammals. And a variety of insect species that are fed upon by reptiles, birds, and insectivorous
   mammals are attracted to this type of tree. As mentioned in the preceding section, other types of oak trees
   pervade throughout the entire community.
   Lastly, it is reiterated herein that the City of Covina probably does not have any species considered sensitive
   or listed as endangered on any Federal or State register. Although the Technical Appendix discusses, based on
   earlier studies, one sensitive species of bird (the Least Bell’s vireo) and one sensitive species of reptile (the
   San Diego horned lizard) as potentially existing within the City limits, their occurrence probability is considered
   low because current land use conditions are incompatible with these species’ habitats. As illustrated on the
   accompanying Natural Resources and Open Space Map, in 1949, the San Diego horned lizard was identified
   in the northwest corner of the Planning Area (presently County territory) and, in 1984, the Least Bell’s vireo
   was spotted approximately one-half mile to the west in what is now Irwindale. For clarification on these
   species and on their past and current ranges, refer to the Appendix. In general, although the bird and lizard
   were at one time seen at the indicated locations, they later were not identified by biologists preparing the
   Technical document. And surrounding the locations of the previously noted species, there had been new uses
   or developments that would appear to have precluded habitat subsistence. Regarding the Bell’s vireo, none
   are expected to appear within or near the community, though, during migration, it is conceivable that an
   individual bird could make a short stopover in Covina for foraging purposes. Also, few, if any, areas of the
   City are expected to support populations of the horned lizard. However, small numbers theoretically could be
   present within the riparian woodland community in Walnut Creek Regional Park. Should any sensitive species
   be identified in the future, then appropriate conservation/preservation actions will be considered.
4. Air quality
   Covina lies within the South Coast Air Basin (SCAB), the southern California State-designated air pollution
   control district that is known to have consistently poor air quality. This potentially unhealthy environment,
   which manifests itself in breathing difficulties, eye irritation, and other discomforts, has developed because of
   a combination of unique meteorological and naturally-occurring inversion conditions and excessively high
   pollutant emissions. Pollutant emissions in Covina emanate from both local and regional industries and
   commercial businesses (stationary sources) and motor vehicles (mobile sources), though the many thousands
   of cars and trucks operating on roads and freeways constitute approximately 70% of the emissions in the
   SCAB. The pollution problem most apparent in the Covina area is ozone, which results primarily from
   vehicle engine hydrocarbons.
                                                       D-7

   Several Federal and State laws have been passed that mandate the control of stationary and mobile sources
   toward the end of meeting particular air-related standards by preventing further air pollution and, where
   feasible, improving air quality. The agency in the SCAB empowered to design and implement plans and
   programs that enforce these laws as well as to monitor pollutant levels is the South Coast Air Quality
   Management District (SCAQMD). Two of SCAQMD’s chief pollution mitigation/abatement tools consist of
   the Air Quality Management Plan and what is simply called Regulation 15.
   The Air Quality Management Plan, which was actually developed in conjunction with the Southern California
   Association of Governments (SCAG, the main regional planning agency) is comprised of various land use,
   transportation, and energy conservation control measures that, in terms of local government responsibility,
   focus on 1) controlling what are known as indirect sources of emissions, such as roads, highways, and
   parking facilities, which attract vehicles (or mobile sources) and, as previously stated, are the major sources of
   air pollution and 2) reducing vehicular trips by adopting such methods as employee ridesharing, compressed
   work schedules, telecommuting, and efficient, sensible land use planning. (For clarification on AQMD
   components, refer to the Land Use Element Study.) Local governments, which bear the primary responsibility
   for implementing the Plan, are required to adopt measures that best suit their needs. To date, the City of
   Covina has adopted an employee compressed work week schedule, offers ridesharing incentives, encourages
   the use of alternative transportation modes, developed and continues to support the Covina Metrolink Commuter
   Train Station, and encourages mixed use developments. (The AQMP also contains emissions regulations
   applicable to industries and commercial businesses, such as requirements for installing new pollution control
   devices or using clean-burning fuels. The Plan recognizes that local jurisdictions, through land use and
   circulation system controls, can play a role in reducing emissions from these direct sources.) It is noted that
   the AQMP is periodically updated to include new strategies and programs that reflect technological
   improvements, research discoveries, AQMD policy shifts, and/or lifestyle changes. Accordingly, City
   implementation of the Plan has and will continue to be modified as well.
   Regulation 15, the other above-noted SCAQMD chief pollution mitigation/abatement tool, requires trip
   reduction and ridesharing programs for all employers with 100 or more persons. The intent of the program is
   to significantly reduce emissions from commuting vehicles, one of the chief purposes of the AQMP. The City
   of Covina presently operates and will modify, when needed, a viable trip reduction proposal, which, like the
   AQMP process and below-discussed Congestion Management Program (CMP), is administered through the
   City Environmental Services Department.
   Lastly, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA)-administered Los Angeles County Congestion
   Management Program (CMP) in part attempts to mitigate air pollution and is therefore mentioned here as
   well. The CMP, which is described in detail in the Land Use Element Background Study and in the Circulation
   Element document, is a countywide measure that aims to relieve traffic congestion, improve air quality, and
   encourage growth management by linking land use, transportation, and air quality decisions. In general,
   traffic congestion reduction, air quality enhancement, and growth management are measured by the traffic
   impacts of new or expanded development proposals on a particular network of major streets. Azusa Avenue
   in Covina is on the CMP network. The City has been adhering to the intent of this program. Concerning all
   above-noted regional air quality plans and programs, Covina will utilize the General Plan process to fulfill all
   obligations to the greatest extent feasible and practical.
5. Soils
   As stated in the previous section, because long-term urbanization and development in Covina have replaced
   and disturbed soil resources, soils in the community today have limited ecological and agricultural value.
   Notwithstanding this fact, to comply with general plan preparation guidelines, soil resources are discussed
   below.
                                                      D-8

   As detailed in the accompanying Technical Appendix, there are two general soil types or associations in
   Covina, Hanford (2-5% slopes) and Ramona-Placentia (2-5% slopes). Both associations typically occur on
   gently sloping alluvial fans at elevations to approximately 3,500 feet, and vegetation types generally consist
   of annual grasses, forbs, chamise, sage, buckwheat, and juniper. (As previously discussed, vegetation in
   Covina is typically comprised of the annual grasses, various common shrubs, and ornamental trees.) Neither
   of these soils are known to be the substrate for plant species of limited distribution or sensitive classification.
   And it is noted that in most of the City soil erosion is not a major problem and that the soils generally handle
   natural drainage, subsoil permeation, and runoff well. However, flood waters along the unimproved segment
   of Walnut Creek in Covina Hills cause some erosion around the banks of the Creek. (Soil erosion is a natural
   process by which material is removed from the earth’s surface.) But the severity of the problem is unknown
   and requires further study. (Refer to Safety Element for clarification on this issue.) Moreover, the soil
   associations are primarily utilized for residential, business, and/or, to a smaller degree, agricultural activities,
   though present and foreseeable land use patterns, development restrictions, and economic/market factors
   preclude and will continue to prevent agricultural uses.
   The lack of agriculture as a planning/conservation issue in the community is further highlighted through
   analysis of the Land Capability Classification of the U. S. Soil Conservation Service. The Classification is a
   ranking tool that groups soils into classes (I - VIII) according to their suitability for agricultural use, based on
   soil characteristics and climatic conditions. Classes I (prime agricultural) and II (potential prime agricultural)
   typically constitute the greatest concern when existing in an area used or potentially suitable for agricultural
   purposes. According to information on file in the Covina Planning Division, there are no Class I soils within
   the City limits and limited Class II soils generally in the eastern portion of the community. Most of the soils
   range from categories III to VII (which vary from “limited agricultural use potential” to “unsuited for
   agriculture”). Despite there being some Class II soils in Covina, again, soil conservation and agriculture
   preservation are not considered planning issues. As stated above, Covina is generally built-out, and there are
   virtually no remaining agricultural activities. Future agriculture would be precluded by land use constraints,
   development regulations, and economic and real estate issues.
6. Minerals
   In terms of general plan and conservation activities, minerals refer to aggregate resources, or rock, sand, and
   gravel, energy-producing fields, including oil, gas, and geothermal substances, and (for both) appurtenant
   mining operations. Concerning the aggregate resources, there are presently no mining activities in the City
   and none are expected in the future because of Covina’s built-out character, land use restrictions, and the
   potentially negative environmental and “quality of life” impacts (e.g., noise, dust, and heavy truck traffic)
   typically associated with such operations. In fact, the Covina Zoning Ordinance prohibits the extraction or
   production of aggregates. And although, according to mineral-related State information on file in the City
   Planning Division, two subsurface areas in northern Covina probably contain certain mineral deposits, State
   officials presently have declared the areas insignificant because urbanization and potentially negative incursions
   preclude any extraction. (From a geological standpoint, Covina lies in the San Gabriel alluvial fan, of which
   the underlying sedimentary material was derived from rocks exposed in the San Gabriel Mountains to the
   north. The potential value of the San Gabriel alluvial fan as a source of quality sand and gravel for use as
   construction material has been recognized for years. There are presently eight aggregate production operations
   in the area, including a major facility in Irwindale, just west of Covina.)
   Also, the State Division of Oil and Gas has indicated that there are no significant energy-producing minerals—
   or oil, gas, or geothermal fields—in the City. Therefore, there is currently no drilling or production of any of
   these elements. As was the case with aggregates, such drilling/production is and will continue to be expressly
   prohibited because of potentially negative land use, operational, and other incursions. In sum, issues associated
   with the management, drilling, extraction, and/or production of mineral resources are not of concern in the
   Covina General Plan process.
                                                       D-9

C.  Listing Of Key Existing Natural Resource Issues
    This area of discussion lists the key Covina natural resource issues, which are based on the facts and information
    presented in the previous section, related, salient material, and community input (see Chapter VII for
    clarification). Issues are important because they clarify key natural resource matters warranting attention and
    because, along with a detailed identification and discussion of natural resources themselves (the preceding
    section and Technical Appendix), issues form the basis for below-listed goals and policies and programs/
    implementation measures. Refer to the previous section and to the accompanying Technical Appendix for
    clarification on these issues and for underlying data and information. (In addition, see the Land Use Element
    and Land Use Study for an expanded discussion on matters relating to land use.)
    The natural resource issues are listed below in no particular order. It should be noted that the issues are not
    necessarily mutually exclusive.
1.  Monitoring and regulating water quality and conditions.
2.  Protecting ground water resources and remedying and handling existing ground water pollution problems.
3.  Preserving and protecting flood control system-related ground water recharge areas or spreading grounds
    (except where the entire facility or a portion thereof is determined by appropriate analysis to be no longer
    needed).
4.  Preserving and protecting unimproved segments of two flood control channels and concomitant riparian
    woodland communities for ecological, aesthetic, and other reasons.
5.  Ensuring the adequacy of water supplies to meet existing and future demands and applications.
6.  Continuing to follow various water conservation measures, such as the Water Conservation Ordinance, when
    necessary, the provision of water conservation kits, and, in reviewing development proposals, the Water-
    Efficient Landscape Ordinance.
7.  Complying with the plans and programs of all levels of government pertaining to air pollution mitigation with
    various land use and transportation control measures outlined in the Land Use and Circulation Elements.
8.  Discouraging land uses that contribute significantly to air pollution.
9.  Enforcing the Covina Oak Tree Ordinance to best protect all oak tree resources.
10. Preserving existing mature trees in private developments and in public works projects.
11. Preserving and protecting parks and recreational facilities for recreational as well as ecological and aesthetic
    reasons.
12. Continuing to require landscaping in private development proposals and in public projects in accordance with
    City standards for aesthetic and ecological reasons.
13. Providing for needed landscape improvements to the City’s parks and recreational facilities for recreational,
    ecological, and aesthetic reasons.
14. Encouraging the maintenance of landscaping in public areas and in private places.
15. Limiting development and minimizing grading in Covina Hills to preserve oak and other significant mature
    trees as well as natural features in the area.
                                                      D-10

16. Dealing with soil erosion occurring along the banks of the unimproved segment of Walnut Creek in Covina
    Hills.
17. Balancing all natural resource concerns with essential, ongoing economic development, commercial
    revitalization, housing preservation and accommodation, and community appearance and image enhancement
    efforts.
18. Committing to implement the natural resources component of the Element through following various documents,
    plans, and items and maintaining a viable inter-departmental approach.

III. IDENTIFICATION AND DISCUSSION OF OPEN SPACE LANDS
A.   General
     As discussed in the Background chapter, according to State planning law, an area of land or water that is
     essentially unimproved and devoted to or designated as a State-defined open space use must be identified and
     discussed. Open space uses, under law, consist of four categories of activities: 1) preserving natural resources
     (such as plant or animal life or wildlife habitat); 2) managing the production of resources (like forest lands,
     rivers, or ground water recharge basins); 3) maintaining areas for outdoor recreation (e.g., parks and trails);
     and 4) protecting areas for public health and safety (relating to, for example, earthquake fault zones, flood
     plains, or unstable soil areas). The identification and discussion is intended to serve as a basis for goals,
     policies, and programs on open space preservation, utilization, and enhancement.
     As previously stated, Covina is a mature and predominantly flat and built-out inland community with limited
     natural resources. Presently, open space issues focus primarily on citywide parks and related recreational
     facilities and trails, the third category noted above. The extent to which this area relates to natural resources
     is generally restricted to preserving the two riparian woodland communities (which falls under the first
     classification) and maintaining the two flood control spreading grounds or ground water recharge areas (included
     in the second category). All of the above open space lands are presented in the following section. It is noted
     that open space for protecting areas for public health and safety (the fourth State-defined classification) is a
     topic that is inapplicable to Covina.
B.   Identification and Discussion of Covina Open Space Lands
     As stated in the previous section, the below-listed open space use categories and appurtenant area types are
     discussed to the extent that important matters apply to Covina:
     1.         Open Space for the Preservation of Natural Resources
                a.        Riparian woodland communities
     2.         Open Space for the Managed Production of Resources
                a.        Flood control spreading grounds
                b.        Improved flood control channels
     3.         Open Space for Outdoor Recreation
                a.        City parks and related facilities
                b.        Trails
                          1)        Bikeways
                          2)        Equestrian trail
1.   Open Space for the Preservation of Natural Resources
a.   Riparian woodland communities
     As discussed in Chapter II and in the accompanying Technical Appendix, unimproved segments of two flood
     control channels support riparian woodland communities, which are an important ecological and aesthetic
     resource and therefore are worthy of preservation as an open space asset as well. These segments are 1) a
     stretch of the Charter Oak Wash running through the southern area of Wingate Park (just south of the Rail
     Line, between Grand and Glendora Avenues) and 2) the northerly portion of Walnut Creek (between Puente
     Street and an area near the terminus of Chaparro Road). Both segments are illustrated on the Natural Resources
     and Open Space Map. The latter riparian community as well as the channelized portion of Walnut Creek also
     run conterminous with or side on the Walnut Creek (horse and hiking) Trail, which is part of a countywide
     trail network (or, managed by Los Angeles County) and is addressed under the recreation section discussion
     below. (It is noted that although a generally unimproved creek runs through the below-described Jalapa Park,
                                                         D-13
   the creek is partially concreted and, according to the Appendix, is not a significant biological resource.)
   Designating both riparian woodlands as “park,” “open space,” or another suitable category or as a flood
   control channel on the General Plan Land Use Map would be an appropriate preservation measure. The
   community around Walnut Creek supports both ecological and recreational functions, and, although the riparian
   area in Wingate Park serves primarily natural or biological purposes, the area lies in an established recreational
   facility and therefore is logically suited for this type of protection. Other safeguards for both communities
   could include establishing appropriate, compatible land uses on adjacent properties, general preservation
   policies, and sufficient building setback standards to maintain the integrity and full functionality of the stream
   channels. Although the City of Covina presently has no other lands or parcels under this area of discussion
   that warrant preservation through open space measures, City staff will endeavor to monitor future conditions,
   discoveries, and local policy changes and, when necessary, make appropriate General Plan amendments.
2. Open Space for the Managed Production of Resources
a. Flood control spreading grounds
   As also discussed in the previous chapter, Covina has two County-managed flood control spreading grounds
   or ground water recharge areas that, because of their environmental and functional significance, constitute
   properties that legitimately qualify for open space preservation. The two facilities are 1) the Walnut Wash
   Spreading Grounds (at easterly terminus of Workman Avenue) and 2) the Ben Lomond Spreading Grounds
   (at southwest corner of Arrow Highway and Barranca Avenue). These two Spreading Grounds, which are
   components of the extensive Los Angeles County Flood Control system, could eventually accommodate
   passive or active recreational activities, a matter that warrants further study.
b. Improved flood control channels
   Improved or fully-concreted flood control channels pervade the community (in areas illustrated on Natural
   Resources and Open Space Map), are linked to the previously mentioned two local spreading grounds, and
   are described in detail in the Circulation and Safety Elements. Because the channels indirectly pertain to or
   “manage” water, a vital resource, and, with respect to certain facilities, directly connect to unimproved washes
   with riparian communities, these improved flood control passages should be designated “open space” or the
   equivalent in the long term, comprehensive planning process. Such classification would also protect local
   residents against potentially inappropriate or incompatible uses or activities in these facilities from being
   established. In addition, the elevated flood control channel access areas or portions thereof could possibly be
   available in the future for bicycles or as walking trails or exercise courses.
3. Open Space for Outdoor Recreation
a. City parks and related facilities
1) Description of facilities
   As previously stated, most of Covina’s open space lands pertaining to recreation are comprised of public
   parks and related facilities. Parks are important public places that serve the passive and active recreational
   needs of and provide essential services for the citizenry. For example, children are provided easily accessible,
   low- or no-fee activities through structured programming provided by the City’s Parks and Recreation
   Department or through the unstructured use of park amenities, such as playground equipment. Also, various
   open space lands have facilities to house wholesome, constructive youth and other activities like nonprofit
   sports leagues or scouting. Such facilities include baseball fields, soccer fields, roller hockey rinks, tennis
   courts, basketball courts, and buildings suitable for meeting purposes. Parks also provide youths with important
   after-school programs and activities. In addition, City parks benefit senior citizens a great deal too. Presently,
   the below-described Joslyn (seniors’) Center at Kelby Park houses senior-oriented programming, including
                                                      D-14

classes, entertainment, nutrition, and various unstructured activities. The Center also offers informational
referral for legal, tax, and other services. Public parks benefit whole families as well in terms of facilitating
passive activities, picnicking, playing sports, and more. And then there are organized groups, such as arts and
crafts associations, that rely on open space lands for places to conduct their occasional activities. The significant
role of parks in maintaining community image and vitality is particularly relevant in light of current and
foreseeable demographic and development trends, which were discussed in the Land Use and Housing Elements
and are elaborated on in the following section. It is noted that most matters and programs pertaining to
Covina parks are administered by the City Parks and Recreation Department.
The Covina park system consists of nine parks and two ball fields. The City owns seven of the parks, two
parks are leased from the Covina-Valley Unified School District, and recreational activities in the ball fields
are conducted under leases with the Charter Oak Unified School District. Parks are located throughout the
community and vary in size and facilities from Three Oak Park, a 0.2-acre passive area oriented for employees
of an adjacent office park in the southeastern part of the community, to Wingate Park, which is over 16 acres
in area and contains ball fields, tennis courts, a roller rink, and picnic areas in the eastern portion of the
community. Covina Park, a 10-acre multi-amenity facility located just west of the downtown, is the community’s
oldest (established in the 1920s) and most heavily used park. Most of the community’s public green spaces
were developed during the building boom period of the ‘50s and ‘60s. The accompanying Natural Resources
and Open Space Map shows the distribution of Covina parks and ball fields. In addition, Table 2 below
describes the facilities by location, acreage, classification, and ownership. Concerning the categorizing of
open space lands, the City classifies parks as follows:

            HIGHWAY. HOLLENBECK PARK IS A MAJOR, MULTI-AMENITY

        °Facility is not assigned park classification because it contains only one ball field and is used exclusively for
        baseball/softball purposes.
        Hence, the City presently has 1 mini-park (1% of acreage total), 5 neighborhood parks (32% of total), 2
        community parks (32% of total), 1 regional park (27% of total), and 2 (non-classified) ball fields (7% of total.
        There are currently no specialty use facilities in the community.) Table 2 illustrates that over the years property
        leases between the City and local school districts have been a viable method for augmenting the City’s network
        of parks. By establishing its own park classification system, the community is able to describe the scale and
        scope of its current and future parks in suitable terms.

   Table 2 and the Natural Resources and Open Space Map show that although the parks and ball fields are
   located throughout the community, over 60% of the total green space is situated between Hollenbeck and
   Barranca Avenues, the central portion of Covina. This fact and other challenges are discussed in the following
   section. Also, of the approximately 62 acres of open space lands identified in Table 2, the City owns about
   77% of the area. However, as previously stated, joint-use agreements with owners of the other 23% of the
   lands, the Covina-Valley Unified and Charter Oak Unified School Districts, ensure sufficient access for local
   citizens. All of Covina’s recreational facilities can therefore be described as diverse, primarily urban, and
   aging.
   In addition to Covina’s eleven parks and ball fields in which principal or City-administered leisure opportunities
   are provided, the Covina-Valley and Charter Oak School Districts and large private schools manage several
   campuses in and around Covina that provide supplemental green space and recreational facilities, such as
   gymnasiums, to City residents. Technically, schools in other districts would be accessible, too. But utilization
   of campuses (except where above-noted joint-use agreements exist) is often limited to non-school hours and,
   when groups such as youth sports are involved, is subject to school district-imposed fees and/or restrictions.
   And schools cannot be heavily relied upon in light of the fact that, as discussed below, many campuses have
   been closed and redeveloped to other (usually residential) uses because of changes in demographics and
   school district administrative policies. The previously mentioned matter of restrictions is also an issue when
   discussing parks and facilities in surrounding cities and Los Angeles County, of which Covina residents
   arguably use but the City of course has no administrative control over. Nevertheless, because of their generally
   broader service areas, larger sizes, and greater amenities, County facilities near Covina are worthy of discussion.
   Charter Oak Park, at 20261 Covina Boulevard, an unincorporated neighborhood (between Glendora and
   Bonnie Cove Avenues) and Walnut Creek Regional Park, which is located within the City limits of Covina
   near the “Reeder-Puente” curve in the Covina Hills area, are the closest County-operated facilities. Charter
   Oak Park is a 19-acre open space land providing generally similar amenities to those found in City parks, such
   as ball fields, basketball courts, and playgrounds. Over the past few years, because of Los Angeles County
   budget problems and below-described City open space shortfalls, several discussions regarding potential City
   lease or aquisition of the Park have occurred. The second County facility close to Covina is the Walnut Creek
   Regional Park, which, as previously mentioned, actually lies in the City. Walnut Creek Park is an approximately
   11-acre facility that is generally unimproved or rural in character and provides a passive or naturalistic setting
   and staging area for the traversing Walnut Creek (horse and hiking) Trail.
   Other County facilities within reasonable access to Covina residents are: Bonelli Regional County Park (120
   Via Verde Park Road, San Dimas); Dalton Park (18867 East Armstead Street, Azusa); the Los Angeles County
   Fairgrounds (Pomona); the Los Angeles State and County Arboretum (301 North Baldwin Avenue, Arcadia);
   Marshall Canyon Golf Course (6100 Stephens Ranch Road, San Dimas); San Dimas Canyon Park (1512
   North Sycamore Canyon Road, San Dimas); and the Santa Fe Dam Recreation Area (1550 East Arrow Highway,
   Irwindale).
   Concerning the State of California and the Federal government, there are no State parklands immediately
   available to Covina residents, though the northerly Angeles National Forest, which is managed by the United
   States Forest Service, is within ten miles of the City. The Angeles National Forest is comprised of foothills
   and mountains and provides a rustic experience that cannot be replicated in Covina’s parks. All above-
   mentioned County, State, and Federal facilities are shown in Figure 12 of the Covina Park System Master Plan
   (see below for clarification on this Plan).
2) Assessment of present and future demands
   From the standpoint of the general plan, evaluating how well a community’s parks and ball fields meet local
   demands is primarily a function of the sufficiency of total open space acreage, though the adequacy of park
   amenities and features is a topic that also warrants discussion. Concerning the total open space acreage for
   Covina recreational facilities, as indicated on Table 2 above, Covina presently has about 62 acres of parkland.
   Combining the acreage figure with the City’s most recent population count (46,452, as of January 1, 1997)
                                                      D-19

reveals that Covina has 1.3 acres of open space for each 1,000 residents. This ratio is significantly below the
generally accepted, national guideline (established by the National Park and Recreation Association, or NPRA)
of 2.5 to 4.0 acres of parkland for every 1,000 population, meaning, as far as this barometer is concerned, that
park demands are not being met. This deficiency has hampered the City for many years and, unless corrective
policies and measures are adopted and followed, the shortfall would be exacerbated in the future because of
various demographic, socio-economic, and housing development trends.
In the first place, between 1980 and 1997, because of general growth and annexations, Covina’s total population
increased by over 37% (from 33,751 to 46,452). The 1980s in particular was known as somewhat of a “mini-
boom” period. But during this 17-year interval, relatively little parkland was added/developed. Moreover,
the character of the population has been changing to one that tends to be more dependent on recreational
facilities. In the ‘80s, Covina’s youth (defined as age 17 and below) and senior citizen (age 65 and above)
populations increased by, respectively, 22% (to 25% of the total) and 42% (to about 11% of the total). These
two segments, which presently comprise about 36% of the local population, have been the City’s focus of
attention in addressing open space and recreation needs because of the mobility limitations commonly associated
with youths and seniors. Other demographic indicators point to rising incidences of single-parent households,
lower income families, and outright poverty. Refer to the Housing Study of the Housing Element for
clarification.
In addition to the above factors, changes in the composition of Covina’s housing stock have had a major
impact on increasing park demands. Specifically, since the ‘70s, because of decreasing amounts of vacant
land, rising land values, and often favorable zoning provisions, more and more multi-unit housing complexes
have been built. In fact today, over 40% of the City’s housing is comprised of apartments, condominiums, and
townhomes, which is considered a high percentage for a community in the east San Gabriel Valley. (Again,
refer to Housing Study for further details.) Such types of dwelling units have less open space for each
dwelling unit than traditional single-family detached residences, and older complexes built under previous
standards or structures erected under County review are particularly lacking in recreational areas. This condition
is most problematic for minors. Lastly, at least to a certain extent, the previously mentioned closure and
redevelopment of school district campuses, which have supplemented local parks for recreational purposes,
has decreased available green space. Several schools in Covina have been closed (and typically rebuilt to
residential uses) because of smaller increases in the number of school-age children, of which school district
officials believed warranted less classroom space, and changing school district administrative policies that
called for operating less underutilized campuses. Also, many school administrators and lay persons believe
that school facilities were overbuilt in the ‘50s and ‘60s. It is again noted that as far as the City of Covina is
concerned, the absolute number of children continues to rise, an important indicator for assessing future park
needs.
The above trends, particularly population, demographic, and housing, are expected to continue in the future,
thus exacerbating Covina’s open space deficiency. Concerning population growth, for example, the Land Use
and Housing Elements project that at the time of General Plan build-out, shortly after 2010, Covina theoretically
could have almost 25,000 more residents (71,254 total) over existing conditions (if all currently unincorporated
areas were to be annexed to the City and every presently vacant or underutilized parcel were to be built to full
potential). This means that should no additional parkland be developed or added (other than Charter Oak and
Walnut Creek Parks, which, as previously mentioned, are now managed by the County but may be acquired
by the City), Covina’s ratio of park acreage to each 1,000 population would remain at 1.3. To meet the “low
end” of the above-mentioned NPRA recommended park standard (a 2.5 ratio), the City would have to add/
develop 86 acres of green space. This is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to accomplish in a community
like Covina, which is well established, predominantly built-out, appears lacking in major underutilized lands
suitable for conversion to full-scale parks, and faced with major park funding limitations. Covina’s overall
situation with respect to parkland needs is illustrated in Table 4.

      A problem related to the overall green space deficiency is that existing facilities are not evenly distributed
      throughout the community. Over 60% of the park and ball field acreage is located between Hollenbeck and
      Barranca Avenues. And many blocks and neighborhoods that are outside of this central section (or, the
      western and eastern districts of Covina) consist of apartments, condominiums, townhouses, and mobile home
      parks, the residents of which, as previously stated, tend to be more park-dependent.
      As indicated in the beginning of this section, the General Plan process also addresses the adequacy of park
      amenities and features in existing facilities. Table 3 above illustrated the various amenities found in Covina’s
      parks and ball fields. As previously noted, the City’s recreational facilities are diverse, though aging. Therefore,
      according to the City’s Parks and Recreation Department, many improvements in park amenities are needed
      in order for Covina to adequately serve a growing, changing population. In fact, because of the City’s built-
      out character and funding limitations, the rehabilitation and enhancement of existing facilities likely will be
      more viable than acquisition and development of new open space lands.
      Over the years, the chief documents in which necessary park improvements have been presented, discussed,
      and prioritized have been the annually updated, five-year Capital Improvement Program (CIP) and
      corresponding City Budget. For example, under both “funded” and “unfunded” sections, the current CIP
      lists, for various facilities, a range of proposals relating to the addition or enhancement of the following key
      features: ball fields, benches, curb ramps, drinking fountains, landscaping and irrigation systems, lighting
      (security and athletic), parking lots, picnic facilities, playgrounds, recreation and maintenance buildings,
      restrooms, signage, and walkways. It is important to point out that in recent years the City has undertaken
      many of the above and other enhancement projects pertaining to certain parks, thus following long-standing
      policies to stabilize and preserve existing facilities in a reasonable fashion to the greatest extent possible. And
      major proposals that will confer significant, long-term benefits on the community have recently been completed
      or are nearing fruition, including the reconstruction of the pool complex at Covina Park, the complete
      redevelopment of Edna Park, the expansion of the Joslyn Senior Center at Kelby Park, and the first phase of
      the Wingate Park improvement project (addition of paved parking, picnic facilities, roller hockey rinks,
      basketball courts, restrooms, and more).
      Despite all the enhancements that have been done up to this point, many more park improvements or additions
      are in fact needed to ensure the suitability and functionality of Covina’s recreational facilities for current and
      future, increasing users. For example, according to the Parks and Recreation Department, the City shows
      strong demand for a youth center and a gymnasium. In addition, continued, appropriate maintenance of parks
                                                         D-21

   and ball fields is essential as well. As is the case with roads, water mains, and other components of the City’s
   infrastructure, the features in Covina’s parks are aging (and, in some instances subject to abuse) and therefore
   require more attention and upkeep. Unfortunately, budget reductions have and likely will continue to hinder
   maintenance efforts. The importance of park improvement and maintenance is underscored by the fact that,
   as previously mentioned, the City’s built-out character and other constraints will likely hinder acquiring and
   developing additional parkland (or, resolving the identified shortfall in total open space acreage). Nevertheless,
   both park development and facility enhancement and maintenance are important matters that warrant
   appropriate, below presented policies and programs as well as further analyses. Also, these matters will have
   to be carried out in a manner that is cost effective, prioritized, systematic, and reflective of community sentiment/
   desires and City Council policy orientations. Lastly, it is noted that many of the challenges on this topic facing
   Covina have been addressed in the community’s Park System Master Plan, which is discussed separately in
   the following section.
3) Covina Park System Master Plan
   To best define and address the community’s open space-related challenges and deficiencies noted in the
   previous section, the City Parks and Recreation Department recently prepared—and in September 1995 the
   City Council adopted—the Covina Park System Master Plan. This Plan, which was developed based on an
   extensive citizen input process and on a thorough identification of applicable issues, mandates, considerations,
   and user demands, contains a comprehensive inventory and assessment of existing recreational facilities and
   sets uniform, consistent standards, guidelines, and policies for the improvement, development, maintenance,
   and utilization of all open space lands. The proposal includes detailed sections on park enhancement funding
   and prioritization and implementation. In short, the Master Plan is a tool that will guide decisions and actions
   on park-related matters over the next 20 years.
   In preparing the Natural Resources and Open Space Element, the Planning staff has incorporated the following
   provisions of the Park System Master Plan (not listed in any particular order) that directly relate to the General
   Plan update process:
   1.        An appropriate goal for future park acreage would be 2.0 acres for each 1,000 population (to be
             achieved by the final or 20th year of Master Plan implementation).
   2.        The lease of property held by school districts or other entities augments the quantity and variety of
             City parkland, and, therefore, future leases of land would be a viable approach toward meeting park
             acreage goals.
   3.        Future capital facilities or amenities that are particularly needed in the City are a youth center,
             development of a ball park with approximately 4 fields, and a gymnasium.
   4.        In light of the City’s built-out nature and funding limitations, Covina should consider practical,
             creative approaches to acquiring additional open space acreage, including, but not limited to, the
             development of mini-parks, small neighborhood parks, and specialty parks, which do not require a
             high level of consolidated land. The City should also consider converting previously developed
             properties for use as park space through leasing additional school district campuses, leasing church
             or institutional properties, purchasing or leasing vacant residential lots or parcels where housing is
             no longer viable, and converting existing public rights-of-way to recreational uses.
   5.        Because of recent and potentially additional budget freezes and reductions, the City must consider
             that future park development be comprised of low-maintenance facilities, and, considering the upkeep
             of open space resources in general, that the City prioritize maintenance such that the safety of park
             users is a top priority, when necessary.
   6.        Rehabilitation or renovation of existing parks and facilities should generally take precedence over
             the establishment of new parks and facilities.
                                                         D-22

7.        To best describe the scale and scope of its current and future parks, the City should continue to utilize
          its own park classification system.
8.        Park design must take into account the personal comfort of parks users, including, where desired,
          reasonable access to restrooms.
9.        Although aesthetic characteristics and the prioritization of aesthetic improvements will vary from
          park to park, to the extent feasible, there should be complementary color schemes in each park.
10.       The City must endeavor to comply with Federal and State laws and guidelines concerning access for
          individuals with disabilities, safety components (e.g., pertaining to playgrounds), and pesticides.
11.       The community must comply with all State and local laws relating to water conservation, such as
          Covina’s Water-Efficient Landscaping Ordinance.
12.       The City should visibly follow the recycling efforts expected of its residents and should comply with
          all California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) regulations relating to the environmental impacts
          of park projects.
13.       Covina will continue to pay particular attention to the open space/recreational needs of young people
          and seniors, who presently and will likely continue to comprise the majority of park users in the
          community.
14.       Where organized, consistent activities, such as arts and crafts exhibits, or occasional events, like
          fairs, occur in parks, the City will attempt to balance, on the one hand, the needs of activity participants
          with, on the other hand, the legitimate open space/recreational demands of citizens and the concerns
          of park neighbors pertaining to actual or perceived incursions.
15.       Because of limited financial resources, future improvements to the Covina park system must be
          prioritized.
16.       In expanding and enhancing its network of open space lands, the City will have to strike a reasonable
          balance between costs versus benefits, whereby the community would be able to develop and sustain
          a park system that embodies community recreation, ensures public safety, and encourages optimum
          usage of available green space, while avoiding an undue financial burden.
17.       In funding future park enhancements, the most viable methods appear to be monies from available
          grants or various foundations, though the City should consider other alternatives, including (in general
          order of estimated reliability and practicality of source) establishing a citywide landscape district, a
          special tax, user fees, community donations/corporate sponsorships, bonds, establishing a nonprofit
          organization, general fund monies, funding from the Covina Redevelopment Agency (CRA), and/or
          certificates of participation.
The above provisions of the Park System Master Plan have been incorporated into the below-presented goal,
policies, and programs/implementation measures. For clarification on any of the above statements, refer to
the Park System Plan. It is noted, however, that, in relation to the General Plan revision process, the Plan is not
considered to be adopted by reference. Therefore, minor or inapplicable changes or updates of the document
do not necessarily trigger a General Plan amendment.
                                                    D-23

b) Trails
1) Description of facilities
   Covina has limited trail-related networks that supplement the park system in addressing the recreational needs
   of the City’s residents. A few streets are designated as bicycle ways, and there are two equestrian/hiking trails
   that run through the community, as depicted on Map 2. These networks are discussed below.
   The City has a small, 3 1/2-mile network of bicycle routes on portions of various primary and secondary
   arterial and collector streets, as defined in the Circulation Element, namely Lark Ellen, Hollenbeck, and
   Grand Avenues and Badillo Street as well as a single, approximately mile-long bike lane on a stretch of
   Glendora Avenue, from Badillo to Cienega Streets. In general, routes provide for sign-designated bike travel
   on streets on a basis that is non-restricted or shared with vehicles. Bicycle lanes, on the other hand, provide
   for restricted (during school hours only), one-way bike travel on a striped lane of a street.
   The bicycle today finds and will continue to attract both functional and recreational usage. From a functional
   standpoint, nonmotorized transportation is important for persons such as students, employed individuals who
   cannot afford a car, and persons running an errand. On the recreational side, bicycles provide an opportunity
   for individuals, families, and groups to get exercise, socialize, and experience the outdoors. Many private
   retail stores and commercial and public centers in Covina have bike racks, which facilitate bicycle usage. The
   bikeways of Covina were established in the 1970s as part of a regional network of bike lanes and routes and
   today facilitate a viable alternative means of transportation. Much of Covina’s bike usage of course occurs on
   non-bikeway streets as well. For additional details on bikeways, refer to the Circulation Element.
   The other facet of Covina’s trail network pertains to two trails suitable for both equestrian and hiking purposes.
   These facilities, as illustrated on the Natural Resources and Open Space Map, are located in the hilly, less
   intensively developed southeastern area and are, first of all, the Peter F. Schabarum or Walnut Creek Trail,
   which runs along or close to Walnut Creek (part of which is along the previously mentioned, environmentally
   sensitive riparian habitat) and in and near the Village Oaks Office Park and is one segment of a major regional
   path that stretches from the base of the San Gabriel Mountains (in Claremont) to the Pacific Ocean (in Seal
   Beach). A portion of this trail passes through Jalapa Park. The second facility is a “general County trail” that
   branches off from the Walnut Creek Trail at Holt Avenue and Park View Drive and then runs on Holt and
   Covina Hills Road, where it connects to an extensive system of paths in the City of San Dimas. All such routes
   in Covina (incorporated and unincorporated territories) total approximately 4.5 miles.
   Unlike the bikeways, the trails serve primarily a recreational function (as opposed to both recreational and
   functional purposes) and serve fewer residents (generally in the southeastern district), particularly relating to
   horses. But the trails also reinforce the more rural atmosphere of the Covina Hills area. Therefore, they
   provide another dimension to the City’s open space lands and, along with bikeways, are worthy of utilization
   and preservation.
2) Assessment of present and future demands
   Unlike relating park acreage for every 1,000 residents in a community, there is no common, generally acceptable
   standard for evaluating the adequacy of trails. Trail suitability is a subjective matter that typically varies from
   community to community according to the extent of existing facilities and local location, character, demographic
   and economic factors, needs, and sentiments. In Covina, based on observations and analyses of several
   applicable factors, including current trail networks, demographic characteristics, and citizen views ascertained
   from various citizen participation measures (see Chapter VIII below), staff believes that bikeways currently
   and will continue to receive much more usage than the equestrian/hiking trails. Therefore, while it appears
   reasonable to continue maintaining both trail/route networks, future enhancement/expansion efforts should
   focus on the bikeway system. The extent to which bikeway improvements are warranted is an issue that
                                                      D-24

   requires further study. In other words, as indicated in the program section, on an ongoing basis, Covina
   officials will consider resident demands in developing any proposals in this area. It is important to point out,
   however, that the City views dealing with the previously discussed deficiencies in total open space acreage
   and in the inadequate or incomplete features of many parks as the highest recreational priority.
3) Linkages to State trails network
   When discussing trails in the General Plan, under law, the City is also required to “consider the feasibility of
   integrating its trail routes with appropriate segments of the State system.” In preparing this Element, the City
   spoke to officials from the State Department of Parks and Recreation and reviewed the most current California
   Recreational Trails Plan. There are no portions of the statewide network (which covers hiking, equestrian,
   bicycling, boating, and off-highway trails/routes) that run in or within many miles of Covina. Therefore, this
   matter is moot. (As discussed earlier, however, the northerly, Federal-managed Angeles National Forest has
   many trails and is indirectly linked to Covina via bikeways and equestrian/hiking routes. But the exact
   recreational benefit conferred to local residents by this obtuse connection is difficult to quantify.) The City
   will monitor for any changes in the State Trails Plan relating to Covina.
C. Listing of Key Existing Open Space Issues
   This area of discussion lists the key Covina open space issues, which are based on the facts and information
   presented in the previous section, related, salient material, and community input (see Chapter VII for
   clarification). As stated in the section on natural resources, issues are important because they clarify key open
   space matters warranting attention and because, along with a detailed identification and discussion of open
   space resources themselves (the preceding section and Technical Appendix), issues form the basis for below-
   listed goals and policies and programs/implementation measures. Refer to the previous section, to the
   accompanying Technical Appendix, and to the Covina Park System Master Plan for clarification on these
   issues and for underlying data and information. (In addition, see the Land Use Element and Land Use Study
   for an expanded discussion on matters relating to land use.)
   The open space issues are listed below in no particular order. It should be noted that the issues are not
   necessarily mutually exclusive.
   1.        Preserving and protecting all parks, ball fields, and schools to maintain recreational opportunities.
   2.        Maintaining joint-use agreements with school districts to provide Covina residents with open space
             lands that supplement the City’s park system.
   3.        Preserving and protecting unimproved segments of two flood control channels and concomitant
             riparian communities for recreational, ecological, aesthetic, and other reasons.
   4.        Preserving and protecting various improved flood control channels for functional, potential
             recreational, and other reasons.
   5.        Recognizing that the City has an open space deficiency and attempting to resolve the problem by
             acquiring and developing additional parkland, whenever feasible.
   6.        Attempting to locate new parks where most needed, such as in the western and eastern portions of
             the community or in neighborhoods with multiple-family housing.
   7.        Considering creative approaches to parkland acquisition, such as through developing mini-parks and
             small neighborhood parks, converting previously utilized properties, and obtaining additional joint-
             use agreements with school districts.
                                                     D-25

8.  Continuing efforts to enhance existing parks and recreational facilities to improve overall park use,
    safety, and appearance.
9.  Placing a higher priority on park enhancement and rehabilitation than on park development, in general.
10. Considering the Covina Park System Master Plan as a framework for addressing and resolving various
    park-related deficiencies.
11. Paying particular attention to the recreational needs of the City’s less mobile segments, such as
    young people and senior citizens.
12. Monitoring demographic, socio-economic, and other trends in Covina to detect any needed changes
    to City recreational strategies or programs.
13. Offering sufficient, cost-effective programs and services to address local needs and interests.
14. Providing for the adequate, efficient use of park and recreational facilities and resources.
15. Handling and maintaining the City’s limited networks of bicycle ways and equestrian/hiking trails.
16. Using the City’s park classification system as the appropriate tool for categorizing and enhancing the
    City’s park system.
17. Considering various factors in the design of new or remodeling/enhancement of existing recreational
    facilities, including attractiveness, functionality, accessibility, durability of materials, appropriateness
    and water efficiency of landscaping, potential negative impacts on adjacent properties, and, in
    particular, public safety.
18. Prioritizing needed park amenities and facility enhancements, focusing on the Covina Park System
    Master Plan and City Capital Improvement Program as bases for decision-making.
19. Considering to establish building setback standards along the unchanneled portions of the two
    unimproved flood control channels for environmental protection purposes.
20. Ensuring that changes to bicycle ways and equestrian/hiking trails meet the appropriate design and
    access requirements.
21. Providing adequate, cost-effective maintenance of park and recreational facilities and trails, utilizing
    as many resources as available, and regarding safety for park and trail users as a top priority.
22. Providing adequate handicap accessibility in new and enhanced parks and recreational facilities and
    regarding the retrofitting of existing facilities as a high priority.
23. Balancing the needs of various park users, including general recreation-seeking citizens and organized
    groups.
24. Following appropriate security measures, such as sufficient supervision, in the operation of parks
    and recreational facilities to discourage and combat, among other problems, graffiti and vandalism
    and regarding public safety in parks and recreational facilities as a high priority.
25. Continuing to require residential developments to contain minimum on-site open space in accordance
    with City standards to supplement public facilities.
                                              D-26

26.   Maintaining a land use plan and concomitant standards that best support and further City park and
      recreational efforts.
27.   Balancing all park and recreational concerns with essential, ongoing economic development,
      commercial revitalization, housing preservation and accommodation, and community appearance
      and image enhancement efforts.
28.   Committing to implement the parks and recreation component of the Element through following
      various documents, plans, and items and maintaining a viable inter-departmental approach.
29.   Ensuring that funding mechanisms and sources for park and recreational facility development,
      enhancement, and maintenance are viable, cost-effective, and administratively and financially feasible
      as well as reflective of guidelines established in the Park System Master Plan.

IV. GOALS AND POLICIES
A.  General
    As stated in the Introduction above, the goals and policies of this General Plan chapter are important because,
    along with the below-presented implementation measures, they serve as the chief tools with respect to local
    decisions and actions in evaluating natural resource matters, open space land issues and proposals, private
    developments, and public projects. The goals and policies, again as previously indicated, are based on the
    community’s key natural resource- and open space-related conditions and issues (described in, respectively,
    Chapters II and III above), which were both identified by City staff and ascertained through public comment.
    In theory, then, the goals and policies presented here (and accompanying implementation measures) bridge
    the gap between where the community is and what type of city it wishes to become. As was the case with the
    discussion of conditions and issues, the natural resource and open space goals and policies are presented
    below in separate sections, a format that the City believes is most appropriate. However, in recognition of the
    interrelatedness of the two areas, several policies overlap.
    A goal is defined as a general expression of an ideal future condition or state toward which the community
    wishes to advance. A policy, on the other hand, is a statement that most directly guides decision-making and
    actions. In order for policies to be meaningful and useful, they must be clear and unambiguous, a guideline
    that this Element has followed. Policies should also indicate clear local government commitment. Therefore,
    all below policies are listed within the context of “The City shall . . .” and are worded in plain English.
B.  Goal and Policies - Natural Resources
    In applying the two terms to natural resources, one goal and several policies are utilized. All policies are listed
    within a framework relative to three topical areas. The City believes that this organization is most logical and
    best suited for preserving identified natural resources. The goal is:
              A setting in which a high environmental quality is achieved through the bona fide conservation and
              protection of existing natural resources.
    The remainder of this section is devoted to the policies. For each topical area, policies are listed in no particular
    order. The three topical areas are:
    1.        Water resources and air quality
    2.        Vegetation and wildlife
    3.        General matters
    The topical areas are not entirely mutually exclusive, and, therefore, some policies from different groupings
    are similar. Also, the goal and policies are applied on a citywide basis, unless expressly stated otherwise.
1.  Policy Area 1
    Water Resources and Air Quality
    The City shall:
a.  Support the efforts at all levels of government to monitor and regulate water quality and conditions, ensuring
    that all applicable standards are met.
                                                      D-29

b. Support the efforts at and various codes and standards of all levels of government to protect ground water
   resources from depletion and sources of pollution, such as soil-leaching hazardous materials.
c. Support Federal, State, and regional efforts to remedy existing ground water pollution problems.
d. Continue local efforts to handle ground water contamination problems, including, but not limited to, shutting
   down or reconstructing water wells and appropriately treating water from operating wells to meet all applicable
   water quality standards.
e. Ensure that existing flood control system-related ground water recharge areas or spreading grounds (Ben
   Lomond at the southwest corner of Arrow Highway and Barranca Avenue and Walnut Wash at the easterly
   terminus of Workman Avenue) are preserved and protected via land use regulations (except where the entire
   facility or a portion thereof is determined by appropriate analysis to be no longer needed) and, when utilized,
   guarded against illegal discharge into surface waters (that feed ground water basins).
f. Preserve and protect in their natural conditions, through appropriate land use controls, development standards,
   and any other reasonable measures, the unimproved segments of two flood control channels running through
   Covina (Charter Oak Wash in Wingate Park and Walnut Creek in the Covina Hills/southeastern area) and
   concomitant elements, such as soil conditions, as important functional, ecological, biological, aesthetic, and
   passive open space resources.
g. Minimize the alteration of drainage patterns in Covina Hills to preserve the stream flow in and immediately
   abutting the unimproved section of Walnut Creek.
h. Handle the problem of soil erosion occurring along the banks of the unimproved portion of Walnut Creek and
   elsewhere.
i. Ensure the adequacy of water supplies to meet all existing and future demands and applications, particularly
   public safety.
j. Where necessary, work with other water providers serving Covina residents and businesses to ensure sufficient
   service and to communicate important issues and needs.
k. Ensure adequate water pressure for all uses and purposes.
l. Follow the Covina Water Conservation Ordinance, when necessary, and provide conservation kits and general
   information to best promote water conservation.
m. Follow the City’s Water-Efficient Landscape Ordinance for the sites of new and significantly expanded/
   remodeled developments as a viable conservation tool.
n. Encourage the incorporation of water conservation features in the design of all new and significantly expanded/
   remodeled developments and in the installation of conservation devices in existing developments, including,
   but not limited to, low-flow toilets and shower registers.
o. Comply with applicable portions of Federal, State, regional, and County plans and programs pertaining to air
   pollution mitigation/air quality enhancement by following, in a manner that recognizes local needs, issues,
   views, and policy and financial constraints, various vehicular emissions-reducing and traffic congestion-reducing
   land use and transportation control and energy conservation measures, proposals, and policies outlined in the
   Land Use and Circulation Elements, to the greatest extent feasible and practical.
p. Encourage and support the use of mass transit, whenever possible, and work with transit operators to provide
   the best, most efficient service for local residents and businesses to reduce vehicular travel and air pollution.

C. Goal and Policies - Open Space Lands
   As was the case with the above section on natural resources, one goal and several policies are utilized for this
   area, and the policies are listed within a framework relative to seven topical areas. The City believes that an
   organization of this type is most logical and appropriate for addressing open space and park conditions and
   issues. The goal is:
            A complete, well-balanced, and functional system of parks, open space facilities, and trails and
            appurtenant thorough, viable programs and services that meet the diverse active and passive
            recreational needs of current and future Covina residents.
   The remainder of this section is devoted to the policies. For each topical area, policies are listed in no particular
   order. The seven topical areas are:
   1.       Retention, development, and enhancement of park and recreational facilities
   2.       Recreational programs
   3.       Trail facilities
   4.       Design and landscaping of parks, trails, and recreational facilities
   5.       Maintenance of parks, trails, and recreational facilities
   6.       Safety, accessibility, security, and miscellaneous matters
   7.       Funding
   The topical areas are not entirely mutually exclusive, and, therefore, certain policies from different groupings
   are similar. Also, the goal and policies are applied on a citywide basis, unless expressly stated otherwise.
1. Policy Area 1
   Retention, Development, and Enhancement of Park and Recreational Facilities
                                                     D-33

   residential, school, institutional, and/or other appropriate, compatible categories to prevent unreasonable
   encroachments thereon.
c. Maintain joint-use agreements with school districts to provide Covina residents with open space lands that
   supplement the City’s park system and attempt to ensure, to the greatest degree possible, that such agreements
   afford local residents with maximum accessibility to school campus facilities.
d. Preserve and protect in their natural conditions the unimproved segments of the Charter Oak Wash (running
   through Wingate Park) and Walnut Creek (which passes through the Covina Hills area) by way of appropriate
   General Plan and Zoning designations and standards and any other reasonable measures as important functional,
   ecological, aesthetic, and passive open space resources.
e. To the greatest degree possible, encourage land uses adjacent to the unchanneled portions of Walnut Creek
   and Charter Oak Washes to consist of low density residential, park/open space, or other appropriate, compatible
   categories to prevent unreasonable encroachments thereon.
f. Preserve and protect the various improved flood control channels through appropriate General Plan and Zoning
   designations and standards and any other reasonable measures (excluding minor, excess portions thereof that

h. Endeavor to provide for its citizens a total park acreage equal to 2.0 acres for every 1,000 population at the
   time of General Plan buildout.
i. Whenever possible and feasible, attempt to acquire and improve land for park and recreational uses.
j. Consider to emphasize locating new parklands in the western and eastern portions of the community, in
   neighborhoods in and around apartments and condominiums/townhomes, and in other areas that are markedly
   deficient in open space.
k. Consider creative, practical approaches to acquiring additional open space acreage, including, but not limited
   to, developing mini-parks, small neighborhood parks, and specialty parks and, through additional lease
   agreements or outright purchases, consider opportunities to convert previously developed properties, such as
   closed school campuses, vacant churches or other institutional facilities, utility company lands, vacant residential
   lots (where housing is no longer viable), public rights-of-way, and, if feasible and/or not in conflict with other
   City proposals, areas in and/or around the flood control spreading grounds, to recreational functions.
l. When deliberating upon opportunities to enter into lease agreements for additional properties to augment the
   City park system, address salient factors including, but not limited to, quantity of land, variety of available
   recreational facilities, terms of leases, operation, and maintenance.

V. PROGRAMS/IMPLEMENTATION MEASURES
   Under State law, this Natural Resources and Open Space Element must contain programs/implementation
   measures. Programs supplement goals and policies and serve as a key implementation mechanism. In other
   words, as stated in the Introduction, programs ensure that the Element’s goals and policies will reach fruition.
   For clarification on the goals and policies and how they have shaped the development of this section, refer to
   Chapter IV.
   The Covina Natural Resources and Open Space Element programs/implementation measures are listed below.
   Some of the programs/measures are currently active, though many would commence upon Element adoption.
   Programs that are proposed are believed best suited and viable for the City.
   For reasons of simplicity and clarity, the programs/measures are divided into three below-listed subject areas.
   The categorization generally follows that of the policies. Within each topical area, the programs are listed in
   no particular order. The three subject areas are:
   A.        Natural Resources
   B.        Open Space Lands
   C.        Inter-Topic General Matters
A. NATURAL RESOURCES
1. Monitoring and Regulating Water Quality and Conditions
   Water is one of Covina’s key resources, and, therefore, its well-being is vital to the community. The City will
   support efforts at all government levels to ensure that each and every standard and code pertaining to drinking
   water and ground water resources are met.
2. Ground Water Pollution/Contamination Remediation and Abatement
   As previously described in this Element, ground water pollution/contamination has been a problem in the
   area. The City will support efforts at all government levels to remedy and abate or handle ground water
   pollution, including local actions to shut down wells and properly treat extracted water as well as ensure that
   future problems are minimized to the greatest extent possible, such that water removed therefrom meets each
   and every applicable standard and code.
3. Water Service Provision
   Covina will ensure sufficient water service and supplies for local residents and businesses as well as adequate
   water pressure, particularly for emergency purposes, and, where necessary, work with other water providers
   serving the City thereupon.
4. Water Conservation Measures
   Water conservation is an important component of any natural resources process. The City will continue to
   follow its various conservation measures, including the Water Conservation Ordinance, when necessary, the
   Water-Efficient Landscape Ordinance, in both private developments and public areas, the provision of water
   conservation kits and related, general information, and encouraging the incorporation of water as well as
   energy conservation features and devices in new buildings and existing structures.
                                                    D-43

5.  Air Pollution Mitigation/Air Quality Enhancement Measures
    The community will continue to follow in a reasonable manner various measures, proposals, and strategies
    outlined in the Land Use and Circulation Elements that comply with applicable portions of Federal, State,
    regional, and County plans and programs and aim to reduce vehicle emissions and traffic congestion as well
    as to provide alternative modes of transportation.
6.  General Plan and Zoning Use Controls
    The City will preserve and protect via General Plan and Zoning land use regulations (e.g., open space zoning
    designations) 1) flood control system-related ground water recharge areas or spreading grounds (except
    where the entire facility or a portion thereof is determined by appropriate analysis to be no longer needed); 2)
    the unimproved segments of two flood control channels (Charter Oak Wash and Walnut Creek) and concomitant
    ecologically and aesthetically important riparian woodland communities; 3) applicable portions of improved
    flood control channels; and 4) parks, ball fields, and related facilities.
7.  General Plan, Zoning, and Design Guidelines Development Standards
    Covina will preserve and protect the ecologically and aesthetically important riparian woodland communities
    in and abutting the unimproved segments of the Charter Oak Wash and Walnut Creek flood control channels
    through reasonable standards and provisions (e.g., minimum building setbacks, if appropriate) as well as
    follow appropriate measures thereof to limit development and hillside grading in the Covina Hills area for
    aesthetic, ecological, and drainage reasons.
8.  Tree Conservation Measures
    The City will continue to follow its Oak Tree Ordinance to protect oak tree resources, particularly the coast
    live oak woodland community in the Covina Hills area, will follow applicable portions of the Design Guidelines
    to preserve existing mature trees, whenever feasible, in private construction or redevelopment proposals, and
    will encourage the retention of existing full-grown trees in conjunction with public works projects.
9.  Private and Quasi-Public Landscaping
    For aesthetic and ecological reasons, Covina will continue to require that new and expanded or remodeled
    developments incorporate adequate landscaping, in accordance with Zoning, Design Guidelines, and general
    landscape installation provisions, and the City will continue to require the reasonable upkeep and maintenance
    of landscaping thereupon as well as in public rights-of-way, in accordance with all applicable standards.
10. Public Landscaping
    For aesthetic and ecological reasons, the community will continue to provide for landscape improvements as
    well as upkeep and maintenance, to the greatest extent feasible, in City sidewalks, streets, parks and recreational
    facilities, and other public places, in accordance with all applicable provisions and standards.
11. Monitoring of Natural Resources Environment
    The Planning Division will periodically monitor the natural resources environment to note any discoveries or
    changes in conditions arising from future private developments or public projects. Where necessary, appropriate
    action will be taken, such as following new General Plan policies and/or considering to incorporate additional
    implementation measures.
                                                       D-44
B. Open Space Lands
1. General Plan and Zoning Use Controls
   As previously indicated in this Element, the City has a relatively limited amount of open space lands and
   therefore must preserve and protect through General Plan and Zoning regulations (e.g., open space zoning
   designations) existing parks, ball fields, and schools to maintain recreational opportunities and confer other
   benefits for the community.
2. School Campus Joint-Use Agreements
   Covina presently leases certain recreational facilities from school districts, which provide local residents with
   important open space resources that supplement the City’s park system. The community will maintain these
   joint-use agreements and, where feasible and beneficial to the community, will consider opportunities to enter
   into additional leases with public school entities and other organizations.
3. Park Acquisition and Development Efforts
   The City will attempt to acquire and improve land for park and recreational uses, whenever possible and
   feasible, particularly in and around areas that are markedly deficient in open space, considering creative,
   practical approaches, such as mini-parks, small neighborhood parks, and specialty use facilities.
4. Park Improvement and Enhancement Efforts
   Covina is in need of many park improvements. The City will continue to upgrade, enhance, and/or redesign
   parks and recreational facilities and appurtenant amenities to improve overall park use, safety, and/or appearance.
5. Park Classification System
   The City of Covina classifies parks and recreational facilities according to size, service area, and amenities
   and will continue to use this hierarchy as a guide in categorizing, preserving, expanding, and enhancing the
   City’s park system.
6. Covina Park System Master Plan
   The community’s Park System Master Plan contains an inventory and appraisal of existing recreational facilities
   and establishes standards and guidelines for the utilization, development, and improvement as well as
   maintenance of all open space lands. Covina will consider the Plan as a viable resource for acquiring and
   enhancing parks and developing major, needed resources on a prioritized, cost-effective basis. The Park Plan
   should be implemented to the greatest extent feasible.
7. Park and Recreational Facility Design
   In developing new and improving existing parks and recreational facilities and appurtenant amenities, the
   City will follow all site design, building architecture, aesthetic, general and handicap accessibility, signage,
   public safety, and security standards, provisions, and guidelines of the General Plan, Zoning Ordinance,
   Design Guidelines, Park Master Plan, and other applicable documents to maintain and bolster the park system’s
   overall function.
                                                      D-45

8.  Park and Recreational Facility Landscaping
    The City will follow all landscape standards, provisions, and guidelines of the General Plan, Zoning Ordinance,
    Design Guidelines, Park Master Plan, Water-Efficient Landscape Ordinance, and other applicable documents
    in installing new or replacing existing park or recreational facility landscaping.
9.  Park System Needs Accommodation
    In handling recreational matters, Covina will continue to pay close attention to the open space and recreational
    needs of the less mobile segments of the City’s population, particularly young people, senior citizens, and
    lower income households, and will monitor various communitywide demographic, social, and economic trends
    and views to identify where changes in needs occur.
10. Recreational Programs
    The City Parks and Recreation Department presently offers a variety of recreational programs and activities
    for persons of different ages, backgrounds, and needs. Covina will continue to offer quality, cost-effective
    recreational programs, activities, and services and, where necessary, enhance and change recreational activities
    to better satisfy the community.
11. General Security
    Covina will continue to follow appropriate general security measures, such as sufficient park supervision and
    regular police patrols, as part of ongoing park operations, to discourage and combat graffiti, vandalism, and
    illicit activities.
12. Park Usage Agreements
    The City Parks and Recreation Department presently oversees and will continue to administer various park
    usage agreements and policy guides thereof for different entities and organizations to ensure the coordinated
    and reasonable utilization of Covina’s parks and recreational facilities.
13. Park and Recreational Facility Maintenance
    The upkeep of parks is understandably important. Therefore, Covina will continue maintaining the physical
    condition, operation, cleanliness, and appearance of parks and recreational facilities and appurtenant amenities
    in an adequate, efficient, and cost-effective manner, reflective of all applicable procedures and standards and
    emphasizing the safety of park users.
14. Playground Retrofitting
    The City will attempt to retrofit all existing playgrounds for safety reasons, to the greatest degree feasible, on
    an organized, systematic basis.
15. Accessibility for the Disabled
    Covina will endeavor to retrofit existing parks and recreational facilities and appurtenant amenities for the
    disabled on an organized, systematic basis, and the community will pay attention to the needs of disabled
    persons pertaining to park facilities, amenities, and programs.
16. Supplemental Open Space Provision
    The community maintains standards and provisions under the Zoning Ordinance and Design Guidelines that
    require all residential uses, notably apartment and condominium/townhouse complexes as well as certain
                                                       D-46

    nonresidential developments to provide a minimum amount of open space, which fulfills general City health,
    safety, and vitality goals but also supplements public facilities. Covina will continue following and, where
    necessary, strengthening these provisions.
17. Park Development and Enhancement Funding
    Using as a basis for decision-making and actions Covina’s Park System Master Plan, the City Capital
    Improvement Program, and related, appropriate documents, the City will prioritize and systematically schedule
    on a long-term basis needed improvements to the Covina park system and ensure that park acquisition/
    development and enhancement funding sources are viable.
18. Park Maintenance Funding
    The City will fund ongoing park maintenance with sources, mechanisms, and methods that are administratively
    and financially feasible, stable, and recurring.
19. Bicycle Ways
    Covina will continue to support, encourage the utilization of, maintain, and, where reasonable, expand and
    improve its relatively limited network of bicycle ways, in accordance with all applicable design and accessibility
    requirements and standards. However, viable, sufficient funding must be secured.
20. Equestrian/Hiking Trails
    The City has limited equestrian/hiking trails that are part of a regional system, and the community will support
    Los Angeles County efforts to preserve, maintain, and, where appropriate, expand and improve the facilities
    and linkages thereto, in accordance with citizen desires and all applicable design and accessibility requirements.
21. Monitoring of Open Space Resources
    The Planning Division and, where appropriate, the Parks and Recreation Department, will periodically monitor
    parks and recreational matters to note any discoveries or changes warranting City response. Where necessary,
    proper action will be taken, such as following new General Plan policies and/or considering to incorporate
    additional implementation measures. Moreover, if appropriate, the City will designate as open space areas
    with scenic views or prone to potential hazards or buildings and/or sections of the community of high historic
    or cultural value.
C.  Inter-Topic General Matters
1.  Zoning Ordinance Revision to Achieve General Plan Consistency
    As required by State planning law, the Zoning text and Map will be revised to conform to the new General
    Plan land use distribution, policy orientation, program framework, building intensity provisions and limits,
    and development standards to streamline and clarify key portions of the document and to incorporate applicable
    new State requirements, such as open space zoning.
2.  Consistency Between General Plan and Other Plans/Documents
    City departments and the Redevelopment Agency administer various plans and measures that directly or
    indirectly relate to Natural Resources and Open Space. Where necessary, the Planning Division will ensure
    consistency between the revised Natural Resources and Open Space Element and these other germane plans/
    documents, which include, but are not limited to, the Redevelopment Project Area Plans, the Park System
    Master Plan, the Subdivision Ordinance, and the Capital Improvement Program, to the greatest extent possible.
                                                      D-47

3. Site Plan Review Process
   This part of the Zoning Ordinance constitutes the process by which private development applications and
   certain public proposals are reviewed and Zoning, Design Guidelines, and other City provisions are applied.
   Site Plan Review also serves as a mechanism for, among other things, determining General Plan/Zoning
   consistency, for routing projects to other City departments/divisions for study and comment, and for addressing
   overall City service and infrastructure accommodation issues and related matters. When reviewing applications,
   the City Planning Division may impose reasonable conditions to ensure General Plan, Zoning, Design
   Guidelines, and Park Master Plan conformance. This process shall continue.
4. Environmental Impact Review Process
   The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires, among other things, examination of environmental,
   biological, physical, and land use impacts as well as service provision when reviewing generally major use or
   development applications, general plan amendments, zone changes, and/or related matters. The analysis
   occurs during the Site Plan Review process. For applicable projects, typical areas of concern pertain to site
   geology and grading, proximity to any active earthquake faults, potential erosion, storm water runoff and/or
   flooding, species degradation, vehicular traffic, noise, and/or land use compatibility. The City will continue
   to follow all applicable CEQA provisions in its planning activities to ensure fruition of natural resource and
   open space goals and the furthering of applicable policies. Thus, in some cases, projects will have to be
   changed or mitigated.
5. Code Enforcement
   In situations where Zoning-, Site Plan Review-, and/or Building and Safety-related Code requirements are not
   met, particularly when there is a major threat to public health, safety, and welfare, the City attempts to abate
   or at least mitigate the violation(s). Code violations range from greatly unkempt property to structural
   inadequacy to illegal discharges, which, if left unchecked, in the aggregate, not only could jeopardize individual
   health and safety but could diminish overall community image, appearance, character, social stability, and
   economic vitality, all of which directly or indirectly relate to subjects discussed in this Element. To ensure
   that all General Plan natural resource and open space goals and policies are furthered, the City will continue
   with its existing, and, where possible, expand, Code Enforcement and related matters. In general, Covina will
   attempt to abate first the most serious violations or those nuisances that constitute the greatest threat to public
   health, safety, and welfare.
6. Reconciling Natural Resource and Open Space Conservation
   This Element is one chapter of a comprehensive General Plan that addresses various other topics, including
   land use, circulation, and housing. Under State law, all Elements must be consistent with one another in
   preparation and revision (see Chapter VI), a requirement that the City has met and will continue to achieve.
   However, in the course of implementing a general plan, proposals that strongly fulfill plan goals and policies
   in one area may be inconsistent with another chapter. For example, the Covina Housing Element, among
   other things, identifies various sites for potential apartment-oriented affordable housing development, though
   some of the properties lie adjacent to open space resources. Although the identification of affordable housing
   locations in such an area does not constitute an inconsistency or problem per se, the City’s land use compatibility
   policies would be triggered, thus possibly influencing the design and cost of this type of housing in the
   effected locations. Moreover, in some cases, the natural resources or open space environment could possibly
   interfere with important community goals, such as economic development, commercial revitalization,
   neighborhood preservation, and public improvement enhancement. Therefore, in implementing the Element,
   the City will endeavor to reconcile, to the greatest degree possible, natural resource/open space preservation
   and protection efforts with all other General Plan obligations, including, but not limited to, those mentioned
   above.
                                                       D-48

7.  Inter-governmental Coordination
    To most fairly and best deal with natural resource and open space issues at or near Covina’s border areas, the
    City will continue routing various topical plans and documents to and reviewing development and public
    proposals from neighboring communities and Los Angeles County as well as, if applicable, the State and
    Federal governments. When necessary, Covina will also be in contact with other governmental entities and/
    or relevant groups. This activity will, among other things, acknowledge City intentions, desires, and/or concerns
    over particular developments, proposals, and related actions in an atmosphere of respect and cooperation.
8.  Intra-governmental Coordination
    In carrying out its various natural resource- and open space-related and planning activities and programs/
    measures, where appropriate and feasible, the Planning Division will work with other City departments/
    divisions, particularly the Building and Safety Division, the Parks and Recreation Department, and the City
    Maintenance Department, to best approach and handle or abate various issues and problems. In light of
    changing Covina demographic, social, economic, and housing conditions as well as other trends, it is believed
    that this holistic orientation is essential and thus will best implement General Plan goals, objectives (where
    applicable), and policies.
9.  Public Involvement
    In compliance with State planning law, the City will endeavor to promote the importance of the General Plan
    as well as implementing programs/measures, such as the Park System Master Plan, to the public, businesses,
    developers, Covina employees, and other interested parties and groups at the public counter, on the phone, at
    meetings, at City-sponsored events, and at other available opportunities through information handouts,
    brochures, press releases, and any other mediums deemed appropriate. When General Plan updates are done,
    persons, groups, and organizations shall be notified through State-defined public hearings and, if appropriate,
    by way of other means. Frequent public education is an important ingredient in successful general plan
    implementation.
10. General Plan Review and Revisions
    State planning law requires the City to annually report to the Planning Commission and City Council on
    progress in General Plan implementation. The report must then be filed with the State Office of Planning and
    Research (OPR). The intent of this process is to ensure the viability, effectiveness, and coordination of
    adopted General Plan goals, objectives (where applicable), policies, and programs/implementation measures,
    which impact not only the community but, technically, the State as well. The City of Covina will continue
    with this activity and, when an amendment to the revised General Plan is made, will review the change in
    relation to the entire Plan to ensure inter-Element consistency. Also, appropriate, occasional monitoring of
    the General Plan components shall occur. Lastly, no later than five years following adoption of the last phase
    of the General Plan update, a detailed analysis of the entire Plan will be conducted.
11. Natural Resources and Open Space Element Implementation
    In accordance with the State planning law/Government Code criteria, the City will implement the Covina
    Natural Resources and Open Space Element in a manner compatible to the implementation/administration of
    all other General Plan Elements, the Park Master Plan and additional applicable City and Redevelopment
    Agency documents and proposals, and community goals and, in a fashion consistent with the intent of this
    chapter, monitor all facets of Element implementation, conduct necessary tasks so as to best prepare for future
    versions, annually report its findings to the Planning Commission and City Council, and, when legally required,
    necessary, and/or in the public interest, update the Element.
                                                       D-49

12. Maintenance of City Departments/Divisions Responsible for Natural Resource and Open Space
    Matters
    In order to carry out its various natural resource and open space responsibilities and obligations, the City will
    maintain departments/divisions to, among other things, appropriately administer the General Plan, Zoning
    Ordinance, Design Guidelines, various non-Planning Codes, Park System Master Plan, and other documents.
    In addition, Covina will maintain resources to administer and monitor various accompanying processes,
    programs, and activities, such as Site Plan Review, Environmental Impact Review, Code Enforcement, and
    general recreational programs and activities, and to disseminate applicable information and provide assistance
    to the public.

                                                      D-50
VI. RELATION TO AND CONSISTENCY WITH OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
    This Natural Resources and Open Space chapter of the General Plan is most closely related to the Land Use
    Element, the central chapter that focuses on the long-term general distribution/location and development
    intensity of residential, commercial, industrial, open space, and other uses, as well as the Circulation and
    Housing Elements. There is a close tie to the Land Use chapter because, under State law, as implied above, the
    proposed land use development scenario or Land Use Map must reflect the community’s desires with respect
    to natural resource and open space matters. In other words, when integrated with this Element, the Land Use
    Map should show acceptable land uses in relation to existing and future natural resources and parks and
    recreational facilities. Concerning the Element’s connection to the Circulation chapter, which focuses on
    circulation and transportation systems and the movement of people and goods, the circulation network must
    be correlated with the Land Use Element, which, as previously stated, includes natural resource/open space
    categories. Thus, the street system provides access to and among the topical resources and (relating to the
    overall land use planning process) must be considered in the location and design of new and improved open
    space lands as well as retention of existing facilities.
    The Housing Element, which this chapter also bears a strong relationship to, among other things, serves as a
    tool for addressing housing needs and providing adequate sites for new housing and standards for the housing
    stock. Because, as stated above, Covina’s residents, particularly seniors, children, and occupants of apartments
    and condominiums/townhomes, have various open space and recreational needs, it is essential for the Natural
    Resources and Open Space Element to reflect the community’s housing situation and concomitant occupancy
    characteristics. The Element is also most directly related to the Safety and Noise chapters.
    It is also important for the Natural Resources and Open Space Element to be consistent with other chapters,
    and vice versa, in terms of everything from supporting data and information to policy orientation to
    implementation. This necessity for overall congruence is underscored by State law as well. Section 65300.5
    of the California Government Code states that “the Legislature intends that the general plan and elements and
    parts thereof comprise an integrated, internally consistent and compatible statement of policies for the adopting
    agency.”
    The City of Covina has met this consistency requirement. Because the City has updated all General Plan
    Elements simultaneously, one common data and information base, with the same community input, has been
    used for the entire project. This means that the goals, objectives (if applicable), and policies for all Elements
    will have been (when all Elements are completed) prepared based on the same foundation and according to
    the same or similar methodology, thus ensuring consistency. Also, and perhaps most importantly, revising all
    General Plan Elements together guarantees inter-Element program conformity because, according to planning
    law, implementation measures or circulation/infrastructure, land use, and other plans must be developed upon
    the existing conditions/data and issues plus the stated goals, objectives (if applicable), and policies in question.
    In sum, the nature of the Covina General Plan update process has greatly facilitated consistency among all
    Elements. During Natural Resources and Open Space Element preparation, topical goals, policies, and
    programs/implementation measures have been cross-checked with those in other Elements, particularly Land
    Use, Circulation, and Housing, the other key General Plan chapters, to maintain and verify this necessary
    congruence.
    The above-noted inter-Element consistency will also ensure that implementation of the Natural Resources
    and Open Space and each and every Element will realize the same results. Furthermore, if the Natural Resources
    and Open Space Element is amended in the future, the City will confirm that the change is consistent with
    other chapters and/or modify the accompanying Elements to maintain overall conformity. Moreover, as
    stated in Program “C10,” the City will monitor all major aspects of Natural Resources and Open Space Element
    implementation through decision-making activities and other processes to verify this consistency. In other
                                                      D-51

words, the City regards all Elements as having equal legal status and is therefore committed to appropriate
Natural Resources and Open Space chapter implementation, particularly with respect to inter-Element unity
and coherence.
                                              D-52
VII. CITIZEN PARTICIPATION IN NATURAL RESOURCES AND OPEN SPACE ELEMENT
     FORMATION
     State planning law (Government Code Section 65351) requires local governments, during the amendment of
     a general plan, to “provide opportunities for the involvement of citizens, public agencies, public utility
     companies, and civic, education, and other community groups, through public hearings and any other means
     the city or county deems appropriate.” In fulfilling its citizen participation obligations and in identifying
     issues for the Natural Resources and Open Space as well as for all other Elements, the City has:
1.   Prepared and distributed a “short” questionnaire to all Covina households.
2.   Prepared and distributed a “long” questionnaire on a random basis to approximately 10% of all Covina area
     households.
3.   Conducted “town hall meetings” and public forums.
4.   Prepared a cable television commercial on the General Plan update and public forums and had a staff member
     appear on the local cable television station to discuss the General Plan update process and answer public
     questions.
5.   Prepared and distributed several General Plan update flyers at City Hall and at various public functions. Also
     prepared press releases and articles in various newspapers and City publications on the update process and on
     the public forums.
6.   Received numerous comments from the public (in this case regarding natural resources and open space) on
     the phone, at the counter, and in the course of site-specific project reviews.
7.   Organized, met with, and elicited the views of a subcommittee of Covina’s General Plan Update Committee
     that addressed natural resource, open space, and related issues.
8.   Met with and elicited the views of City of Covina employees who deal with natural resource and open space
     matters.
9.   Received numerous comments from representatives of other public or quasi-public agencies, such as school
     districts, transit agencies, utility companies, regional organizations, and adjacent municipalities as well as
     local civic organizations.
10.  Reviewed and considered the Covina Park System Master Plan, an important, applicable document that had
     been prepared based on extensive community outreach.
     The public comments elicited from measures 1 through 10 have been carefully studied by the City and have
     been incorporated into the body of data and information that was used in formulating this Element’s identification
     and discussion of natural resources and open space lands and, therefore, in developing the related goals,
     policies, and programs/implementation measures as well. All material and information and specific input
     received pertaining to these items are on file in the City Planning Division. Thus, Covina has made a reasonable
     effort to reach out to the important segments, views, and organizations in drafting the Natural Resources and
     Open Space Element.

VIII. MONITORING NATURAL RESOURCES AND OPEN SPACE ELEMENT IMPLEMENTATION
      In order for the General Plan Natural Resources and Open Space Element’s goals, policies, and programs/
      implementation measures to be realized, or to ensure that the Element serves to maintain and, where necessary,
      improve Covina’s natural environment, open space facilities, recreational opportunities, and quality of life,
      the Element must be implemented as proposed through effective decision-making and actions. Also, to ensure
      that implementation is achieved to the maximum degree possible, consistent Natural Resources and Open
      Space Element monitoring must also occur. This subject is addressed by Section 65400(b) of the Government
      Code, which states that following general plan adoption or revision, a city shall “provide an annual report to
      the legislative body on the status of the plan and progress in its implementation . . .” Because the Natural
      Resources and Open Space Element is an important chapter and is, as previously stated, closely tied to the
      central Land Use Element, monitoring is particularly relevant here.
      The City of Covina will fulfill its obligation to monitor implementation by preparing the State-required report
      for the Planning Commission and for the City Council. This procedure, in fact, has been incorporated into the
      Natural Resources and Open Space Element implementation framework as Program “C10,” which calls for
      the monitoring of all aspects of the implementation effort, including, as stated in Section VI, assurances that
      inter-Element consistency is achieved. One such facet of the monitoring process is ensuring that any
      underutilized policies or programs are adequately handled. Also, any identified problems or deficiencies will
      be carefully studied and appropriately managed to ensure that desired Natural Resources and Open Space
      Element results are met. The City believes that many potential problems should be avoided by maintaining a
      commitment to appropriate Element implementation through the decision-making process. Besides, then,
      furthering the established natural resource- and open space-related goals, this approach will facilitate preparing
      General Plan amendments.

                                               EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Noise Element is the component of the comprehensive planning process that addresses noise control. Noise, for
purposes of this Element, is defined as excessive or “unwanted” sound that typically comes from transportation systems
and certain commercial and industrial operations and that commonly intrudes on inhabitants of residential and other
properties. Excessive sound can be disturbing or injurious to public health, safety, and welfare and detrimental to
overall community character, image, and vitality.
The entire contents of the Noise Element are based on State planning law requirements (Section 65302(f) of the
California Government Code) and the Noise Element Guidelines, an advisory document on Noise chapter formation
prepared by the California Department of Health Services (DHS) and the State Office of Planning and Research (OPR).
Under law, the State establishes the overall data and analysis requirements, while allowing local governments to address
their noise issues and problems in a manner tailored to local conditions and circumstances. The Covina Noise Element
has therefore been organized and prepared in a manner that the City feels is most appropriate and logical and best
suited for carrying out planning activities.
Covina (population 46,452, 1997 estimate) is a mature, suburban community located in the eastern portion of the San
Gabriel Valley, approximately twenty-three miles east of downtown Los Angeles. The City, which possesses a historic
downtown that is a key social and economic center of the community, is characterized by predominantly low rise/low
intensity residential, commercial, and light manufacturing uses. For a suburban city, Covina has a relatively high
percentage of commercial and industrial areas, which illustrates a strong, diversified economic base. However, from a
land use relationship standpoint, the community’s strong economic base has manifested itself, in certain neighborhoods,
in the proximity of residential uses with commercial and industrial activities and/or major streets, which makes Covina
susceptible to noise problems. But because Covina is well established and almost entirely built-out, large-scale land
use changes are impractical. Therefore, in view of this situation and the fact that additional noise in the future is
imminent as a result of projected growth and vehicular traffic and train service increases, it is appropriate for the City
to maintain reasonable, viable noise control policies and programs. The Covina General Plan covers a ten square mile
Planning Area, which includes seven square miles of incorporated territory and a three square mile Sphere of Influence/
unincorporated area (designated for eventual Covina annexation). Refer to Section “A” of the Land Use Study of the
Land Use Element for more information on location, character, and the Covina Planning Area.
The Covina Noise Element is divided into eight chapters. The first chapter introduces and presents general information
on the Element process, as mentioned above, as well as on below-described Element contents.
In section number two, Covina’s major noise sources are described and appraised. The major noise sources are:
          1.        San Bernardino Freeway.
          2.        Primary and Secondary Arterial Streets (as classified under previous General Plan).
          3.        Metrolink Commuter Rail Line.
          4.        Aircraft Overflights.
          5.        Commercial and Industrial Activities.
          6.        Various Stationary Sources.
In evaluating the six sources of noise in Covina presented above, the first three factors, the San Bernardino Freeway,
the major or primary and secondary arterial streets, and the Metrolink Commuter Rail Line, appear to be the strongest
generators in shaping the local noise environment. Therefore, these sources serve as the Noise Element’s information-
related framework for quantification and detailed analysis, which is presented in the following chapters.
                                                           F-IX

Section number two also discusses noise-sensitive land uses and activities, which warrant inclusion in the Noise Element
because they represent the receptors that face the most negative impacts when exposed to noise incursions. Housing is
the most predominant and most noise-sensitive land use in Covina. In some areas of the City, as previously indicated,
residential uses are adjacent to and inadequately buffered from commercial and industrial businesses and/or major
streets or transportation corridors, such as the Metrolink Commuter Rail Line. Other noise-sensitive land uses in
Covina include public and private primary and secondary schools, libraries, parks/recreation areas, hospitals/medical
facilities, nursing homes, and churches, many of which abut or are near principal noise sources as well. The City faces
challenges and constraints in protecting all of the above noise-sensitive activities in view of the facts that Covina is a
mature, generally built-out community with well established, basically fixed land uses.
The third chapter quantifies and analyzes the City’s primary noise generators, which, as stated above, are three mobile
sources: 1) the San Bernardino Freeway, 2) the major or primary and secondary arterial streets, and 3) the Metrolink
Commuter Rail Line. In accordance with State planning law, excessive sounds are quantified/described using noise
contours, which represent lines of equal noise exposure (just as the contour lines on a topographic map are lines of
equal elevation) and thus are oriented around the three key sound generators. These contours represent what are called
60 and 65 decibel demarcations in the Day-Night Average Noise Level (Ldn) scale. The decibel (dB), which ranges
from 0 to 140, is the standard unit of the measurement of the loudness of sound, while Ldn is a 24-hour, time-weighted
annual average noise level. The noise contours for existing and future conditions have been derived from a special
computer program on the basis of figures collected from noise surveys. Because of the long-term nature of the general
plan update and implementation processes, future contours (i.e., for 2010, the year of Covina General Plan build-out)
are particularly relevant and therefore take precedence over the existing demarcations. Both existing and future noise
contours themselves, which are depicted in separate maps and described in tables of the text, are intended to be used as
a guide for establishing land use patterns and circulation routes (in the related Land Use Element update) and making
day-to-day land use decisions that minimize the exposure of community residents to excessive noise or, particularly
regarding the future demarcations, that serve as a basis for noise mitigation policies and programs.
The existing and future contour maps and tables illustrate that Covina’s noise conditions vary greatly and will continue
to differ, present and projected vehicular traffic and train operations being the primary contributing factors. There are
and will continue to be several residential and other noise-sensitive uses located within the 60 and 65 Ldn noise
contours of the City’s various transportation routes, particularly along Arrow Highway, the Metrolink Rail Line, the
San Bernardino Freeway, Grand Avenue, Citrus Avenue, and Azusa Avenue. The City will use the contour information
as a guide in exercising, to the greatest extent legally and practically possible, noise mitigation and abatement decisions
and actions and in carrying out subsequently listed policies for existing and for new and expanded developments.
Because Covina is generally a mature, built-out community with above-noted legal and resource limitations in addressing
existing noise-sensitive uses within the contour zones and because many such uses may in fact posses site features that
inhibit excessive sound exposure, it is believed that the existing and future contour information will be most applicable
to new and expanded developments and uses.
In section number four, the goal and policies of the Noise Element are presented. Goals and policies are important
because they serve as the chief tools with respect to private development and public project evaluation and decision-
making and overall local direction setting as well as the primary basis for the Element’s implementation measures,
discussed in the following chapter. A goal is defined as a general expression of an ideal future condition or state toward
which the community wishes to advance. A policy, on the other hand, is a statement that most directly guides decision-
making and actions. In applying the two terms to Covina, one goal and several policies are utilized. The goal is:
           An environment in which potential adverse impacts of noise on the City’s residents and workers are identified
           and prevented and mitigated.
                                                             F-X

The policies are listed within a framework relative to the following four topical areas:
          1.        Transportation noise sources.
          2.        Commercial and industrial noise sources.
          3.        Miscellaneous stationary noise sources.
          4.        Construction noise sources and general matters.
Key policies call for the City to examine the noise environment of proposed residential or other noise-sensitive uses
located within the 60 Ldn noise contour to ensure compatibility and, if applicable, adherence to applicable State noise
insulation standards; to attempt to mitigate or eliminate the possible noise problems of proposed residential or other
noise sensitive uses located within the 65 Ldn noise contour to also ensure compatibility and, again if applicable,
adherence to applicable State noise insulation standards; to ensure the inclusion of noise mitigation measures and
features in the design, orientation, and routing of new and improved streets and circulation and transportation facilities,
where necessary; and to require noise-reduction techniques and features in site planning, automobile and truck access
points, loading/delivery areas, architectural design, project landscaping, building materials, and construction.
Furthermore, the City would support and participate with Caltrans in the development of any sound abatement plans
for the San Bernardino Freeway; ensure that rail car- and horn-related noises emanating from the Metrolink system,
including the Covina Station, meet Federal standards and continue to work with Metrolink officials to adopt specific
measures to reduce overall rail car and horn noises to the greatest extent technologically possible; encourage all law
enforcement agencies operating within the City limits to enforce State Vehicle Code and related noise standards for
cars, trucks, motorcycles, buses, and other vehicles; and discourage the location of noise-sensitive land uses in noisy
environments. In addition, the City commits to consider establishing acceptable limits of noise levels for various land
uses throughout the community, in accordance with State guidelines; study and consider the existing and potential
noise generating characteristics of commercial, industrial, and other businesses that wish to expand or modify their
scope of operation; when necessary, encourage existing relatively noisy industrial businesses adjacent to residences to
abate their intrusive sounds, to the greatest extent feasible, by taking appropriate measures; discourage the development
of new private schools and nightclubs, discotheques, billiard parlors, and other high noise-generating uses adjacent to
residential areas, unless it can be demonstrated that adequate measures can be employed; and continue enforcing the
Covina Noise Ordinance to prevent potential and to handle existing noise problems in the community.
The fifth chapter discusses the programs/implementation measures, which, along with the goal and policies, serve as
the backbone of the Noise Element. Programs supplement and ensure that the Element’s goal and policies will reach
fruition. The programs and measures are divided into two below-listed subject categories, which are:
          1.        Transportation and Nontransportation Noise Mitigation and Abatement.
          2.        General Administration.
Various specific and general programs are presented, which, again, supplement the previously-listed goal and policies.
Section number six discusses the Noise Element’s relation to and consistency with other General Plan chapters. The
Noise Element is most closely related to the Land Use Element, the central chapter that focuses on the long-term
general distribution/location and development intensity of residential, commercial, industrial, and other uses. There is
a close tie to the Land Use Element because, under State law, the proposed land use development scenario or Land Use
Map must reflect the Noise Element’s noise exposure information. The Noise Element is also closely related to the
Circulation chapter. In addition, under State law, the Noise Element must be consistent with all other chapters, and vice
versa, in terms of everything from supporting data and information to policy orientation to implementation. The City
of Covina has met this consistency requirement by updating all General Plan Elements simultaneously, including
utilizing one common data and information base and cross-checking all goals, policies, and plans/implementation
measures among the various Elements. This inter-Element consistency will also ensure that implementation of the
                                                             F-XI

Noise Element and all other Elements will realize the same results. Moreover, if the Noise Element is amended in the
future, the City will verify that the change is consistent with other chapters and/or modify the accompanying Elements
to maintain overall conformity.
The seventh section lists the various measures that the City has undertaken to guide citizen participation in the General
Plan update process. These items include questionnaires; public forums; cable television segments; and flyers, press
releases, and articles. In addition, City staff received numerous citizen and business comments on the phone, at the
public counter, and in the course of site-specific project reviews and met with and elicited the views of various City
advisory bodies involved with noise issues. Public comments elicited from the measures were carefully studied by the
City and have been incorporated into the body of data and information that was used in formulating the Noise Element’s
identification and discussion of major noise sources and, therefore, in developing the noise-related goal, policies, and
programs/implementation measures. State planning law places a strong emphasis on citizen participation in the General
Plan preparation as well as implementation and amendment processes.
The eighth and final chapter discusses monitoring Noise Element implementation, which is also a State requirement
and is important to ensure that the Element fulfills its primary purpose of protecting local residents from excessive
noise intrusion. The City will fulfill its obligation to monitor implementation by preparing a State-required annual
report on this matter to the Planning Commission and City Council. Any identified underutilized policies or programs
will be adequately handled and problems or deficiencies will be carefully studied and appropriately managed to ensure
that the desired Noise Element goal is met.
Much of the background information and facts and analysis of data for this Element appear in an accompanying noise
study. Though separate, the noise study or Technical Appendix, most of which has been prepared by Covina staff, is
legally part of the Noise Element. The City believes that this two-document organization best addresses applicable
planning statutes and policies as well as local conditions and needs.

I. INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND
   The Noise Element is the component of the comprehensive planning process that addresses noise control.
   Noise, for purposes of this Element, is defined as excessive or “unwanted” sound that typically comes from
   transportation systems and certain commercial and industrial operations and that commonly intrudes on
   inhabitants of residential and other properties. Excessive sound can be disturbing or injurious to public
   health, safety, and welfare and detrimental to overall community character, image, and vitality. The Noise
   chapter of the General Plan identifies major noise sources, areas of sound impact, and noise-sensitive activities
   for the purposes of developing and maintaining compatible land use patterns and circulation routes as well as
   appropriate, day-to-day administered policies and programs, such as a noise ordinance and zoning/design
   standards, to protect local residents from excessive noise intrusion. In addition, the Noise Element serves as
   a guideline for complying with State noise insulation standards for multiple-family buildings. From the
   standpoint of the overall General Plan process, the Noise Element is thus closely related to the chapters on
   Land Use, Circulation, Housing, and Natural Resources and Open Space.
   The entire contents of the Noise Element are based on State planning law requirements (Section 65302(f) of
   the California Government Code) and the Noise Element Guidelines, an advisory document on Noise chapter
   formation prepared by the California Department of Health Services (DHS) and the State Office of Planning
   and Research (OPR). Under law, the State establishes the overall data and analysis requirements, while
   allowing local governments to address their noise issues and problems in a manner tailored to local conditions
   and circumstances. The Covina Noise Element has therefore been prepared and, as stated below, organized in
   a manner that the City feels is most appropriate and logical and best suited for carrying out planning activities.
   The Covina Noise Element is divided into eight chapters. Following this Background chapter, the second
   section presents an identification and appraisal of major noise sources in the community, as ascertained by
   City staff through a survey and from citizen participation activities and resident complaints, and a discussion
   of noise-sensitive land uses. The third area analyzes and quantifies the principal, continuing generators of the
   local noise environment, which are the San Bernardino Freeway, the major roads or what are classified under
   the previous General Plan as primary and secondary arterial streets, and the Metrolink Commuter Rail Line.
   Here, reference is made to an accompanying communitywide noise study that functions as the Technical
   Appendix to this Element. Section number four presents the goal and the policies, an important component
   that bridges the gap between where the City is and what type of community it wishes to become. The fifth
   chapter describes programs/implementation measures, which supplement and ensure fruition of the goal and
   policies. Sections six, seven, and eight conclude the Noise Element by discussing, respectively, the relation to
   and consistency with other General Plan chapters, citizen participation in Element formation, and monitoring
   Circulation Element implementation.

   Covina is well established and almost entirely built-out, large-scale land use changes are impractical. Therefore,
   in view of this situation and the fact that additional noise in the future is imminent as a result of projected
   growth and vehicular traffic and train service increases, it is appropriate for the City to maintain reasonable,
   viable noise control policies and programs. The Covina General Plan covers a ten square mile Planning Area,
                                                      F-1

which includes seven square miles of incorporated territory and a three square mile Sphere of Influence/
unincorporated area (designated for eventual Covina annexation). Refer to Section “A” of the Land Use
Study of the Land Use Element for more information on location, character, and the Covina Planning Area.

II. IDENTIFICATION AND APPRAISAL OF MAJOR NOISE SOURCES
A.  Identification and Appraisal of Major Noise Sources
    The following section describes and appraises Covina’s major noise sources. As stated in the Introduction
    above, Covina is a low-rise, suburban community that is generally “less noisy” than more intensely developed
    urban areas. However, Covina’s land use relationships and major transportation arteries do at times generate
    excessive sounds. This noise-related information is based on City staff observations, citizen participation
    measures (refer to Chapter VII), a communitywide noise survey (explained in the following chapter), and a
    resident complaint file. It is noted that the quantification of these identified, immoderate sounds and noise
    level projections (at full implementation of the General Plan) is presented in the following chapter.
    The sources of noise in Covina fall into six categories. They are:
    1.        San Bernardino Freeway
    2.        Primary and Secondary Arterial Streets (as classified under previous General Plan)
    3.        Metrolink Commuter Rail Line
    4.        Aircraft Overflights
    5.        Commercial and Industrial Activities
    6.        Various Stationary Sources
    Each noise source and its impacts on the noise environment of Covina are summarized below. For proper
    orientation, refer to Map 1 (City Streets) and Map 2 (City Existing Land Use) in the Technical Appendix.
1.  San Bernardino Freeway
    One significant noise source in Covina is the San Bernardino Freeway, which, east of Grand Avenue, passes
    through the southeastern portion of the community in an east-west direction and is both below- and at-grade
    with adjacent areas. Development along this portion of the Freeway is both residential-single-family and
    commercial. Although there are minimal sound walls, most of the closest residential properties are situated
    considerably higher than the Freeway, thus limiting noise for residents.
    West of Grand Avenue, the Freeway also varies from below- to at-grade positions, but much of the adjacent
    territory lies in West Covina. The Covina uses west of Grand that, again, because of minimal sound walls, are
    susceptible to at least some traffic-related noises include residential-single-family, residential-multiple-family,
    commercial, and institutional (a church). It is noted, however, that over the years, the City of Covina has not
    received any citizen complaints pertaining to Freeway noise.
2.  Primary and Secondary Arterial Streets (as classified under previous General Plan)
    Traffic on major surface streets constitutes another significant source of noise within the community. The
    principal roadways in Covina, which are classified under the previous General Plan as primary and secondary
    arterial streets, are illustrated in Maps 1 and 2. (As indicated in other sections of this Element, because the
    Noise Element serves as a foundation for developing, among other things, future-oriented circulation routes,
    previously-existing General Plan designations must be utilized as a basis for the new circulation hierarchy.
    This new hierarchy thus constitutes the Circulation Plan in the accompanying revised Circulation Element.)
    Noise levels along roadways, which, as mentioned above, are presented in the following section, vary according
    to and are determined by a number of factors. The most important component is a road’s total, 24-hour traffic
    volume, called Average Daily Traffic or ADT. Additional factors include the percentage of trucks, vehicle
    speed, the time-related distribution of traffic, and gradient of the roadway. Considering all variables, the
    busiest/noisiest streets in Covina tend to be the primary north-south running roadways that are directly linked
    to the San Bernardino Freeway, which include (from east to west) Vincent, Azusa, Citrus, Barranca, and
    Grand Avenues. Also, in terms of the major east-west streets (from north to south), over the years, Arrow
                                                         F-3

   Highway, San Bernardino Road, and Badillo Street have produced the greatest volume of traffic and therefore
   noise, too. Besides the proximity to the San Bernardino and other Freeways, these streets prone to greater
   noise generation have relatively high traffic volumes because of citywide and regional land use patterns as
   well as truck routes and public transit.
   Land uses along the just-mentioned roads with higher traffic volumes typically are commercial and industrial,
   though there are pockets of residential-single-family and -multiple-family. Referring to the other major streets
   that generally have less traffic and noise (again, refer to Maps 1 and 2), the land use mix tends to be more
   varied, with some commercial and industrial activities but more single-family homes and multiple-family
   dwellings and parks. As was the case with the San Bernardino Freeway, over the years, the City has not
   received any noise-related complaints pertaining to excessive sounds generated from traffic on major roadways.
3. Metrolink Commuter Rail Line
   The San Bernardino route of the Metrolink Commuter Rail Line traverses the middle and northeastern sections
   of Covina in an east-west direction. There is a Commuter Rail Station and accompanying parking lot in
   Covina at the northeast corner of the intersection of the Line and Citrus Avenue. Metrolink, a regional-
   oriented commuter rail system that is based out of Union Station in downtown Los Angeles and that is owned,
   operated, and maintained by the Southern California Regional Rail Authority (SCRRA), currently operates
   approximately 18 weekday trains, with the bulk of service occurring during the early morning and late afternoon
   peak transportation periods. A limited number of trains run on Saturdays. Also, during the late night and pre-
   dawn hours, freight trains occasionally operate on the tracks, a vestige of the line’s original, long-time function.
   The entire portion of the Metrolink line running through Covina is at-grade, and there are 12 street crossings
   equipped with railroad crossing signals and barricades. The land uses adjacent to the track easement are
   varied in nature, they including residential-single-family and -multiple family, commercial, and industrial.
   And the track easement is commonly, though not always, separated from adjoining private properties by the
   rear walls of commercial and industrial buildings or freestanding 4- to 8-foot high block walls. Since Metrolink
   began service in late 1992, however, the City has received several resident complaints concerning commuter
   train- and horn-related noise and ground vibration. Although identified noise and vibration readings (refer to
   Chapter III below) generally comply with applicable Federal standards, train and horn noise is relatively loud
   and disturbing to many residents living along or near the right-of-way. Therefore, as of this writing, the City
   is studying the situation and attempting to work with the Metrolink operator to reduce all train-related noise to
   the greatest degree possible. The infrequent late-night freight trains have not been identified as problematic.
4. Aircraft Overflights
   Although there are no airports in or near Covina, as with most suburban municipalities located within an
   overall metropolitan region (in this case, the greater Los Angeles area), the community is subject to occasional
   noises from aircraft overflights. Typically, sounds from large, commercial jets tend to be more perceptible
   than those of small, single engine airplanes, though the jet flyovers are high enough to preclude major
   disturbances. The City has received no complaints concerning aircraft noise and, it is noted, no protests from
   occasional helicopter flights or landings and take-offs (which have occurred at Covina’s primary hospital and
   public safety complex). Because of the above reasons and the fact that noises from aircraft overflights are
   difficult to quantify and regulate, this topic is determined to not constitute a serious problem for the community.
5. Commercial and Industrial Activities
   As stated in the previous Chapter, from a land use standpoint, Covina has many areas in which commercial or
   industrial activities abut residential uses, with little or no sound-reducing design features. These situations,
   which pervade throughout the community, have evolved over the decades as a result of City growth combined
                                                         F-4

   with previously accepted land use planning and site design standards and policies and annexations from Los
   Angeles County. Although the City’s land use pattern is deemed viable and safe, in a few cases in recent
   years, residents living within close proximity to commercial and industrial businesses have made noise-related
   complaints. These protests have generally pertained to a few types of establishments, including manufacturing/
   assembly operations, car repair and other activities associated with automobiles, and bars/nightclubs. Other
   complaints have focused on matters that relate to many kinds of businesses, such as delivery trucks, loading
   dock operations, outside loudspeakers, venting devices, and mechanical equipment located inside or outside
   of a building.
   The City has, however, been able to resolve all noise complaints through enforcement of the community’s
   Noise Ordinance and/or by working with business managers or property owners (to modify one or more
   operational aspects of particular enterprises so that compliance with noise standards is achieved). Also, for
   new developments and land use modification applications bordering different activity types, presently City
   staff better addresses noise through stronger land use compatibility policies and site design guidelines. Overall,
   based on City staff observations and analyses, including studies of comparable situations in other communities,
   while commercial and industrial noises in Covina are at times somewhat excessive or unwarranted, the noises
   are amenable to mitigation or abatement.
6. Various Stationary Sources
   In addition to the previously-mentioned excessive or unwarranted sounds sometimes emanating from certain
   commercial and industrial activities, noise comes from other stationary sources as well, such as on-site (private
   land) construction, off-site (public right-of-way) construction, street sweepers, power tools, and gas-powered
   leaf blowers. However, existing City policies and the Covina Noise Ordinance have given the community
   sufficient leverage for controlling these sources as well, while allowing for reasonable work/usage. Complaints
   have been rare.
   In evaluating the six sources of noise in Covina presented above, it is apparent that there are no serious-,
   health-threatening noise problems in Covina. The first three factors, the San Bernardino Freeway, the primary
   and secondary arterial streets (again, as previously classified and as illustrated in Maps 1 and 2), and the
   Metrolink Commuter Rail Line, appear to be the strongest generators in shaping the local noise environment.
   Therefore, these sources shall serve as the Noise Element’s information-related framework for quantification
   and detailed analysis, which is presented in the following chapter.
B. Discussion of Noise-Sensitive Land Uses and Activities
   Noise-sensitive land uses and activities warrant discussion in the Noise Element because they represent the
   receptors that face the most negative impacts when exposed to noise incursions. Housing is the most
   predominant and most noise-sensitive land use in Covina. As described in the Land Use Element and as
   illustrated in Map 2 (Existing Land Use), housing pervades throughout the community. The previous section
   stated that, unfortunately, in some areas of Covina residential uses are adjacent to and inadequately buffered
   from commercial and industrial businesses and major transportation corridors, such as the Metrolink Commuter
   Rail Line. Residential is considered particularly noise-sensitive mainly because considerable time is spent by
   individuals at home and because sleep disturbance is most likely to occur in a residential area.
   Other noise-sensitive land uses in Covina include public and private primary and secondary schools, libraries,
   parks/recreation areas, hospitals/medical facilities, nursing homes, and churches. There are several of the
   above uses in Covina, and, like residential, many are abutting or near major noise sources. Again, refer to
   Map 2 for clarification.
                                                      F-5

   Considering that Covina is a mature, generally built-out community with well established, basically fixed
   land uses, the City faces challenges and constraints in protecting all of the above noise-sensitive activities.
   Nevertheless, the community is legally obligated to and, as detailed below, this document makes a good faith
   effort to address the existing and potential (e.g., relating to future growth, redevelopment, and transportation
   changes) noise-related concerns of Covina residents and others.
C. Listing of Key Existing Major Noise Source Issues
   This area of discussion lists the key Covina major noise source issues, which are based on the facts and
   information presented in the previous sections, related, salient material, and community input (see Chapter
   VII for clarification). Issues are important because they clarify key noise source matters warranting attention
   and because, along with a detailed identification and discussion of major noise sources themselves (the preceding
   section and Technical Appendix), issues form the basis for the below-listed goal and policies and programs/
   implementation measures. (Issues of the following segment, Quantification and Analysis of Local Noise
   Environment, are thus similarly regarded and applied.) Refer to the previous section and to the accompanying
   Technical Appendix for clarification on this material and for underlying data and information. (In addition,
   see the Land Use Element and Land Use Study for an expanded discussion on matters relating to land use.)
   The major noise source issues are listed below in no particular order. It should be noted that the issues are not
   necessarily mutually exclusive.
1. Documenting, based on City staff observations, citizen participation measures, a communitywide noise survey,
   and a resident complaint file, that the overall sources of noise in Covina fall into the following six categories:
   1) San Bernardino Freeway; 2) primary and secondary arterial streets (as classified under previous General
   Plan and illustrated in Maps 1 and 2); 3) Metrolink Commuter Rail Line; 4) aircraft overflights; 5) commercial
   and industrial activities; and 6) various stationary sources (e.g., construction and gardening equipment).
2. Stating that none of the six above-noted noise sources in Covina constitute serious, health-threatening problems
   for the community.
3. Acknowledging that, based on observations and facts, the first three of the previously-mentioned sources of
   noise, the San Bernardino Freeway, the primary and secondary arterial streets, and the Metrolink Commuter
   Rail Line, appear to be the strongest generators in shaping the local noise environment and therefore serve as
   the Noise Element’s information-related framework for quantification and detailed analysis.
4. Documenting that noise-sensitive land uses and activities, particularly housing as well as public and private
   primary and secondary schools, libraries, parks/recreation areas, hospitals/medical facilities, nursing homes,
   and churches, warrant discussion in the Noise Element because they represent the receptors that face the most
   negative impacts when exposed to noise incursions.
5. Dealing with challenges and constraints that the City faces in protecting noise-sensitive activities, considering
   that Covina is a mature, generally built out community with well established, basically fixed land uses.
                                                       F-6

III. QUANTIFICATION AND ANALYSIS OF LOCAL NOISE ENVIRONMENT
A.   Noise Measurement Criteria and Methodology
     The preceding chapter identified and discussed Covina’s six major mobile and stationary noise sources. It has
     been determined that the three mobile sources, 1) the San Bernardino Freeway, 2) the major or (as defined
     under the previous General Plan and illustrated in Maps 1 and 2 of the Technical Appendix) the primary and
     secondary arterial streets, and 3) the Metrolink Commuter Rail Line, are the primary generators that shape
     the local noise environment and therefore should serve as the basis for communitywide noise quantification
     and analysis.
     In accordance with State planning law, excessive sounds are quantified/described using noise contours, which
     represent lines of equal noise exposure (just as the contour lines on a topographic map are lines of equal
     elevation). The standard unit of the measurement of the loudness of sound is the decibel (dB). Decibel levels,
     in theory, numerically range from 0 to 140, though, in Covina, typical readings along a major street will vary,
     depending on the time of day, location, traffic volume, and outside activities, from approximately 40 to 90 dB.
     (For further information on noise theory and a listing of decibel levels associated with common noise
     environments, refer to the Technical Appendix.) Following State guidelines, accompanying maps of this
     Element depict noise contours at 60 and 65 decibel demarcations in the Day-Night Average Noise Level (Ldn)
     scale. Ldn is a 24-hour, time-weighted annual average noise level. “Weighted” means that noise occurring in
     the generally late night and early morning hours is penalized to account for greater human sensitivity to
     excessive sounds during this time period. The noise contours, as previously stated, are oriented around Covina’s
     three primary sound generators, the San Bernardino Freeway, the major or primary and secondary arterial
     streets, and the Metrolink Commuter Rail Line. The contours have been derived from a special computer
     program on the basis of figures collected from a communitywide noise survey and applicable data. Regarding
     the survey, City staff utilized an automatic sound level meter to record 24-hour noise readings, first of all,
     along the Freeway and all major or primary and secondary arterial streets. Sections of streets with the greatest
     identified traffic volumes were selected for measurement to ensure that later-prepared noise contours would
     be based on the highest or most conservative sound readings (to provide residents with maximum “noise
     protection”). And because of the noise-sensitive nature of housing, the City took sound level readings in a few
     residential neighborhoods for general identification purposes. All noise monitoring locations associated with
     this survey are illustrated on Map 3 in the Technical Appendix. Noise conditions for the Metrolink Commuter
     Train Line were taken from a special, consultant-prepared study, the Commuter Train having not begun operating
     when City staff conducted its noise survey. It is noted that the train-related noise readings of the consultant
     that are documented here were also obtained through direct monitoring of typical train operations.
     As stated above, based on ascertained noise readings from the citywide survey and documented Commuter
     Train-related sound levels from the consultant-prepared study, City staff utilized a special computer program
     to create noise contours for existing conditions around the Freeway, all major streets, and the Commuter Train
     Line. In addition, as required by planning law, based on estimated future noise figures derived from projected
     increases in traffic and Train service, City personnel used the same computer system to develop noise contours
     for 2010, the year of General Plan build-out. Because of the long-term nature of the General Plan update and
     implementation processes, future contours are particularly relevant. Both existing and future noise contours
     themselves, which are presented and analyzed below, are intended to be used as a guide for establishing and
     maintaining land use patterns and circulation routes (in the related Land Use Element update) and making
     day-to-day land use and other decisions that minimize the exposure of community residents to excessive
     noise or, particularly regarding the future demarcations, that serve as a basis for noise mitigation policies and
     programs. Again, see the accompanying Technical Appendix for more information on contours, on the City’s
     noise monitoring activities, on the Metrolink study, and on related computer applications.
                                                        F-7

B. Presentation of Existing and Future Noise Contours
   Existing and future noise contours for Covina are depicted in, respectively, Map 4 and Map 5 (see attachments).
   As described in the previous section, noise contours represent lines of equal sound exposure, are intended to
   guide land use planning by minimizing resident exposure to excessive sounds, and are illustrated around
   Covina’s principal sound generators, which are the San Bernardino Freeway, the major or (as defined under
   the previous General Plan and illustrated in Maps 1 and 2 of the Technical Appendix) the primary and secondary
   arterial streets, and the Metrolink Commuter Train Line. And as also described above, contours for both Maps
   are depicted in terms of 60 and 65 decibel demarcations in the Day-Night Average Noise Level (Ldn) scale,
   which represents daily levels of noise exposure averaged on an annual basis.
   The previous area of discussion further clarified that the existing 60 and 65 decibel noise contours for the
   primary sound generators, in accordance with applicable State guidelines, were based on traffic levels and
   train operations. Future contours, for the General Plan build-out year of 2010, were additionally established
   considering projected increases in traffic and Train service. Refer to the accompanying Technical Appendix
   and related Circulation Element for clarification on the transportation-related figures that have been utilized
   in computing the two sets of contours.
   The following discusses the significance of the 60 and 65 Ldn decibel contours*:
   60 Ldn: The 60 Ldn contour defines the Noise Study Zone, where, in recognition of the need to provide
   acceptable habitation environments, State law requires noise insulation of new multiple-family dwelling units.
   Moreover, the City may also wish to evaluate other proposed sensitive uses within this area (such as hospitals,
   primary and secondary schools, and churches) on a project-by-project basis to ensure noise level acceptability.
   It is noted that some sites may already be sufficiently buffered by existing walls, landscaping, and/or berms to
   the extent that no further sound analyses are necessary.
   65 Ldn: The 65 Ldn counter delineates the Noise Mitigation Zone. Within this contour, new or expanded
   noise-sensitive developments should be permitted only if appropriate mitigation measures, such as barriers or
   additional sound insulation, are included and City and/or State noise standards are achieved. In some instances,
   it may be possible to show that current walls, landscaping, berms, and/or screening exist such that desired
   mitigation is already in place.
   * It is noted that in carrying out policies and programs associated with these demarcations, particularly
   related to multiple-family insulation, the future contours shall take precedence. This determination conforms
   to the long-term nature of the General Plan implementation process. However, it must also be stated that
   given the relative scarcity of available sites for future development/redevelopment and the projected moderate
   growth that will occur, construction of residential and other sound-sensitive uses in high noise areas may
   sometimes be necessary. But such projects will be attenuated to the greatest extent feasible through site,
   architectural, and building design features, as stated in the policy and program sections.
   The existing and future noise contours for Covina, again, are illustrated in, respectively, Map 4 and Map 5.
   Distances to contour values (as measured from the centerlines of the sound generators or transportation routes)
   are presented in the Technical Appendix and listed below in Tables 1 and 2 in tabular format. The two tables
   utilized here also highlight general land use conditions and the major noise sources of the various transportation
   courses. It is noted that variations in contour distances are manifestations of the fact that topography and
   intervening buildings or barriers have a complex effect on the propagation of noise.

     (4) This stretch of the street is from Reeder Avenue to the eastern City limits. Because Puente Street in this area
         is essentially an extension of Reeder Avenue and because both routes are surrounded almost entirely by

         information on Puente as on Reeder.
     (5) Noise contours for Workman Avenue were not needed because sounds and corresponding contours from the
         southerly San Bernardino Freeway transcend the noise environment of this route.

   (2) Refers to uses in Covina Planning Area. Land use designations are defined as follows: SFR—single family
       residential; MFR—multiple family residential or condominium; MHP—mobile home park; C—commercial;
       I—industrial; IN—institutional; G—governmental; S—school; U—utility; MU—mixed use; and P—park.
   (3) Noise contours are measured from the centerline of the various noise generators (for all three generator
       types).
   (4) This section is from the western City limits to Glendora Avenue.
   (5) This stretch of the street is from Reeder Avenue to the eastern City limits. As stated in Table 1 above, because
       Puente Street in this area is essentially an extension of Reeder Avenue and because both routes are surrounded
       almost entirely by single-family detached properties, the City determined that it would be acceptable to use
       the same contour information on Puente as on Reeder.
   (6) Noise contours for Workman Avenue were not needed because sounds and corresponding contours from the
       southerly San Bernardino Freeway transcend the noise environment of this route.
C.     Analysis of Existing and Future Noise Contours
       The existing and future noise contours for Covina are illustrated in, respectively, Map 4 and Map 5, and the
       distances to contour values are presented in the Technical Appendix and listed in tabular format in Tables 1
       and 2. For background information on noise contours, refer to Sections A and B of this chapter above.
       The applicable existing and future contour maps and tables illustrate that Covina’s noise conditions vary
       greatly and will continue to differ, present and projected Freeway and street traffic and train operations being
       the primary contributing factors. There are and will continue to be several residential and other noise-sensitive
       uses located within the 60 and 65 decibel demarcations. Under both existing and future conditions, the six
       transportation routes with the farthest-reaching contour distances include the San Bernardino Freeway, the
       Metrolink Commuter Rail Line, and the following roads: Arrow Highway, Azusa Avenue, Citrus Avenue, and
       Grand Avenue. However, all 60 and 65 decibel zones of each and every transportation corridor noted in the
       tables warrant equal consideration in the noise analysis process. Although the inclusion of an area within
       either contour indicates that noise levels are high enough to be of potential concern, such designation does not
       imply that excessive noise levels are present uniformly on all sites within the contour areas. The location of
       buildings as well as doors and windows, walls, landscaping, and changes in topography affect noise levels.
       Some locations may be screened from noise impact by the presence of one or more of these features.
       Notwithstanding the previous comments, the City will use the contour information as a guide in exercising, to
       the greatest extent legally and practically possible, noise mitigation and abatement decisions and actions and
       in carrying out applicable policies (listed in Chapter IV below) for existing and for new and expanded
       developments. Because Covina is generally a mature, built out community with above-noted legal and resource
       limitations in addressing existing noise sensitive uses within the contour zones and because many such uses
       may in fact possess site features that inhibit excessive sound exposure, it is believed that the existing and
       future contour information will be most applicable to new and expanded developments and uses. Refer to the
       following chapters on policies and programs for specific documentation of the means and approaches the City
       will use in handling the noise contours.
D.     Listing of Key Noise Quantification and Analysis Issues
       This area of discussion lists the key issues concerning noise quantification and analysis and is based on the
       facts and information presented in the previous sections, related salient material, and community input (see
       Chapter VII for clarification). As stated in Chapter II (Identification and Appraisal of Major Noise Sources),
       issues are important because they clarify key matters warranting attention and because, along with the detailed
       quantification and analysis of the local noise environment (in the preceding sections and Technical Appendix),
       issues form the basis for the below-listed goal and policies and programs/implementation measures. (Issues
                                                          F-11

   of Chapter II are thus similarly regarded and applied.) Refer to the previous sections and to the accompanying
   Technical Appendix for clarification on this material and for underlying data and information. (In addition,
   see the Land Use Element and Land Use Study for an expanded discussion on matters relating to land use.)
   The major noise source issues are listed below in no particular order. It should be noted that the issues are not
   necessarily mutually exclusive.
1. Acknowledging that, based on observations and facts, the San Bernardino Freeway, the major or (as defined
   under the previous General Plan) the primary and secondary arterial streets, and the Metrolink Commuter Rail
   Line are the principal generators that shape the local noise environment and therefore serve as the basis for
   communitywide noise quantification and analysis.
2. Stating that, based on applicable data, existing and future noise conditions in Covina vary greatly and will
   continue to differ, present and projected vehicular traffic and train operations being the primary contributing
   factors.
3. Dealing with several residential and other noise-sensitive uses located within “noisy zones” or what are called
   the 60 and 65 decibel noise contours (areas of similar sound exposure) that run parallel to the City’s various
   transportation routes, particularly along Arrow Highway, the Metrolink Rail Line, the San Bernardino Freeway,
   Azusa Avenue, Citrus Avenue, and Grand Avenue.
4. Because of the long-term nature of the General Plan update and implementation processes, paying particular
   attention to the future noise conditions or contours (i.e., for 2010, the year of Covina General Plan build out).
5. Acknowledging that because Covina is generally a mature, built-out community with above-noted legal and
   resource limitations in addressing existing noise sensitive uses within the “noisy zones” or sound contour
   areas and because many such uses may in fact possess site features that inhibit excessive sound exposure, the
   existing and future noise contour information would be most applicable to new and expanded developments
   and uses.
6. Committing to use the noise-related data and information in this chapter as a guide in exercising, to the
   greatest extent legally and practically possible, noise mitigation and abatement decisions and actions or in
   carrying out applicable, below-listed policies and programs/implementation measures.
                                                    F-12

IV. GOAL AND POLICIES
A.  General
    As stated in the Introduction above, the goal and policies of this General Plan chapter are important because,
    along with the below-presented implementation measures, they serve as the chief tools with respect to local
    decisions and actions in evaluating private developments and public projects. The goal and policies, again as
    previously indicated, are based on the community’s key noise-related conditions and issues (described in
    Chapters II and III above), which were ascertained by City staff generally by official survey and through
    public comment. In theory, then, the goal and policies presented here (and accompanying implementation
    measures) bridge the gap between where the community is and what type of city it wishes to become.
    A goal is defined as a general expression of an ideal future condition or state toward which the community
    wishes to advance. A policy, on the other hand, is a statement that most directly guides decision-making and
    actions. In order for policies to be meaningful and useful, they must be clear and unambiguous, a guideline
    that this Element has followed. Policies should also indicate local government commitment. Therefore, all
    below policies are listed within the context of “The City shall . . .” and are worded in plain English.
B.  Goal and Policies
    In applying the two terms to Covina, one goal and several policies are utilized. The policies are listed within
    a framework relative to four topical areas. The goal is:
              An environment in which potential adverse impacts of noise on the City’s residents and workers are
              identified and prevented and mitigated.
    The remainder of this chapter is devoted to the policies, the four underlying topical areas of which are based
    on different noise source types. This organization is determined to be most logical and best suited for the City
    of Covina in controlling and abating excessive sounds. Under each topical area, policies are listed in no
    particular order. The four topical areas are:
    1.        Transportation noise sources.
    2.        Commercial and industrial noise sources.
    3.        Miscellaneous stationary noise sources.
    4.        Construction noise sources and general matters.
    The topical areas are not entirely mutually exclusive, and, therefore, several policies from different groupings
    are similar. Also, the goal and policies are applied on a citywide basis, unless expressly stated otherwise. In
    terms of the nature of the below listed policies, it is noted that the City generally has limited regulatory control
    over the transportation noise sources, the first grouping that includes cars, trucks, buses, and other vehicles on
    streets, rail operations, and aircraft overflights. State and Federal agencies have the responsibility to control
    noises associated with these sources. Nevertheless, the City can deal with transportation sounds in various
    ways, such as by encouraging and administering proper, noise-reducing land use compatibility and site planning
    principles as well as, when appropriate, by working with transportation providers to resolve problems. A
    local government’s greatest leverage in regulating excessive noise pertains to nontransportation sources, which
    would include the noises identified under the second through fourth groupings, commercial and industrial
    uses, miscellaneous activities, and construction. Typically, noise levels associated with these sources are
    enforced through a local noise ordinance. Some of the strategies employed in handling the transportation
    sources, such as encouraging appropriate land use compatibility and site planning as well as following various
    related procedures, are used in this area to facilitate noise abatement and mitigation.
                                                        F-13

C.  Policy Area 1
    Transportation Noise Sources
    The City shall:
1.  Examine the noise environment of proposed residential or other noise-sensitive uses located within all 60 Ldn
    noise contours to ensure compatibility and, pertaining to residential activities, adherence to applicable State
    noise insulation standards.
2.  Attempt to mitigate or eliminate the possible noise problems of proposed residential or other noise-sensitive
    uses located within all 65 Ldn noise contours to ensure compatibility and, pertaining to residential activities,
    adherence to applicable State noise insulation standards.
3.  Consider “noise-sensitive uses” to include, but not be limited to, all residential housing types, public and
    private primary and secondary schools, libraries, parks/recreation areas, hospitals/medical facilities, nursing
    homes, and churches.
4.  Consider establishing acceptable limits of noise levels for various land uses throughout the community, in
    accordance with State guidelines, as a means of determining noise-compatible land uses.
5.  Ensure the inclusion of noise-mitigation measures and features in the design, orientation, and routing of new
    and improved streets and circulation and transportation facilities, where necessary and consistent with funding
    capability.
6.  Require noise-reduction techniques and features in site planning, architectural design, project landscaping,
    building materials, and/or construction, where necessary or required by law.
7.  Support and participate with Caltrans in the development of any sound abatement plans for the San Bernardino
    Freeway, particularly relating to residential or other noise-sensitive uses.
8.  Provide for the continued evaluation of truck movements and routes to provide effective separation from
    residential or other noise-sensitive land uses, and, where appropriate, consider truck route changes.
9.  Ensure that any future major truck distribution facilities are located, designed, and oriented to impose minimal
    noise-related incursions on noise sensitive activities.
10. Provide for the continued evaluation of public bus movements and routes, to the greatest extent possible, to
    attain effective separation from residential or other noise-sensitive land uses, and, where feasible, work with
    bus service providers in considering route changes.
11. Ensure that any new or expanded major bus depots are located, designed, and oriented to impose minimal
    noise-related incursions on adjacent activities, particularly noise-sensitive uses, and work with bus providers
    to resolve any existing or potential problems.
12. Discourage high speed, through traffic in residential neighborhoods by means of proper street design, including,
    but not limited to, the use of cul-de-sacs, knuckles, and curvilinear roads, speed control, and, if necessary, by
    incorporating one-way orientations.
13. If necessary and feasible, incorporate traffic calming measures, including, but not limited to, speed bumps or
    humps, traffic circles, and/or chockers in residential neighborhoods.

14. Require that new or expanded developments minimize the noise impacts of trips that they generate on residential
    neighborhoods by controlling the location of driveways and parking.
15. Continue to monitor existing operations of and expansion plans for the Metrolink Commuter Train Line and
    Covina Station pertaining to noise-related impacts on residential uses and noise-sensitive activities and
    discourage any proposals that unreasonably increase communitywide noise levels.
16. Ensure that rail car- and horn-related noises emanating from the Metrolink system, including the Covina
    Station, meet Federal standards, and continue to work with Metrolink officials to adopt specific measures to
    reduce overall rail car and horn noises to the greatest extent technologically possible and to the degree that
    local residents, particularly those directly adjacent to or within close proximity of the track, are least impacted.
17. Continue to permit higher than normal block walls along the rear property lines of residential parcels that
    back up to the Metrolink right-of-way to mitigate train-related noises, and consider other appropriate
    concessions.
18. Encourage all law enforcement agencies operating within the City limits to enforce State Vehicle Code and
    related noise standards for cars, trucks, motorcycles, buses, and other vehicles to control, among other things,
    offensive sounds from modified engine, exhaust or horn systems, high-wattage stereos, and general amplification
    devices.
19. Consider supporting State or Federal legislation for the reduction of the levels of noise generated by cars,
    trucks, motorcycles, buses, and trains.
20. Support ongoing efforts by Covina Police personnel to use applicable portions of the City Code to handle and
    control operating, unmonitored vehicle alarms.
21. Restrict the use of trail bikes, mini-bikes, and other off-road motor vehicles, except where designated for that
    purpose.
22. Consider requiring that new vehicles and equipment used by the City, contractors, or permittees comply with
    all applicable noise standards.
23. Allow the development of heliports or helipads only when it can be demonstrated that noise impacts on
    adjacent or nearby residential uses can be adequately mitigated.
24. Require that helicopter takeoff and landing patterns be limited to government, commercial, and industrial
    areas, except in emergencies.
25. Consider establishing the City’s major streets and the San Bernardino Freeway as the principal helicopter
    flight corridors and consider requiring the use of these zones, except when alternative corridors are needed for
    safety or emergency purposes.
26. Require that helicopters utilizing Covina airspace fly in compliance with Federal regulations, maintain noise
    alleviating altitudes until landing, and follow noise-minimizing flight procedures.
27. Discourage helicopter training flights over the City between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m.
28. Monitor existing operations at and any expansion plans for local airports that could impact the Covina noise
    environment.
                                                       F-15

29. Raise in environmental reviews and oppose any actions implemented by local airports, including, but not
    limited to, flight path changes in Covina airspace, that noticeably increase the overall level of noise in the
    community.
30. Balance the City’s obligation to protect local residents from excessive transportation noise with Covina’s need
    to accommodate moderate growth and to continue with ongoing communitywide construction, economic
    development, code enforcement, neighborhood preservation, and affordable housing activities/programs.
D.  Policy Area 2
    Commercial and Industrial Noise Sources
    The City shall:
1.  Consider establishing acceptable limits of noise levels for various land uses throughout the community, in
    accordance with State guidelines, as a means of determining noise-compatible land uses.
2.  Discourage the location of noise-sensitive land uses in noisy environments.
3.  Consider “noise-sensitive uses” to include, but not be limited to, all residential housing types, public and
    private primary and secondary schools, libraries, parks/recreation areas, hospitals/medical facilities, nursing
    homes, and churches.
4.  Require noise-reduction techniques and features in site planning, architectural design, project landscaping,
    building materials, and/or construction, where necessary or required by law.
5.  Require that parking lots and structures and loading areas be designed to minimize on-site noise impacts and
    off-site incursions by calling for the use of appropriate walls, buffers, and materials and by insisting upon the
    configuration of on-site or interior spaces that minimize sound amplification and transmission.
6.  Require that automobile and truck access to a commercial or industrial property situated adjacent to residential
    parcels be located at the maximum practical distance from the residential properties.
7.  Consider prohibiting truck deliveries to commercial and industrial properties abutting residential uses before
    7:00 a.m. and after 11:00 p.m., unless there is no feasible alternative or there are overriding transportation
    benefits of scheduling deliveries at the other hours.
8.  Minimize the noise impacts of commercial-, industrial-, institutional-, or transportation system-related parking
    overflow in residential areas by continuing the existing and, where applicable, expanding the residential
    parking permit system and by employing other methods.
9.  Study and consider the existing and potential noise-generating characteristics of commercial, industrial, and
    other businesses that wish to expand or modify their scope of operation.
10. When necessary, encourage existing relatively noisy or code-violating industrial businesses adjacent to
    residences to abate their intrusive sounds, to the greatest extent feasible, by taking appropriate measures, such
    as utilizing new, technologically advanced equipment, closing front or rear doors during business hours,
    modifying work/production schedules, or changing the interior location of machinery/equipment.
11. When necessary, encourage public agencies and institutions located in the City to incorporate appropriate
    measures to contain noises generated by their on-site activities.

12. Ensure that commercial or industrial buildings are constructed soundly to prevent adverse noise transmission
    onto adjacent businesses.
13. Ensure that condominium/townhouse and apartment structures are constructed soundly to prevent adverse
    noise transmission onto adjacent dwelling units.
14. Where necessary or where in or adjacent to residential neighborhoods or particular nonresidential areas,
    require private schools and entertainment uses, restaurants, bars, and similar activities to provide for increased
    security resources and to monitor the activities of patrons who are waiting in line or loitering outside of the
    establishment.
15. Require that private schools and entertainment uses, restaurants, bars, and similar activities control the activities
    of their patrons on-site and within reasonable and legally-justifiable proximity thereon to minimize noise
    impacts on adjacent residences as well as on businesses.
16. Discourage the development of new nightclubs, discotheques, billiard parlors, and other high noise-generating
    uses adjacent to residential areas, unless it can be demonstrated that adequate measures can be employed to
    mitigate the impacts of on-site operations and off-site customer access.
17. Prohibit the development of new nightclubs, discotheques, billiard parlors, and other high noise-generating
    uses adjacent to senior citizen housing, schools, health care facilities, and other noise-sensitive uses, unless it
    can be demonstrated that adequate measures can be employed to mitigate the impacts of on-site operations
    and off-site customer access.
18. Periodically review and, if necessary, revise Covina’s existing Noise Ordinance to better regulate high noise-
    generating uses and to ensure that the Ordinance establishes standards for all types of noise not already
    governed by local regulation or preempted by State or Federal law.
19. Continue enforcing the Covina Noise Ordinance and maintaining coordination among City departments/
    divisions involved in noise abatement.
20. Periodically monitor and update data regarding the City’s current and projected sound levels to acknowledge
    changes in noise conditions arising from future development and alterations in land use, traffic patterns, and
    train schedules.
21. In enforcing the Covina Noise Ordinance, pay particular attention to a resident complaint in which there is an
    adjacent commercial or industrial activity generating a high and unreasonable level of noise onto the residential
    property.
22. Evaluate and make recommendations on potential noise impacts of permanent developments and uses through
    environmental or noise-related studies or analyses and, for minor work, by observing project plans as well as
    the potential noise impacts of temporary activities and special events.
23. Balance the City’s obligation to protect local residents and workers from excessive noise exposure with Covina’s
    need to accommodate moderate growth and to continue with ongoing communitywide economic development,
    commercial revitalization, public improvement enhancement, residential construction, neighborhood
    preservation, code enforcement, and affordable housing activities/programs.
24. Require that commercial uses developed as part of a mixed use project (e.g., residential dwelling units situated
    above commercial businesses) not be noise-intensive, except where determined to be appropriate through
    appropriate features and mitigation.
25. Require that mixed use structures be designed to prevent the transfer of noise and vibration from the commercial
    activity to the residential use.
                                                        F-17

26. Require that common walls and doors between commercial and residential uses be constructed so as to minimize
    the transmission of noise and vibration.
27. Orient mixed use residential units away from major noise sources, to the greatest degree possible.
28. Locate balconies and openable windows of residential units in mixed use projects away from major noise
    sources, to the greatest degree possible.
29. Evaluate and appropriately handle potential noise incursions of new or expanded child day care or group
    home facilities, particularly relating to residential and other sensitive uses.
30. Where necessary, work with the appropriate State agencies to prevent or resolve noise disturbances arising out
    of small child day care or group home facilities that exist in residential neighborhoods.
31. Continue supporting and enforcing City Zoning provisions pertaining to limitations on in-home businesses to
    ensure that such activities will function peacefully and harmoniously in residential neighborhoods.
32. Continue supporting Federal and State standards pertaining to interior noise levels of commercial and industrial
    businesses.
E.  Policy Area 3
    Miscellaneous Stationary Noise Sources
    The City shall:
1.  Continue implementing the Covina Noise Ordinance to regulate the hours of operation for, among other
    things, lawn equipment, domestic power tools, garbage trucks, and miscellaneous repair or maintenance
    equipment, when in or within 500 feet of a residential area.
2.  Encourage the installation of quiet residential air conditioners and outside appliances and devices, with proper
    installation procedures.
3.  Continue working with the City’s trash collection service to minimize adverse noise impacts on residents.

                                                       F-18

F.  Policy Area 4
    Construction Noise Sources and General Matters
    The City shall:
1.  Continue implementing the Covina Noise Ordinance to regulate the hours of operation and excessive noise
    associated with on-site construction activities, particularly activities occurring in or near residential uses,
    permitting exceptions only under special circumstances.
2.  Where necessary, require the construction of barriers to shield noise-sensitive uses from intrusive, construction-
    related noise.
3.  Require that construction activities incorporate feasible and practical techniques, measures, and procedures
    that minimize the noise impacts on all adjacent uses.
4.  Consider requiring sound attenuation devices on construction equipment to reduce noises associated with
    building activities.
5.  On a citywide basis, continue, where appropriate, accommodating vibrant, quality, and attractive commercial
    and industrial businesses that strengthen the City’s economic base, image, and character, while minimizing
    adverse noise impacts.
6.  Attempt to reasonably monitor and handle potential and actual negative noise-related incursions from projects
    in adjoining jurisdictions.
7.  Best implement the Noise Element through the Zoning Ordinance and Design Guidelines, Capital Improvement
    Program, Subdivision Ordinance, Building and Safety and Police provisions, general Code Enforcement, and
    any related Covina Municipal Code sections, City policies, plans, or proposals or through other matters.
8.  Observe the requirements imposed by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) when reviewing any
    public or private proposals, including, but not limited to, infrastructure alterations or the development,
    redevelopment, modification, or expansion/remodeling of properties, to address all applicable potential noise
    impacts.
9.  Ensure, to the greatest extent possible, that properties, buildings, and uses of which the Federal or State
    government or another entity has permitting authority over, such as post offices, public schools, hospitals,
    mobile home parks, utility company sites, and miscellaneous administrative facilities, comply with all applicable
    Covina noise and related codes and standards and address any City concerns.
10. Appropriately monitor and, under State law, annually report to the Planning Commission and City Council on
    progress in General Plan implementation to ensure the viability, effectiveness, and coordination of all adopted
    goals, objectives (if applicable), policies, and land use, circulation, noise, and other plan components.
11. Maintain a coordinated, cooperative, and inter-departmental approach in handling various noise-related issues
    and problems.
12. Endeavor to promote the importance of the General Plan and its implementation to the public, businesses,
    developers, Covina employees, and other interested parties through appropriate channels.
                                                      F-19

13. Implement the Noise Element in a manner consistent with the desired implementation/administration of all
    other General Plan Elements, as presented in those chapters, and applicable City and Redevelopment Agency
    plans and community goals.

V. PROGRAMS/IMPLEMENTATION MEASURES
   Under State law, a noise element must contain programs/implementation measures. Programs supplement
   goals and policies and serve as a key implementation mechanism. In other words, as stated in the Introduction,
   programs ensure that this Noise Element’s goal and policies will reach fruition. For clarification on the goal
   and policies and how they have shaped the development of this section, refer to Chapter IV.
   The Covina Noise Element programs/implementation measures are listed below. Some of the programs/
   measures are currently active, though many would commence upon Element adoption. Programs that are
   proposed are believed best suited and viable for the City.
   For reasons of simplicity and clarity, the programs/measures are divided into two below-listed subject areas.
   Although the policy chapter established different groupings for the various noise sources, it was believed that
   such an organization would not function clearly here because of excessive overlapping of programs. Within
   each topical area, the programs are listed in no particular order. The two subject areas are:
   A.       Transportation and Nontransportation Noise Mitigation and Abatement
   B.       General Administration
A. Transportation and Nontransportation Noise Mitigation and Abatement
1. State Noise Insulation Standards
   Under Title 24 of the California Administrative Code, which is administered by the City Building and Safety
   Division, the construction of all new attached dwelling unit complexes (i.e., apartments and condominiums/
   townhomes) and transient lodging facilities (e.g., motels and hotels) located within the 60 decibel Ldn contour
   must incorporate features that reduce interior noise levels to 45 decibels. Verification of this standard shall be
   achieved through submittal of an acoustical design report. The City may also wish to apply the interior noise
   level provision to new single-family detached dwelling units as well, and it is recommended that the community
   examine the sound environment of all proposed nonresidential noise-sensitive uses within the 60 decibel
   contour.
2. State Vehicle Code Standards
   The State Vehicle Code is the body of provisions that regulates all vehicle-related noises, including excessive
   sounds from modified engine and exhaust systems, on public streets and on private properties. Covina Planning
   and related officials will encourage all law enforcement agencies operating within the City limits to enforce
   this Code.
3. City Vehicle Car Alarm Provisions
   Under the Covina Municipal Code, the City has some authority to deal with operating, unmonitored car
   alarms that can be quite disturbing to residents and others. The Police Department will continue to follow
   and, when necessary, expand these provisions.
4. City Noise Ordinance and Related Provisions
   The City Planning Division and other City entities will continue to follow and enforce its adopted Noise
   Ordinance and related provisions of the City Municipal Code on private properties. The Ordinance, which is
   the primary tool used to implement noise policy, establishes noise level standards citywide for most nonvehicle
   or point source sounds of an obnoxious or offensive nature, including music, machinery, building exhaust
   systems, animals, certain commercial or industrial operations, parties or assemblages, and construction activities.
                                                    F-21

    For construction, there are also restricted hours of operation. A key intent of this tool is to address potential
    noise complaints typically made by persons in residential and other noise sensitive properties. The City
    should from time to time review the Ordinance to ensure continued suitability and viability and revise the
    measure to reflect changes in public consciousness concerning noise.
5.  Noise/Land Use Compatibility Guidelines
    The Planning Division will use the noise/land use compatibility guidelines illustrated in the State General
    Plan Guidelines in considering whether to establish acceptable limits of noise levels for various land uses
    throughout the community. These noise level limits, if followed, would be utilized to determine noise-
    compatible land uses relating to mitigating existing noise problems and to guiding future development decisions.
6.  Zoning Ordinance and Design Guidelines
    The Planning Division will continue to utilize the various development standards and provisions of the Zoning
    Ordinance and Design Guidelines to require noise-reduction techniques and features in site planning,
    architectural design, project landscaping, parking and loading orientation and design, building materials, and/
    or construction, where necessary or required by law. These noise reduction features shall be particularly
    applicable to new or expanded or remodeled properties or activities that may generate noise incursions onto
    adjacent residential and other noise-sensitive uses. The Zoning Ordinance also regulates in-home businesses
    to ensure compatibility with neighborhood environments. When necessary, standards and provisions shall be
    revised to better serve the public.
7.  Site Plan Review Process
    This process is part of the Zoning Ordinance and serves as the chief mechanism by which development
    proposals are reviewed and, accordingly, Zoning Ordinance and Design Guidelines provisions are applied.
    The Planning Division will continue to use Site Plan Reviews to ensure that necessary and/or required noise
    reduction techniques and features are included in development plans.
8.  Conditional Use Permit Process
    Through the Zoning-related Conditional Use Permit process, the Planning Division will work with the Police
    Department and other entities to control and minimize in residential neighborhoods, nonresidential areas, and
    public places potential noise problems emanating from properties with uses characterized by moderate to
    high levels of nighttime patronage, including, but not limited to, restaurants, night clubs, bars, billiard parlors,
    and theatres, as well as certain private schools. Under the Conditional Use Permit process, proposals undergo
    staff and Planning Commission (or public hearing) review and evaluation.
9.  Uniform Building Code
    The Building and Safety Division will continue to follow the standards and requirements of this and related
    structural codes to prevent or minimize noise impacts both within the limits of properties and onto adjacent
    noise-sensitive uses. When necessary, standards and provisions shall be revised to better serve the public.
10. Street Design Standards
    The City Planning and Engineering Divisions will continue to ensure the inclusion of noise mitigation standards,
    measures, and features in the design, orientation, and routing of new, improved, and modified streets and
    circulation and transportation facilities. Important parts of this effort shall be to develop a viable circulation
    plan for the revised General Plan Land Use Map and to discourage high speed, through traffic in residential
    neighborhoods. When necessary, standards will be revised to better serve the public.
                                                       F-22
11. Traffic Calming Measures
    If necessary and feasible, the Planning and Engineering Divisions will consider to incorporate in residential
    neighborhoods traffic calming measures, including, but not limited to, speed bump or humps, traffic circles,
    and/or chockers.
12. Freeway Sound Abatement
    All City departments/divisions will support efforts by Caltrans and/or other agencies to develop any sound
    abatement plans and measures for the San Bernardino Freeway, particularly relating to residential or other
    noise-sensitive uses.
13. Truck Movements and Routes
    The Planning and Engineering Divisions will continue to maintain and evaluate truck movements and routes
    to provide effective separation from residential or other noise sensitive land uses and, where appropriate,
    consider truck route changes.
14. Bus Movements, Routes, and Major Depots
    Where necessary and appropriate, the Planning and other applicable departments/divisions will continue to
    provide the maximum feasible input to local bus providers on bus movements, routes, and major depots to
    provide effective separation from residential or other noise sensitive uses and to perform system improvements.
15. Metrolink Commuter Rail Line and Covina Station
    The Planning and other applicable departments/divisions will continue to monitor all noise-related aspects of
    the Metrolink Commuter Rail Line and Covina Station pertaining to the community to ensure conformity
    with applicable standards. The City will further continue to work with Metrolink officials to adopt specific
    measures to reduce overall rail car and horn noises to the greatest extent technologically possible and to a
    degree acceptable by residents living adjacent to the Line.
16. Aircraft Noise
    The City will consider developing a program to coordinate with the appropriate agencies the control and
    mitigation of noise from aircraft, particularly helicopters.
17. City-Owned Vehicles and Construction and Maintenance Equipment
    The City will consider requiring all construction- and maintenance-related vehicles and equipment used by
    the City, contractors, and permittees to comply with all applicable noise standards.
18. Environmental Impact Review Process
    The Planning Division will continue to use this process, which runs with the Site Plan Review procedure, to
    determine whether any aspects of new or expanded permanent developments or uses would generate excessive
    noise levels. Should noise abatement be necessary, the City may wish to require submittal of a technical
    report containing a detailed evaluation of existing and/or projected noise problems and suggested measures to
    mitigate impacts to acceptable levels. Included in this process, where necessary, the City will consider requiring
    sponsors of commercial, industrial, and other projects to conduct special studies addressing traffic, circulation,
    and parking impacts, particularly relating to residential neighborhoods and noise-sensitive projects, and
    providing suggested mitigation.
                                                      F-23
19. Administrative Conditional Use Permit Process
    Many temporary or occasional activities, such as fairs, carnivals, outdoor commercial promotional activities,
    or seasonal sales events, require an Administrative Conditional Use Permit. The Planning Division will continue
    to control or mitigate potential noise problems associated with such events through this staff-involved process,
    where applicable.
20. Special Construction (Noise) Permit Process
    To best control the hours of operation and excessive noise associated with on-site construction activities, the
    Planning Division will continue to require a Special Construction Permit for early morning, evening, and
    Sunday building activities. The Permit shall be issued only in special, justifiable, or hardship cases.
21. Residential Parking Permit System
    The City presently operates a parking permit system in the residential neighborhood adjoining the Covina
    Metrolink Commuter Train Station to prevent the parking of cars by and accompanying noises of Commuter
    Train riders. The City may wish to expand this system, where now existing or in separate areas, to preclude
    parking spillover/noises arising out of future commercial, industrial, or other developments or expansions.
22. Mixed Use Accommodation
    The Planning and Building Divisions will require that mixed use developments (e.g., residential dwellings
    above commercial businesses) be designed and constructed in accordance with applicable codes, standards,
    and policies and such that noise levels inside residential dwellings are as low as possible.
23. Code Enforcement Process
    The Planning and Building Divisions as well as the Police Department will continue to enforce noise abatement
    provisions of the Covina Noise Ordinance and, unless stated otherwise, additional noise control measures
    through the Code Enforcement processes of the Community Development Department and other involved
    entities.
24. Monitoring of Noise Environment
    The Planning Division will periodically monitor the noise environment to note any changes in sound levels
    arising from future development, modifications in land use, traffic patterns, and Commuter Train or bus
    schedules. Where necessary, appropriate action shall be taken, such as following new General Plan policies
    and/or considering to incorporate additional implementation measures.
25. Reconciling Noise Abatement and Mitigation With Other General Plan Obligations
    This noise exposure-related Element is one chapter of a comprehensive General Plan that addresses various
    other topics, including land use, circulation, housing, and natural resources and open space. Under State law,
    all Elements must be consistent with one another in preparation and revision (see Chapter VI), a requirement
    that the City has met and will continue to achieve. However, in the course of implementing a general plan,
    proposals that strongly fulfill plan goals and policies in one area may be inconsistent with another chapter.
    For example, the Covina Housing Element, among other things, identifies various sites for potential apartment-
    oriented affordable housing development, though some of the properties fall within the 60 decibel corridor.
    Although the identification of affordable housing locations in a noise analysis zone does not constitute an
    inconsistency or problem per se, the State noise insulation requirement would be triggered, thus influencing
    the design and cost of this type of housing in the affected areas. Moreover, in some cases, the noise environment
                                                        F-24
   could possibly interfere with important community goals, such as economic development, commercial
   revitalization, neighborhood preservation, and public improvement enhancement. Therefore, in implementing
   the Noise Element, the City will endeavor to reconcile, to the greatest degree possible, noise abatement and
   mitigation efforts with all other General Plan obligations, including, but not limited to, those mentioned
   above. In some situations, however, reconciliation will be facilitated by the fact that particular sites located
   within the 60 or even 65 decibel corridor may not be in need of sound mitigation because of noise-deafening
   physical features. (Refer to Section III for clarification.)
B. General Administration
1. Inter-governmental Coordination
   To most fairly and best deal with noise and related issues at or near Covina’s border areas, the City will
   continue routing various plans and documents to and reviewing development proposals from neighboring
   communities and Los Angeles County. When necessary, Covina will also be in contact with other governmental
   entities and/or relevant groups. This activity will, among other things, acknowledge City intentions, desires,
   and/or concerns over particular developments, proposals, and related actions in an atmosphere of respect and
   cooperation. The City will also deal with the State and regional transportation agencies in addressing noise
   problems.
2. Intra-governmental Coordination
   In carrying out its various noise-related and planning activities and programs/measures, where appropriate
   and feasible, the Planning Division will work with other City departments/divisions, particularly the Building
   and Safety Division and Police Department, to best approach and handle or abate various issues and problems.
   In light of changing Covina demographic, social, economic, and housing conditions as well as other trends, it
   is believed that this holistic orientation is essential and thus will best implement General Plan goals, objectives
   (where applicable), and policies.
3. Public Involvement
   In compliance with State planning law, the City will endeavor to promote the importance of the General Plan
   as well as implementing programs/measures, such as noise mitigation matters, to the public, businesses,
   developers, Covina employees, and other interested parties and groups at the public counter, on the phone, at
   meetings, at City-sponsored events, and at other available opportunities through information handouts,
   brochures, press releases, and any other mediums deemed appropriate. When General Plan updates are done,
   persons, groups, and organizations shall be notified by way of State-defined public hearings and, if appropriate,
   through other means. Frequent public education is an important ingredient in successful general plan
   implementation.
4. General Plan Review and Revisions
   State planning law requires the City to annually report to the Planning Commission and City Council on
   progress in General Plan implementation (with an emphasis on Housing Element-defined needs
   accommodation). The report must then be filed with the State Office of Planning and Research (OPR). The
   intent of this process is to ensure the viability, effectiveness, and coordination of adopted General Plan goals,
   objectives (where applicable), policies, and programs/implementation measures, which impact not only the
   community but, technically, the State as well. The City of Covina will continue with this activity and, when
   an amendment to the revised General Plan is made, will review the change in relation to the entire Plan to
   ensure inter-Element consistency. Also, appropriate, occasional monitoring of the General Plan components
   shall occur. Lastly, no later than five years following adoption of the last phase of the General Plan update, a
   detailed analysis of the entire Plan will be conducted.

5. Noise Element Implementation
   In accordance with the State planning law/Government Code criteria, the City will implement the Covina
   Noise Element in a manner compatible to the implementation/administration of all other General Plan Elements,
   City and Redevelopment Agency plans, and community goals and, in a fashion consistent with the intent of
   this chapter, monitor all facets of Element implementation, conduct necessary tasks so as to best prepare for
   future versions, annually report its findings to the Planning Commission and City Council, and, when legally
   required, necessary, and/or in the public interest, update the Element.
6. Maintenance of City Departments/Divisions Responsible for Noise Matters
   In order to carry out its various noise mitigation, abatement, and enforcement responsibilities and obligations,
   the City will maintain departments/divisions to, among other things, appropriately administer General Plan,
   Zoning, Site Plan Review, Environmental Impact Review, and other matters and various non-Planning Codes,
   to coordinate and monitor City noise-related programs, and to disseminate applicable information and provide
   assistance to the public.

VI. RELATION TO AND CONSISTENCY WITH OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
    This Noise chapter of the General Plan is most closely related to the Land Use Element, the central chapter
    that focuses on the long-term general distribution/location and development intensity of residential, commercial,
    industrial, and other uses, as well as the Circulation and Housing Elements. There is a close tie to the Land
    Use chapter because, under State law, the proposed land use development scenario or Land Use Map must
    reflect the Noise Element’s noise exposure information. In other words, when integrated with the Noise
    Element, the Land Use Map should show acceptable land uses in relation to existing and future noise contours.
    Concerning the Noise Element’s connection to the Circulation chapter, which focuses on circulation and
    transportation systems and the movement of people and goods, because the circulation network must be
    correlated with the Land Use Element and is one of the major sources of noise, noise exposure is intended to
    be a key consideration in the location and design of new and improved transportation facilities as well as
    retention of existing facilities in relation to existing and planned land uses.
    The Housing Element, which this chapter also bears a strong relationship to, among other things, serves as a
    tool for addressing housing needs and providing adequate sites for new housing and standards for the housing
    stock. Because, as stated above, residential land use is among the most noise sensitive, the noise exposure
    information provided in the Noise Element must be considered when planning the location of new housing.
    Specifically, as also previously explained, State law requires special noise insulation of new apartments and
    condominium/townhouse complexes built within the 60 decibel noise contour. The Noise Element is also
    most directly related to the Natural Resources and Open Space chapter.
    It is also important for the Noise Element to be consistent with all other chapters, and vice versa, in terms of
    everything from supporting data and information to policy orientation to implementation. This necessity for
    overall congruence is underscored by State law as well. Section 65300.5 of the California Government Code
    states that “the Legislature intends that the general plan and elements and parts thereof comprise an integrated,
    internally consistent and compatible statement of policies for the adopting agency.”
    The City of Covina has met this consistency requirement. Because the City has updated all General Plan
    Elements simultaneously, one common data and information base, with the same community input, has been
    used for the entire project. This means that the goals, objectives (if applicable), and policies for all Elements
    will have been (when all Elements are completed) prepared based on the same foundation and according to
    the same or similar methodology, thus ensuring consistency. Also, and perhaps most importantly, revising all
    General Plan Elements together guarantees inter-Element program conformity because, according to planning
    law, implementation measures or circulation/infrastructure, land use, and other plans must be developed upon
    the existing conditions/data and issues plus the stated goals, objectives (if applicable), and policies in question.
    In sum, the nature of the Covina General Plan update process has greatly facilitated consistency among all
    Elements. During Noise Element preparation, the topical goal and policies and programs/implementation
    measures have been cross-checked with those in other Elements, particularly Land Use, Circulation, and
    Housing, the other key General Plan chapters, to maintain and verify this necessary congruence.
    The above-noted inter-Element consistency will also ensure that implementation of the Noise and each and
    every Element will realize the same results. Furthermore, if the Noise Element is amended in the future, the
    City will confirm that the change is consistent with other chapters and/or modify the accompanying Elements
    to maintain overall conformity. Moreover, as stated in Program “B4,” the City will monitor all major aspects
    of Noise Element implementation through decision-making activities and other processes to verify this
    consistency. In other words, the City regards all Elements as having equal legal status and is therefore committed
    to appropriate Noise chapter implementation, particularly with respect to inter-Element unity and coherence.

VII. CITIZEN PARTICIPATION IN NOISE ELEMENT FORMATION
     State planning law (Government Code Section 65351) requires local governments, during the amendment of
     a general plan, to “provide opportunities for the involvement of citizens, public agencies, public utility
     companies, and civic, education, and other community groups, through public hearings and any other means
     the city or county deems appropriate.” In fulfilling its citizen participation obligations and in identifying
     issues for the Noise as well as for all other Elements, the City has:
1.   Prepared and distributed a “short” questionnaire to all Covina households.
2.   Prepared and distributed a “long” questionnaire on a random basis to approximately 10% of all Covina area
     households.
3.   Conducted “town hall meetings” and public forums.
4.   Prepared a cable television commercial on the General Plan update and public forums and had a staff member
     appear on the local cable television station to discuss the General Plan update process and answer public
     questions.
5.   Prepared and distributed several General Plan update flyers at City Hall and at various public functions. Also
     prepared press releases and articles in various newspapers and City publications on the update process and on
     the public forums.
6.   Received numerous comments from the public (in this case regarding noise) on the phone, at the counter, and
     in the course of site-specific project reviews.
7.   Reviewed and analyzed the City’s noise complaint file.
8.   Organized, met with, and elicited the views of a subcommittee of Covina’s General Plan Update Committee
     that addressed noise and related issues.
9.   Met with and elicited the views of City of Covina employees who deal with noise abatement and mitigation
     issues.
10.  Received numerous comments from representatives of other public or quasi-public agencies, such as school
     districts, transit agencies, utility companies, regional organizations, and adjacent municipalities as well as
     local civic organizations.
     The public comments elicited from measures 1 through 10 have been carefully studied by the City and have
     been incorporated into the body of data and information that was used in formulating the Noise Element’s
     identification and quantification of major noise sources and, therefore, in developing the related goal, policies,
     and programs/implementation measures as well. All material and information and specific input received
     pertaining to these items are on file in the City Planning Division. Thus, Covina has made a reasonable effort
     to reach out to the important segments, views, and organizations in drafting this Noise Element.

VIII. MONITORING NOISE ELEMENT IMPLEMENTATION
      In order for the General Plan Noise Element’s goal, policies, and programs/implementation measures to be
      realized, or to ensure that the Element serves to maintain and, where necessary, improve Covina’s noise
      environment and quality of life, the Element must be implemented as proposed through effective decision-
      making and actions. Also, to ensure that implementation is achieved to the maximum degree possible, consistent
      Noise Element monitoring must also occur. This subject is addressed by Section 65400(b) of the Government
      Code, which states that following general plan adoption or revision, a city shall “provide an annual report to
      the legislative body on the status of the plan and progress in its implementation . . .” Because the Noise
      Element is an important chapter and is, as previously stated, closely tied to the central Land Use Element,
      monitoring is particularly relevant here.
      The City of Covina will fulfill its obligation to monitor implementation by preparing the State-required report
      for the Planning Commission and for the City Council. This procedure, in fact, has been incorporated into the
      Noise Element implementation framework as Program “B4,” which calls for the monitoring of all aspects of
      the implementation effort, including, as stated in Section VI, assurances that inter-Element consistency is
      achieved. One such facet of the monitoring process is ensuring that any underutilized policies or programs
      are adequately handled. Also, any identified problems or deficiencies will be carefully studied and appropriately
      managed to ensure that desired Noise Element results are met. The City believes that many potential problems
      should be avoided by maintaining a commitment to appropriate Element implementation through the decision-
      making process. Besides, then, furthering the established noise-related goal, this approach will facilitate
      preparing General Plan amendments.

                                          EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Safety Element of the General Plan serves to protect the community from any unreasonable risks associated with
the effects of potential natural and man-made disasters, including earthquakes, geologic hazards, such as landslides,
floods, fires, and hazardous materials accidents. In other words, the Safety Element aims to reduce death, injuries,
property damage, and the economic and social dislocation resulting from major disasters by establishing and applying
safety-related policies, standards, designations, and programs to land use and development decisions and actions.
Recognizing and appropriately handling potential disasters of all types are important for maintaining a community’s
overall functionality, vitality, image, and quality of life.
The entire contents of this Element are based on State planning law requirements (Section 65302(g) of the California
Government Code) and the California Office of Planning and Research (OPR) General Plan Guidelines, an advisory
document on general plan preparation. Under law, as is the case with all chapters of the general plan, the State
establishes the overall data and analysis requirements, while allowing local governments to address their safety issues
and challenges in a manner tailored to local conditions and circumstances. Therefore, the Element has been organized
and prepared in a manner that the City feels is most appropriate and logical and best suited for carrying out planning
activities.
Covina (population 46,452, 1997 estimate) is a mature, suburban community located in the eastern portion of the San
Gabriel Valley, approximately twenty-three miles east of downtown Los Angeles. Covina is generally flat, though
contains a hilly enclave in the southeastern area (Covina Hills), and is today almost completely built-out. However,
future growth in the City is expected, considering the remaining vacant and many underutilized properties as well as
market trends. The community, which possesses a historic downtown that is a key social and economic center of the
City, is characterized by predominately low rise/low intensity residential, commercial, and light manufacturing uses.
For a suburban city, Covina has a relatively high percentage of commercial and industrial areas, which illustrates a
strong, diversified economic base. Despite Covina’s stability, positive image and appearance, and reputation as a good
community in which to live, work, shop, and seek recreation and entertainment, the City is susceptible to some natural
and man-made hazards because of regional geography (i.e., being in earthquake-prone southern California), urbanization
(in which fires and hazardous materials accidents could occur in structures and on roads), topography (in which wild
land fires and landslides and mudslides could take place in the hilly Covina Hills area), hydrology (considering that
major flooding could occur around the unimproved portion of Walnut Creek in Covina Hills, being located downstream
from the major Bonelli Park flood control complex), future development, and other factors. The Covina General Plan
covers a ten square mile Planning Area, which includes seven square miles of incorporated territory and a three square
mile Sphere of Influence/unincorporated area (designated for eventual Covina annexation). Refer to Section “A” of
the Land Use Study of the Land Use Element for more information on location, character, and the Covina Planning
Area.
The Safety Element is divided into twelve chapters. The first chapter introduces and presents general information on
the Element process, as mentioned above, as well as below-described Element contents.
In section number two, potential seismic and geologic hazards are identified, to the extent applicable to Covina, and
appraised and mapped. The key issues in this area include: 1) monitoring the two potentially active earthquake faults
in Covina for any movement and, if detected, taking appropriate actions; 2) coping with possible ground shaking
hazards and concomitant effects and risks in Covina that could occur as a result of movement along any of the several
active earthquake faults throughout southern California; 3) coping with possible landslide and mudslide hazards and
concomitant effects and risks in Covina Hills that could occur as a result of continuous erosion processes or the
simultaneous interaction of an unstable surface condition with either an earthquake or a heavy rain; and 4) promoting
earthquake preparedness in the community by participating in various programs. Other salient issues here pertain to:
5) maintaining current seismic- and structural-related codes and standards and grading and construction practices; 6)
continuing to retrofit older, unreinforced masonry and similar buildings; and 7) recognizing and appropriately handling
the unique geological, soil, and topographic conditions in and near the Covina Hills area.
                                                             E-IX

The third chapter discusses and analyzes potential flooding hazards. The primary issues consist of: 1) supporting and
working with Los Angeles County in maintaining the existing flood control infrastructure serving Covina; 2) supporting
and working with Los Angeles County in enhancing the local storm drainage system in particular areas to address local
minor flooding and ponding problems; and 3) coping with seasonal moderate flooding and erosion problems in and
around the unimproved section of the Walnut Creek Flood Control Channel in Covina Hills, which is related to the
excessive release of storm waters from the upstream Puddingstone Reservoir and Dam complex. Other key issues in
this area include: 4) studying and monitoring the cumulative effects and implications of property damage, human
danger, and soil erosion and concomitant threats to wildlife in and adjacent to the unimproved section of Walnut Creek
relative to existing, seasonal flooding; 5) following appropriate Uniform Building Code provisions regulating earth
work and grading during construction and pertaining to other matters to minimize erosion along the banks of, again,
the unimproved section of Walnut Creek; and 6) encouraging the County to develop a program to seismically reinforce
Puddingstone Dam.
Section number four focuses on dangers associated with possible fires. The key issues in this area include: 1) coping
with potential urban or structure-oriented fires, particularly regarding older, larger apartment and commercial and
industrial buildings that lack automatic sprinklers and other fire prevention features; 2) coping with potential wild land
or hillside oriented fires, a threat that exists in and adjacent to the Covina Hills area because of the district’s proximity
of a relatively large number of residential houses to combustible plant materials; and 3) continuing to maintain appropriate
Building and Safety, Fire, and Planning Department/Division requirements and standards for new construction and for
substantial additions to existing structures to prevent and minimize potential urban and wild land fires in the community.
Additional noteworthy issues here pertain to: 4) maintaining ongoing fire inspection, neighborhood preservation,
general code enforcement, and business monitoring programs that reduce fire and other dangers associated with
residential, commercial, industrial, and institutional buildings and 5) continuing with existing citywide fire prevention/
education programs to bolster public awareness of the disastrous impacts that fires can have on the community.
The fifth chapter discusses and analyzes issues pertaining to hazardous materials, particularly potential accidents. The
salient hazardous materials issues are: 1) dealing with the ongoing generation, use, and storage of various hazardous
materials in Covina, which raises the possibility of chemical spills, gas leaks, explosions, structural fires, and resource
contamination; 2) continuing to maintain information on City businesses and entities that handle hazardous materials
to best respond in the event of an accident or to call upon Los Angeles County officials for assistance; 3) continuing to
maintain City Building and Safety Division and Fire Department inspections and efforts to identify hazardous materials
use and storage in various businesses and activities; 4) dealing with the ongoing transport of large quantities of
hazardous materials through and near Covina along the San Bernardino Freeway, the Metrolink Commuter Rail Line,
and via major arterial streets; and 5) dealing with the treatment and disposal of hazardous wastes from commercial,
industrial, and institutional uses. Other key issues in this area include: 6) dealing with the disposal of household items
considered hazardous; 7) dealing with potential or actual underground hazards from storage tanks, septic tanks, and
natural gas distribution lines, which, in some cases, have led to soil contamination; 8) continuing to cooperate with the
appropriate State and County departments on the identification, monitoring, and remediation of subsurface pollution,
particularly from underground storage or septic tank leakage, through appropriate actions; 9) cooperating with appropriate
agencies in preventing waste disposal as well as all non-storm water discharges into the storm drainage system; and 10)
cooperating with Los Angeles County and all other levels of government in incorporating into the General Plan applicable
portions of the Los Angeles County Hazardous Waste Management Plan, which concerns the treatment and disposal of
hazardous materials at the municipal level, particularly sections on the location identification and siting criteria of, the
analysis of, the application of conditions to, and the inclusion of public participation on potential hazardous waste
treatment or disposal facilities.
Section number six of the Safety Element focuses on risk assessment. The chapter expands on the risks pertaining to
the previously-mentioned seismic and geologic conditions, flooding, fires, and hazardous materials by presenting
various criteria that further assess and describe the potential for hazard-related community upset. The key issues here
include: 1) recognizing ground shaking, ground lurching, flooding around Walnut Creek, dam failure, seiches, urban
fires, and underground storage tank problems as having the highest potential of occurring; 2) recognizing ground
shaking, flooding around Walnut Creek, and dam failure or seiches as potentially causing the most extensive overall
upset to the community; 3) acknowledging that the actual/quantifiable risks associated with potential disasters cannot
be predicted with certainty because their incidence in Covina sometimes depends on the occurrence of unusual
                                                              E-X

circumstances; and 4) acknowledging the need to prevent and prepare for a disaster by promoting emergency preparedness
activities, by supporting adequate public safety personnel and resources, and by following related strategies.
The seventh chapter concludes the “assessment” sections of the Element by presenting emergency preparedness and
related and general matters. Under this topic, the primary issues are: 1) maintaining and periodically revising the
Covina Emergency (preparedness) Plan as a viable tool to prepare, mobilize, and employ public and private resources
to meet essential needs in a serious natural or man-made emergency as well as to restore normal conditions as quickly
as possible; 2) utilizing appropriate inter-agency processes and mutual aid agreements in emergency preparedness
planning and during an actual disaster to most effectively deal with other entities and to address community needs; 3)
supporting community programs that train volunteers to assist City staff in emergency preparedness planning; and 4)
promoting public awareness concerning emergency preparedness matters. The other chief issues in this area include:
5) continuing to supply the Covina Fire and Police Departments with adequate personnel, equipment, resources, and
facilities to perform their many duties, including responding to disasters, emergencies, and everyday public safety-
related service requests and participating in emergency preparedness planning; 6) maintaining fire-, paramedical-, and
police-related mutual aid agreements with surrounding communities for supplemental emergency service assistance,
when needed; 7) ensuring that future firefighting, paramedical, and police protective resources and services keep pace
with projected moderate growth and redevelopment activities; 8) ensuring that new, expanded, or altered potentially
problematic developments mitigate any public safety-related impacts; and 9) continuing with various fire and crime
prevention programs. The final noteworthy issues concerning emergency preparedness and related issues consist of:
10) maintaining the San Bernardino Freeway and the major roads as Covina’s evacuation routes in significant
emergencies; 11) maintaining adequate water pressure flow capacity in Covina and sufficient fire hydrants to allow for
proper firefighting capabilities; 12) maintaining adequate public and private road provisions and site design standards
to ensure that hazardous incidents and emergencies can be quickly accessed by emergency vehicles and personnel; and
13) maintaining a coordinated, inter-departmental approach in reviewing public and private projects and proposals to
facilitate implementation of all City public safety-related codes and standards.
In section number eight, the goal and policies of the Safety Element are presented. Goals and policies are important
because they serve as the chief tools with respect to private development and public project evaluation and decision-
making and overall local direction setting as well as the primary basis for the Element’s implementation measures,
discussed in the subsequent chapter. A goal is defined as a general expression of an ideal future condition or state
toward which the community wishes to advance. A policy, on the other hand, is a statement that most directly guides
decision-making and actions. In applying the two terms to Covina, one goal and several policies are utilized. The goal
is:
          A community in which the loss of lives, serious injuries, major damages to public and private structures/
          properties, the loss of natural resources, economic and social dislocation, and the disruption of vital services
          associated with a potential natural or man-made disaster are prevented.
The policies are listed within a framework relative to the following five topical areas:
          1.        Potential seismic and geologic hazards.
          2.        Potential flooding hazards.
          3.        Potential fire hazards.
          4.        Hazardous materials.
          5.        Emergency preparedness and related and general matters.
                                                          E-XI

Thus, the categorization of policies generally follows the previous chapters on hazard identification and analysis. The
key policies for the first topical area, potential seismic and geologic hazards, call for the City to require all new and
expanded or improved buildings and structures to comply with current seismic-related codes, standards, and construction
practices; to require adequate soils, geologic, and/or structural studies/evaluations prior to any building construction,
particularly in the Covina Hills area, to identify appropriate, development-accommodating engineering and development
siting measures; to follow all applicable development and grading standards and practices in the Covina Hills area; to
continue with voluntary seismic retrofitting of older, unreinforced masonry and similar buildings in conjunction with
ongoing commercial revitalization, community development, and general renovation activities for the orderly and
effective abatement of potentially hazardous structures; and to consider the aesthetic, historic, and/or cultural significance
of a building to be upgraded for seismic safety and, to the greatest extent possible, to avoid demolition or alteration of
a structure’s appearance or character in seismic retrofitting. Other noteworthy policies under potential seismic and
geologic hazards require Covina to request that Los Angeles County develop a program and funding mechanism to
seismically reinforce Puddingstone Dam to protect the City and other downstream areas from possible major flooding;
to monitor the dormant/potentially active Indian Hill and Walnut Creek Fault systems in Covina for any officially
documented movement and, if detected, to closely investigate the matter, including determining the exact location and
nature of the fault, probable extent of earthquake activity, and the appropriate development policies and standards to
adopt; where slope-denuding fires strike in the Covina Hills area, to maintain or encourage reasonable replanting
efforts on public and private properties to stabilize bare hillsides against possible landslides or mudslides during
subsequent rain storms; to further investigate and collect additional data on seismic, geologic, and soil conditions
affecting the community, particularly in the Covina Hills area; and to promote earthquake preparedness within the
community by participating in quake awareness programs, such as the distribution of brochure materials and informative
literature on methods to safeguard lives and property during seismic events.
The main policies for the second area, potential flooding hazards, call for the City to support the efforts of and work
with Los Angeles County to maintain the existing flood control infrastructure serving Covina to meet the community’s
drainage needs; to support the efforts of and work with Los Angeles County to enhance the local storm drainage system
in particular areas to relieve local minor flooding and ponding problems and to accommodate future moderate growth;
to work with the State, Los Angeles County, and other officials to attain a permanent solution to Walnut Creek flooding
and erosion problems, such as by developing a program to seismically reinforce the upstream Puddingstone Dam or by
having the County lower the Puddingstone Reservoir water level during the winter months; to continue to require that
all new and significantly expanded developments incorporate sufficient measures to mitigate flood hazards, such as the
design of on-site drainage systems to link with the citywide flood control infrastructure; and to maximize permeable
surface area to reduce site runoff, like by imposing reasonable landscaping requirements. Other important policies
under potential flooding hazards require the City to address, to the greatest extent possible, the short-term or day-to-
day effects and problems in and adjacent to the unimproved portion of Walnut Creek relating to seasonal flooding by
prohibiting the construction of habitable structures within or near the wash, administering additional reasonable
development standards for properties abutting the Creek, and following other appropriate measures; to study and
monitor the long-term or cumulative effects and implications of property damage, human danger, and soil erosion and
concomitant threats to wildlife in and adjacent to the unimproved section of Walnut Creek relating to existing, seasonal
flooding conditions; to adhere to appropriate Uniform Building Code provisions regulating earth work during construction
to minimize erosion along the banks of the unimproved section of Walnut Creek; and to improve emergency preparedness
activities in areas subject to potential dam failure–generated inundation by following various measures.
The third policy area deals with potential fire hazards. Here, the key policies indicate that the City will maintain a
preventative approach in handling potential urban and wild land fires; maintain all fire-inhibiting Building and Safety
and Fire Department requirements and standards for new construction and for substantial additions to existing structures,
including those for fire-resistant building and roofing materials and detector and alarm systems; maintain all fire-
inhibiting Planning Department requirements and standards for new construction and for substantial additions to existing
structures, including those for site planning, building setback, landscape design, and minimum road and driveway
widths; and maintain ongoing fire and business license inspection and business monitoring programs as well as code
enforcement activities, particularly relating to establishments using or storing hazardous materials. In addition, the
City would continue to follow weed abatement programs in Covina Hills to reduce the amount of combustible vegetation;
                                                             E-XII

continue with existing citywide fire prevention/education programs; and maintain and periodically review procedures
for dealing with potential urban and wild land fires and hazardous materials accidents in the Covina Emergency Plan.
Under the fourth topical area, hazardous materials, Covina commits to continue to cooperate with all applicable laws
and agencies concerning the regulation of the use, storage, and disposal of hazardous materials; to continue to contract
with Los Angeles County to administer various State-required monitoring activities and permitting processes regarding
the utilization, storage, and transportation of hazardous materials and to respond to major hazardous materials accidents;
to support City Fire Department general inspections in identifying and addressing hazardous materials; to support City
Building and Safety Department efforts to identify hazardous materials use and storage in the business license inspection
process; and to implement a storm water/urban runoff management program to prohibit all waste disposal and non-
storm water discharges into the public storm drainage system (related policies are also documented). Other salient
policies on hazardous materials call for the City to prohibit high intensity or high risk industrial uses in the community;
to inform residents of the types of household hazardous wastes and the proper manner of disposal thereof; to support
strong and consistent enforcement of all laws pertaining to hazardous materials transport in and adjacent to Covina; to
continue to identify, address, and resolve underground contamination through various local processes; and to support
Federal, State, and County efforts to identify, monitor, and remediate subsurface pollution created by underground
storage or septic tank leakage. Lastly, key policies here state that the City will require all new development to be
connected to public sewers; appropriately handle septic tanks, when found in conjunction with development activities;
prevent hazards relating to major high-pressure natural gas distribution lines that underlie Covina by appropriately
conducting various permit issuance processes and supporting other measures; implement the Los Angeles County
Hazardous Waste Management Plan, while paying particular attention to sections on the location identification and
siting criteria of, the analysis of, the application of conditions to, and the inclusion of public participation on potential
hazardous waste treatment facilities to further community health, safety, welfare, and integrity; and maintain and
periodically review procedures for dealing with potential hazardous materials accidents of all types in the Covina
Emergency Plan.
The key policies for the last topical area, emergency preparedness and related and general matters, call for the City to
maintain and occasionally update the Covina Emergency (preparedness) Plan to allow the local government, residents,
and businesses to handle a natural or man-made disaster in an efficient, organized, and expedient manner and to restore
normal conditions as quickly as possible; to continue to support, follow, and train all Covina City employees in the
Standardized Emergency Management System (SEMS), the chief inter-agency process/framework relating to emergency
preparedness, management, and resolution, to best handle potential disasters and to most efficiently and effectively
deal with other entities; to promote continuing public awareness concerning emergency preparedness matters by preparing
and distributing various information to the community; to sponsor and support community programs that train volunteers
to assist City staff in disseminating information on emergency procedures and in performing effectively after an actual
disaster; to establish the mitigation of earthquake hazards as a high priority for applicable City programs/strategies,
both before and after an earthquake; and to develop programs, procedures, and funding sources to promote the rapid
and effective reconstruction and recovery of effected portions of the City following an earthquake or other major
disaster, as opportunities allow.
Additional important policies state that Covina will designate and maintain the San Bernardino Freeway and the major
roads or primary arterial, secondary arterial, and collector streets (as defined in the Circulation Element) as the City’s
evacuation routes in relation to major emergencies; continue to supply the Covina Fire and Police Departments with
adequate personnel, equipment, resources, and facilities to perform their many duties, including responding to disasters,
emergencies, and everyday public safety-related service requests, and handling emergency preparedness planning,
such that the community is afforded the highest quality, most efficient emergency services; constantly monitor and
evaluate operations and procedures relative to emergency service provision and ensure that the quality and scope of
future fire, paramedical, and police protective resources and services keep pace with projected moderate growth and
redevelopment and community revitalization activities; maintain fire-, paramedical-, and law enforcement-related mutual
aid and specific service agreements with surrounding communities and with Los Angeles County to best assist Covina
emergency service personnel; continue with various fire and crime prevention programs; and require that new, expanded,
                                                            E-XIII

or altered potentially problematic or public safety-threatening developments, uses, and businesses mitigate any impacts
on services that may result from the proposals. The final key policies for this fifth topical area, emergency preparedness
and related and general matters, call for the City to maintain adequate water pressure flow capacity in Covina and
sufficient fire hydrants to allow for proper firefighting capabilities; to maintain adequate minimum road width and
other appropriate public and private street design standards (as described in the Circulation Element and Subdivision
Ordinance) to ensure that hazardous incidents and emergencies can be quickly and safely accessed by emergency
vehicles; to maintain adequate site design standards for public and private driveways, parking aisles, vehicular turnaround,
driveway approaches, building setback, clearances around structures, and other elements (in accordance with the Zoning
Ordinance, Uniform Building Code, and Uniform Fire Code) to, again, ensure that hazardous incidents and emergencies
can be quickly and safety accessed by emergency vehicles and personnel; to continue to maintain a coordinated,
cooperative, and inter-departmental approach in reviewing new or expanded/altered public and private developments
and uses to facilitate implementation of all City public safety-related codes and standards; and to monitor future
hazard- and safety-related conditions, discoveries, and local policy changes and, when necessary, make appropriate
General Plan amendments.
The ninth chapter of the Safety Element discusses the programs/implementation measures, which, along with the goal
and policies, serve as the backbone of the Element. Programs supplement and ensure that the Safety Element’s goal
and policies will reach fruition. The programs and measures are divided into six below-listed subject areas that generally
follow the categorization of the policies. The subject areas are:
          1.        Potential Seismic and Geologic Hazards.
          2.        Potential Flooding Hazards.
          3.        Potential Fire Hazards.
          4.        Hazardous Materials.
          5.        Emergency Preparedness and Related Matters.
          6.        Inter-Topic General Matters.
Various specific and general programs are presented, which, again, supplement the previously-listed goal and policies.
Section number ten discusses the Safety Element’s relation to and consistency with other General Plan chapters. The
Safety Element is most closely related to the Land Use Element, the central chapter that focuses on the long-term
general distribution/location and development intensity of residential, commercial, industrial, and other uses. There is
a close tie to the Land Use Element because, under State law, the proposed land use development scenario must reflect
the community’s identified potential hazards and corresponding mitigation or abatement measures. In addition, under
State law, the Safety Element must be consistent with all other chapters, and vice versa, in terms of everything from
supporting data and information to policy orientation to implementation. The City of Covina has met this consistency
requirement by updating all General Plan Elements simultaneously, including utilizing one common data and information
base and cross-checking all goals, policies, and plans/implementation measures among the various Elements. This
inter-Element consistency will also ensure that implementation of the Safety and all other Elements will realize the
same results. In addition, if the Safety Element is amended in the future, the City will verify that the change is
consistent with other chapters and/or modify the accompanying Elements to maintain overall conformity.
The eleventh chapter lists the various measures that the City has undertaken to guide citizen participation in the General
Plan update process. These items include questionnaires; public forums; cable television segments; and flyers, press
releases, and articles. In addition, City staff received numerous citizen and business comments on the phone, at the
public counter, and in the course of site-specific project reviews and met with and elicited the views of various City
                                                           E-XIV

advisory bodies involved with safety issues. Public comments elicited from the measures were carefully studied by the
City and have been incorporated into the body of data and information that was used in formulating the Element’s
identification and discussion of potential hazards facing Covina and, therefore, in developing the safety goal, policies,
and programs/implementation measures. State planning law places a strong emphasis on citizen participation in the
General Plan preparation as well as implementation and amendment processes.
The twelfth and final chapter of the Safety Element discusses monitoring implementation, which is also a State
requirement and is important to ensure that the Element fulfills its primary purpose of protecting the community from
any unreasonable risks associated with the effects of potential natural and man-made disasters. The City will fulfill its
obligation to monitor implementation by preparing a State-required annual report on this matter to the Planning
Commission and City Council. Any identified underutilized policies or programs will be adequately handled and
problems or deficiencies will be carefully studied and appropriately managed to ensure that the desired Safety Element
goal is met. Because the Safety Element is an important chapter and closely tied to the central Land Use Element,
monitoring is particularly relevant here.
Much of the background information and facts and analysis of data for this Element appear in the accompanying
Technical Appendix, a consultant-prepared compilation of primarily seismic and geologic subjects, with some materials
on flooding and fire issues. Though separate, the Technical Appendix is legally part of the Safety Element. The City
believes that this two-document organization best addresses applicable planning statutes and policies as well as local
conditions and needs.

I. INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND
   The Safety Element of the General Plan serves to protect the community from any unreasonable risks associated
   with the effects of various potential natural and man-made disasters. Under State planning law (discussed
   below), possible hazards include: 1) seismic (or, earthquake-related); 2) geologic (e.g., landslides); 3) tsunami
   (or, tidal waves); 4) flooding; 5) fires; and 6) hazardous materials accidents. The potential disasters must be
   identified, appraised, and mapped (where possible) as well as addressed in terms of evacuation routes, peakload
   water supply requirements (pertaining mainly to fires and hazardous materials incidents), minimum road
   widths, and clearances around structures. In other words, the Safety Element aims to reduce death, injuries,
   property damage, and the economic and social dislocation resulting from major disasters by establishing and
   applying safety-related policies, standards, designations, and programs to land use and development decisions
   and actions. Because Covina is, as clarified below, a generally mature suburban community in the east San
   Gabriel Valley (an inland subregion) of (earthquake-prone) greater Los Angeles, has many commercial and
   industrial businesses, and has extensive infrastructure, safety issues in the community center primarily around
   potential earthquakes, fires, and hazardous materials accidents and concomitant risks and effects. However,
   because the southeastern part of the community is, in many places, hilly, very low density, and traversed by a
   partly unimproved wash linked to a major flood control facility (at Bonelli Park, which is upstream to the
   east), possible landslides and major flooding also pose threats to this area and therefore are noteworthy matters
   as well. Recognizing and appropriately handling potential disasters of all types are important for maintaining
   a community’s overall functionality, vitality, image, and quality of life. From the standpoint of the entire
   General Plan process, the Safety Element is closely related to the chapters on Land Use, Circulation, Housing,
   and Natural Resources and Open Space.
   The complete contents of this Element are based on State planning law requirements (Section 65302(g) of the
   California Government Code) and the California Office of Planning and Research (OPR) General Plan
   Guidelines, an advisory document on general plan preparation. Under law, as is the case with all chapters of
   the general plan, the State establishes the overall data and analysis requirements, while allowing local
   governments to address their safety issues and challenges in a manner tailored to local conditions and
   circumstances. Therefore, as indicated below, the Element has been organized and prepared in a manner that
   the City feels is most appropriate and logical and best suited for carrying out planning activities.
   The Safety Element is divided into twelve chapters. Following this Background chapter, the second section
   presents an identification, discussion, and mapping of the potential seismic and geologic hazards affecting
   Covina, which primarily emanate from, respectively, active earthquake faults located throughout southern
   California (but which do not pass through Covina) and possible landslides or mudslides in the topographically
   varied Covina Hills area. There is also a section on local structural conditions and seismic retrofitting efforts.
   Here, reference is made to an accompanying communitywide seismic and geologic assessment that functions
   as the Technical Appendix to this Element. The third area exhibits an identification of and discussion on
   possible flooding hazards, which, as indicated above, focus on the section around Walnut Creek in Covina
   Hills. Areas in the predominant flat territory of Covina that experience minor flooding and ponding problems
   are also mentioned. Section number four presents the potential fire hazards, which are broken down according
   to the flatland and hillside areas. The fifth chapter identifies and discusses possible dangers associated with
   the handling of hazardous materials and the generation of hazardous wastes by both businesses, which pose
   the greatest threats, and households. Other topics discussed here include the transportation of hazardous
   wastes in Covina, identified and potential problems related to underground storage and septic tanks and high-
   pressure natural gas distribution lines, and the Los Angeles County Hazardous Waste Management Plan, a key
   regional-oriented document that brings cities into the hazardous waste treatment process. The sixth area
   approaches the previously-identified potential disasters by presenting various criteria that further estimate
   risks associated with these hazards and that assess and describe the likely extent of upset to the community
   and surrounding area that would occur as a result of various disasters.
                                                      E-1

Chapter number seven concludes the informational/factual portion of the Element by presenting emergency
preparedness and related information as well as general State-required matters, including the Covina Emergency
(preparedness) Plan, evacuation routes, emergency response personnel (i.e., the City Fire and Police
Departments), peakload water supply requirements, and minimum road widths and clearances around structures
(which pertain to emergency personnel/vehicle accessibility). Following this chapter, the eighth section lists
the Safety Element goal and policies, an important component that bridges the gap between where the City is
and what type of community it wishes to become. The ninth chapter describes programs/implementation
measures, which supplement and ensure fruition of the goal and policies. Sections ten, eleven, and twelve
conclude the document by discussing, respectively, the relation to and consistency with other General Plan
Elements, citizen participation in Element formation, and monitoring Safety Element implementation.
Covina (population 46,452, 1997 estimate) is a mature, suburban community located in the eastern portion of
the San Gabriel Valley, approximately twenty-three miles east of downtown Los Angeles. Covina is generally
flat, though contains a hilly enclave in the southeastern area (Covina Hills), and is today almost completely
built-out. However, future growth in the City is expected, considering the remaining vacant and many
underutilized properties as well as market trends. The community, which possesses a historic downtown that
is a key social and economic center of the City, is characterized by predominantly low rise/low intensity
residential, commercial, and light manufacturing uses. For a suburban city, Covina has a relatively high
percentage of commercial and industrial areas, which illustrates a strong, diversified economic base. Despite
Covina’s stability, positive image and appearance, and reputation as a good community in which to live, work,
shop, and seek recreation and entertainment, the City is susceptible to some natural and man-made hazards
because of regional geography (i.e., being in earthquake-prone southern California), urbanization (in which
fires and hazardous materials accidents could occur in structures and on roads), topography (in which wild
land fires and landslides and mudslides could take place in the hilly Covina Hills area), hydrology (considering
that major flooding could occur around the unimproved portion of Walnut Creek in Covina Hills, being
located downstream from the major Bonelli Park flood control complex), future development, and other
factors. The Covina General Plan covers a ten square mile Planning Area, which includes seven square miles
of incorporated territory and a three square mile Sphere of Influence/unincorporated area (designated for
eventual Covina annexation). Refer to Section “A” of the Land Use Study of the Land Use Element for more
information on location, character, and the Covina Planning Area.

II. IDENTIFICATION AND APPRAISAL OF SEISMIC AND GEOLOGIC HAZARDS
A.  General
    As stated in the previous chapter, under this topic, State law requires the identification and mapping of known,
    potential seismic and geologic hazards, including ground shaking, ground lurching, ground rupture, tsunami,
    seiche, and ground failure, which encompasses liquefaction, settlement, subsidence, and landslides and
    mudslides. This identification is intended to serve as a basis for the Safety Element goal, policies, and programs
    on the management, mitigation, and, if possible, prevention of adverse effects or community upset associated
    with these hazards.
    In Covina, as explained below, there are no major earthquake faults, though the City lies in a seismically
    active region and two dormant faults pass through the community. This means that Covina could experience
    ground shaking and ground lurching hazards from movement along active faults in adjacent or distant areas
    but faces limited susceptibility to ground rupture, a phenomenon that occurs only immediately around the
    active faults. And because Covina is predominantly flat and geologically stable, most ground failure problems,
    namely liquefaction, settlement, and subsidence, have not been identified in the past and appear unlikely to
    occur in the future. However, in the topographically-varied Covina Hills area, where many homes were
    developed on fill, landslides or mudslides may take place. Regarding tsunami, inasmuch as Covina is an
    inland community, the hazard would not affect the City. (Seiches are discussed in the subsequent chapter
    under flooding.) Thus, from a planning standpoint, certain seismic or geologic hazards could cause damages
    in the community while others are relatively or totally insignificant. The following chapter, therefore, discusses
    these matters to the extent that they pertain to Covina.
    It is noted that information and facts relating to the City’s seismic and geologic setting are clarified in the
    accompanying Technical Appendix, which is a detailed, consultant-prepared report on existing topical
    conditions. Though separate, the Technical Appendix is legally part of this Element. Matters relating to other
    areas, as stated below, are referenced from general documents and correspondence on file in the Covina
    Planning Division.
B.  Seismic and Geologic Setting and Faults and Earthquakes
    The City of Covina lies within a metropolitan area that has historically been seismically active. Earthquakes
    occur as the result of movement along breaks in the crust of the earth, which are called faults. The earthquake
    is basically the effect of the shock waves generated by the break. If the area of the break is small and limited
    to the deeper part of the crust, then the resulting movement would be small. However, if the fracture is large
    and extends to the surface, the break can result in a major earthquake.
    Faults are prevalent throughout California and are commonly classified as either “active” or “potentially
    active.” An active fault is a break that has moved in recent geologic time (the last 11,000 years) and that is
    likely to move within the next approximately 100 years. Active faults are the primary focus of concern in
    attempting to prevent earthquake hazards. A potentially active fault is one that has shifted but not in the recent
    geologic period (or, between 11,000 and 3,000,000 years ago) and is therefore considered dormant or unlikely
    to move in the future. The Technical Appendix should be referenced for more general information on this
    topic.
    No active faults have been identified within or adjacent to the boundaries of the Covina Planning Area, which,
    most importantly, indicates that the community does not fall under either the State Earthquake Fault Zoning
    Act or the State Hazards Mapping Act. These Acts basically require that local governments, in the general
    plan update process, adopt policies and criteria to ensure the structural adequacy of buildings erected across
    active faults for human occupancy. In some cases, the development of structures must be prohibited. Verification
    that the above Acts do not pertain to Covina was obtained through correspondence with the State Department
                                                        E-3

of Conservation and is on file with the City Planning Division.
According to the Technical Appendix, there are two potentially active earthquake faults that pass through
Covina, therefore indicating, as previously stated, that they would not pose a significant seismic threat or
hazard to the community. The two faults are: 1) the Indian Hill Fault, which runs through a portion of the
northeastern section of the City and 2) the Walnut Creek Fault, which traverses southeastern Covina along
Walnut Creek. Nevertheless, because below-described hazards could theoretically occur, the City will take
note of and monitor these fault systems with respect to future development and planning matters, to the
greatest extent possible. For clarification on the faults, refer to the Technical Appendix and accompanying
Seismic Hazards Map.
Despite the fact that Covina faces limited threats from interior seismicity, there are a number of active faults
in southern California that could potentially move and thus result in hazards to the community. The Technical
Appendix describes these faults in detail, including their distances from Covina, lengths, maximum (Richter
Scale) magnitudes of historical quakes, and maximum probable earthquake (again, Richter Scale) magnitudes
that could be expected. Noteworthy, relevant information is summarized below.
The closest active faults to Covina are the Sierra Madre and Duarte and Lower Duarte Faults, which are
approximately between 2 and 4 miles north of the City, as also shown on the Seismic Hazards Map. This fault
zone is believed to have moved during the 1971 San Fernando earthquake, which reached a magnitude of 6.4.
In addition, a segment of the well-known San Andreas Fault, the portion of which runs between San Bernardino
City and Parkfield (southeast Monterey County) and is considered most capable of generating a large earthquake
upsetting Covina as well as the surrounding region, lies only about 20 miles northeast of the City. Geologic
evidence suggests that the San Andreas Fault has a 50 percent chance of producing a magnitude 7.5 to 8.5
quake (comparable to the great San Francisco earthquake of 1906) within the next 30 years. The other active
faults closest to or within 20 miles of Covina include the Whittier-Elsinore Fault (10 miles to the southwest),
the Norwalk Fault (20 miles to the southwest), and the Raymond Fault (15 miles to the northwest). The
previously-mentioned San Andreas and other active Faults close to Covina are mapped on Figure 3 of the
Technical Appendix. A significant earthquake originating along any of these or other regional faults could
cause damage to buildings and infrastructure as well as injuries and fatalities in Covina.
The above-noted earthquake-related potential problems or disturbances pertaining to Covina would actually
occur as a result of primary and secondary effects or hazards associated with subsurface movement, such as
ground shaking and ground failure, which are discussed in the following section. Generally, in a community
like Covina, where there are no active faults, the probable extent of hazards related to crustal movement in
adjacent or outlying areas would be a function of the City’s geologic, soil, and topographic conditions. Most
of Covina is located in the relatively flat San Gabriel alluvial fan, which is comprised of relatively deep
sedimentary deposits derived from rocks exposed in the northerly San Gabriel Mountains. Geologic hazards
under these conditions are limited to ground shaking. However, the southeastern portion of Covina (comprised
primarily of residential properties) tends to be hilly and is underlain with thinner alluvium and bedrock,
which, in certain sections, may be prone to ground failure, including landslides. For more information on
Covina geology, refer to the Technical Appendix and the Seismic Hazards Map. Regarding the entire community,
with very few exceptions, geologic, soil, and seismic hazards do not resist development, though do occasionally
establish a need for particular types of detailed investigations that are conducted prior to construction.
                                                   E-4

C. Overview of Potential Seismic and Geologic Hazards and Concomitant Effects and Risks Relating to
   Covina
1. General
   As indicated in the previous section, although there are no active faults within the City of Covina, seismic
   hazards and risks are not necessarily restricted to those areas directly along or surrounding a fault. Depending
   on the type of fault system, its depth, and other factors, earthquake waves produced by a seismic incident
   could have far-reaching impacts. Therefore, to ascertain the ramifications that earthquakes might have for
   and to protect the public health and safety of Covina, it is necessary to inventory and discuss potential seismic
   and geologic hazards and concomitant effects and risks relating to the community. It must also be noted here
   that, as stated in the prior section and in the Technical Appendix, the community could theoretically face
   seismic problems from the two potentially active faults that run through Covina.
   Seismic and geologic hazards are typically classified from a sequential standpoint. Initially, the earthquake-
   related shock waves generated by movement along an active fault lead to what are called primary hazards,
   which include ground shaking, ground lurching, and ground rupture. Secondary hazards are defined as the
   interaction of one or more primary factors with existing ground instabilities, resulting in ground failure, such
   as liquefaction and landslides and tsunami. Concerning both types of hazards, it is noted that the City’s
   susceptibility thereof varies considerably. In other words, as explained below, in the event of a major earthquake
   in the area, while some hazards could be considered inevitable, others are unlikely to occur but are noted for
   documentation purposes.
2. Ground shaking
   Ground shaking is the movement of the earth’s surface in response to a seismic event and, in general, is the
   primary cause for the collapse of buildings and other structures, injury, and loss of life. The intensity of the
   ground shaking and the extent of resultant damages are a function of the magnitude of the earthquake, distance
   from the fault movement, the characteristics of the surface and subsurface, geology, and a community’s building
   types and intensities and daytime and nighttime populations.
   Because of Covina’s proximity to several previously-identified active faults and because of the prevalent,
   motion-susceptible alluvium that underlies the community, the City will experience ground shaking in the
   future. (And as indicated earlier, this activity could theoretically occur as a result of the two potentially active
   faults that lie within the community.) Ground shaking would likely be strongest in roughly the upper two-
   thirds of Covina, which is the closest to the northerly Sierra Madre and Duarte and Lower Duarte Faults.
   Refer to Seismic Hazards Map for clarification. And the fact that the City is generally built-out indicates the
   potential for considerable damage to structures as well as injuries and loss of life in the event of a major
   earthquake. The structures that are particularly vulnerable to damage are the older, unreinforced masonry
   buildings generally in the downtown. (See Section “D” below.) However, Covina’s potential for major upset
   in a seismic incident could be tempered by the fact that the City has few multi-story structures. Nevertheless,
   in recent years, Covina has attempted to mitigate potential earthquake problems—or best protect public health
   and safety during foreseeable ground shaking—through the following of various seismic-related building
   codes (again, refer to Section “D” below) and emergency preparedness activities (discussed in Chapter VII).
   All in all, it is believed that whatever risks Covina faces from matters discussed herein are not unreasonable
   compared to surrounding areas.
3. Ground lurching
   As earthquake waves travel through subsurface materials, the materials are stressed. If the amplitude of the
   earthquake waves is great enough, the earth materials could be overstressed and break, resulting in cracks,
   fissures, and displacement in the ground at places other than directly above the active fault. Unconsolidated
   and poorly solidified materials are most susceptible to ground lurching, but the phenomenon can occur in
                                                      E-5

   bedrock as well. Therefore, all areas within the City of Covina have a moderate or high potential for lurching.
   However, the problem per se is not considered to pose a health or safety threat.
4. Ground rupture
   Ground rupture refers to the fracturing or vertical or lateral displacement of the earth’s surface along a fault,
   which is caused by underlying crustal movement. The degree of displacement is a function of the intensity of
   an earthquake and may range from a few millimeters to several feet. However, only buildings and structures
   straddling faults would be subject to major damage. Covina’s susceptibility to this type of hazard is limited
   because there are no active faults in the community. Whatever risks the community does face here concerning
   its two potentially active faults are believed to be reasonable—or not warranting any remedial action.
5. Ground failure
a. General
   As mentioned earlier, ground failure is classified as a secondary seismic hazard, which refers to the interaction
   of one or more primary hazards—such as ground shaking—with existing surface instabilities and results in
   liquefaction, settlement, subsidence and/or landslides or mudslides. In short, ground failure is the inability of
   the earth to maintain its normal strength. This area of discussion states whether and, if applicable, to what
   extent these hazards pertain to Covina.
b. Liquefaction
   Liquefaction is a phenomenon that occurs when water-laden, loose, and cohesionless soils are subject to
   intense seismic shaking and form a quicksand- or fluid-like soil condition below the ground surface. As a
   result, structural damage may occur as building foundations lose ground support. Liquefaction typically
   occurs in areas where the ground water is less than 30 feet from the surface and where the soils are composed
   of predominantly poorly consolidated fine sand. In Covina, liquefaction has not been a problem in the past
   and appears to have very limited future hazard potential because the water table is generally more than 50 feet
   deep and there are believed to be no areas of loose, cohesionless soils. This has been clarified on the Seismic
   Hazards Map. Also, it is noted that the City’s geological and soil conditions have precluded this hazard from
   occurring in Covina’s two ground water recharge basins/flood control spreading grounds, Ben Lomond, at the
   southwest corner of Arrow Highway and Barranca Avenue, and Walnut Wash, at the easterly terminus of
   Workman Avenue. Refer to Chapter III below and to the Natural Resources and Open Space Element for
   clarification on these facilities. Notwithstanding the above facts, the City will monitor this topic for future
   changes.
c. Settlement
   Settlement of the ground may occur in poorly consolidated or particular soils or improperly compacted fills
   during earthquake shaking, though the problem could also arise during heavy rains. As a consequence,
   structural damage may take place. However, this activity is not of major concern to Covina because of
   generally favorable soil conditions and because the City has long-adhered to all applicable building code
   provisions in hillside developments.
   Regarding the underlying soils, as stated in the Natural Resources and Open Space Element, the Soil
   Conservation Service of the U. S. Department of Agriculture maps and classifies this matter with respect to
   their suitability for resource conservation and agriculture as well as urban development. In that Element, it
   was noted that the two soil associations in the Covina area, Hanford (2-5% slopes) and Romona-Placentia (2-
   5% slopes), were generally suitable for urbanization, as opposed to agriculture. Mentioned here is the “limitation
   rating,” which relates to the soils’ capacity to support load and resist settlement. A rating of “slight” refers to
   soil properties that are favorable for construction. A “moderate” rating means that some soil properties are
                                                      E-6

   unfavorable, but construction can take place with special design/planning features. Soils with a “severe”
   rating require major soil reclamation and/or special design before any construction can take place. Most of
   the Covina Planning Area has a “slight” rating; some areas in the eastern, particularly southeast, part of the
   community are classified as “moderate.” This means, again, that soil characteristics are generally favorable,
   though on certain properties construction would require special design/planning features. (It is noted that
   portions of a few properties backing up to Walnut Creek in the Covina Hills area have experienced some soil
   erosion caused by Creek inundation. This matter is discussed in conjunction with flooding hazards in the
   following chapter.)
d. Subsidence
   Although it is typically not induced by seismic activity, subsidence may result in settling, tilting, or uneven
   land surfaces and therefore is worthy of discussion here. Subsidence generally occurs in areas of loose and
   soft soil materials when ground water is withdrawn to the extent that surface deformation takes place. Because
   of decreasing amounts of water extracted from below the surface in Covina in recent years, subsidence has not
   been viewed as a problem.
e. Landslides and mudslides
   A landslide is defined as a falling mass of soil or rocks. This occurrence, which often constitutes a continuous
   erosional process, is considered a geologic, rather than seismic, hazard because the basis for a slide is an
   unstable surface condition, not an earthquake. The earthquake may, however, provide the triggering force to
   initiate the downward movement. In addition, landslides may also take place as a result of heavy rains,
   particularly after a major fire, or construction grading. The Technical Appendix lists common types of this
   phenomenon, including mudslides (generally, rapid downslope movement of saturated soil, sub-soil, and/or
   weathered bedrock) and rockfalls (basically, an avalanche of loose rock, disturbing more material as it cascades
   down a slope).
   To identify where and to what extent landslide hazards are likely to occur in a community, it is necessary to
   locate hilly areas with particular rock types (e.g., fill, siltstone, or sandstone or poorly-compacted soils) and
   steep slopes (natural or man-made, generally exceeding 20%) as well as to ascertain where the hazards have
   been mapped or are known to exist. In Covina, although there have been no documented cases of major
   landslides (the community being predominantly flat), the problem is believed to have the potential for occurring
   in certain sections of the Covina Hills area, as indicated in the Technical Appendix and shown on the Seismic
   Hazards Map. This district, which is comprised of generally large-lot single-family homes and one business
   park, tends to be hilly and has many fill slopes. However, the City will continue to follow appropriate
   development standards and practices in Covina Hills to prevent possible problems. Also, where slope-denuding
   fires strike, the community will maintain reasonable replanting efforts to stabilize bare hillsides during
   subsequent rain storms. These obviations are particularly applicable to mudslides, which tend to be triggered
   as a result of a combination of fire and heavy rain, as opposed to geologic and slope instability alone, and
   therefore could be more difficult to foresee. But all in all, City officials believe that communitywide risks
   associated with landslide hazards are not unreasonable.
6. Tsunami
   A tsunami is a sea wave, commonly referred to as a tidal wave, generated by an underwater seismic disturbance,
   such as sudden faulting or landslide activity. Tsunami generally affect low-lying coastal areas. Because
   Covina is an inland community (approximately 40 miles east of the Pacific Ocean), the City could not experience
   this phenomenon. (Seiches, earthquake-induced waves in a lake or reservoir, could theoretically upset Covina
   and, therefore, are discussed in the following section under “flooding hazards.”)
                                                       E-7

D. Local Structural Conditions and Seismic Retrofitting Efforts
   Regarding the above-noted potential seismic hazards, the topic must also be considered in relation to
   communitywide structural integrity because damaged buildings are generally a key factor in causing earthquake-
   related deaths and injuries. Experience has shown that newer, low- to moderate-intensity residential and non-
   residential structures constructed from well-built timber, regardless of whether they meet the most current
   seismic codes, have performed satisfactorily in past earthquakes. Therefore, the majority of buildings in
   Covina should provide a relatively low risk to loss of life and property during future fault movements. However,
   high occupancy commercial, industrial, and public buildings, which exist throughout the community, constitute
   greater though unquantifiable risks.
   The highest potential for loss of life and injury during an earthquake is associated with buildings constructed
   prior to the adoption of seismic-resistive codes (or, before 1933), particularly structures of unreinforced masonry
   wall materials. These types of buildings pervade in the older downtown area and have been long regarded as
   a statewide concern, prompting State officials over the years to strengthen structure-related codes and, most
   notably in 1986, to pass significant legislation addressing the problem. The law, promulgated as Chapter 12.2
   of the Government Code, required local governments in seismically active areas, by January 1, 1990, at a
   minimum 1) to identify all unreinforced masonry buildings and other potentially hazardous structures within
   their respective jurisdictions, 2) to notify the property owners of the applicable buildings’ status, and 3) to
   report and file all information on potentially hazardous buildings to, respectively, the local legislative body
   and State Seismic Safety Commission. This legislation also authorized communities to adopt a program to
   mitigate potentially hazardous buildings through various measures, including seismic rehabilitation and
   demolition.
   As described in the Technical Appendix, the City of Covina has complied with the above-mentioned seismic
   law. Notably, 72 structures in the downtown were placed on the community’s official list of potentially
   hazardous buildings. Since this list was adopted, the community has been attempting to address the vulnerable
   structures by encouraging applicable owners to voluntarily pursue seismic retrofitting during remodeling.
   Renovation and thus retrofitting activities often occur in conjunction with the Redevelopment Agency’s building
   façade enhancement program, which offers rebates of construction costs and other incentives to participants.
   A more aggressive, obligatory effort may be initiated in the future, too. It is noted that the above 72 “problem”
   structures represent only a fraction (less than 1%) of all buildings in the City. And each recent development
   in Covina meets every applicable seismic code so as to best resist earthquake motion. The seismic- and
   structural-related codes are generally administered by the Covina Building and Safety Division of the
   Community Development Department, though the State has jurisdiction over certain types of development,
   such as public schools, hospitals, and mobile home parks. Concerning areas with the potential for landslides
   and mudslides, as previously mentioned, the City attempts to prevent these problems to the greatest extent
   possible through following appropriate development and grading standards and practices. Again, for more
   information on structural performance, refer to the Technical Appendix.
E. Listing of Key Existing Seismic and Geologic Issues
   This area of discussion lists the key Covina seismic and geologic issues, which are based on the facts and
   information presented in the previous sections, related, salient material, and community input (see Chapter XI
   for clarification). Issues are important because they clarify key seismic and geologic matters warranting
   attention and because, along with a detailed identification and discussion of local seismic and geologic conditions
   themselves (the preceding sections and Technical Appendix), issues form the basis for the below-listed goal
   and policies and programs/implementation measures. Refer to the previous section and to the accompanying
   Technical Appendix for clarification on these issues and for underlying data and information. (In addition,
   see the Land Use Element and Land Use Study for an expanded discussion on matters relating to land use.)
                                                       E-8

    The seismic and geologic issues are listed below in no particular order. It should be noted that the issues are
    not necessarily mutually exclusive.
1.  Monitoring the two potentially active earthquake faults in Covina for any movement and, if detected, taking
    appropriate actions to restrict but permit development.
2.  Coping with possible ground shaking hazards and concomitant effects and risks in Covina that could occur as
    a result of movement along any of the several active earthquake faults in the area and throughout southern
    California.
3.  Handling problems and nuisances in Covina relating to ground lurching associated with movement along any
    of the many nearby and distant active earthquake faults.
4.  Maintaining current seismic- and structural-related codes and standards and grading and construction practices
    on and continuing to require adequate soils, geologic, and/or structural studies for new and expanded or
    improved buildings to best prepare for potential earthquakes.
5.  Recognizing and appropriately handling the unique geological, soil, and topographic conditions in and near
    the Covina Hills area with respect to grading and development proposals.
6.  Continuing to retrofit older, unreinforced masonry and similar buildings that pervade in the downtown and
    considering to expand existing efforts thereof.
7.  Monitoring the City for incidents of liquefaction, settlement, or subsidence and, if identified, taking necessary
    measures to restrict but permit construction.
8.  Coping with possible landslide and mudslide hazards and concomitant effects and risks in Covina Hills that
    could occur as a result of a continuous erosion process or the simultaneous interaction of an unstable surface
    condition with either an earthquake or a heavy rain.
9.  Maintaining replanting efforts after slope-denuding fires occur in Covina Hills to stabilize bare hillsides
    against possible ground failure during subsequent rainstorms.
10. Promoting earthquake preparedness in the community by participating in various programs and by maintaining
    the multi-hazard Covina Emergency Plan.

III. IDENTIFICATION AND APPRAISAL OF FLOODING HAZARDS
A.   General
     As stated in the Introduction above, under State planning law, the City must identify and appraise potential
     flooding hazards, particularly related to rivers, streams, and creeks, dam failure, seiches, and tsunami. The
     identification serves as a foundation for the Safety Element goal, policies, and programs on the management,
     mitigation, and, if possible, prevention of adverse effects or community upset associated with flooding dangers.
     In Covina, except for the area around Walnut Creek in Covina Hills, the City has not experienced major
     flooding problems in recent years principally because of the community’s favorable climate and developed,
     generally adequate infrastructure. This chapter begins by discussing these two factors and then explains that
     identified flooding, which typically occurs during heavy rains, has been minor in nature, confined to only a
     few intersections or stretches of major streets, and could be easily resolved through enlarging existing or
     constructing new storm drains. It is also mentioned here that according to a branch of the Federal Emergency
     Management Agency (FEMA) that oversees matters pertaining to this topic, Covina does not contain any
     Special Flood Hazard Areas. FEMA classifies the entire community as an area of minimal flooding. However,
     during heavy rains, some flooding takes place around Walnut Creek, a potentially hazardous situation that is
     subsequently discussed. This flooding, which results primarily from the controlled release of water from the
     upstream Puddingstone Reservoir and Dam complex, inundates portions of the back yards of up to 20 Creek-
     rearing homes. Because Covina also therefore faces flooding risks from Dam failure and seiches, these
     possible hazards are presented as well. Lastly, tsunami, a non-issue considering the community’s inland
     setting, relates more to seismicity and was discussed in the previous chapter.
     From a planning standpoint, then, particular flooding hazards could cause upset in Covina and therefore are
     identified and evaluated below. In some cases, follow-up analyses may be appropriate. Information and facts
     relating to the community’s storm drainage system and flooding situation are based on discussions with
     various City and Los Angeles County officials and are referenced from general documents and correspondence
     on file in the Covina Planning Division.
B.   Local Setting
     In recent decades, except for the area around Walnut Creek in Covina Hills, Covina has not experienced major
     flooding problems primarily because of the community’s favorable Mediterranean climate and developed
     storm water and related infrastructure. (Because flooding around Walnut Creek is somewhat of an anomaly
     and pertains to unique though potentially dangerous circumstances, the matter is discussed separately under
     “potential flooding hazards” in the following section.) Regarding the climate, rainfall averages only about 18
     inches each year, nearly all between November and April. Precipitation during the summer period is infrequent,
     and rainless times of several months are common. Concerning the infrastructure, Covina is served by an
     extensive storm drainage system that is comprised of six large, fully improved, and generally open concrete-
     lined channels, which are operated and maintained by the Los Angeles County Flood Control District, and
     numerous smaller, below-ground channels that are the responsibility of the Covina Public Works Department.
     The large, open channels or washes, of which the small lines or typical storm drains feed into, traverse Covina
     in various areas and are illustrated in the accompanying Existing Land Use and General Plan Maps. (It is also
     noted that segments of two flood control channels, one in the Covina Hills neighborhood and the other in
     Wingate Park (just south of Rail Line between Grand and Glendora Avenues) are unimproved or were never
     reinforced with concrete and steel to appropriate engineering standards because of their value as an important
     natural resource (riparian habitat) and, in the case of the Covina Hills facility, because of use as a County
     horse and hiking trail. Refer to the Land Use and Natural Resources and Open Space Elements for clarification
     on these special, sensitive areas. As indicated above and as clarified in the following section, the unimproved
     Walnut Creek channel does, however, experience some potentially hazardous flooding because of the release
                                                        E-11

of water at the upstream Puddingstone Reservoir and Dam.) Another component of the County-operated
flood control infrastructure are two large flood control spreading grounds (at the southwest corner of Arrow
Highway and Barranca Avenue and at the easterly terminus of Workman Avenue), facilities that serve as
generally temporary catch basins for waters diverted from channels and washes in the region and function to
reduce pressure on the overall system. Collected water subsequently percolates into the ground, thus also
serving as ground water recharge facilities (an aspect of the spreading grounds clarified in the Natural Resources
and Open Space Element). As further described in the Land Use and Natural Resources and Open Space
chapters, the spreading grounds may eventually serve a recreation function as well. The large, above-noted
channels are components of an extensive, countywide flood control network that ultimately sends storm water
out to the Pacific Ocean. Most portions of the community’s major streets and nearly all districts and
neighborhoods have stormdrains or are linked to the flood control system.
The above-discussed storm drainage system is designed and generally succeeds to accommodate local runoff
and to eliminate or reduce localized flooding and ponding during rainstorms. In the past, only minor flooding
has occurred, in typically older areas, because of inadequate storm drain capacities or, in a few cases, there
being a major street or intersection completely lacking such facilities. (The City’s definition of “minor flooding”
generally refers to situations during heavy rains where water rises above a curb and flows onto private property,
usually for short periods. However, the definition is more subjective in cases where street curbs do not exist.)
The problem has been somewhat exacerbated by development, which increases local runoff volumes as more
and more solid surfaces become covered by impervious materials. Many of the drainage deficiencies have
been rectified. Specifically, the City and Los Angeles County have independently or jointly constructed
several new storm drains and appurtenant components and enhanced existing infrastructure. However, some
inadequate areas have not yet been addressed and therefore remain prone to minor flooding. These sections
are listed below (in no particular order):
          TABLE 1.            COVINA AREAS SUBJECT TO MINOR FLOODING DURING HEAVY
                              RAINSTORMS*
        AREA                                                                           PROBLEM

5.      Badillo Street, From Hollenbeck Avenue East to Fourth Avenue                   Street Flooding
*Other flooding problems contained entirely within private properties may also exist. And as previously
indicated, this table does not include the area around Walnut Creek in Covina Hills, which, because of its
unique situation, is discussed in the following section.
The information on which Table 1 is based was obtained from the Covina Public Works Department, which,
along with the County Public Works entity, has studied minor flooding within the community and made
recommendations on improving the drainage control network. It is believed that as more (local and County)
funding is made available, the City and County will resolve the listed deficiencies through enlarging existing
or constructing new storm drains and related facilities, as has been done in the past. In sum, despite a few
shortcomings, engineering officials from the City of Covina and Los Angeles County have stated that the
existing flood control system serving Covina is functionally sufficient, so as not to pose any serious hazards,
                                                   E-12

   can accommodate the type of moderate growth (refer to Land Use Element for clarification) the City envisions
   and desires, and will be enhanced in the near future.
   An important, noteworthy point that underscores the community’s generally adequate flood control network
   and corresponding limited potential for major flooding is that the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) of
   the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which oversees matters and establishes regulations
   pertaining to this topic, has determined that the City does not have any Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs).
   According to the FIA mapping system, the entire community is classified as “Zone C,” which indicates “areas
   of minimal flooding.” (Technically, Zone C means that a 100-year flood would be contained within existing
   channels.) Under the voluntary Federal National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), the FIA offers low-cost
   flood insurance to property owners in SFHA-applicable communities in exchange for the local governments
   committing to administer various Federally-approved flood plain management measures. The Zone C
   classification that is applied to Covina and many other places therefore means that Federal flood insurance is
   available, though the cities need not comply with FIA regulations.
C. Overview of Potential Flooding Hazards and Concomitant Effects and Risks Relating to Covina
1. General
   As stated above, although Covina has generally not experienced major flooding, the area around Walnut
   Creek in Covina Hills does get inundated during rainstorms and poses some negative effects or hazards for the
   community. This flooding results primarily from Los Angeles County Flood Control District release of water
   from the upstream Puddingstone Reservoir and Dam complex. Therefore, it is appropriate to present the
   matter under this section. In addition, because Walnut Creek could theoretically become flooded in the event
   of either a seismically-induced failure of Puddingstone Dam or earthquake-prompted seiches, these potential
   hazards must be discussed as well.
2. Controlled release of stormwater into Walnut Creek
   The area around Walnut Creek in Covina Hills experiences some flooding during periods of heavy rain.
   Flooding occurs primarily because of the release of water from the easterly Puddingstone Reservoir as a
   means of managing the facility’s insufficient flood water storage capacity. The storage capacity limitation
   relates to both Los Angeles County and State actions that are clarified below.
   Puddingstone Reservoir and Dam were built in the 1920s to control flooding in Covina and other downstream
   communities. For many years after its construction, the County Flood Control District-managed complex
   adequately performed this function, and downstream water flows were year-round and reasonable. However,
   in the ‘70s, as the surrounding Bonelli Regional Park began developing, County Flood Control officials started
   retaining a high level of water during all seasons to serve various recreational activities. Also around this
   time, the State Department of Water Resources imposed water storage limitations on the County because of
   uncertanties regarding the seismic stability of the Dam (discussed in the following section). To comply with
   State law and to meet increasing recreational needs, the County began to release water through the Dam on a
   managed basis during winter rainstorms. This practice continued and was reinforced as more development in
   and around the park occurred, particularly uses and structures below and to the west of the Dam.
   Today, during heavy rains, the controlled release of water from Puddingstone Dam into the stretch of Walnut
   Creek that meanders through Covina, which is approximately 2 1/2 miles downstream and just upstream from
   where the Creek becomes an improved, concrete-lined channel, floods portions of the back yards of up to 20
   Creek-rearing homes with as much as 3 to 4 feet of water. The inundation typically covers open areas and, if
   existing and toward the rear, accessory structures (such as storage buildings, barns, and/or corrals), thus
   sometimes resulting in minor property damage and threatening public safety. Depending on the intensity of
                                                     E-13

   the storm activity, varying quantities of water from the Dam may be released for up to 30 days during the rainy
   season. Flood waters also cause some soil erosion around the banks of the Creek. (Soil erosion is a natural
   process by which material is removed from the earth’s surface.) Although the severity of this problem is not
   known and requires further study, in general, the cumulative effects of erosion could also threaten structures
   and public safety plus existing wildlife. (As discussed in the Natural Resources and Open Space Element, the
   unchanneled segment of Walnut Creek supports various bird, reptile, and animal species, though none are
   considered endangered. Also, the creek functions as a wilderness area/trail, which provides recreational and
   educational opportunities. These functions could therefore be undermined as well.) It is noted that general
   runoff into all portions of Walnut Creek from abutting residential properties, including those upstream in San
   Dimas, is a contributing though somewhat lesser factor in the above-noted flooding and erosion. As more
   development has occurred, so has increased drainage into the Creek.
   In sum, the loss of flood water storage capacity at and concomitant stormwater management practices associated
   with the Puddingstone Reservoir and Dam complex result in some inundation (again, during the rainy season)
   and could potentially cause major flooding hazards on downstream properties in Covina that warrant attention,
   particularly in light of current plans to commercialize more of Bonelli Park. Such proposals would exacerbate
   the problem and further prevent operation of the Dam to meet the purpose for which it was constructed.
   Therefore, in the past, the City of Covina has officially stated that any Bonelli Park expansion plans should
   resolve local flooding concerns, such as by developing a program to seismically reinforce the Dam or convincing
   the County to lower the Reservoir water level during the winter months. Until a permanent solution is made,
   the City should monitor and address the situation, particularly with respect to cumulative effects, prohibit
   habitable structures from being built within or near the wash, and, to the greatest extent possible, continue
   communicating with County Flood Control District officials on water release matters. Regarding the latter
   point, on days in which water is to be under controlled release, Flood Control officials at the Dam notify the
   Covina Fire Department so the Department can best respond to telephone inquiries and requests for service in
   the area. Fire officials are informed about the quantity of cubic feet of water per minute that is released and
   other relevant facts. But the City must also continue with its emergency preparedness activities (see Chapter
   VII below) to handle a worst case scenario or possible major flood or Dam failure (again, discussed below).
3. Dam failure
   Puddingstone Dam, which, as discussed in the previous section, is just east of and, via Walnut Creek, upstream
   from Covina, was built before the advent of modern seismic safety codes. Although the Dam does not overlay
   any earthquake faults, the facility would nevertheless be vulnerable to failure from major seismic activity in
   an adjacent or distant area. Dam failure would result in major, hazardous flooding and soil erosion around
   Walnut Creek in Covina and other downstream communities. Flooding could reach Covina in as little as 20
   minutes after Dam breakage. And in the City, according to the information on file with the Covina Community
   Development Department, rushing waters would overflow the banks of Walnut Creek by approximately one-
   quarter mile on each side and travel beyond the Covina Hills area, partially inundating the portion of the
   community roughly south of Workman Avenue. However, the exact extent of flooding-related building and
   infrastructure damage and human injuries or deaths is unknown, and, because Puddingstone Dam is County
   owned and managed, the City has limited authority to bring the facility up to current codes. Therefore, to best
   handle this potential disaster and to deal with risks associated therewith, it appears that the City should follow
   three appropriate courses of action: 1) administer reasonable development standards for properties abutting
   the Creek, including those that prohibit habitable structures from being located near the wash; 2) continue
   with ongoing emergency preparedness activities, particularly with respect to evacuation routes (see Chapter
   VII below); and 3) encourage the County to develop a program and funding mechanism to seismically
   reinforce the Dam. (Large-scale relocation of residences from potentially effected areas would be infeasible.)
   In addition, although there are other reservoir-serving dams north and northeast of Covina in the San Gabriel
   Mountains that could break, it is believed that potentially negative impacts on the City would be minimized
   because these facilities are all several miles from Covina (which would enable much water to be caught by
                                                      E-14

   storm drains in adjacent communities and would provide Covina officials with adequate time for emergency
   activities) and because segments of the community’s previously described, generally adequate flood control
   system that pervade the upper and central portions of the town could most likely handle the incoming residual
   waters.
4. Seiches
   Seiches are earthquake-induced waves in enclosed bodies of water, such as lakes or reservoirs, and are similar
   to the sloshing of water in a bucket or bowl when shaken or jarred. The waves can be tens of feet high or more
   and can have devastating effects on people and property within their reach. In reservoirs, dams are often
   overtopped, sending large volumes of water on downstream areas. This is where the potential hazard relates
   to Covina. Because of the presence of the easterly, upstream Puddingstone Reservoir and Dam complex (see
   above for clarification), and because Covina lies in a seismically active region, the City is theoretically susceptible
   to seiches, which would likely cause major flooding. The phenomenon would lead to considerable upset in
   the community if the seiches occurred simultaneously with the controlled release of water form the Reservoir.
   To best prepare for potential seiche-related hazards or to deal with concomitant risks, the City should follow
   two of the courses of action noted in the previous section on possible dam failure: 1) administer reasonable
   development standards for properties abutting the Creek and 2) continue with ongoing emergency preparedness
   activities. Lastly, it is believed that seiches from the northerly and northeasterly dams would not disrupt
   Covina because of distance and infrastructure factors.
D. Listing of Key Existing Flooding Issues
   This area of discussion lists the key Covina flooding issues, which are based on the facts and information
   presented in the previous sections, related, salient material, and community input (see Chapter XI for
   clarification). As stated in the prior chapter, issues are important because they clarify key flooding matters
   warranting attention and because, along with a detailed identification and discussion of flooding problems
   themselves (the preceding sections and Technical Appendix), issues form the basis for the below-listed goal
   and policies and programs/implementation measures. Refer to the previous sections and to the accompanying
   Technical Appendix for clarification on these issues and for underlying data and information. (In addition,
   see the Land Use Element and Land Use Study for an expanded discussion on matters relating to land use.)
   The flooding issues are listed below in no particular order. It should be noted that the issues are not necessarily
   mutually exclusive.
1. Supporting and working with Los Angeles County in maintaining the existing flood control infrastructure
   serving Covina.
2. Supporting and working with Los Angeles County in enhancing the local storm drainage system in particular
   areas to address local minor flooding and ponding problems.
3. Continuing to require that all new and significantly expanded developments incorporate sufficient measures
   to mitigate flood hazards.
4. Coping with seasonal, moderate flooding and erosion problems in and around the unimproved section of the
   Walnut Creek Flood Control Channel in Covina Hills, which is related to the excessive release of storm waters
   from the upstream Puddingstone Reservoir and Dam complex, through following various short-term and
   long-term measures. Short-term measures include prohibiting the construction of habitable structures within
   or near the creek and administering other reasonable development standards as well as communicating with
   Los Angeles County Flood Control officials on water release matters. Long-term actions consist of working
   with various State and County officials to attain a permanent solution to the flooding and erosion, such as
   developing a program and funding mechanism to seismically reinforce Puddingstone Dam or having County
   Flood Control officials lower the Puddingstone Reservoir water level during the winter months.
                                                       E-15

5. Ensuring that any Bonelli Park expansion plans or proposals recognize the original purpose for which the
   Park’s Puddingstone Reservoir and Dam complex was developed and resolve downstream flooding problems
   and concerns in Covina.
6. Studying and monitoring the cumulative effects and implications of property damage, human danger, and soil
   erosion and concomitant threats to wildlife in and adjacent to the unimproved portion of Walnut Creek relative
   to existing, seasonal flooding.
7. Following appropriate Uniform Building Code provisions regulating earth work and grading during construction
   and pertaining to other matters to minimize erosion along the banks of the unimproved section of Walnut
   Creek.
8. Promoting emergency preparedness activities in the community with respect to potential major flooding
   incidents by following various measures and by maintaining the multi-hazard Covina Emergency Plan.

IV. IDENTIFICATION AND APPRAISAL OF FIRE HAZARDS
A.  General
    The Safety Element process, as mentioned in the Introduction, aims to reduce death, injuries, and property
    damage resulting from both natural and man-made hazards. While the preceding two chapters discussed,
    respectively, potential seismic and geologic hazards and flooding risks, this division focuses on the potential
    for fires, the primary man-made hazard. (Hazardous materials spills, another possible man-made disaster, is
    discussed in the following chapter.) Potential fire hazards are thus identified and appraised to serve as a basis
    for the Safety Element goal, policies, and programs on the management, mitigation, and, if possible, prevention
    of adverse effects or community upset associated with this concern.
    There are two types of fires that pose hazards to Covina, urban and wild land. Urban fires originate within a
    structure in the built environment of the generally flatter portions of the community and are typically caused
    by carelessness, ignorance of fire prevention precautions, arson, faulty equipment, or a lack of fire suppression
    devices, such as automatic sprinklers. Wild land fires, on the other hand, start outside of buildings in the very
    low density, hillside areas of southeast Covina (or Covina Hills), where there are large quantities of uncultivated,
    combustible plant materials, particularly near buildings, and generally occur as a result of carelessness with
    matches or cigarettes or, again, arson. The first section below discusses first urban and then wild land fire
    hazards. In Covina, urban or structure-originating fires pose the most danger to the overall community. The
    reason for this is that the City is predominantly flat and developed and, therefore, more susceptible to building
    fires, where there tends to be a greater human presence. Under urban fires, common situations/property types
    in which blazes have broken out as well as current fire prevention control measures and suppression programs
    are discussed. In the latter category, the potential for wild land fires, which have not occurred to large degrees
    in recent years because of existing infrastructure and other factors, is evaluated. The section subsequently
    lists successfully-utilized fire prevention development standards and suppression activities. It is stated that,
    based on past and foreseeable local fire experiences, although both classifications of blazes pose different
    degrees of risk to the community, the City of Covina believes that neither risk is unreasonable relative to
    surrounding jurisdictions.
    Nevertheless, because, from a planning standpoint, potential fires could cause upset in the City, they are
    identified and evaluated below. Follow-up analyses may be appropriate in some cases. Information and facts
    relating to this hazard are based on discussions with City Fire Department personnel and are referenced from
    general documents and correspondence on file in the Covina Planning Division.
B.  OVERVIEW OF POTENTIAL FIRE HAZARDS AND CONCOMITANT EFFECTS AND RISKS
    RELATING TO COVINA
1.  General
    This section presents potential fire hazards relating to Covina. The first area of discussion focuses on what are
    known as urban fires, which are fires that take place in the built environment of the generally flatter portions
    of the community. The second topic presents what are classified as wild land fires, they being likely to occur
    in the very low density, hillside areas of southeast Covina (or Covina Hills).
    Because Covina is predominantly flat and built-out, urban or structure-oriented fires are of greatest concern.
    The types of development that pose relatively high fire hazards are older, larger apartment and nonresidential
    buildings that lack automatic sprinklers and other fire prevention features, smaller commercial and industrial
    structures of which fire sprinkler systems are not required, and commercial and industrial sites handling
    flammable materials. Fires occurring within these structures, which exist throughout the City, constitute the
    most danger or highest risks to humans and thus the overall community because of the greater probability of
    human presence. However, the City attempts to minimize potential urban fire hazards through various prevention
                                                       E-17
   control measures, including emphasizing safety in the design, construction, access to, and use of structures,
   ensuring the proper storage of flammable materials, and conducting business inspections and public education.
   Also, the Covina Fire Department, described in Chapter VII below, maintains sufficient resources to deal with
   most incidents.
   In addition, wild land fires pose a hazard in Covina Hills because of the area’s moderate to steep slopes, large
   quantities of uncultivated, combustible plant materials, particularly in relation to nearby structures, and many
   buildings with wood-shake roofs and that lack fire sprinkler systems. Although the City has not experienced
   major wild land fires in recent decades, a fire in Covina Hills can occur at any time of the year as a result of
   lightning, spontaneous combustion, or arson. Fire is typically most likely to occur during the summer through
   fall “dry season.” However, potential fire hazards are at least somewhat precluded by the facts that the City
   Fire Department (again, discussed in Chapter VII) maintains adequate personnel, equipment, and inter-agency
   agreements to handle most wild land fires, that water for fighting fires in Covina Hills is available via strategically
   placed hydrants, and that the City follows appropriate development standards, building codes, public education
   efforts, and activities related to trimming and clearing overgrown plant materials. All of the above matters are
   clarified below, along with a general discussion on Covina fire protection services. Emergency preparedness
   planning, which the City also employs to deal with both types of potential fire hazards, is presented in Chapter
   VII as well. And, based on past and foreseeable local fire experiences, although both classifications of blazes
   pose different degrees of risk to the community, the City of Covina believes that neither risk is unreasonable
   relative to surrounding jurisdictions.
2. Urban fires
   As indicated above, certain types of development in Covina, pose relatively great fire hazards, they typically
   being 1) older, larger apartment and commercial and industrial buildings that lack automatic sprinklers and
   other fire prevention features, 2) smaller commercial and industrial structures (i.e., under 5,000 square feet)
   of which fire sprinkler systems are not required, and 3) commercial and industrial businesses of various types
   and sizes that generate, store, and/or use large quantities of hazardous or flammable materials (e.g., everything
   from gas stations to large-scale manufacturing operations). According to the Covina Fire Department, the
   primary agency that handles these matters (discussed in Chapter VII below), the areas that constitute the
   greatest fire hazard potential are presented in the following table:
             TABLE 2.            COVINA DEVELOPED AREAS WITH GREATEST FIRE HAZARD
                                 POTENTIAL*

        buildings                                   Street and Barranca Avenue and Charter Oak Wash
                                                    (current target area for City Neighborhood

         properties containing
         hazardous materials
   *Items are listed in no particular order. For clarification on locations, refer to City Street Map. HAZARDOUS
   MATERIALS ARE DISCUSSED SEPARATELY IN CHAPTER V BELOW.
   Although the above notable fire hazards can be found throughout the City, the Covina Fire Department (again,
   discussed separately below) maintains sufficient personnel and equipment to deal with most fire situations
   and can call on nearby firefighting units for assistance, when needed. In general, the City attempts to minimize
   potential urban fire hazards through prevention control measures, which include emphasizing safety in the
   design, construction, access to, maintenance, and use of structures as well as ensuring the proper storage of
   flammable and combustible materials (described separately in the following chapter). Regarding building
   design and construction, modern standards require the incorporation of fire-resistant materials and alarms/
   detectors in all structures and automatic fire sprinklers in many types of development situations, including all
   new and significantly expanded residential properties and new and enlarged non-residential proposals exceeding
   5,000 square feet. And wood-shake roofs are prohibited. Proper safety measures can effectively prevent the
   possibility of fire, thus minimizing potential human and property losses. The City also exercises fire suppression
   in its programs to monitor and inspect businesses and to educate the public on fire prevention methods. These
   activities are performed by both the Fire Department and Building and Safety Division of the Community
   Development Department. Other efforts pertain to disaster preparedness planning, a topic discussed in Chapter
   VII below. (As was the situation with seismic-related codes discussed in Chapter II above, under law or
   through agreement with the City, the State administers fire-inhibiting standards and practices for public schools,
   hospitals, mobile home parks, and other uses.) In sum, as previously stated, fire prevention in buildings and
   structures is of great importance to the City of Covina, which is generally urbanized or built-out and therefore
   particularly prone to this type of hazard. But because Covina has a low density, hillside area (Covina Hills),
   wild land fires, discussed below, pose a problem for the community as well.
3. Wild land fires
   In addition to facing fire threats from buildings or components within the developed areas, Covina is also
   confronted with potential hazards relating to wild land fires in the generally hilly southeastern territory (Covina
   Hills). For purposes of this Element, a wild land fire is a blaze typically occurring in very low density, hillside
   areas with large quantities of uncultivated, combustible plants (such as chaparral and riparian communities),
   brush, and grasslands. Combustible plant materials subject nearby structures to latent fire risks. Most of the
   buildings in this approximately one square mile area are single-family homes and detached accessory structures
   (e.g., garages, barns, and corrals), though there is a major commercial business park around the intersection of
   Garvey Avenue and Holt Avenue (Village Oaks Business Park). Fire risks are somewhat heightened by the
   fact that many of the residential and commercial buildings in Covina Hills have wood-shake roofs and lack
   automatic fire sprinkler systems, and some residential sites have overgrown vegetation. Also of concern and
   considered under this topic of discussion are potential fire hazards occurring at the interface between hillside
   and developed areas. This type of fire could possibly cause the most damage to structures and loss of life
   because of the proximity of a relatively large number of dwelling units to combustible plant materials.
                                                      E-19
   According to the Covina Fire Department, the City has not experienced major wild land fires in recent decades,
   though a fire in Covina Hills can happen at any time of the year as a result of lightning, spontaneous combustion,
   or arson. Fire is most prevalent, however, during the “dry season,” which occurs primarily in the summer and
   fall. The drying effects of the Santa Ana Winds from the eastern deserts together with, in many situations,
   steep slopes and fairly remote, moistless locations increase the inherent fire hazard within this area. Covina is
   also susceptible to wild land fires in light of the fact that a hillside district adjacent to the City in San Dimas,
   according to officials from the Los Angeles County Fire Department, is particularly prone to combustion
   because of topography and vegetation. A fire starting here could therefore spread into Covina.
   It must also be noted that, in theory, other hazards may occur as a result of fire in hillside areas. For example,
   a burn can destroy deep-rooted plants, which could increase the possibility of slope failure. Plants with
   extensive root systems prevent oversaturated soil from sliding during or after heavy rainfall. Moreover, the
   loss of a well-vegetated watershed increases storm water runoff, which could hasten erosion and flooding.
   (These matters were also discussed in Chapters II and III above.)
   As was the case with urban fire hazards presented earlier, the below-described Covina Fire Department (refer
   to Chapter VII for clarification) maintains adequate personnel and equipment to handle most wild land fires.
   Where necessary, the City Fire entity can call on the Los Angeles County Fire Department for assistance in
   this district through an established inter-agency agreement. And according to Covina Fire, water for fire
   fighting is available via strategically placed water tanks and appropriately located hydrants. Furthermore,
   peakload water supply requirements, discussed below, are believed to be adequate. There is also a nearby
   helispot on a concrete-lined reservoir near the junction of the San Bernardino and Orange Freeways. Generally,
   the City endeavors to minimize potential wild land fire hazards through appropriate, prevention-oriented
   development standards relating to architectural design, site planning (e.g., setbacks from slopes), building
   and roof components (e.g., fire-resistant wall materials and tile or composition shingle roofs—wood-shakes
   are prohibited), landscape design, and minimum road widths. (It is noted that in accordance with State
   planning law, minimum road widths and building setbacks or clearances around structures are evaluated
   separately in Chapter VII.) Moreover, current codes would require fire alarms/detectors and automatic fire
   sprinklers in all primary structures in this area. Proper development measures can affectively prevent the
   possibility of fire, thus minimizing potential human and property losses. Finally, the City exercises fire
   suppression in Covina Hills through other avenues as well, including programs to trim and clear overgrown
   plant materials from public and private properties, monitor and inspect commercial businesses (in the Village
   Oaks Business Park), educate the public on fire prevention methods, and work on disaster preparedness planning
   (also discussed in Chapter VII below).
C. Listing of Key Existing Fire Issues
   This area of discussion lists the key Covina fire issues, which are based on the facts and information presented
   in the previous section, related, salient material, and community input (see Chapter XI for clarification). As
   stated in the prior chapters, issues are important because they clarify key fire matters warranting attention and
   because, along with a detailed identification and discussion of potential fire hazards themselves (the preceding
   section and Technical Appendix), issues form the basis for the below-listed goal and policies and programs/
   implementation measures. Refer to the previous section and to the accompanying Technical Appendix for
   clarification on these issues and for underlying data and information. (In addition, see the Land Use Element
   and Land Use Study for an expanded discussion on matters relating to land use.)
   The fire issues are listed below in no particular order. It should be noted that the issues are not necessarily
   mutually exclusive.
1. Coping with potential urban or structure-oriented fires, particularly regarding older, larger apartment and
   commercial and industrial buildings that lack automatic sprinklers and other fire prevention features, which
   pose the most danger to the overall community.
                                                      E-20

2. Coping with potential wild land or hillside-oriented fires, a threat that exists in and adjacent to the Covina
   Hills area because of the district’s proximity of a relatively large number of residential houses to combustible
   plant materials.
3. Continuing to maintain appropriate Building and Safety, Fire, and Planning Department/Division requirements
   and standards for new construction and for substantial additions to existing structures to prevent and minimize
   potential urban and wild land fires in the community. Building and Safety and Fire provisions relate to fire-
   resistant building materials and roofing components; building construction; detector and alarm systems; fire
   service equipment; automatic fire sprinklers; one-hour fire walls; clearances around structures; accessibility
   to and into buildings; and the proper storage of flammable and combustible materials. Planning provisions
   pertain to architectural design; site planning; building setback; landscape design; minimum road and driveway
   widths; and property usage and maintenance.
4. Maintaining ongoing fire inspection, Neighborhood Preservation, general Code Enforcement, and business
   monitoring programs that reduce fire and other dangers associated with residential, commercial, industrial,
   and institutional buildings.
5. Continuing with weed abatement programs in Covina Hills, which involve trimming and clearing overgrown
   plant materials from public and private properties, to reduce the amount of combustible vegetation.
6. Maintaining sufficient personnel, equipment, and resources in the Fire and Police Departments to handle fire
   incidents.
7. Continuing with existing citywide fire prevention/education programs to bolster public awareness of the
   disastrous impacts that fires can have on the community.
8. Promoting emergency preparedness activities in the community with respect to potential urban and wild land
   fires by following various measures and by maintaining the multi-hazard Covina Emergency Plan.

V. IDENTIFICATION AND APPRAISAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
A. General
   As described in the Land Use, Circulation, and Housing Elements, the City of Covina is a predominantly
   residential community with an economic base that includes a variety of small- to medium-size and some
   larger light industrial and commercial businesses. This base, while vital to the economic health of the City,
   represents a potential source of problems from improper management of hazardous materials. In other words,
   the ongoing generation, use, storage, and disposal of hazardous materials in Covina present threats to the
   safety of the community by raising the possibility of chemical spills, gas leaks, explosions/structural fires, and
   resource contamination. Hazardous materials are also transported through and near the community along the
   San Bernardino Freeway, on the Metrolink Commuter Rail Line (during freight operations in the late-night
   hours only), and via major arterial streets, thus constituting another area where accidents could occur.
   According to the State General Plan Guidelines, a hazardous material is defined as “an injurious substance,
   including pesticides, herbicides, toxic metals and chemicals, liquefied natural gas, explosives, volatile chemicals,
   and nuclear fuels.” These materials, which may cause serious injury, illness, or death to humans and/or
   destruction to property, can be further classified into four basic categories: toxics, corrosives, reactives, and
   ignitables. Toxics include a broad range of typically industrial chemicals and gasses whose ingestion can
   result in serious illness or death. Through body contact (rather than ingestion), corrosives can cause
   inflammation or destruction of living tissue. When mixed with other substances, reactives can cause damage
   from blast and flash fire. And ignitables pose the threat of combustion at low ignition temperatures and rapid
   burning.
   Of particular concern regarding hazardous materials is the treatment and disposal of hazardous wastes.
   Hazardous wastes include a spectrum of dangerous by-products generated from, for example, the manufacturing
   of common items, including electric components, medical devices, and plastic containers and the operation of
   typical commercial businesses like dry cleaning, film processing, and automotive painting and general repair.
   Enterprises such as these are located throughout Covina. In addition, substances or waste materials from
   household items, such as pesticides, used motor oil, paint, and cleaning solutions, are to varying degrees
   hazardous as well.
   All through the United States, there has been little regulation of the disposal of industrial, commercial, and
   residential wastes until recently. This lack of regulation has resulted in the indiscriminate dumping of hazardous
   wastes in general landfills and along roadsides and in open fields, causing polluted ground and surface water,
   soil, and air. Because of these problems, various Federal and State laws have been passed to provide government
   with greater leverage for regulating the generation, use, storage, and disposal of hazardous materials to protect
   human life and the environment. In terms of the general plan process, cities may address hazardous materials
   in the safety element. The City of Covina believes that it is appropriate to discuss the matter in this Element
   because hazardous materials constitute an identified and real threat to public safety. Leaks or explosions
   could cause considerable upset in the community.
   In addressing this area relating to Covina, the Safety Element includes a discussion of potentially injurious
   substances. The first section below therefore presents an overview of existing hazardous materials in the City
   and concomitant effects and risks. Three different facets of the topic are explored: general hazardous material
   types and the sources thereof; transportation of hazardous wastes; and underground hazards (i.e., storage
   tanks, septic tanks, and natural gas distribution lines). Regarding all three subtopics, it is stated that although
   dangerous materials pose different threats and risks to the community, the City believes that the presence of
   such materials, which is unavoidable in a contemporary developed community, poses only moderate or
   reasonable risks compared to similar cities in the region. The second and final principal section of this chapter
   discusses the Los Angeles County Hazardous Waste Management Plan, of which Covina is required to follow
   applicable portions thereof. Concerning matters presented in the Waste Management Plan and in some situations
   with respect to the underlying hazardous materials discussion, follow-up studies and analyses will be necessary.
                                                      E-23

   As was the case with the three previous hazard-related chapters, the material presented herein serves as a basis
   for the Safety Element goal, policies, and programs. Information and facts mentioned in this chapter are
   based on discussions with City Fire Department personnel and are referenced from various documents and
   correspondence on file in the Covina Planning Division.
B. Overview of Existing Hazardous Materials and Concomitant Effects and Risks Relating to Covina
1. General
   The following section presents key matters pertaining to hazardous materials within a framework relative to
   three areas of discussion: 1) hazardous material types and sources; 2) the transport of hazardous wastes; and
   3) underground hazards. These items constitute the focus of this topic. Basically, hazardous materials and
   substances are a direct result of society’s technology and high standard of living. Many of the products people
   use in everyday living contain substances that are harmful to the environment. The production and use of
   these materials often leave toxic or other potentially injurious matters that require proper disposal to ensure
   that the detrimental effects can be reduced or eliminated altogether. In any society, a balance must inevitably
   be found between economic prosperity and the well-being of the environment.
   Under the first area of discussion, hazardous material types and sources, such materials are defined, typical
   substances are listed, and common local businesses and activities that use, generate, store, and must dispose of
   hazardous substances are mentioned. Other matters presented include hazardous waste disposal, an important
   issue later expanded upon, oversight and regulation of hazardous materials handlers, and household hazardous
   wastes. The second area examines the transport of these substances, which covers both various materials and
   waste products, and potential problems associated therewith. Underground hazards constitute the third and
   final subject. The potential underground hazards consist of storage tanks, septic tanks, and natural gas
   distribution lines. These items pervade the community and therefore warrant discussion as well. For example,
   in several cases, leaking underground storage tanks have caused soil contamination, a major local problem.
   For all three areas of concern presented below, appurtenant risks involved and major emergency preparedness
   practices are also mentioned. Generally, the City believes that, relative to surrounding communities, none of
   the risks are unusual or unreasonable. And regarding emergency preparedness planning, which the City
   performs to be ready for any and all contingencies, it is noted that the matter is further presented in Chapter
   VII below.
2. Hazardous materials and sources
   As indicated above, the City of Covina has several industrial and commercial businesses that use, generate,
   store, and must dispose of hazardous materials. (Refer to previous sections for the definition of these substances.)
   According to the Covina Fire Department, which maintains records on City companies involved with hazardous
   materials, there are 145 hazardous materials handlers within the community. The 145 businesses (list on file
   in Covina Planning Division) consist of a wide variety of company types, such as manufacturing, processing,
   and printing operations, machine shops, contractors’ storage yards, service stations, automobile-related facilities,
   equipment rental sites, pool and pest control services, dry cleaning and film processing enterprises, and some
   hardware and larger food stores. In addition, certain institutional uses possess hazardous substances, including
   hospitals, utility company sites, and public school properties. These 145 activities are located throughout the
   community, frequently abutting residential property, and handle various types of materials, such as gases,
   oils, cleaning solvents, and chemicals, which are toxic, corrosive, reactive, and/or ignitable (refer to previous
   sections for clarification). Problems could also arise during construction or demolition activities. Therefore,
   the subject materials constitute risks for Covina or threaten public safety because accidents or spills have the
   potential to affect large segments of the population. The quantitative aspect of hazardous materials usage in
   the City is unknown, though business-related hazardous substance utilization and waste generation are expected
   to increase at least slightly in the years ahead as a result of ongoing and future population growth, redevelopment,
   commercial revitalization, businesses retention, and economic development efforts. Unfortunately, hazardous
                                                         E-24

materials constitute an unavoidable consequence of the community’s need to maintain a strong economic
base, which is thus dependent upon supporting sufficient daytime as well as nighttime populations. Regarding
the City’s residents, as previously indicated, many common household items, such as paint, cleaning solutions,
and used motor oil, are potentially harmful as well, and these substances will likely be in greater supplies as
the population increases.
As mentioned above, the Covina Fire Department maintains information on City businesses and entities that
use, store, or generate hazardous materials so that in the event of an accident or fire Covina emergency
personnel may either respond appropriately or call upon Los Angeles County officials, who also have these
records, for assistance. Under special agreement, the City contracts with the Los Angeles County Fire
Department, Hazardous Materials Division to address major incidents and to administer various State statutes,
a key one of which requires applicable businesses to submit plans for the handling of hazardous materials.
The initial information on hazardous materials users is typically ascertained by the City Building and Safety
Division in the granting or renewing of business licenses. (For more information on emergency response, see
Chapter VII below. It is noted that if a disaster is epidemic or threatens to spread by contaminated air or water,
the Los Angeles County Public Health Department becomes the primary agency dealing with this aspect of
the emergency.) Many of the above-noted State statutes came from “right-to-know” laws that enable local
governments to identify high-risk industries and commercial operations and work towards protecting public
health and safety. Besides Los Angeles County, other agencies also play key roles in regulating the storage
and use of hazardous materials to further public vitality as well as environmental quality. These agencies are
1) the United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2) the California Department of Health Services, 3)
the California Department of Industrial Relations, and 4) the California Regional Water Quality Control
Board. Regarding environmental quality, unfortunately, according to the County and State agencies, certain
occupied and vacant Covina sites have been contaminated from either leaching above-ground hazardous
materials or leaking below-ground storage tanks. (This matter is discussed separately below.) But under
direction of the above entities, appropriate remediation has been and will continue to take place on these
properties.
A separate though also important issue is waste disposal. Industrial and commercial businesses in Covina
generate a diverse mix of hazardous wastes requiring various treatment technologies. Historically, hazardous
waste disposal and removal have been regional concerns managed by Los Angeles County. Because of this
situation as well as land use concerns and economic factors, no hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal
plants were ever developed in Covina. (The generation of hazardous wastes by the above-mentioned
establishments is ancillary to their primary operations.) Therefore, all of the City’s waste materials have been
transported to and treated in distant facilities. However, recent changes in State law, as promulgated through
the Los Angeles County Hazardous Waste Management Plan, call for cities to play a more active role in this
area. Specifically, cities must identify suitable sites and appropriate siting criteria for allowing waste processing
and disposal facilities, which have major land use and other implications. The Plan is discussed below.
Covina has and will continue to maintain a cooperative and reasonable stance in regional hazardous waste
disposal efforts.
The City will further cooperate with the appropriate agencies in preventing another problem associated with
waste disposal of all types and related matters, the inadvertent or deliberate discharge of non-storm water or
possibly environmentally harmful substances into the storm drainage system. Although the extent of this
problem in Covina is unknown, under the Federal NPDES (or, National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System) program, which aims to protect the water quality of receiving water sources (in this case, the Pacific
Ocean) by effectively prohibiting non-storm water discharges into the public drainage network, Covina has
been working with Los Angeles County to implement a storm water/urban runoff management program. This
program, of which Los Angeles County is the lead agency, regulates discharges from all land use types,
including industrial, commercial, institutional, and residential. The non-storm water discharges that the program
addresses actually pertain to typical or above-described waste materials as well as various matters that have
historically also contributed to storm water pollution (again, by getting washed into storm drains during rain),
                                                    E-25

   particularly from a cumulative standpoint. These other matters include grading and construction activities,
   some outside commercial and industrial operations, excessive erosion, sediment build-up, and insufficient
   impermeable surfaces or excessive water runoff. Therefore, it is necessary for the policies and programs of
   the Safety Element to deal with the latter through equally important NPDES issues as well. NPDES is described
   in greater detail in the Background Study of the Land Use Element.
   The ongoing use, storage, and generation of various hazardous materials in Covina present threats to the
   community in terms of potential chemical spills, gas leaks, structural fires, and resource contamination.
   Although these risks are real and identifiable, they are not believed to be “unreasonable” or excessive. The
   above-noted businesses and places in which hazardous incidents could occur are found in most communities
   and, as previously indicated, are essential for the City’s economy and vitality. It must be reiterated that the
   generation of hazardous wastes by those City properties is ancillary to their primary operations. In addition,
   Covina possesses sufficient emergency service resources to adequately monitor and regulate the identified
   facilities and to respond to accidents. And the City is able to reduce the risks of injury and property loss in an
   undesirable event through emergency preparedness planning (see below) as well as sound land use planning
   and the implementation of appropriate development standards. Concerning potential dangers posed by
   household hazardous wastes, although there is little the City can do in this area, it is possible that Federal
   regulations and market considerations may lead to the replacement of many such products by innocuous
   materials. In addition, the County runs quarterly household hazardous waste roundups for residents of all
   incorporated and unincorporated communities. These roundups accept many types of household hazardous
   items and are believed to alleviate the problem somewhat.
3. Transportation of hazardous wastes
   As indicated above, Covina is also susceptible to hazardous materials accidents or spills from the transport of
   hazardous substances through and near the community along the San Bernardino Freeway, on the Metrolink
   Commuter Rail Line (during freight operations in the late-night hours only), and via major arterial streets.
   Under this topic, hazardous materials movement includes both the transport of general products to particular
   business types (such as gasoline going to service stations) and the hauling off of waste materials (like cleaning
   solvent residue from certain manufacturing operations). Thus, for any particular hazardous matter passing
   through Covina, the City or any other community could be the origin or destination of the material.
   Typically of greatest concern to local governments—because of the increased risks involved—are the transport
   of large quantities of hazardous materials and wastes. On major roads and freeways, such passage occurs in
   the form of large, heavy trucks. For the rails, train cars of varying size and type are typically involved. The
   City of Covina maintains some regulatory control over the bigger trucks within the town through local
   ordinances, particularly one on truck routes, which was also a topic in the Circulation Element. Like many
   communities, Covina has designated certain generally larger streets as truck routes to facilitate truck access,
   to bolster communitywide safety, and to protect, to the greatest extent possible, persons in sensitive uses (such
   as residential, nursing homes, and schools) from truck noise, vibrations, and other disturbances. (Refer to
   Circulation Element for clarification.) However, the primary preempting regulations come from the United
   States Department of Transportation, which also oversees all rail hazardous substances movement, the California
   Department of Health Services, and the California Highway Patrol. In addition, these three entities control
   the transport of dangerous materials on the San Bernardino and all other Freeways. It is noted that although
   a wide variety of hazardous materials could be shipped through Covina, under Federal and State regulations,
   certain particularly dangerous matters, including explosives, cargo tanks of fuming nitric acid, anhydrous
   hydrazine, and liquid nitrogen tetroxide, may only be moved via the Freeways. And future changes in City
   street routes could occur depending on the extent of City adherence to the below-described Los Angeles
   County Hazardous Waste Management Plan. Apparent in this discussion is the fact that Covina has absolutely
   no authority over hazardous materials being transported on roads abutting or near the City.
                                                     E-26

   To best prepare for possible transport-related accidents or spills in the City, as is the case with potential on-site
   incidents, the Covina Fire Department engages in emergency preparedness planning and contracts with the
   Hazardous Materials Division of the Los Angeles County Fire entity to address and resolve emergency situations.
   The County has sufficient resources to handle most scenarios, though, if necessary, other agencies can be
   summoned to mitigate a problem. Because of strong, consistent enforcement of all applicable laws by various
   levels of government, the City of Covina has had essentially no serious movement-related hazardous materials
   accidents in recent years. All in all, City staff do not believe that this potential problem constitutes an
   unreasonable hazard or risk for the community.
4. Underground hazards
   Potential hazards from various underground sources is a related topic that warrants consideration in the General
   Plan process. These sources consist of the following:
   a.        Storage tanks
   b.        Septic tanks
   c.        Natural gas distribution lines
   It is noted that the City of Covina does not have any active or closed waste landfills or hazardous materials
   dumps. Although the adjacent communities of West Covina and Azusa have landfill sites, the facilities appear
   to be far enough away from Covina’s boundaries to cause underground problems in the community. City of
   Covina staff regard none of the following items as constituting an unusual risk to the community. But should
   a hazard occur, it is believed that the City’s execution of emergency preparedness activities, emergency resources,
   and inter-agency agreements would handle the situation sufficiently. Many of these issues are regulated by
   agencies of the State and Federal governments.
a. Storage tanks
   It is common for certain industrial, commercial, and other uses to store toxic materials, including manufacturing-
   related wastes and gasoline, in underground storage containers. In general, the overfilling of storage tanks or
   aging, leaking containers and/or pipes can result in soil contamination. Covina has numerous underground
   tanks on the sites of the above-mentioned 145 hazardous materials handlers. Unfortunately, according to the
   State Water Resources Control Board, which is the primary agency that monitors subsurface pollution, in
   recent years about 49 of the sites have been identified as contaminated. Thirty-seven cases pertained to
   leaking underground storage tanks, though approximately 12 situations involved the leaching through the soil
   of various substances contained above the surface. It is noted that three of the contaminated properties have
   been vacated (e.g., closed service stations).
   Based on data and information received by the City on this matter, underground tank leakage appears to have
   posed the greatest environmental hazards for the community. Gasoline and diesel are the primary contaminates,
   though waste oil and hydrocarbons have been identified as well. The Los Angeles County Department of
   Public Works, Waste Management Division conducts an underground tank program that monitors tank safety.
   Where leakage has occurred, the program calls for remediation plans to decontaminate effected soil. Tanks
   are typically removed or, if appropriate, filled in place. Of the 37 previously-mentioned identified sites with
   leaking underground containers, the County has currently resolved 20 of the cases and is in different stages of
   remediation on the remaining 17. Other County and State agencies are involved in below-surface pollution
   abatement efforts as well. In addition, the City of Covina often serves as the impetus for addressing and
   resolving such environmental problems in the site plan and environmental impact review and building permit
   issuance processes.
   Hazardous materials seepage from various underground tanks (i.e., not necessarily those noted above) has
   also manifested itself in generalized ground water contamination. As discussed in the Natural Resources and
                                                        E-27

   Open Space Element, Covina as well as other communities in the San Gabriel Valley have been plagued by
   ground water pollution problems, which have resulted in shutting down or appropriately treating the water in
   many wells. Much of this contamination, however, occurred in prior decades as a result of insufficient regulation
   of hazardous materials storage or, relating specifically to Covina, may have moved from surrounding
   communities. Since the 1970s, State and Federal officials have been working with cities in the area to remedy
   the problem to the greatest extent possible. Covina has very little leverage for addressing this aspect of the
   contamination issue, though the City will continue to cooperate with the applicable government agencies here
   and, concerning site-specific pollution, regarding monitoring and remediation activities.
b. Septic tanks
   Although the overwhelming majority of properties in Covina are connected to a network of public sewers
   (refer to Circulation Element for clarification), there are a few remaining places served by on-site, underground
   septic tanks. These places consist primarily of 1950s-era and older houses in various portions of the community.
   In addition, the City possesses an unknown number of dormant or sealed-off septic tanks and possibly
   cesspools—also situated throughout Covina. The rupture of these tanks or disturbance of their leachfields
   could result in ground water or soil contamination. In recent years, the City has required soil testing to detect
   the presence of underground septic tanks in most new development. If a septic tank is found, it must be
   removed, filled, or circumvented by revision of the site plan.
c. Natural gas distribution lines
   The Southern California Gas Company, which provides natural gas service to Covina and all of the greater
   Los Angeles area, has several major, high-pressure natural gas distribution lines that, in Covina, underlie
   generally a few bigger streets. Although these pipelines are believed to be well-constructed and maintained,
   construction or excavation in the vicinity of a particular pipe creates a potential hazard if the line is ruptured.
   Hazards include explosion, fire, spillage, and earth and ground water contamination. The Southern California
   Gas Company and the United States Department of Transportation, Office of Pipeline Safety are the primary
   agencies responsible for inspection and maintenance of pipelines running through the City. Although Covina
   does not have regulatory mandate over the pipes, the City is able to prevent hazards through reviewing plans
   and information related to various permit issuance processes, notably for public right-of-way work. Moreover,
   recently enacted State legislation requires persons who plan to do any digging or excavating on public or
   private property to inform a regional notification center (called DigAlert) at least 2 working days in advance.
   The notification center, in turn, informs all entities who have underground lines in the area or who may have
   an interest in the project and thus serves as a key mechanism for alerting the City and others about digging as
   well as avoiding accidents. Because of existing development patterns and the built-out situation of the City,
   the role of future land use planning in dealing with this issue appears to be minimal. Lastly, it is noted that
   Covina does not have any major underground petroleum pipelines, which would constitute another hazard.
C. Discussion of Los Angeles County Hazardous Waste Management Plan
1. Background
   Under the Los Angeles County Hazardous Waste Management Plan (HWMP), local governments have greater
   authority and responsibility for handling hazardous waste treatment and disposal. The Plan was prepared in
   response to various Federal and State laws mandating better government oversight and management in this
   area and restricting direct land disposal of untreated hazardous wastes in distant, out-of-County facilities
   (what had been the County’s primary disposal method). Regarding the former factor, the HWMP addresses
   on a countywide level waste disposal problems that have been exacerbated over the last several years because
   of the increased use of hazardous materials in industrial, commercial, and institutional activities as well as in
   the home. Basically, more wastes have been generated, though fewer remote sites have become available for
   waste treatment and disposal. Another problem has been the persistent illegal dumping of hazardous waste
                                                       E-28

materials along roadsides and in other areas, resulting in explosions, fires, contaminated ground water, and air
pollution. (For definitions and examples of “hazardous wastes,” refer to the above sections. In general,
hazardous waste is defined as any waste or combination of wastes that, because of its quantity, concentration,
or physical, chemical or infectious characteristics may exhibit toxicity, corrosivity, flammability, and/or
reactivity). Thus, the Plan, which has been formally adopted by the County and the City of Covina, aims 1) to
encourage and facilitate the establishment of needed hazardous waste programs and facilities in cities and in
unincorporated communities by the private sector to minimize untreated hazardous wastes leaving the County
and 2) to ensure that all future hazardous waste disposal will be accommodated in environmentally safe,
effective, and economical facilities and managed and handled in a cooperative, balanced, and multi-faceted
fashion among government, the private sector, and the public. Although waste minimization, the most
environmentally sound and economically feasible means of addressing the growing hazardous waste problem,
is actually the primary goal of the Plan, for reasons previously indicated, the HWMP states that additional off-
site hazardous waste management facilities within the County must be developed. According to the Plan
“hazardous waste management facilities” are complexes of various sizes and features that perform a particular
primary function upon receiving hazardous wastes, including transferring and storing, treating, recycling,
solidifying and stabilizing, and incinerating. And “off-site” means that the facility serves more than one
producer of hazardous wastes. Therefore, for purposes of complying with the HWMP, places with facilities
that are on-site or serve only one producer are not considered to be a “hazardous waste management facility.”
Inasmuch as the establishment of a complex that handles hazardous materials fulfills and is part of a countywide
process, each facility of a particular community could receive wastes from throughout the County. For additional
information on the foregoing, refer to the Plan documents or to the Background Study of the General Plan
Land Use Element.
The Plan itself is a four-volume document that describes and defines existing conditions, projects future waste
streams and needed off-site hazardous waste management facilities, sets countywide objectives, policies, plan
recommendations, and programs, describes criteria to be followed in siting new waste facilities, a key area
that is expanded upon below, and lists the general procedures for establishing additional facilities. Various
other topics, including public participation, emergency response, and recommended legislation (to implement
and fund certain programs) are also presented.
According to the appurtenant State statutes, each city within Los Angeles County must take one of the following
actions in Hazardous Waste Management Plan implementation:
1)        Incorporate, by reference, applicable portions of the final HWMP into the city’s general plan,
2)        Adopt a city hazardous waste plan that is consistent with the HWMP and contains all the elements
          required by Section 25135.1(d) of the State Health and Safety Code, or
3)        Enact an ordinance that requires all applicable zoning, subdivision, conditional use permit, and variance
          decisions to be consistent with the portions of the final HWMP that identify the general areas and
          siting criteria for off-site hazardous waste management facilities.
In the past, the City of Covina, following formal adoption of the Plan, has opted to pursue the first alternative,
which calls for incorporating portions of the document into this General Plan Safety Element. The most
important section of the HWMP that will be included in the Safety Element pertains to the siting criteria to be
used to evaluate the suitability and compatibility of off-site hazardous waste management facilities with
surrounding land uses and the immediate environment. Siting criteria is a significant, complex issue in the
HWMP process that carries many potential land use, compatibility, accessibility, safety, and environmental
quality impacts and implications and, therefore, inevitably raises concerns within the local population. However,
the State legislation on which the Plan is based indicates that cities must follow the law and cannot prohibit the
siting of hazardous waste facilities in their jurisdictions. The referenced standards that the City will utilize in
this area are presented in the following section. But first, it is appropriate to discuss salient, background
information on hazardous waste facility siting criteria.
                                                   E-29

There are actually two facets to the above-discussed standards of evaluation by which off-site hazardous
waste facilities are to be located: 1) the general geographic areas (e.g., zoning districts) that are particularly
suitable for hazardous waste facilities and 2) the waste facility siting criteria that must be followed in considering
facility proposals. Regarding the first facet, the Plan recommends that previously-mentioned storage, treatment,
recycling, solidifying/stabilizing, and incinerating facilities be located in industrial or manufacturing areas,
where hazardous wastes are typically generated. The Plan contains a County map designating the general
geographic areas within cities and unincorporated areas that could be potentially suitable for new hazardous
waste management facilities. According to the HWMP, these possible waste complex locations are based on
a study of municipal and unincorporated land use patterns, general plan and zoning designations, demographic
and environmental factors, and other data. Generally, as indicted above, the specified areas pertain to industrial/
manufacturing districts, where a great deal of the hazardous wastes are generated. In Covina, for example,
various stretches along the railroad track, which are all designated for light manufacturing uses, have been so
denoted. (In addition, the County has highlighted a large area just westerly of the City in Irwindale.) The Plan
emphasizes, however, that the County map is only for illustrative purposes; it does not identify any specific
properties. Cities and the County may, but are not required to, use the map in considering general geographic
areas.
Concerning the second aspect of the HWMP process, the Plan includes various criteria that are intended to
assist local communities in making informed decisions on any proposed hazardous waste management facility.
The criteria have been developed around the following eight objectives:
a.         Protect the residents;
b.         Ensure the structural stability and safety of the facility;
c.         Protect surface water;
d.         Protect ground water;
e.         Protect air quality;
f.         Protect environmentally sensitive areas;
g.         Ensure safe transportation of hazardous waste; and
h.         Protect the social and economic development goals of the community.
Cities must utilize this criteria, which, again, relates to the previously-mentioned geographic designations or
guidelines, in approaching the matter. However, to best protect public health, safety, and welfare, the Plan
expressly permits cities to adopt more stringent siting criteria and land use policies for hazardous waste
facilities than those approved by the County as long as the criteria and policies are consistent with the HWMP.
In addressing local concerns, communities may also attach reasonable conditions to the issuance of any such
facility.
As indicated above, the siting of a hazardous waste management facility raises many questions pertaining to
potential land use, compatibility, accessibility, safety, and environmental quality impacts and implications.
All of such impacts and implications will in large part be determined according to where the facilities will be
permitted (particularly in relation to non-industrial uses) and the standards by which they are to be evaluated,
the focus of the section below. In other words, problems or hazards could occur, and legitimate local concerns
are inevitably raised. Therefore, appropriate analysis of all issues involved and sufficient public participation
are essential components of this process to further community health, safety, welfare, and integrity. Regarding
the latter matter, according to the HWMP, public involvement is intended to be a key step in all levels of
hazardous waste management planning, including development of the Plan itself. This means that the public
will continue to be provided with opportunities to review and comment on any future proposals for waste
facilities in Covina. As was the case with other aspects of hazardous wastes stated previously in this chapter,
various Federal and State agencies are involved in HWMP activities as well, particularly the California
Department of Health Services. But the primary responsibility for implementation rests with the County.
                                                    E-30
2. City of Covina adherence to key applicable provisions
   The Los Angeles County Hazardous Waste Management Plan (HWMP) is a tool for addressing countywide
   waste treatment and disposal matters. One of the primary purposes of the Plan is to encourage and facilitate
   the establishment of needed, previously defined off-site hazardous waste facilities in cities and in unincorporated
   communities by the private sector to minimize untreated hazardous wastes leaving the County. Under HWMP
   provisions, the City of Covina, which has formally adopted the Plan, is required to incorporate, by reference,
   applicable portions of the document into this General Plan Safety Element. The most important section of the
   Plan describes the siting criteria to be used to evaluate the suitability and compatibility of hazardous waste
   management facilities with surrounding land uses and the environment. As mentioned in the prior section,
   siting criteria is a significant, complex issue in the HWMP process that carries many potential land use,
   compatibility, accessibility, safety, and environmental quality impacts and implications. Therefore, appropriate
   analysis of all matters involved, considering all relevant factors, and sufficient public participation, are essential
   to protect community health, safety, welfare, and integrity.
   Siting criteria, as also mentioned in the prior section, refers to 1) the general geographic areas (e.g., zoning
   districts) that are particularly suitable for hazardous waste management facilities and to 2) the standards and
   guidelines that must be followed in considering facility proposals. Regarding the first aspect of this topic,
   using the HWMP as a guide, the City believes that any waste management facility location must meet all
   provisions of Table 3 below:
             TABLE 3.            GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS FOR PERMITTING HAZARDOUS WASTE
                                 MANAGEMENT FACILITIES
   SUBJECT                                          PROVISION
   1.   Zoning                                      M-1 (Light Manufacturing)
   2.   Minimum Property Size                       One Acre
   3.   Relation to Surrounding                     Cannot Abut or be Adjacent to Any Residential
        Uses and Activities                         District or Use/Facility with an Immobile
                                                    Population*
   *An immobile population includes, but is not limited to, the following uses: all public and private schools
   (excluding trade schools), child day care centers, hospitals, and nursing homes.
   Furthermore, concerning the accompanying standards and guidelines to be followed in reviewing hazardous
   waste facility requests, Covina shall utilize the criteria outlined in the County Plan. A general description of
   these siting objectives, factors, and criteria is illustrated in the following table:
             TABLE 4.            HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT FACILITY SITING FACTORS

                                                          require independent study; and
                                                     °    Potential changes in employment require
                                                          independent study.
   *An immobile population includes, but is not limited to, the following uses: all public and private schools
   (excluding trade schools), child day care centers, hospitals, and nursing homes.
   +Abbreviations:       PSD - Prevention of Significant Deterioration
                         AADT - Average Annual Daily Traffic
   Any facility proposed for the City will need to conform to all of the above land use guidelines and siting
   provisions. The City believes that the guidelines and provisions are reasonable, address the community’s
   physical characteristics, and are consistent with the HWMP. Regarding the land use policies, many of Covina’s
   industrial properties are relatively small (under 30,000 square feet) and/or located within close proximity to
   residences, thus precluding the placement of hazardous waste management facilities. (Refer again to Table
   3.) It is noted that no sites suitable for a disposal facility (i.e., landfill) were identified. In addition, to ensure
   protection of community health, safety, welfare, and integrity, in reviewing any waste facility proposal, the
   City will supplement the siting criteria with appropriate project-specific conditions. Such conditions would
   pertain to various engineering, site design, aesthetic, and operational matters to bolster suitability and
   compatibility with surrounding activities, viable accessibility thereto, and harmony with the environment.
   Furthermore, because the siting provisions of the County do not provide for any buffer or minimum distance
   requirement between a hazardous waste treatment facility and any residential district or immobile population,
   in accordance with preempting State law, the City will also require that a comprehensive health and safety risk
   assessment be performed by an applicant proposing to site any facility within 2,000 feet of property zoned for
   residential use or any public or private school, child day care center, hospital, nursing home, and similar use.
   This assessment, using guidelines developed by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency for superfund
   sites, would have to demonstrate that the facility will not present any unusual health or safety risks to the
   surrounding residential area or to a special, sensitive use. Thus, while the above siting criteria provides a
   sufficient foundation for hazardous waste facility analysis and evaluation, technically the criteria functions as
   the overall framework upon which additional standards and provisions are to be utilized to protect the
   community.
   Lastly, in accordance with the County Hazardous Waste Management Plan process, the City of Covina agrees
   to follow all other applicable sections of the HWMP, notably those dealing with waste management facility
   definitions, public participation, emergency response, and waste minimization. These portions are to be
   followed on an as-needed basis. According to the HWMP, public involvement constitutes a particularly
   important step in hazardous waste management planning in that citizen review and comment were a significant
   factor in the development of the Plan and that the public, including municipal legislators, must continue to be
   given opportunities to provide input on future Plan revisions and all proposals for waste management facilities.
   The City will monitor any changes in the Plan, especially the siting criteria and related matters, ascertain in
   what ways the changes might impact Covina, and respond accordingly.
D. Listing of Key Existing Hazardous Materials Issues
   This area of discussion lists the key Covina hazardous materials issues, which are based on the facts and
   information presented in the previous sections, related, salient material, and community input (see Chapter XI
   for clarification). As stated in the prior chapters, issues are important because they clarify key hazardous
   waste matters warranting attention and because, along with a detailed identification and discussion of hazardous
   wastes themselves (the preceding sections), issues form the basis for the below-listed goal and policies and
                                                       E-33

    programs/implementation measures. Refer to the previous sections for clarification on these issues and for
    underlying data and information. (In addition, see the Land Use Element and Land Use Study for an expanded
    discussion on matters relating to land use.)
    The hazardous waste issues are listed below in no particular order. It should be noted that the issues are not
    necessarily mutually exclusive.
1.  Dealing with the ongoing generation, use, and storage of various hazardous materials in Covina, which raises
    the possibility of chemical spills, gas leaks, explosions, structural fires, and resource contamination.
2.  Dealing with the treatment and disposal of hazardous wastes from commercial, industrial, and institutional
    uses.
3.  Dealing with the disposal of household items considered hazardous.
4.  Dealing with the ongoing transport of large quantities of hazardous materials through and near Covina along
    the San Bernardino Freeway and the Metrolink Commuter Rail Line and via major arterial streets.
5.  Dealing with potential or actual underground hazards from storage tanks, septic tanks, and natural gas
    distribution lines, which, in some cases, have led to soil contamination.
6.  Cooperating with agencies of all levels of government regarding the regulation of the generation, use, and
    storage of hazardous materials.
7.  Continuing to maintain information on City businesses and entities that handle hazardous materials to best
    respond in the event of an accident or to call upon Los Angeles County officials for assistance.
8.  Continuing to contract with the Los Angeles County Fire Department, Hazardous Materials Division to address
    major hazardous materials incidents and to administer various statutes.
9.  Continuing to maintain City Building and Safety Division and Fire Department inspections and efforts to
    identify hazardous materials use and storage in various businesses and activities.
10. Maintaining sufficient personnel, equipment, and resources in the Building and Safety and Fire Departments
    to provide general regulation of hazardous materials handlers and to respond to certain hazardous materials
    accidents.
11. Attempting to control the transport of large quantities of hazardous materials through enforcing local truck
    routes and various applicable Federal and State regulations.
12. Continuing to cooperate with the appropriate State and County departments on the identification, monitoring,
    and remediation of subsurface pollution, particularly from underground storage or septic tank leakage, through
    appropriate actions.
13. Ensuring that major, high-pressure natural gas distribution lines that underlie Covina streets are inspected and
    maintained by the appropriate agencies as well as protected during digging or excavating activities.
14. Cooperating with all levels of government, particularly Los Angeles County, in incorporating into the General
    Plan applicable portions of the Los Angeles County Hazardous Waste Management Plan, which concerns the
    treatment and disposal of hazardous materials at the municipal level.
15. Encouraging overall waste minimization as an important activity in the hazardous waste management process.
                                                       E-34
16. Cooperating with appropriate agencies in preventing waste disposal as well as all non-storm water discharges
    into the storm drainage system.
17. Regarding the Los Angeles County Hazardous Waste Management Plan, identifying suitable locations and
    appropriate siting criteria for and applying reasonable conditions to potential waste treatment facilities and
    handling all land use, compatibility, accessibility, safety, and environmental quality impacts and implications
    associated therewith.
18. Analyzing all issues involved with and having sufficient public participation pertaining to the potential siting
    of a hazardous waste management facility to further community health, safety, welfare, and integrity.
19. Appropriately regulating industrial and other activities that use, produce, and/or store hazardous materials
    from a general land use standpoint.
20. Implementing a storm water/urban runoff management program.
21. Promoting emergency preparedness activities in the community with respect to potential hazardous materials
    incidents by following various measures and by maintaining the multi-hazard Covina Emergency Plan.

VI. ASSESSMENT OF RISKS FOR ALL POTENTIAL HAZARDS
A.  General
    This section of the Safety Element focuses on risk assessment. Chapters II through V above discussed potential
    hazards and concomitant general risks with respect to seismic and geologic conditions, flooding, fires, and
    hazardous materials. The following section expands on the appurtenant risks by presenting various criteria
    that further assess and describe the potential for hazard-related community upset. For clarification on the
    subject hazards, refer to the previous chapters. It is noted that the criteria utilized here is from the State Office
    of Emergency Services (EOS), which oversees and manages matters in this area as well as emergency
    preparedness (see Chapter VII).
B.  Risk Assessment
    As indicated above, this section focuses on risk factors relating to previously-described potential disasters in
    Covina. Table 5 below lists these hazards (in generally the same order in which they are discussed in Chapters
    II through V) and further describes and evaluates the disasters by four different criteria. The criteria are 1)
    potential of occurrence, 2) scope of risk, 3) emergency response, and 4) event duration.
    “Potential of occurrence” means the potential threats to public safety and welfare that the hazard constitutes.
    Hazards have thus been assessed according to the following:
    °Low Risk -        The level of risk below which no specific action is deemed necessary. The occurrence of a
                       specific event is unlikely;
    °Medium Risk - The level of risk above which specific action is required to protect life and property, though
                       the probability of the event taking place is low to moderate; and
    °High Risk -       Risk levels are significant and occurrence of a particular emergency situation is highly
                       probable or inevitable.
    The “scope of risk” refers to the geographic area that could be potentially affected with the occurrence of one
    of the hazards. The scope of risk includes three levels:
    °Site-             The particular geographic area that is directly affected would be site-specific;
    °City -            The affected area would include a significant portion or all of the City; and
    °Regional -        The affected area would include the entire City and the surrounding region.
    Furthermore, the “emergency response” pertains to three levels of emergency response to peacetime
    contingencies, which are based on the severity of the situation and the availability of local resources to respond
    to the emergency. The three levels of emergency response include:
    °Level 1 -         A minor to moderate incident where local resources are adequate to deal with the emergency;
    °Level 2 -         A moderate to severe emergency where local resources are not adequate in dealing with the
                       emergency and mutual assistance would be required on a regional or statewide basis; and
    °Level 3 -         A major disaster where local resources are overwhelmed by the magnitude of the disaster
                       and State and Federal assistance are required.
                                                     E-37

Finally, “event duration” refers to the length of occurrence for a particular hazard. This fourth criteria functions
as another noteworthy hazard assessment descriptor. (The residual effects of an incident are not considered
here, though they may be long-term in nature. An earthquake, for example, may last for only several seconds
but aftershocks could continue for many days, months, or even years. Fault displacement may result in
permanent alterations in topography. And property damage may be so extensive that complete recovery
would take years.) The following three categories are used in classification of event duration:
°Immediate -       The occurrence of a particular incident is instantaneous and measurable in terms of seconds
                   or minutes;
°Short-Term -      The duration of a particular incident is generally measured in terms of hours or days; and
°Long-Term -       The duration of a particular incident extends for a much longer period of time. Specific
                   hazards that are considered continuous or ongoing are included in this category.
                                                   E-38

               E-39
   Those hazards of greatest concern to the people who live and work in Covina, such as seismic, flooding, and
   fire, are evident from examining Table 5, particularly the “potential of occurrence” row. And it is noted that
   seismic and flooding dangers appear to pose the most extensive overall upset to the community. In other
   words, as stated previously in this Element, certain potential disasters are real. However, because their incidence
   in Covina sometimes depends on the occurrence of unusual circumstances, the actual/quantifiable risks of
   these hazards cannot be predicted with certainty. To best prevent and prepare for a disaster, various activities,
   such as emergency preparedness planning and public safety support, must be considered. These and related
   matters are discussed in the following chapter.
C. Listing of Key Existing Risk Assessment Issues
   The following discussion lists the key Covina risk assessment issues, which are based on the facts and
   information presented in the previous section and in prior chapters. Issues are important because they clarify
   key risk assessment matters warranting attention and because, along with a detailed identification and discussion
   of potential hazards and concomitant risks themselves (the preceding section and prior chapters), issues form
   the basis for the below-listed goal and policies and programs/implementation measures. Refer to the previous
   section and prior chapters for clarification on these issues and for underlying data and information.
   The risk assessment issues are listed below in no particular order. It should be noted that the issues are not
   necessarily mutually exclusive.
1. Recognizing ground shaking, ground lurching, flooding around Walnut Creek, dam failure, seiches, urban
   fires, and underground storage tank problems as having the highest potential of occurring.
2. Recognizing ground shaking, flooding around Walnut Creek, and dam failure or seiches as potentially causing
   the most extensive overall upset to the community.
3. Acknowledging that the actual/quantifiable risks associated with potential disasters cannot be predicted with
   certainty because their incidence in Covina sometimes depends on the occurrence of unusual circumstances.
4. Acknowledging the need to prevent and prepare for a disaster by promoting emergency preparedness activities,
   by supporting adequate public safety personnel and resources, and by following related strategies.
                                                      E-40

VII. EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND RELATED AND GENERAL MATTERS
A.   General
     The previous chapters of this Element presented and discussed potential seismic and geologic, flooding, fire,
     and hazardous materials disasters and concomitant effects and risks pertaining to Covina. Throughout these
     discussions, references were made with respect to emergency preparedness planning, methods of both reducing
     the likelihood of hazards from occurring and, should a disaster take place, limiting the negative impacts on the
     community, and key personnel who are involved with these activities and who respond to hazardous incidents.
     The following chapter expands on the foregoing by presenting all applicable and State-required matters relating
     to emergency preparedness. Topics discussed include the City of Covina Emergency Plan, which serves as
     the community’s chief guidebook for emergency preparedness planning and for comprehensively managing
     any type of major contingency, evacuation routes to be followed in an emergency, they generally pertaining to
     the major streets, and emergency response personnel or the primary agencies that initially react to disasters as
     well as everyday public safety-related service requests in Covina, which are the Covina Fire and Police
     Departments. The latter matters presented here are peakload water supply requirements, minimum road
     widths, and clearances around structures. As indicated above, all of these items basically seek to control and
     reduce and, if possible, prevent various potential hazards by providing the City with viable tools, resources,
     procedures, and standards on which to base decisions and conduct actions. This chapter further serves as a
     basis for the Safety Element goal, policies, and programs/implementation measures.
B.   City of Covina Emergency Plan
     The City of Covina takes seriously its responsibility in planning for a major disaster. Informing citizens and
     businesses of potential concerns, taking appropriate steps to minimize damage and injury in a hazardous
     incident, and ensuring effective communication and efficient service when a disaster occurs are all important
     goals of the Covina Emergency Plan. This Plan (last revised in 1994) serves as the community’s chief guidebook
     for emergency preparedness planning and for comprehensively managing any type of major emergency, which
     is defined as “a situation that requires immediate action beyond the scope of normal City operations.” According
     to the Emergency Plan, its purposes are as follows:
     1.        To answer, during emergencies, who is in charge, what should be done, and by whom;
     2.        To provide for the continuity of government during emergencies;
     3.        To facilitate public understanding of Covina emergency organization;
     4.        To provide guidance for disaster education and training; and
     5.        To provide references to additional, more detailed information.
     Covina’s Emergency Plan was developed using a common-sense approach to disaster management, while at
     the same time meeting all applicable legislative mandates and achieving consistency with other local, County,
     and State documents of this nature.
     The Emergency Plan uses simple action checklists for basic functions. These checklists can be expanded or
     contracted based on the size and complexity of the disaster. This organization is based on the Incident Command
     System (ICS), which is routinely used by fire and police departments and provides clear authority, direction,
     and communication during an emergency.
     The disaster response is directed from the City’s Emergency Operating Center (EOC), to where key personnel
     must report. The EOC is designated as the Fire and Police Department complex at 400 to 444 North Citrus
     Avenue, with alternate facilities identified if the primary location is unusable. Although the Emergency Plan
                                                        E-41

   is designed so that any trained person can step in and follow the action checklists, the position of Director of
   Emergency Services oversees the EOC. This position is filled by the City Manager, Fire Chief, Police Chief,
   or City employee with the highest degree of expertise in the type of emergency at hand. In general, however,
   emergency preparedness and disaster management activities in Covina are controlled and coordinated by the
   City Fire Department.
   An emergency changes working relationships in that several departments and/or agencies that would normally
   function independently may work under the direction of one person, the Section Chief. The Covina Plan calls
   for four Sections: Operations, Planning, Logistics, and Finance. In addition, special-purpose units may be
   formed to address concerns outside of the City’s normal sphere of responsibility, such as food distribution,
   emergency shelter, and transportation.
   Because Covina’s resources may be stretched to exhaustion during a disaster, mutual aid agreements are in
   place with other cities, Los Angeles County, and the State of California. And to facilitate inter-agency
   cooperation and coordination in responding to a major emergency, Covina follows the Standardized Emergency
   Management System (SEMS) of the State Office of Emergency Services (EOS), which provides an
   organizational framework and guidance for operations at each level of the State’s emergency management
   system. (EOS, as mentioned in the prior chapter on risk assessment, is the State level agency that coordinates
   emergency preparedness and related matters.) In accordance with SEMS requirements, all City of Covina
   employees have been provided general training in the management system. Also, the employees were briefed
   on the City Emergency Plan. Both of these activities are important because in case of an emergency, any and
   all City personnel are required to provide assistance, when requested by the Director of Emergency Services.
   It is noted that in preparing this Safety Element, in accordance with State law, the City of Covina has received
   supplemental SEMS and, as previously indicated, additional emergency-related information from the State
   EOS.
   The City Emergency Plan further establishes a basis for other organizations and agencies to participate in
   disaster planning efforts, including the American Red Cross, Salvation Army, and National Guard. Concerned
   citizens, businesses, and school district personnel are also involved in a variety of ways as part of Covinans
   Organized for Potential Emergencies (COPE), a new community-based program. One of COPE’s primary
   tasks is to encourage familiarity of the Emergency Plan and appurtenant provisions.
   Thus, the Covina Emergency Plan serves as a viable tool to prepare, mobilize, and employ public and private
   resources to meet essential needs in a serious emergency as well as to restore normal conditions as quickly as
   possible. Recent generally successful City staff simulation training has been occurring, which underscores
   the effectiveness of the process and identifies areas where improvements are needed. It is imperative that the
   Plan remain up-to-date and continue to respond to all safety issues and potential hazards, particularly those
   identified in this Element. Copies of the Emergency Plan are in the possession of all key individuals, agencies,
   and organizations who are involved with its implementation and are on file in the Covina Public Library for
   general reference.
C. Evacuation Routes
   Under State planning law, the City must address evacuation routes in relation to potential hazards. According
   to the Covina Fire Department, which, as indicated above, controls and coordinates local emergency
   preparedness activities, all major public streets serve as the principal evacuation routes. (The previously
   described Covina Emergency Plan does not address this issue.) All such roads are illustrated on the
   accompanying Land Use Map, where they are officially designated as one of the following: 1) San Bernardino
   Freeway, 2) primary arterial street, 3) secondary arterial street, and 4) collector street. These principal
   access ways are all well-maintained and should support an evacuation function. In any disaster warranting
   evacuation, the exact emergency routes used would depend on a number of variables, including the type,
   scope, and location of the incident. (Or, an emergency could render some streets or portions thereof obstructed
   or inaccessible.) It is the responsibility of emergency service and/or appropriate public officials to adequately
   assess the situation so that safe and efficient evacuation routes are selected.
                                                      E-42

D. Emergency Response Personnel
   The two primary agencies that initially react to disasters and emergencies as well as everyday public safety-
   related service requests in Covina are the City Fire and Police Departments. The Covina Fire Department,
   first of all, maintains 43 sworn and 2 support personnel, 12 vehicles, and various equipment out of 3 stations.
   (Station No. 1, the headquarters, is at 400 North Citrus Avenue. This station abuts the Police facility at the
   City’s Public Safety Complex. Fire Stations Nos. 2 and 3 are located at, respectively, 1577 West Cypress
   Street and 807 East Cypress Street.) With approximately 1 firefighter for every 1,000 residents, the minimum
   recommended acceptable level of fire response, according to national standards, the Department reacts to
   fires and other emergencies, such as certain hazardous materials accidents, trapped victim calls (pertaining to,
   for example, vehicle accidents and structure collapse), and downed power lines; provides paramedical services;
   and affords fire prevention assistance. Regarding fire prevention, as indicated in Chapter IV above, the City
   attempts to minimize potential urban and wild land fire hazards through various preventative control measures,
   including enforcement of fire-related codes and ordinances pertaining to automatic sprinklers, fire-resistant
   building materials, safe site design, emergency personnel and vehicle accessibility, and the storage and use of
   hazardous materials; plan checks (generally related to ensuring compliance with Fire’s codes and ordinances);
   inspections for both businesses and residential buildings; brush trimming; and public education/awareness
   programs. And as also indicated in Chapter IV above, the City contracts with Los Angeles County to respond
   to major hazardous materials accidents and to administer various programs in managing and overseeing
   businesses and institutional uses that utilize these materials. The County maintains various facilities throughout
   the San Gabriel Valley with abundant resources in this area. In short, the City places a strong emphasis on fire
   prevention, an activity that is linked to emergency preparedness planning. As indicated previously in this
   section, the City maintains an important Emergency Plan that serves to prepare, mobilize, and employ public
   and private resources to meet essential needs in a disaster, and the Covina Fire Department controls and
   coordinates this related process. The Emergency Plan sets forth the assignments to be carried out by Fire as
   well as other City personnel in a time of major emergency. Again, refer to Section B above for clarification in
   this area.
   Each year, the Fire Department responds to approximately 1,000 fire- and 2,000 medical-related calls. In
   addition to maintaining sufficient resources to handle most incidents, the Department provides adequate response
   times for service. Furthermore, the overall fire/insurance rating is “Class 3,” (out of a possible 10, with 10
   being the lowest). This rating underscores the high level and good quality of fire protection services available.
   But if needed, the City can call on surrounding communities and on Los Angeles County for assistance, in
   accordance with established mutual aid agreements. It is noted that certain fire protection matters that the
   State requires cities to address in the general plan update process, including peak load water supply requirements,
   minimum road widths, and clearances around structures, are discussed in separate sections below.
   The other primary entity that provides everyday safety service as well as the first line of defense in disaster
   situations is the Covina Police Department. With 57 sworn and 30 non-sworn employees, Covina residents
   are protected with a ratio of 1.3 officers for every 1,000 residents, which slightly exceeds the minimum
   commonly accepted ratio (1.0). Police personnel also have generally sufficient, up-to-date equipment and
   resources, including a canine unit. The City operates a full-service police facility, organized around Patrol
   and Detective Divisions, at the northern side of the Public Safety Complex, 444 North Citrus Avenue, adjacent
   to the Fire headquarters. Long-term booking facilities are provided under an agreement with Los Angeles
   County. The Police Department operates the City’s emergency communications networks, including a computer-
   aided dispatch system, which are used jointly by the Police and Fire entities. Police further manages several
   viable crime prevention programs, such as DARE (Drug Abuse Resistance Education), Neighborhood Watch,
   Graffiti Abatement, Home Security Check, and Safety Fairs. The City has had a longstanding commitment to
   local law enforcement on the belief that minimal criminal activity in the community enhances the commerce
   and living environments. A low crime rate helps to keep existing and attract new businesses, gives residents
   a greater sense of security and community pride, and reinforces the City’s goal to maintain public safety. As
   is the case with Fire, the Police Department maintains mutual aid contracts with other jurisdictions and,
   according to Police officials, response times are reasonable. On an annual basis, the Department receives over
   26,000 calls for service.
                                                         E-43

   In addition to its normal law enforcement assignment, in major emergencies, Covina’s Police force works
   with the Fire Department in a variety of capacities, including evacuation supervision (mentioned in previous
   section) and the particular assignments listed in the already discussed Emergency Plan. (Because Azusa
   Avenue is a State Highway, the California Highway Patrol could also be involved in evacuation as well as
   other activities.) As stated in the Emergency Plan, although Police and Fire would be the primary responding
   departments in a disaster, if called upon, other City personnel and non-City agencies would provide supporting
   roles in stabilizing the situation.
   The City of Covina believes that its Fire and Police Departments presently provide local residents, workers,
   and others with sufficient, quality fire protection and law enforcement with respect to everyday calls and
   potential major emergencies to best protect public health, safety, and welfare. In other words, reliable protection
   from fire and crime risks allows the community to exist in a relatively safe and secure environment. Monitoring
   and evaluating operations are constantly occurring to ensure continued adequacy and to identify where any
   enhancements can be made, particularly with respect to emergency preparedness/management. Concerning
   physical development in general, in the future, the City is expected to provide fire and police services
   commensurate to projected moderate growth and redevelopment and revitalization. (Refer to Land Use and
   Housing Elements for details.) Although fire and police protection needs typically must consider building
   proposals and land use modifications on a project-by-project basis to ensure adequacy regarding access,
   clearance, response times, defensible space considerations, and other factors, the impacts of new construction
   and activities on existing services/resources can be mitigated through adequate inter-departmental project
   reviews and cooperation in the plan submittal and General Plan revision activities. The City has long followed
   this integrated, cooperative approach. Applicable design factors, such as access and defensible space, are
   discussed below.
E. Peakload Water Supply Requirements
   To enable sufficient firefighting capabilities, the Covina Fire Department requires a minimum pressure flow
   of water. The required fire flows vary generally between 1,000 to 6,000 gallons for each minute, depending
   on the type of construction and building use, maximum occupancy, and whether any built-in protection systems
   (e.g., sprinklers) are present. According to the Fire Department, currently there are no water flow pressure
   problems in Covina. Furthermore, the water itself is available for firefighting citywide via ample, strategically
   placed hydrants. Fire officials will continue to monitor fire flows to ensure future adequacy.
F. Minimum Road Widths
   In order for fires and other incidents to be contained and eradicated within reasonable time periods, they must
   first be quickly and safely accessed by emergency vehicles of responding personnel. Therefore, minimum
   road width standards constitute another secondary factor that is essential for lessening various hazards, notably
   fire. As presented in the Circulation Element, the City follows various public street design standards, including
   minimum right-of-way and curb-to-curb widths and radii for cul-de-sacs and knuckles. Generally, the minimum
   curb-to-curb width on the major/arterial and collector streets varies from 56 to 84 feet. On the smaller or local
   roads, the minimum curb-to-curb widths are typically between 36 and 38 feet. Emergency accessibility, in
   addition to general vehicular circulation, was considered in developing these criteria.
   The City Fire, Planning, and Engineering entities implement the public street criteria in a coordinated fashion
   in the Site Plan Review and Building Permit Issuance processes. (These processes also ensure that other,
   previously-mentioned hazard reduction design requirements, such as fire-resistant building and roofing materials
   and automatic sprinkler systems, are met.) According to the Fire Department, whose larger emergency vehicles
   constitute the focus for evaluating suitable accessibility, all existing roadway standards are adequate. Design
   provisions for private (usually smaller) roads are the same as for public streets. The minimum width standards
   pertaining to public or private driveways and parking aisles are based on applicable sections of the Covina
   Zoning Ordinance. In major projects, such as multiple-family complexes and commercial facilities, these
   provisions typically range from 20 to 25 feet, with an unobstructed vertical clearance of 14 feet. The Fire
                                                     E-44

   Department further applies various other standards on matters including “clear zones” in front of buildings
   and site access points, in accordance with the Uniform Fire Code. Verification of the adequacy of the above
   guidelines on private properties is also done in an inter-departmental fashion on a case-by-case basis in the
   Site Plan Review and Building Permit Issuance processes. It is noted that the Fire Department, which enforces
   these private as well as the public codes with respect to identified problems on existing access ways, has stated
   that standards for the private developments are sufficient. Nevertheless, the City will monitor all of the above
   accessibility standards to ensure they continue to fulfill their primary emergency response and other functions.
G. Clearances Around Structures
   The subject of “clearances around structures” is related to the previous section on minimum road widths and,
   in accordance with State planning law, must also be addressed here. As was the case with above-described
   roads, maintaining appropriate standards for clearances around structures is essential to allow for building
   access during fires, geologic hazards, or other emergencies. In Covina, these many and varied standards
   come under the Zoning Ordinance and Uniform Building Code, which are primarily implemented and enforced
   by, respectively, the Community Development Department’s Planning and Zoning and Building and Safety
   Divisions. However, for all development proposals, each and every City Department/Division, notably Fire
   and Police, are jointly involved in the preliminary stages of the Site Plan Review and Building Permit Issuance
   processes to ensure, among other things, emergency accessibility by foot, fire containment, general safety,
   and vitality. Typical clearance provisions pertain to building setbacks (relating to property lines and slopes),
   fence/block wall height limitations, and minimum required distances between structures and block walls or
   fences. For example, both previously-noted codes call for a minimum 3-foot emergency access on any side of
   a detached house. Relating primarily to law enforcement, Planning guidelines also call for defensible space
   considerations in developments, which promote personal security through the use of such features as cross
   visibility and ample lighting. Covina emergency personnel believe that current standards in this area are
   adequate, though ongoing evaluation of “clearance” provisions is occurring to ensure continuing viability.
H. Listing of Key Existing Emergency Preparedness and Related Issues
   This area of discussion lists the key Covina emergency preparedness and related issues, which are based on
   the facts and information presented in the previous sections, related, salient material, and community input
   (see Chapter XI for clarification). As stated in the prior chapters, issues are important because they clarify key
   emergency preparedness and related matters warranting attention and because, along with a detailed
   identification and discussion of emergency preparedness and related topics themselves (the preceding section),
   issues form the basis for the below-listed goal and policies and programs/implementation measures. Refer to
   the previous sections for clarification on these issues and for underlying data and information. (In addition,
   see the Land Use Element and Land Use Study for an expanded discussion on matters relating to land use.)
   The emergency preparedness and related issues are listed below in no particular order. It should be noted that
   the issues are not necessarily mutually exclusive.
1. Recognizing the City’s responsibility to plan for a major disaster.
2. Maintaining and periodically revising the Covina Emergency (preparedness) Plan as a viable tool to prepare,
   mobilize, and employ public and private resources to meet essential needs in a serious natural or man-made
   emergency as well as to restore normal conditions as quickly as possible.
3. Utilizing appropriate inter-agency processes and mutual aid agreements in emergency preparedness planning
   and during an actual disaster to most effectively deal with other entities and to address community needs.
                                                      E-45

4.  Supporting community programs that train volunteers to assist City staff in emergency preparedness planning.
5.  Promoting public awareness concerning emergency preparedness matters.
6.  Establishing the mitigation of earthquake hazards as a high priority for City emergency preparedness and
    post-disaster programs/strategies.
7.  Maintaining the San Bernardino Freeway and the major roads or Circulation Element-defined primary and
    secondary arterial and collector streets as Covina’s evacuation routes in relation to major emergencies.
8.  Continuing to supply the Covina Fire and Police Departments with adequate personnel, equipment, resources,
    and facilities to perform their many duties, including responding to disasters, emergencies, and everyday
    public safety-related service requests and participating in emergency preparedness planning.
9.  Ensuring adequate fire, paramedical, and police response times in the community.
10. Continuing with various fire and crime prevention programs.
11. Monitoring operations and procedures relating to fire protection and paramedical services and law enforcement
    to identify where improvements can be made.
12. Ensuring that future firefighting, paramedical, and police protective resources and services keep pace with
    projected moderate growth and redevelopment activities.
13. Ensuring that new, expanded, or altered potentially problematic developments mitigate any public safety-
    related impacts.
14. Maintaining fire-, paramedical-, and police-related mutual aid agreements with surrounding communities for
    supplemental emergency service assistance, when needed.
15. Maintaining adequate water pressure flow capacity in Covina and sufficient fire hydrants to allow for proper
    firefighting capabilities.
16. Maintaining adequate public and private road provisions and site design standards to ensure that hazardous
    incidents and emergencies can be quickly accessed by emergency vehicles.
17. Maintaining a coordinated, inter-departmental approach in reviewing public and private projects and proposals
    to facilitate implementation of all City public safety-related codes and standards.
18. Ensuring that the Covina Fire Department continues to enforce codes and standards regarding the obstruction
    of approaches needed for emergency vehicle accessibility.
                                                     E-46

VIII. GOAL AND POLICIES
A.    General
      As stated in the Introduction above, the goal and policies of this General Plan chapter are important because,
      along with the below-presented implementation measures, they serve as the chief tools concerning local
      decisions and actions on potential natural and man-made hazards affecting Covina and in evaluating public
      projects and private developments and proposals from the standpoint of preventing adverse impacts in the
      City. The goal and policies, again as previously indicated, are based on the community’s key safety-related
      conditions and issues (described in Chapters II through VII above), which were both identified by City staff
      and ascertained through public comment. In theory, then, the goal and policies presented here (and
      accompanying implementation measures) bridge the gap between where the community is and what type of
      city it wishes to become. As was the case with the discussion of conditions and issues, the safety goal and
      policies are presented below in separate sections, a format that the City believes is most appropriate.
      A goal is defined as a general expression of an ideal future condition or state toward which the community
      wishes to advance. A policy, on the other hand, is a statement that most directly guides decision-making and
      actions. In order for policies to be meaningful and useful, they must be clear and unambiguous, a guideline
      that this Element has followed. Policies should also indicate clear local government commitment. Therefore,
      all below policies are listed within the context of “The City shall . . .” and are worded in plain English.
B.    Goal and Policies
      In applying the two terms to the Safety Element, one goal and several policies are utilized. All policies are
      listed within a framework relative to five topical areas, which are based on different potential hazards and
      emergency preparedness matters. The City believes that this organization is most logical and best suited for
      protecting public health and safety. The goal is:
               A community in which the loss of lives, serious injuries, major damages to public and private structures/
               properties, the loss of natural resources, economic and social dislocation, and the disruption of vital
               services associated with a potential natural or man-made disaster are prevented.
      The remainder of this chapter is devoted to the policies. For each topical area, policies are listed in no
      particular order. The five topical areas are:
      1.        Potential seismic and geologic hazards
      2.        Potential flooding hazards
      3.        Potential fire hazards
      4.        Hazardous materials
      5.        Emergency preparedness and related and general matters.
      The topical areas are not entirely mutually exclusive, and, therefore, some policies from different groupings

    Zoning Ordinance, Uniform Building Code, and Uniform Fire Code, to ensure that hazardous incidents and
    emergencies can be quickly and safely accessed by emergency vehicles and personnel. The City will attempt
    to ensure that developments or uses of which the State has permitting authority over, including public schools,
    hospitals, and mobile home parks, meet these standards and provisions to the greatest extent possible.
oo. Study and evaluate all public and private street and accessibility and clearance standards of the Circulation
    Element, Subdivision Ordinance, Zoning Ordinance, Uniform Building Code, and Uniform Fire Code to
    ensure that they continue to fulfill their emergency response and other functions and, where necessary, revise
    the provisions.
pp. Continue to maintain a coordinated, cooperative, and inter-departmental approach in reviewing new or
    expanded/altered public and private developments and uses and temporary activities through administering
    the Covina Site Plan Review and Building Permit Issuance processes to facilitate implementation of all City

    and other officials can best comment on all aspects of the proposals involving public safety, including, but not
    limited to, building and roofing materials; fire sprinklers (if required); alarms and related features; emergency
    vehicle accessibility/circulation with respect to streets, driveways, parking aisles, clearances around structures,
    and/or driveway approaches; emergency vehicle parking and unloading; response times; water pressure;
                                                       E-58

    defensible space; traffic; lighting; impacts on surrounding areas; and overall structural adequacy as well as the
    impacts of the projects on existing services/resources. These reviews shall take place at the earliest possible
    point to permit changes in the proposal, if necessary.
qq. Ensure that the Covina Fire Department continues to enforce all codes and standards concerning actual or
    potential obstruction of approaches needed for emergency vehicle accessibility.
rr. Endeavor to monitor future hazard- and safety-related conditions, discoveries, and local policy changes and,
    when necessary, make appropriate General Plan amendments.
ss. Balance the City’s obligation to preserve, protect, and maintain public safety with Covina’s need to accommodate
    moderate growth and to continue with ongoing communitywide economic development, commercial
    revitalization, public improvement enhancement, residential construction, neighborhood preservation, code
    enforcement, and housing activities/programs.
tt. Best implement the Safety Element through the Zoning Ordinance and Design Guidelines, Capital Improvement
    Program, Subdivision Ordinance, Building and Safety and Fire provisions, Neighborhood Preservation Program,
    general Code Enforcement, Emergency Plan, and any related Covina Municipal Code sections, City policies,

IX. PROGRAMS/IMPLEMENTION MEASURES
    Under State law, this Safety Element must contain programs/implementation measures. Programs supplement
    the goal and policies and serve as a key implementation mechanism. In other words, as stated in the Introduction,
    programs ensure that the Element’s goal and policies will reach fruition. For clarification on the goal and
    policies and how they have shaped the development of this section, refer to Chapter VIII.
    The Covina Safety Element programs/implementation measures are listed below. Some of the programs/
    measures are currently active, though many would commence upon Element adoption. Programs that are
    proposed are believed best suited and viable for the City.
    For reasons of simplicity and clarity, the programs/measures are divided into six below-listed subject areas.
    The categorization generally follows that of the policies. Within each topical area, the programs are listed in
    no particular order. The six subject areas are:
    A.        Potential Seismic and Geologic Hazards
    B.        Potential Flooding Hazards
    C.        Potential Fire Hazards
    D.        Hazardous Materials
    E.        Emergency Preparedness and Related Matters
    F.        Inter-Topic General Matters
A.  Potential Seismic and Geologic Hazards
1.  Uniform Building and Other Official Codes
    The City administers and enforces various construction and grading provisions, standards, and practices of
    the Uniform Building Code (UBC) and other official, City-adopted Codes to ensure the structural adequacy of
    buildings and the safety of persons against the adverse impacts of seismically induced ground shaking or
    ground failure, such as landslides. Duties pertaining to these provisions and standards constitute one of the
    most important functions of the community. Covina will continue to implement and review and, where
    necessary, modify these Codes to better protect the City. And for developments or uses of which the State has
    permitting authority over (e.g., public schools, hospitals, and mobile home parks), the City will strive to
    ensure that the applicable codes and standards are appropriately followed through.
2.  Soils, Geologic, and/or Structural Studies/Evaluations
    Project-specific soils, geologic, and/or structural studies/evaluations, when required, provide useful,
    supplemental information to City officials in verifying the structural adequacy of new and expanded or improved
    buildings. The City will continue to call for these studies/evaluations in project review.
3.  Seismic Retrofitting Efforts/Activities
    The City encourages seismic retrofitting of older, unreinforced masonry and similar buildings on a voluntary
    basis in conjunction with ongoing commercial revitalization and general building renovation. Most of these
    buildings pervade in the older downtown area. The community will continue with this activity, which abates
    potentially hazardous structures.
                                                      E-61

4. Seismic Retrofitting of Puddingstone Dam
   As detailed in this Element, the unimproved section of Walnut Creek in Covina Hills experiences some seasonal
   flooding primarily because of Los Angeles County Flood Control District storm water management/release
   practices at the upstream Puddingstone Reservoir and Dam complex, which is within Bonelli Regional Park.
   One reason for the storm water release strategy is to comply with State restrictions regarding uncertainties of
   the seismic stability of the 1920s-era Dam. In light of the disturbances imposed on the community by this
   flooding and the catastrophic impacts that could result if Puddingstone Dam should fail, the City will request
   that the County Flood Control District commit and secure funding to seismically reinforce the Dam.
5. Monitoring of Dormant/Potentially Active Faults
   There are two potentially active or dormant faults that pass through Covina, Indian Hill and Walnut Creek,
   which could theoretically pose threats for the community. The City will monitor the faults for movement and,
   if any activity is detected, will closely investigate the fault(s), following appropriate methodology, and adopt
   reasonable development policies and standards.
6. Investigations of General Seismic Conditions
   Because Covina lies in a region that has experienced much earthquake activity, it is appropriate for the City to
   continually investigate, to the greatest extent possible, seismic conditions and matters in southern California.
   Any discoveries with public safety implications for Covina will be appropriately handled from a building
   construction standpoint.
7. Investigation of Local Geologic and Soil Conditions
   Certain sections of the Covina Hills area have the potential for major landslides or mudslides. Therefore, the
   City will continue to follow various applicable construction and grading standards and practices to ensure
   structural integrity and ground stability and will investigate further the geology and soil conditions in Covina
   Hills. If there are significant detections that relate to public safety, then the City will conduct appropriate
   actions concerning development, such as revising policies, standards, and practices.
8. Monitoring for Potential Liquefaction, Settlement, or Subsidence
   Liquefaction, settlement, and subsidence are different types of ground failure-related phenomena, they occurring
   as a result of particular soil materials either existing alone over time or interacting with ground shaking or
   ground water withdrawal. These problems have not been detected in Covina because of various factors, such
   as favorable soil and ground water conditions and adherence to appropriate development standards. However,
   City staff will monitor the community for any incidents of liquefaction, settlement, or subsidence and, if
   identified, will closely investigate the hazard and require special studies and measures to accommodate
   construction.
9. Replanting Efforts in Hillside Areas
   Landslides, which could potentially occur in portions of Covina Hills, are sometimes brought on by the
   saturation of bare, post-fire hillsides during heavy rains. To prevent potential problems, following a major fire
   in this district, the City will continue with existing efforts to replant the hillsides in a reasonable fashion with
   appropriate materials.
                                                       E-62
10. Promotion of Earthquake Preparedness
    Earthquake preparedness planning is an important process in seismically active regions, such as southern
    California, for saving human lives and protecting property during and after a ground shaking incident. The
    City will continue to promote this process through the Covina Emergency Plan and through active involvement
    with various quake awareness measures, including the distribution of brochure materials and working with
    local groups.
B.  Potential Flooding Hazards
1.  Maintenance of Flood Control Infrastructure
    Covina is served by an extensive storm drainage system that is operated and maintained by the Los Angeles
    County Flood Control District. The City will continue to support County efforts to sustain this infrastructure.
    Covina’s drainage needs constitute an important matter that cannot be overlooked.
2.  Improvement of Flood Control Infrastructure
    Despite the general overall adequacy of Covina’s storm drainage network in areas other than around the
    unimproved section of Walnut Creek, minor flooding and ponding has occurred at a few older locations
    because of outmoded or insufficient infrastructure. The community will continue to work with Los Angeles
    County on public works projects that will resolve these deficiencies and that will accommodate future moderate
    growth.
3.  Imposition of Flood Control System-Related Conditions
    In the development review process for generally major applications, the City imposes flood control system-
    related conditions to prevent or ensure the mitigation of any flood hazards or problems. The City will therefore
    continue to require appropriate, applicable measures in conjunction with new and significantly expanded
    proposals.
4.  Permanent Resolution of Walnut Creek Flooding and Erosion Problems
    The unimproved section of Walnut Creek in the Covina Hills area experiences some flooding during the
    winter months primarily because of Los Angeles County Flood Control District storm water management/
    release practices at the upstream Puddingstone Reservoir and Dam complex. These practices have occurred
    as a result of both the seismic instability of the Dam (which has created a maximun water storage capacity)
    and County desires to expand recreational and commercial activities (which has led to a minimum water
    level). The flooding has also caused erosion problems. The City of Covina believes that it is in the best
    interests of area residents and property owners and all levels of government to reach a permanent solution to
    Walnut Creek flooding and erosion by whatever means are deemed appropriate, including developing a program
    and funding mechanism to seismically reinforce Puddingstone Dam or by having the County lower the
    Puddingstone Reservoir water level during the winter months.
5.  Addressing of Short-Term Effects of Walnut Creek Flooding and Erosion
    Until there is a permanent solution to the Walnut Creek flooding and erosion problems, it is appropriate for the
    City to continually follow various reasonable short-term or day-to-day measures. Such measures encompass
    prohibiting habitable structures within or near the Creek, administering reasonable development standards
    and provisions for abutting properties, including those clarified under the Zoning Ordinance and Design
    Guidelines, communicating with Los Angeles County Flood Control District officials on water release matters
    to best respond to public questions and concerns, and conducting emergency preparedness activities.
                                                       E-63

6. Addressing of Long-Term Effects of Walnut Creek Flooding and Erosion
   In addition to following various short-term items pertaining to flooding and erosion of Walnut Creek (as
   stated in No. 5 above), the City will study and monitor the long-term or cumulative effects thereof. This
   activity is needed to best prevent or minimize property damage, human danger, and soil erosion and concomitant
   threats to wildlife in and adjacent to the Creek.
7. Uniform Building Code Provisions
   The City administers various construction, earth work, grading, and general drainage standards and practices/
   provisions of the Uniform Building Code (UBC) to ensure, among other things, the structural adequacy of
   buildings, the minimization of erosion along the banks of the unimproved section of Walnut Creek and
   elsewhere, and the control of storm water to off-site facilities. To best protect public health and safety, the
   City will continue to follow and, where necessary, modify applicable sections of the UBC. For developments
   or uses of which the State has permitting authority over (e.g., public schools, hospitals, and mobile home
   parks), the City will strive to ensure that applicable codes, standards, and/or provisions are appropriately
   followed through.
8. Zoning Ordinance and Design Guidelines Provisions
   The Covina Zoning Ordinance and Design Guidelines constitute the primary General Plan implementation
   mechanisms of the City Planning Division. Concerning the area in question, the City will continue to implement
   the various standards and provisions of these documents pertaining to site planning, grading, erosion
   minimization, site runoff, and landscaping. Particular attention will be devoted to the unimproved section of
   Walnut Creek in Covina Hills and other sensitive areas. Where appropriate, changes to the Zoning Ordinance
   and Design Guidelines will be performed to better serve the community. For developments or uses of which
   the State has permitting authority over (e.g., public schools, hospitals, and mobile home parks), the City will
   strive to ensure that applicable codes, standards, and/or provisions are appropriately followed through.
C. Potential Fire Hazards
1. Uniform Building and Fire Codes
   Fire prevention is of great importance to the City of Covina. Therefore, the Covina Building and Safety
   Division and Fire Department follow and enforce various requirements and standards from, respectively, the
   Uniform Building Code (UBC) and Uniform Fire Code (UFC) for new construction and for substantial additions
   to existing structures to ensure the safety of persons against the adverse impacts of both urban and wild land
   fire hazards. The City will further review and, where necessary, change these provisions, which include fire-
   resistant materials and fire sprinkler systems, to better protect Covina residents, property owners, workers,
   and others.
2. Zoning Ordinance and Design Guidelines Requirements
   The City Planning Division maintains certain fire-inhibiting provisions for new and substantially modified
   development proposals that supplement the Uniform Building Code (UBC) and Uniform Fire Code (UFC).
   These requirements of the Zoning Ordinance and Design Guidelines consist of building use and design,
   landscaping, and related provisions. When appropriate or required by law, the community will revise the
   documents to better serve Covina.
                                                     E-64
3. Fire Department Inspection and Monitoring Programs
   The Covina Fire Department inspects and monitors buildings of all uses and types to ensure adherence to
   various department codes and standards. The Department will carry on with these activities, particularly
   relating to establishments using and/or storing hazardous materials.
4. Weed Abatement Efforts
   An abundance of overgrown, combustible weeds and plant materials can make Covina Hills and other areas
   susceptible to wild land fires. Therefore, the Covina Fire Department has managed a weed abatement program
   that involves trimming and clearing such materials from public and private properties. Covina will continue
   with this effort, which, along with general Fire inspection and monitoring activities, suppresses potential fire
   hazards.
5. Building and Safety Inspections
   The Covina Building and Safety Division conducts various inspections in the course of its day-to-day activities,
   many of which directly or indirectly relate to fire suppression. These inspections are performed during general
   building construction or alteration, business license issuance, and general Code Enforcement activities, and
   the inspection process is often coordinated with the Fire Department. The City regards and will continue this
   program as an essential pubic safety measure.
6. Neighborhood Preservation Program
   Building and Safety Division personnel manage and coordinate the Neighborhood Preservation Program
   (NPP), an in-depth code enforcement activity that focuses on particular deteriorating areas. In the NPP
   process, Building and Safety, functioning with other departments, such as Fire, works with property owners,
   residents, and merchants in these neighborhoods or target areas to abate violations and to prevent potential
   problems from arising. And fire prevention as well as ensuring structural stability constitute important aspects
   of this process. The City will continue to administer the NPP as a viable tool for maintaining public safety in
   certain areas.
7. Water Infrastructure and Availability
   In the plan review process, various City departments/divisions review proposals to ensure the inclusion of
   water or firefighting infrastructure, such as hydrants, and the adequacy of water pressure. The City will
   continue checking for these items.
8. Fire Prevention/Education Activities
   The Covina Fire Department as well as the Building and Safety Division utilize various fire prevention/
   education methods that bolster public awareness of the issue and that basically complement inspection,
   monitoring, code enforcement, and other areas. These activities are believed to be quite beneficial to the
   community and therefore are to be maintained.
D. Hazardous Materials
1. Fire Department Inspection and Monitoring Programs
   As described in this Element, the City of Covina has several industrial and commercial businesses and
   institutional operations that use, generate, store, and must dispose of hazardous materials. The Covina Fire
   Department, among its many duties, inspects, monitors, and maintains records on these entities to reduce fire
   dangers, to best respond to emergencies, and to assist the Los Angeles County Fire Department, with which
                                                      E-65
   the City contracts concerning hazardous materials oversight. Because of the disastrous impacts that a hazardous
   materials accident can have on the community, it is important for the City to continue with this activity.
2. Building and Safety Inspections
   The Covina Building and Safety Division conducts various structural-, occupancy-, business license-, and
   code enforcement-related inspections. Many of these activities involve identifying the use and storage of
   hazardous materials, directing applicable handlers to the City or County Fire Department and other appropriate
   regulatory entities, and advising operators as to particular code requirements. Building and Safety, which
   works closely with Fire in this area, will carry on with all current efforts.
3. Contractual Agreement With Los Angeles County
   The City contracts with the Los Angeles County Fire Department, Hazardous Materials Division to administer
   various State-required monitoring activities and permitting processes regarding the utilization, storage, and
   transportation of hazardous materials as well as to respond to major above- and below-ground and transport-
   related hazardous materials accidents. To best protect public health and safety, the City will maintain this
   agreement.
4. Business Assistance Efforts
   Covina administration strives to work with and maintain a harmonious relationship with the business community
   and various institutional uses. One facet of this effort involves disseminating to businesses and institutional
   operators that handle and/or generate hazardous materials or wastes general information on applicable
   regulations and provisions and the need to comply therewith. This activity is particularly important with
   respect to the Los Angeles County Hazardous Waste Management Plan (see Programs 17 and 18 below).
   Furthermore, if determined to be necessary, the City will supplement these efforts by informing the Chamber
   of Commerce, Downtown Merchants’ Association, and other business organizations in the City about the
   subject matters and encourage the organizations to share the information with members. Business assistance
   efforts, which are handled by various City departments/divisions, additionally help staff to augment and
   clarify code enforcement situations, if necessary, and therefore serve as an all-around important tool.
5. National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
   Under the Federal NPDES program, which aims to prohibit polluted substances and all non-storm water
   discharges into the public storm drainage system, the City, working with Los Angeles County, manages local
   storm water/urban runoff management activities. Covina will continue implementing its NPDES proposal to
   comply with the Clean Water Act and other applicable laws and to prevent unwanted storm water contamination
   through such discharges. As indicated in this Element, the NPDES program thus addresses hazardous or
   environmentally injurious materials as well as grading and construction activities, certain business operations,
   excessive erosion, sediment build-up, and insufficient impermeable surfaces or excessive water runoff.
6. Los Angeles County Department of Public Works Household Hazardous Waste Roundups
   As mentioned in this Element, many common household items, such as cleaning solutions and used motor oil,
   are comprised of hazardous materials and therefore warrant proper disposal. Under the quarterly Los Angeles
   County Department of Public Works Household Hazardous Waste Roundup program, City and County residents
   may bring various waste materials to a large collection facility for proper disposal. The City will continue to
   back this viable program.
                                                    E-66

7.  General Plan and Zoning Use Standards
    A key function of a general plan and accompanying, implementing zoning ordinance is to designate the
    appropriate distribution of land uses around a community, which is particularly relevant when considering
    hazardous materials. Therefore, in carrying out its land use duties, the City will attempt to place new or
    accommodate expanded facilities involved in the production, storage, transportation, and/or handling of
    hazardous materials sufficiently away from residential and other sensitive activities, as described in the body
    of this Element and the related policies. And in terms of the types of “potentially hazardous” uses themselves
    to be permitted, the City will encourage relatively low intensity/low risk industrial and commercial uses, as
    opposed to high intensity/high risk activities, based on reasonable development standards.
8.  Hazardous Materials Transport
    Covina is susceptible to hazardous materials accidents from the transport of hazardous substances through
    and near the community. To prevent potential disasters from occurring, the City will attempt to ensure that
    vehicles carrying large quantities of dangerous materials travel on officially-designated truck routes and that
    applicable laws of all levels of government are enforced.
9.  Los Angeles County Underground Storage Tank Abatement Program
    The Los Angeles County Department of Public Works, Waste Management Division conducts an underground
    storage tank program that monitors tank safety and, where leakage has occurred, as is the case with several
    properties in Covina, calls for remediation. Covina will continue to work with and support the County in
    administering this program to best prevent or abate underground contamination. The City will also cooperate
    with other levels of government involved in this area as well as in handling generalized ground water pollution
    created by both storage and septic tank leakage.
10. Environmental Audits
    At its discretion, the City often requires various types of environmental audits pertaining to possible
    contamination of underground resources and structures. The community will continue with this process,
    which includes, if applicable, corrective measures. Covina aims to resolve these issues prior to construction.
11. Septic Tank Management
    Some older properties in Covina still have underground septic tanks and related facilities, which, if not
    monitored/maintained, are prone to rupture or leakage and concomitant soil or ground water contamination.
    Therefore, where appropriate, the City requires soil testing and/or other investigative actions in the development
    process to detect the presence of any such facilities. And to prevent potential problems, where active septic
    tanks are discovered, the City calls for their testing or circumvention by site plan revision. Dormant septic
    tanks must be removed or correctly filled. These practices are to continue.
12. Handling of Unauthorized Dumping
    The illegal dumping of toxic or other hazardous substances into the ground, water, or storm drainage system
    can constitute a major cause for subsurface contamination. Therefore, the City will appropriately handle
    persons or entities involved in this activity and, through proper channels, encourage citizens and businesses to
    report such dumping.
                                                        E-67

13. DigAlert Program
    There are several major, high-pressure natural gas distribution lines that underlie Covina. To prevent accidents
    associated with digging activities, the City and local utility companies participate in and continue to support
    DigAlert, a regional notification center pertaining to this topic. Under State law, persons or entities digging or
    excavating anywhere in Covina are required to call the DigAlert center in advance, which, in turn, informs the
    City and any utility company or other organization that owns/controls underground lines in the vicinity about
    the upcoming work.
14. Maintenance of Sewers and Other Infrastructure
    Covina is served by an extensive sewage disposal system that is operated and maintained by the City, Los
    Angeles County, and, on a contract basis, other communities. To prevent accidents or underground hazards,
    the City and all other applicable entities will continue to inspect and sustain this infrastructure as well as the
    major, high-pressure natural gas distribution lines that underlie Covina. It is noted that the gas lines typically
    fall under the purview of the Southern California Gas Company and the U. S. Department of Transportation,
    Office of Pipeline Safety.
15. Improvement of Sewers and Other Infrastructure
    The community has cooperated with and will continue to support or work with Los Angeles County and/or
    additional entities to improve the sewage disposal and other systems, where appropriate. Such actions would
    resolve existing, minor deficiencies and facilitate growth.
16. Imposition of Sewage Disposal System–Related Conditions
    In the development review process for particular major applications, the City imposes conditions pertaining to
    sewage disposal, such as requiring projects to be connected to the public sewers and to conform to current
    public works standards, to prevent potential underground contamination that is often associated with septic
    tanks. The City will therefore continue to require appropriate, applicable measures in conjunction with new
    and significantly expanded proposals.
17. Obligations Regarding the Los Angeles County Hazardous Waste Management Plan
    Under the Los Angeles County Hazardous Waste Management Plan, of which Covina has to incorporate
    applicable portions thereof into the General Plan Safety Element, local governments must participate in the
    regional hazardous waste management process by following various measures and procedures, particularly
    relating to siting waste-related facilities. The intent of this effort is to address countywide waste disposal
    problems. Through adoption and implementation of this Element, the City has committed to follow the
    applicable portions of the Plan, including sections on waste management facility definitions, public participation,
    emergency response, and waste minimization, on an as-needed basis. In addition, the City will continue to
    assist the County as well as the State and Federal governments in handling general hazardous waste management
    planning and related matters, such as by maintaining and furnishing salient, available information on local
    hazardous waste generators.
18. Hazardous Waste Management Facility Siting
    A key component of the Los Angeles County Hazardous Waste Management Plan requires cities to accept
    various types of hazardous waste management facilities and, accordingly, to list and detail the general
    geographical areas particularly suitable for hazardous waste facilities and the siting criteria to be used to
    evaluate the suitability and compatibility of such facilities with surrounding land uses and the immediate
                                                      E-68

   environment. Therefore, the City of Covina will carry out the geographical guidelines and siting criteria
   described in the body of this Element and the related policies, such as those calling for thorough analyses of
   all applicable issues associated with a proposal, supplementing the criteria with appropriate project-specific
   conditions, requiring comprehensive risk assessments, and providing for extensive public education and review
   and comment opportunities. In the aggregate, this effort is essential to further community health, safety,
   welfare, and integrity.
E. Emergency Preparedness and Related Matters
1. Covina Emergency (Preparedness) Plan
   The Covina Emergency Plan serves as the City’s chief guidebook for emergency preparedness planning and
   for comprehensively managing any type of major emergency, such as an earthquake, a flood, or a fire. The
   City will maintain and, as necessary or required by law, update the Plan to best serve the community, will
   continue to apprise and train City employees of key Plan provisions, and will promote public awareness of the
   document to best serve the community.
2. Standardized Emergency Management System (SEMS)
   The Standardized Emergency Management System (SEMS) is the chief inter-agency process/framework relating
   to emergency preparedness, management, and resolution and thus augments the Covina Emergency Plan.
   The City of Covina places a high priority on supporting and training all municipal employees in the SEMS to
   best handle potential disasters and to most efficiently deal with other entities following an emergency. This
   emphasis will carry on.
3. Informational Community Programs
   The City will continue to support and sponsor local programs, such as Covinan’s Organized for Potential
   Emergencies (COPE), that train volunteers to assist City staff in disseminating information on emergency
   procedures, particularly relating to potential earthquakes, and in promoting public awareness of the Covina
   Emergency Plan. These efforts are essential to successfully manage emergency preparedness planning.
4. Reconstructive Measures
   Because of the substantial upset to the community that an earthquake or other major disaster could cause, it is
   necessary for City officials to look beyond emergency preparedness planning. Specifically, the City should
   develop programs and procedures, inclusive of funding sources, to promote the reconstruction and recovery
   of affected portions of the City following a hazardous incident.
5. Evacuation Routes
   The Safety Element must establish evacuation routes in relation to major emergencies, which constitute another
   component of emergency preparedness planning. Covina has designated the San Bernardino Freeway and the
   major roads or Circulation Element-defined primary arterial, secondary arterial, and collector streets for this
   purpose. The City will maintain these routes.
6. Fire Protection and Paramedical Services
   Fire and paramedical services in Covina are provided by the Covina Fire Department, which also provides
   general regulation of and monitoring of the handlers of hazardous materials and performs related duties. The
   Department further manages Covina’s Emergency Plan functions and conducts various fire prevention efforts,
   including weed abatement, brush clearance, and general Code Enforcement. Covina will strive to maintain
   sufficient Fire personnel, equipment, suppression resources, and facilities as well as mutual aid agreements
   with surrounding jurisdictions to best respond to disasters, emergencies, and everyday public safety-related
   service requests, to administer its various programs, and to fulfill its many various obligations.
                                                    E-69

7.  Contractual Agreement With Los Angeles County
    The City contracts with the Los Angeles County Fire Department, Hazardous Materials Division to administer
    various State-required monitoring activities and permitting processes regarding the utilization, storage, and
    transportation of hazardous materials as well as to respond to major above- and below-ground and transport-
    related hazardous materials accidents. To best protect public health and safety, the City will maintain and, if
    appropriate, modify this agreement.
8.  Maintaining Water Pressure Flow
    Adequate water pressure flow in a community is essential for ensuring sufficient firefighting capabilities. The
    community will maintain sufficient water pressure and flow capacities citywide, monitor conditions, and,
    where necessary, enhance the water distribution system.
9.  Law Enforcement Service
    The Covina Police Department provides law enforcement for the community, which ranges from responding
    to disasters and emergencies to everyday public safety-related service requests. In addition, the Department
    manages the City’s emergency communications systems and conducts various viable crime prevention and
    control programs, such as Neighborhood Watch, Citizens’ Volunteer Patrol, and Drug Abuse Resistance
    Education (DARE). The City will strive to maintain sufficient police-related personnel, equipment, resources,
    facilities, and mutual aid agreements with surrounding jurisdictions to fulfill its many, varied duties. Where
    necessary, operational and/or procedural improvements will be made.
10. Contractual Agreements with Los Angeles County
    The City contracts with Los Angeles County’s Sheriff’s Department and Animal Care and Control Department
    to provide, respectively, long-term booking facilities and animal control administration. To best protect public
    health and safety, the City will maintain and, if appropriate, modify these agreements.
11. Building and Safety Division Service
    In conducting its various structural-, occupancy-, business license-, and code enforcement-related inspections,
    Building and Safety Division staff frequently work with and assist Fire and Police personnel in exercising
    their duties. Furthermore, the Building and Safety Division plays a key role in carrying out the Covina
    Emergency Plan. Therefore, it is essential for the City to strive to maintain sufficient applicable personnel,
    equipment, and resources to fulfill the above tasks, and, where appropriate, perform operational and/or
    procedural improvements.
12. Public and Private Street Design Standards
    Through implementation of the Covina Subdivision Ordinance, Zoning Ordinance, and Design Guidelines,
    the City applies various public and private street design standards to facilitate general circulation and to
    ensure that hazardous incidents and emergencies can be quickly and safely accessed by emergency vehicles.
    The City will maintain and enforce these provisions, the foundations of which are established in the Circulation
    Element, and, to ensure continued viability thereof, will revise the standards to best serve Covina.
13. Site Design Standards
    Under the Zoning Ordinance, Design Guidelines, Uniform Building Code, Uniform Fire Code, and
    applicable portions of this General Plan, the City applies many essential site design standards for public
    and private driveways, parking aisles, vertical clearances, vehicular turnarounds, driveway approaches,
                                                      E-70

   the number and locations of site access points, emergency parking and unloading, building setbacks, clearances
   around structures, and other elements. Covina will maintain and, through Fire, Building and Safety, Planning,
   and/or Police Department/Division efforts, enforce these provisions to ensure that they continue to fulfill their
   emergency response, public safety, and other functions. Where appropriate for health, safety, functionality,
   and/or aesthetic enhancement purposes, the site design standards will be amended. In addition, as indicated
   previously, the City will attempt to ensure that developments or uses of which the State has permitting authority
   over, including public schools, hospitals, and mobile home parks, meet these standards and provisions to the
   greatest extent possible.
F. Inter-Topic General Matters
1. Zoning Ordinance Revision to Achieve General Plan Consistency
   As required by State planning law, the Zoning text and Map will be revised to conform to the new General
   Plan land use distribution, policy orientation, program framework, building intensity provisions and limits,
   and development standards to streamline and clarify key portions of the document and to incorporate applicable
   new State requirements, such as pertaining to hazardous waste management facilities.
2. Consistency Between General Plan and Other Plans/Documents
   City departments and the Redevelopment Agency administer various plans and measures that directly or
   indirectly relate to safety issues. Where necessary, the Planning Division will ensure consistency between the
   revised Safety Element and these other germane plans/documents, which include, but are not limited to, the
   Redevelopment Project Area Plans, the Emergency Plan, the Park System Master Plan, the Subdivision
   Ordinance, and the Capital Improvement Program, to the greatest extent possible.
3. Site Plan Review Process
   This part of the Zoning Ordinance constitutes the process by which private development applications and
   certain public proposals are reviewed and analyzed and, thus, by which General Plan, Zoning, Design
   Guidelines, and related provisions pertaining to site planning, land use impacts, grading, site runoff, erosion
   minimization, and landscaping are applied. Site Plan Review also serves as a mechanism for determining
   General Plan/Zoning consistency and for routing projects to other City departments/divisions for study and
   comment on such issues as structural adequacy, soils stability, infrastructure accommodation, fire suppression,
   and emergency service capabilities. When reviewing applications, the City Planning Division may impose
   reasonable conditions to ensure conformance with respect to the General Plan, Zoning Ordinance, Design
   Guidelines, and other documents. This process shall continue.
4. Environmental Impact Review Process
   The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires, among other things, examination of environmental,
   biological, physical, land use, and safety impacts as well as service provision when reviewing generally major
   use or development applications, hazardous waste management facilities, general plan amendments, zone
   changes, and/or related matters. The analysis occurs during the Site Plan Review process. For applicable
   projects, typical areas of concern pertain to site geology and grading, proximity to any active earthquake
   fault(s), potential erosion, storm water runoff and/or flooding, underground contamination, public safety,
   species degradation, vehicular traffic, noise, and/or land use compatibility. The City will continue to follow
   all applicable CEQA provisions in its planning activities to ensure fruition of the safety-related goal and the
   furthering of applicable policies. Thus, in some cases, projects will have to be changed or mitigated.
                                                      E-71
5. Plan Check Process
   Under this process, which is administered by the Building and Safety Division and the Fire Department and
   typically proceeds a Site Plan Review, various provisions and practices of the Uniform Building Code (UBC)
   and related Codes and the Uniform Fire Code (UFC) are applied to development proposals. These matters
   pertain to a range of areas, such as building construction; seismic adequacy and retrofitting; electrical, plumbing,
   and related systems; grading; soils/geologic stability; on-site drainage; erosion control; handicapped
   accessibility; septic tank management or abatement; underground contamination identification and resolution;
   emergency accessibility; and fire detection and suppression systems. Concerning many of the areas that fall
   within their purviews, Building and/or Fire often require supplemental project-specific studies/evaluations to
   verify particular conditions and/or to ensure code compliance. Covina will continue with all Plan Check
   activities.
6. Engineering Review Processes
   During Site Plan Review, as the Planning Division addresses its many standards, guidelines, and policies, the
   Engineering Division of the Public Works Department checks projects with respect to impacts on public
   infrastructure, including streets; flood control systems; water distribution apparatuses; sewage disposal networks;
   street lights; and fire hydrants. Many of these provisions emanate from the Covina Subdivision Ordinance
   and related sections of the Covina Municipal Code. Where necessary, Engineering imposes and passes on to
   Planning reasonable conditions to ensure conformance with all applicable public works standards and to
   protect public health and safety. The Division also manages various permitting activities relating to actual
   infrastructure construction/improvement, both in conjunction with site-specific developments and major public-
   sponsored enhancement efforts. These public-involved activities are generally referred to as Capital
   Improvement Projects, are undertaken to resolve remaining minor deficiencies or identified problems, and are
   often done in conjunction with Los Angeles County. Furthermore, the Division requests permits for all
   infrastructure maintenance and right-of-way digging and excavating work, such as water or sewer line repair,
   to prevent hazards pertaining to the possible damage of high-pressure natural gas distribution lines that underlie
   Covina. The City will carry on with this area.
7. Inspection and Monitoring Activities
   The Covina Building and Safety Division and the Fire Department further conduct various inspection and
   monitoring activities that relate to structural adequacy, occupancy, hazardous materials, and fire detection and
   suppression and that are thus essential in maintaining community health and safety. Therefore, these activities
   will continue. Building and Safety inspections take place during building construction or alteration, building
   system modification (e.g., upgrades to an electrical system), business license issuance, code enforcement, and
   other matters. The Fire Department, moreover, inspects properties of all types and uses to ensure adherence
   to various Department codes and standards, including emergency accessibility, fire detection and suppression,
   hazardous materials, and weed or brush growth. Regarding hazardous materials, the Department further
   monitors and maintains records on hazardous materials handlers to best respond to emergencies and to assist
   Los Angeles County, of which the City contracts with, to provide the primary support in this area. Many of
   the inspections between Building and Safety and Fire are thus closely coordinated.
8. Code Enforcement
   In situations where Zoning-, Site Plan Review-, Building and Safety-, and/or Fire-related Code requirements
   are not met, particularly when there is a major threat to public health, safety, and welfare, the City attempts to
   abate or at least mitigate the violation(s). Code violations range from excessive weed growth to structural
   inadequacy to illegal discharges, which, if left unchecked, in the aggregate, not only could jeopardize individual
   health and safety but could diminish overall community image, appearance, character, social stability, and
   economic vitality, all of which directly or indirectly relate to subjects discussed in this Element. To ensure
   that the General Plan safety-related goal and policies are furthered, the City will continue with its existing,
                                                       E-72
    and, where possible, expand Code Enforcement and related activities. In general, Covina will attempt to
    abate first the most serious violations or those nuisances that constitute the greatest threat to public health,
    safety, and welfare.
9.  Reconciling Safety Matters
    This Element is one chapter of a comprehensive General Plan that addresses various other topics, including
    land use, circulation, housing, and natural resources and open space. Under State law, all Elements must be
    consistent with one another in preparation and revision (see Chapter X), a requirement that the City has met
    and will continue to achieve. However, in the course of implementing a general plan, proposals that strongly
    fulfill plan goals and policies in one area may be inconsistent with another chapter. For example, the aggressive
    retrofitting of older, unreinforced masonry buildings in the downtown area and elsewhere could possibly
    interfere with important community goals, such as economic development, commercial revitalization, and
    neighborhood preservation. Therefore, in implementing the Element, when conflicts arise, the City will
    endeavor to reconcile, to the greatest degree possible, the applicable safety and non-safety issues in an
    appropriate, acceptable manner.
10. Inter-government Coordination
    To most fairly and best deal with safety-related development issues at or near Covina’s border areas and with
    infrastructure matters, such as the construction, maintenance, and improvement of street, flood control, water
    distribution, fire detection and suppression, and sewage disposal systems, the City will continue routing various
    topical plans and documents to and reviewing development and public proposals from neighboring communities,
    Los Angeles County, and, if applicable, the State and Federal governments. When necessary, Covina will also
    be in contact with other governmental entities and/or relevant groups. This activity will, among other things,
    acknowledge City intentions, desires, and/or concerns over particular developments, proposals, and related
    actions in an atmosphere of respect and cooperation. Furthermore, Covina will continue to be in contact with
    all applicable governmental entities on additional important issues like emergency preparedness, emergency
    communication and coordination, water runoff and management, underground contamination and abatement,
    general hazardous materials disclosure laws administration, hazardous waste management planning, and
    evacuation route and/or circulation coordination.
11. Intra-government Coordination
    In carrying out the policies, activities, and programs/measures of the Safety Element, the Planning Division
    will work with other City departments/divisions, particularly the Building and Safety Division, the Fire
    Department, and the Police Department, to best approach and handle or abate various issues and problems.
    These matters include, but are not limited to, the imposition of infrastructure-related conditions, based on
    appropriate design and site planning standards, as well as general safety-type requirements, in the development
    process; the overall construction, maintenance, and improvement of infrastructure; emergency preparedness
    planning and post-disaster reconstruction; evacuation routes; various types of inspections and code enforcement
    activities; water availability and pressure flow adequacy; and everyday public safety activities. In light of the
    important and interrelated nature of all safety-related matters, this holistic orientation is essential and will best
    implement General Plan goals, objectives (where applicable), and policies.
12. Public Involvement
    In compliance with State planning law, the City will endeavor to promote the importance of the General Plan
    to the public, businesses, institutional uses, local service groups, developers, Covina employees, and additional
    interested parties and groups at the public counter, on the phone, at meetings, at City-sponsored events, and at
    other available opportunities through information handouts, brochures, press releases, and any other mediums
    deemed appropriate. In terms of safety-related matters warranting dissemination, the City will focus on
    earthquake awareness; Walnut Creek flooding management; fire prevention methods; crime prevention and
                                                        E-73

    control measures; business and institutional use-related hazardous materials handling; potential hazardous
    waste management facility education and comment solicitation; household hazardous waste disposal;
    underground contamination prevention; digging and excavation preparation; emergency preparedness planning,
    particularly with respect to the Covina Emergency Plan; and any other areas determined to be important.
    When General Plan updates are done, persons, groups, and organizations shall be notified through State-
    defined public hearings and, if appropriate, by way of other means. Frequent public education is an important
    ingredient in successful general plan implementation.
13. General Plan Review and Revisions
    State planning law requires the City to annually report to the Planning Commission and City Council on
    progress in General Plan implementation. The report must then be filed with the State Office of Planning and
    Research (OPR). The intent of this process is to ensure the viability, effectiveness, and coordination of
    adopted General Plan goals, objectives (where applicable), policies, and programs/implementation measures,
    which impact not only the community but, technically, the State as well. The City of Covina will continue
    with this activity and, when an amendment to the revised General Plan is made, will review the change in
    relation to the entire Plan to ensure inter-Element consistency. Moreover, appropriate, occasional monitoring
    of the General Plan components shall occur, particularly with respect to potential State or County changes in
    emergency preparedness planning and post-disaster communications or procedures; emergency service-related
    contractual agreements; hazardous materials handling; hazardous waste management facility planning/siting;
    Bonelli Park storm water management (which affects Walnut Creek, downstream); or possible seismic, geologic,
    or other underground or environmental discoveries. In addition, no later than five years following adoption of
    the last phase of the General Plan update, a detailed analysis of the entire Plan will be conducted. Finally, in
    recognition of the importance of safety planning, it is noted that State law also calls for each local government
    to consult with the California Department of Conservation, Division of Mines and Geology and the Office of
    Emergency Services prior to preparing or revising its safety element to include available element-related
    information. And at least forty-five days before the date of amendment of the element, a city is required to
    submit to the Department of Conservation a draft of the document for review and comment. (Remarks by the
    State are advisory, however.) The City of Covina has followed and will continue to pursue these procedures
    as well.
14. Safety Element Implementation
    In accordance with the State planning law/Government Code criteria, the City will implement the Safety
    Element in a manner compatible to the implementation/administration of all other General Plan Elements, the
    Covina Emergency Plan, applicable City and Redevelopment Agency documents and proposals, and community
    goals and, in a fashion consistent with the intent of this chapter, monitor all facets of Element implementation,
    conduct necessary tasks so as to best prepare for future versions, annually report its findings to the Planning
    Commission and City Council, and, when legally required, necessary, and/or in the public interest, update the
    Element.
15. Maintenance of City Departments/Divisions Responsible for Safety Matters
    In order to carry out its various safety responsibilities and obligations, the City will maintain departments/
    divisions to, among other things, appropriately administer the General Plan, Zoning Ordinance, Design
    Guidelines, Subdivision Ordinance, Uniform Building and related Codes, Uniform Fire Code, Los Angeles
    County Hazardous Waste Management Plan, Covina Emergency Plan, and other documents. In addition,
    Covina will maintain resources to administer and monitor various accompanying processes, programs, and
    activities, such as Site Plan Review, Environmental Impact Review, Plan Check, Building Permit Issuance,
    Engineering Review, Building and Safety or Fire Inspection, Code Enforcement, Neighborhood Preservation,
    Emergency Preparedness Planning, and incident-specific and everyday Public Safety Services, and to
    disseminate applicable information and provide assistance to the public.

X. RELATION TO AND CONSISTENCY WITH OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
   This Safety chapter of the General Plan is most closely related to the Land Use Element, the central chapter
   that focuses on the long-term general distribution/location and development intensity of residential, commercial,
   industrial, open space, and other uses, as well as the Circulation and Housing Elements. There is a close tie to
   the Land Use chapter because, under State law, as implied above, the proposed land use development scenario
   or Land Use Map must reflect the community’s identified potential hazards and corresponding mitigation or
   abatement measures. For example, to best handle and resolve possible landslides or mudslides and flooding
   in Covina Hills, most land uses in the area are designated “low density residential” and (pertaining to Walnut
   Creek) “park” or the equilivalent. And regarding potential hazardous materials accidents on commercial,
   industrial, and institutional properties, the Land Use Map establishes appropriate use relationships and
   development standards to adequately protect/buffer residential districts. Concerning the Safety Element’s
   connection to the Circulation chapter, which focuses on circulation and transportation systems, such as streets,
   and the movement of people and goods, the Safety Element must designate evacuation routes to be used in a
   major disaster. These evacuation routes are typically established based on the street hierarchy of the Circulation
   Element.
   The Housing Element, which this chapter also bears a strong relationship to, among other things, serves as a
   tool for addressing housing needs and providing adequate sites for new housing and standards for the housing
   stock. There is a correlation to the Housing Element because the City places a high priority on maintaining
   the safety of all Covina dwelling units in terms of structural and mechanical adequacy, fire prevention, emergency
   accessibility, and other factors. And a key basis for implementing and enforcing the applicable policies,
   standards, and programs is this Safety Element. The Element is also most directly related to the Natural
   Resources and Open Space chapter.
   It is also important for the Safety Element to be consistent with other chapters, and vice versa, in terms of
   everything from supporting data and information to policy orientation to implementation. This necessity for
   overall congruence is underscored by State law as well. Section 65300.5 of the California Government Code
   states that “the Legislature intends that the general plan and elements and parts thereof comprise an integrated,
   internally consistent and compatible statement of policies for the adopting agency.”
   The City of Covina has met this consistency requirement. Because the City has updated all General Plan
   Elements simultaneously, one common data and information base, with the same community input, has been
   used for the entire project. This means that the goals, objectives (if applicable), and policies for all Elements
   will have been (when all Elements are completed) prepared based on the same foundation and according to
   the same or similar methodology, thus ensuring consistency. Also, and perhaps most importantly, revising all
   General Plan Elements together guarantees inter-Element program conformity because, according to planning
   law, implementation measures or circulation/infrastructure, land use, and other plans must be developed upon
   the existing conditions/data and issues plus the stated goals, objectives (if applicable), and policies in question.
   In sum, the nature of the Covina General Plan update process has greatly facilitated consistency among all
   Elements. During Safety Element preparation, the topical goal and policies and programs/implementation
   measures have been cross-checked with those in other Elements, particularly Land Use, Circulation, and
   Housing, the other key General Plan chapters, to maintain and verify this necessary congruence.
   The above-noted inter-Element consistency will also ensure that implementation of the Safety and each and
   every Element will realize the same results. Furthermore, if the Safety Element is amended in the future, the
   City will confirm that the change is consistent with other chapters and/or modify the accompanying Elements
   to maintain overall conformity. Moreover, as stated in Program “F13,” the City will monitor all major aspects
   of Safety Element implementation through decision-making activities and other processes to verify this
   consistency. In other words, the City regards all Elements as having equal legal status and is therefore committed
   to appropriate Safety chapter implementation, particularly with respect to inter-Element unity and coherence.

XI. CITIZEN PARTICIPATION IN SAFETY ELEMENT FORMATION
    State planning law (Government Code Section 65351) requires local governments, during the amendment of
    a general plan, to “provide opportunities for the involvement of citizens, public agencies, public utility
    companies, and civic, education, and other community groups, through public hearings and any other means
    the city or county deems appropriate.” In fulfilling its citizen participation obligations and in identifying
    issues for Safety as well as for all other Elements, the City has:
1.  Prepared and distributed a “short” questionnaire to all Covina households.
2.  Prepared and distributed a “long” questionnaire on a random basis to approximately 10% of all Covina area
    households.
3.  Conducted “town hall meetings” and public forums.
4.  Prepared a cable television commercial on the General Plan update and public forums and had a staff member
    appear on the local cable television station to discuss the General Plan update process and answer public
    questions.
5.  Prepared and distributed several General Plan update flyers at City Hall and at various public functions. Also
    prepared press releases and articles in various newspapers and City publications on the update process and on
    the public forums.
6.  Received numerous comments from the public (in this case regarding safety matters) on the phone, at the
    counter, and in the course of site-specific project reviews.
7.  Organized, met with, and elicited the views of a subcommittee of Covina’s General Plan Update Committee
    that addressed safety and related issues.
8.  Met with and elicited the views of City of Covina employees who deal with safety-related matters.
9.  Received numerous comments from representatives of other public or quasi-public agencies, such as school
    districts, transit agencies, utility companies, regional organizations, and adjacent municipalities as well as
    local civic organizations.
10. Reviewed and considered the Covina Emergency (preparedness) Plan, an important, applicable document
    that had been prepared based on extensive community outreach.
    The public comments elicited from measures 1 through 10 have been carefully studied by the City and have
    been incorporated into the body of data and information that was used in formulating this Element’s identification
    and discussion of potential hazards facing Covina and related local matters and, therefore, in developing the
    applicable goal, policies, and programs/implementation measures as well. All material and information and
    specific input received pertaining to these items are on file in the City Planning Division. Thus, Covina has
    made a reasonable effort to reach out to the important segments, views, and organizations in drafting the
    Safety Element.

XII. MONITORING SAFETY ELEMENT IMPLEMENTION
     In order for the General Plan Safety Element’s goal and policies and programs/implementation measures to
     be realized, or to ensure that the Element serves to prevent death, injuries, property damage, and other problems
     associated with a disaster, the Element must be implemented as proposed through effective decision-making
     and actions. Also, to ensure that implementation is achieved to the maximum degree possible, consistent
     Safety Element monitoring must also occur. This subject is addressed by Section 65400(b) of the Government
     Code, which states that following general plan adoption or revision, a city shall “provide an annual report to
     the legislative body on the status of the plan and progress in its implementation . . .” Because the Safety
     Element is an important chapter and is, as previously stated, closely tied to the central Land Use Element,
     monitoring is particularly relevant here.
     The City of Covina will fulfill its obligation to monitor implementation by preparing the State-required report
     for the Planning Commission and for the City Council. This procedure, in fact, has been incorporated into the
     Safety Element implementation framework as Program “F13,” which calls for the monitoring of all aspects of
     the implementation effort, including, as stated in Section X, assurances that inter-Element consistency is
     achieved. One such facet of the monitoring process is ensuring that any underutilized policies or programs
     are adequately handled. Also, any identified problems or deficiencies will be carefully studied and appropriately
     managed to ensure that desired Safety Element results are met. The City believes that many potential problems
     should be avoided by maintaining a commitment to appropriate Element implementation through the decision-
     making process. Besides, then, furthering the established safety-related goal, this approach will facilitate
     preparing General Plan amendments.
