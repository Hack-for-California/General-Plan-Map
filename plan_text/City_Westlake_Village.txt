INTRODUCTION
In 1990, the City of Westlake Village initiated a comprehensive update of its General Plan. This update was needed to account for the City's change from a semi-rural community to a substantially developed master planned city. The original General Plan contains goals, policies, and programs which directed cohesive development. The primary focus of this General Plan is to develop goals, policies, and programs which will sustain Westlake Village residents' high quality of life, and to address the probable recycling of existing uses to increased densities.
This General Plan is also intended to:
a.	address all legislative planning requirements of the State of California;
b.	integrate into a single plan document all required and permissive elements, replacing previously adopted elements;
c.	provide data and analyses regarding conditions and factors currently influencing the City and projected to occur to 2010; and
d.	define policies and programs which promote the conservation and revitalization of existing uses, guide new development, and focus resource management activities in a manner which reflects community needs and objectives.
ORGANIZATION OF THE GENERAL PLAN DOCUMENT
The General Plan document has been organized by major resource topics and is divided into the following chapters and subject areas:
CHAPTER ONE - COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
Land Use Fiscal Resources Housing
CHAPTER TWO - INFRASTRUCTURE AND COMMUNITY SERVICES
Circulation
Utilities
Institutional Facilities Public Safety Recreation
Solid Waste/Source Reduction and Recycling

THE GENERAL PLAN
The General Plan will give guidance to those making decisions affecting the allocation of resources and future shape and character of the City of Westlake Village. It, therefore, will be the official statement of the City regarding the framework of policies, standards, and actions needed to achieve its physical, economic, social, and environmental goals. Although the Plan will be composed of individual sections, or "elements," each dealing with a particular topical areas of concern, the General Plan will embody a comprehensive approach in which the total range of City concerns and issues are treated in an integrated manner.
The General Plan will also act to clarify and articulate the City's intentions with respect to the rights and expectations of the general public, property owners, and prospective investors and business interests. Through the Plan, the City will inform these groups of its goals, policies and development standards, thereby communicating what is expected of the private sector to meet the objectives of the Plan.
Integrated into the Plan are the seven elements mandated by the State of California and three elective elements. The former includes Land Use, Circulation, Housing, Conservation, Open Space, Noise and Safety. Elective elements include Fiscal, Infrastructure, and Public Services and Facilities. In addition, the Plan summarizes and incorporates by reference a Source Reduction and Recycling Element consistent with the requirements of the California integrated Waste Management Act of 1989
City of Westlake Village General plan

INTRODUCTION
(i.e., AB 939) and includes an Air Quality Element in compliance with the guidelines of the Southern California Association of Governments.
These elements are organized by their constituent resource topics, rather than the state-defined element titles, to avoid the redundancy resulting from the overlapping requirements of the State General Plan Guidelines. For example, "Parks and Recreation" policy pertains to three separate elements: Land Use, Open Space, and Parks and Recreation.
The Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for this General Plan is under a separate cover and known as Appendix A.
OVERVIEW OF THE CITY
The City of Westlake Village is located approximately 40 miles northwest of Los Angeles (see Figures 1 and 2) and contains 5.62 square miles. It is bounded by the City of Thousand Oaks on the northwest at the Los Angeles-Ventura County line, the City of Agoura Hills on the east and southeast, the Rancho El Conejo line in the southeast, and Decker Road on the west. Topographically, the City is bordered by El Conejo Hills to the north and the Santa Monica Mountains to the south. The Ventura Freeway (U.S. Highway 101) bisects the City. The 1990 U.S. Census estimates approximated that the City has 7,455 residents within the City limits, living in 3,000 dwelling units. The estimated average household income is approximately $70,000.
The master planned nature of the community is responsible for such characteristics as a wide range of housing types, uniform design patterns, well-defined and broad-based industrial centers in business park settings, an efficient and attractively landscaped circulation system, neighborhoods with readily-identifiable boundaries, an 18-hole golf course and greenbelts which internally link residential developments.
AREA COVERED BY PLAN
The Westlake Village General Plan covers the area within the City limits (see Figure 3). It is the City of Westlake Village Planning Department's determination that no other area outside of the City limits will bear a relation to the City's planning.

INTRODUCTION
DATA BASE
The economic and socio-demographic analysis presented in the General Plan is based on data compiled by the 1980 U.S. Census, the preliminary 1990 U.S. Census, and the State of California Department of Finance (DOF). These data sources were selected due to the extensive and comprehensive nature of the information gathered by the census and the fact that the DOF's population figures are used to determine per capita distribution of State subventions.

CHAPTER
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT



Chapter I Community Development
A.	LAND USE
1.	HISTORIC BACKGROUND
The City of Westlake Village is located on a portion of the former Albertson Ranch, whose cattle-grazing operation on the land ended in the mid 1960s, when construction of Westlake Village commenced. The ranch was a portion of the former El Conejo land grant, whose original boundary line forms the southern and eastern City limits.
Over twenty-six cultural resources have been recorded in the City and within two miles of the City boundaries, including eight aboriginal sites located within the City itself. One of these sites is believed to have been the historic village of Hipuk, which was established around 500 A.D. near the former confluence of several streams at the center of the City. The site was eliminated by the construction of Westlake Lake. An earlier village located just west of the City was probably established more than 5,000 years ago and may be the oldest known village in the area.
American Hawaiian Company developed Westlake Village as a master-planned community, beginning in 1966, with development responsibilities subsequently passing to the Prudential Insurance Company. The community straddles the Los Angeles-Ventura County line (Figure 4), the Ventura County portion of which was incorporated as part of the City of Thousand Oaks in 1968. However, the buildout of the two halves has proceeded in a coordinated and interlinked manner, relatively indifferent to the corporate limit which separates them.
The City of Westlake Village was incorporated on December 11, 1981. Incorporation was supported by more than 80% of those voting on the issue. The primary reason for incorporation was to maintain the high quality of development within the City and to preserve the general pattern of land uses and design standards envisioned in the master plan. Sentiments towards formation of a City with physical limits based on the master plan were intensified by several attempts to include all or part of the City in incorporation movements initiated by the community of Agoura.
2.	EXISTING LAND USE
For the purposes of this discussion, the City's lands can be grouped into two categories: developed and undeveloped. The areas of the City developed with residential, office, light industrial, and commercial uses are likely to remain stable over the long-term; however, some areas are potentially subject to change and/or intensify land use. The undeveloped areas of the City can be further separated into three groups: permanent open space areas; vacant lands which are committed to a use through a development agreement or Final Tract Map recorded with City; and vacant lands which are not committed to particular use.

Chapter I Community Development
Approximately 77 percent of the City's total land area is presently developed or		
committed to preservation as open space (Figure 5).		A detailed tabulation of existing
land uses by acres is presented in Table 1, and is summarized as follows:		
Land Use	Acres	Percent of Total
Open Space	1,332:83	37%
Residential	756.62	21%
Rights-of-Way	350.86	10%
Industrial	175.16	5%

Commercial	84.23	2%
Public/Semi-Public	28.39	1%
Vacant	832.61	23%
	3,596.89	100%
a. DEVELOPED AREAS
Residential Development
The City is divided into 17 neighborhoods which represent a broad mix of residential densities, ranging from lot sizes of almost two acres to developments of more than 23 dwelling units per acre. However, a Citywide average density of 5.65 dwelling units per acre creates an overall appearance of suburban, low-profile development. The 17 neighborhoods are characterized in Table 2 and depicted on Figure 6.
Commercial/Industrial Development
Commercial development represents a small percentage of the City's developed acreage and is somewhat fragmented. Commercial centers are limited to the County Line Center (northwest corner of Agoura and Lakeview Canyon Roads) which contains neighborhood retail and service uses as well as movie theaters; the Landing (north side of Lindero Canyon Road, adjacent to Westlake Lake) which sustains an extensive amount of office space and two restaurants; the Village Center (Village Center Road), which supports a few retail and service businesses; and the North Ranch Gateway shopping center at Thousand Oaks Boulevard and Lindero Canyon Road. The Westlake Inn complex, which consists of a 75-room hotel, restaurant and cafe, represents the only other commercial center within the City. Two service stations, a carwash, and two banks located outside of these centers complete the range of commercial uses, except for a few wholesale outlets located in the business park areas. Most of the commercial uses which serve the daily needs of City residents, such as grocery and department stores, are located in the City of Thousand Oaks and the Ventura County portion of the Westlake Village community.

Chapter I Community Development
The City includes approximately 34 acres of office use, of which State Farm Insurance, with 980 employees, comprises a large part A medical office building is located adjacent to the hospital, and an additional 68,000 square feet of office space is located at the southeast corner of Agoura and Lindero Canyon Roads.
Industrial and business park uses are centered north and south of the Ventura Freeway/Lindero Canyon Road interchange, as well as along the eastern portion of Agoura Road. Major users include Raypak, Inc. which employs 450 persons. Smaller firms are located in business park settings in these areas.
There are a limited number of properties within the City which have been developed with uses, primarily industrial, but now lie vacant with a low likelihood of future use of the site in that capacity. The prime example is the former Unysis site, now owned by the Dole Food Company, located in the northwest quadrant formed by the Lindero Canyon Road and the Ventura Freeway. The industrial buildings on-site have been demolished and the property owners are considering reuse of the site as a possible commercial center or corporate office park.
Commercial recreational areas are developed with tennis courts, the Westlake Golf Course, and the Westlake marina.
Other Uses
Public and semi-public uses include Westlake Medical Center, White Oak Elementary School, four churches, a fire station, and a future City library site.
b. UNDEVELOPED/UNCOMMITTED AREAS
Open Space
Approximately 2,165 acres within the City were undeveloped in 1990. Of this, 62% has been preserved as open space. In fact, 37% of the entire City is currently devoted to open space. Major open space areas include: a 342-acre parcel owned by the Las Virgenes Municipal Water District and located southeast of Westlake Reservoir; approximately 139 acres of dedicated open space north and west of Westlake Canyon Oaks; the 102-acre Decker Canyon open space; Westlake Reservoir; Westlake Lake; Westlake Golf Course; and Valley Oaks Memorial Park (Figure 5).
Uncommitted Vacant Areas
Areas which are undeveloped and subject to change include the 491-acre property surrounding Westlake Reservoir, the 4.44-acre property north of Triunfo Creek, and the vacant City property adjacent to Lindero Canyon and Lakeview Canyon Road (Table 3, Figure 7).

10	491	Site is available for residential development. Plans submitted by property owner are currently being processed. Steep slopes and rock outcroppings exist over much of the property, and a sizable portion of the site lies within the watershed for Westlake Reservoir. Wildlife habitat, access, fire hazard and water quality considerations must also be successfully addressed by development plans for the site.
11	74.5	Site is available for residential development. Plans submitted by property owner are currently being processed. Much of the site is unsuitable for development due to presence of steep slopes and rock outcroppings, as well as its remote location in the Santa Monica Mountains. Biological resource, access and public service concerns must also be resolved in order for the property to be developed.

Committed Vacant Areas
The following areas are currently vacant, but have received development approval or recorded a Final Tract Map: the 129-acre Westlake North Specific Plan area; the 3.59 acre future library site; the 88-acre property south of Westlake Spectrum; vacant parcels in the Westlake Spectrum Business Park; residential parcels in the Southridge Trails, The Trails, and Three Springs subdivisions; the 4.91 acre former stables property; the 74.5 acre site adjacent to Decker Road; and various parcels within the Oak Forest mobile home park (Table 3, Figure 7).
3.	GENERAL DEVELOPMENT POLICIES
The City of Westlake Village is predominantly built out, that is, the majority of vacant land available for development has been developed. While future growth within the City will continue to include some expansion of urban uses into presently undeveloped areas, other development trends and issues can be anticipated. With the escalation of land values and regional growth pressures, the City has witnessed and will continue to experience a trend toward infill and land use intensification within existing neighborhoods and business districts. This trend will bring with it new issues related to land use compatibility and the maintenance of community character and cohesiveness. To address this emerging trend, the City's general development policy has been expanded and refocused.
The General Development Policy map (Figure 8) identifies those areas where the existing type and intensity of land uses will be maintained, areas which are subject to use intensification, presently vacant areas which are generally suitable and available for the expansion of new land uses, and areas which will be preserved for open space and recreational purposes. Policies directed toward Maintenance Areas will encourage the maintenance and preservation of neighborhood quality and character. Policies pertaining to Intensification Areas anticipate and provide for recycling and adaptive reuse of existing development at somewhat greater intensities. Expansion policies permit the conversion of presently vacant land to urban use in a manner that is sensitive to and compatible with the natural and manmade environment. Finally, Open Space policies are intended to protect and enhance existing open space and recreational amenities, and to encourage the preservation of additional areas characterized by important scenic, biotic and other natural values. In sum, the City's general development policies are intended to assure that all future development is compatible with, and compliments existing community character in terms of scale, density and design.

land use designation, permitted density or intensity of use, and specific plan or density bonus overlays. If the City is developed to the maximum potential densities and intensities as shown in the Land Use Map and represented in Table 4, the City shall have an additional 812 dwelling units, 1,687,297 square feet commercial (general commercial, office commercial, and hotel) use, and 1,060,795 square feet of business park/industrial use, and 63,485 square feet of public/semi-public (institutional) use above the 1991 existing land use. The actual buildout figures depend on the specific design of the future development projects. It is anticipated that the acreage devoted to all land use categories listed in Table 1 will increase with the exception of vacant lands.
b.	LAND USE DESIGNATIONS
The General Plan's land use designations broadly define the types of residential, commercial and industrial uses permitted in the various subareas of the City. The mechanism which precisely defines the uses permitted on a particular parcel, within the parameters of the land use plan, is the zoning ordinance. Although one is general and the other specific, the plan and ordinance must be consistent. The following outlines the intent of each land use designation and the types of uses which may be accommodated within each classification. The permitted residential densities and permitted commercial and business park intensities of use are indicated on the Land Use Map, Figure 9.
Residential Designations
•	Low Density (0-4.0 units/acre)
The Low Density designation applies to a predominantly single-family suburban environment with a low overall density. Clustering may be utilized in order to preserve significant natural resources, such as slopes and habitat areas.
•	Medium Density (4.1-7.0 units/acre)
The Medium Density designation applies to neighborhoods of predominantly single-family, detached homes in areas with limited development constraints.
•	Intermediate Density (7.1-10.0 units/acre)
The Intermediate Density designation applies to areas composed largely of attached, single-family townhome or patio home developments. Such developments are normally in a condominium form of ownership, with extensive commonly-owned open space and small private patios or yards.
•	High Density (10.1-18.0 units/acre)
The High Density designation applies to multi-family development in the more central areas of the City, near services, and on arterial streets.

•	Very High Density (18.1-25.0 units/acre)
The Very High Density designation applies to multi-family residential development in the central areas of the City and on arterial streets, and is characterized by multistoried development and smaller units.
•	Mobilehome Residential
The Mobilehome Residential designation applies to areas of existing mobilehome development and to vacant property which represents an infilling of these areas. It is intended that the density of new mobilehome development will be compatible with that of existing development.
Commercial Designations
•	General Commercial
The General Commercial designation is intended to allow for a broad range of commercial services, including office, retail, hotel and entertainment uses. It is intended to be applied in central areas to ensure the viability of commercial centers, reduce vehicle-miles traveled and maintain the low-intensity character of outlying areas.
•	Commercial Recreation
The Commercial Recreation designation is intended to designate centers of recreational activity, such as golf courses, driving ranges, tennis and athletic clubs.
•	Office Commercial
The Office Commercial designation is intended to provide for business and professional office uses which do not engage in the merchandising of products.
Industrial Designations
•	Business Park
The Business Park designation is intended to encourage an attractive environment for office and industrial uses (including high technology and research and development firms) in which building design, lot size and internal circulation are regulated. This designation is intended to be applied near major transportation corridors and in a consolidated pattern in order to reduce industrial traffic on residential streets, provide for the efficient transportation of supplies and employees, reduce conflicts with other land uses and enhance the identity of industrial areas.

Public and Quasi-Public Designations
• Public
The Public designation is intended to apply to uses in public ownership, including administrative offices, police and fire stations, libraries and cultural centers.
•	Schools
The School designation is intended to apply to public schools.
•	Park
The Park designation is intended to apply to publicly and privately owned parks.
•	Institutional
The Institutional designation is intended to apply to quasi-public uses such as religious facilities, private schools and hospitals.
•	Open Space
The Open Space designation is intended to apply to publicly and privately owned land primarily maintained in an unimproved form, such as common open space, lakes, reservoirs, hillside and watershed areas.
•	Cemetery
The Cemetery designation is intended to apply to publicly and privately owned land primarily maintained as cemeteries.
c.	SPECIFIC PLAN OVERLAY
Certain areas of the City have been identified as requiring a specific plan to coordinate architectural and site design with onsite circulation and infrastructure, and to promote neighborhood cohesiveness and compatibility. The specific plan process will enable better site design through a more comprehensive project review. Sites required to develop specific plans are indicated on Figure 9 with "*SP".
d.	SENIOR HOUSING OVERLAY
The area known as the Ridgeford site has a senior housing overlay, as shown on Figure 9. If the site is developed with senior housing units, a density bonus of up to 18.5 units per gross acre will be permitted.
e.	RESOURCE MANAGEMENT OVERLAYS
Certain areas of the City have been identified as containing significant resources for which special consideration is necessary in conjunction with development. These areas are described and depicted on the following pages. To ensure the protection of
City of W estlake Village General plan
1-17
Chapter I Community Development
the appropriate resources, the City has designated various policy overlays for these areas such that specific actions are required upon development of these properties.
Hillside Management Area
The Hillside Management Area Overlay (Figure 10) is intended to further the preservation and maintenance of the natural character and visual amenities of hillsides as a scenic resource, and to afford protection from geologic, fire and other natural hazards. Development of property with this designation must conform to the Hillside Development Standards contained in the zoning ordinance.
Cultural Reconnaissance Area
The Cultural Reconnaissance Area Overlay (Figure 11) is intended to preserve, where feasible, sites of archaeological and historic significance or the information they contain where site preservation is not possible. Biophysical and physiographic features similar to those of areas where cultural resources were previously discovered exist in the unsurveyed portions of the City; therefore, there is a very strong possibility that additional, potentially-significant cultural resource remains lie within the City limits. As part of any development proposal for property located within or adjacent to a designated Cultural Reconnaissance Area, an intensive, systematic surface reconnaissance program conducted by a qualified archaeologist shall be required to identify and evaluate the impact of the proposed development and to recommend measures to mitigate any such impacts.
Flood Hazard Area
The Flood Hazard Area Overlay (Figure 12) is intended to protect development within flood hazard areas identified by the Los Angeles County Flood Control District and limit the impact of flood control improvements on affected properties. Any development proposal for property located within or adjacent to a designated Flood Hazard Area shall be subject to the review and approval of the District.
Watershed Area
The Watershed Area Overlay (Figure 13) is intended to minimize the effects of development on Westlake Reservoir and Triunfo Canyon. As part of any development proposal for property located within a designated Watershed Area, measures shall be incorporated into the project's design to minimize the impacts of runoff, erosion and pollutants on affected water bodies.
Significant Habitat Area
The Significant Habitat Area Overlay is intended to minimize the negative effects of development on the highly-sensitive biological habitats depicted in Figure 33 (Chapter Three). As part of any development proposal for property located within or adjacent to a designated Significant Habitat Area, an analysis by a qualified

IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAMS
The Zoning Ordinance
The principal method for the implementation of a General Plan Land Use Map is the zoning ordinance. Policies and standards which prescribe the types of use permitted, their density/intensity, and design and development characteristics are codified as precise requirements in the ordinance. The authority to zone is inherent in the police power Yy of W estlake Village General Plan
1-37
Chapter I Community Development
delegated to cities by the California State Constitution. The zoning ordinance consists of two basis elements: a) a map which delineates the boundaries of districts, or "land use zones," in which similar and compatible uses developed at similar and compatible standards are to be permitted and b) text which explains the purpose of the zoning district, lists the permitted uses (as a "right" and under special conditions), and defines the standards for development (e.g., minimum lot size, density, height, setbacks, lot coverage, parking requirements, sign design, and so on).
Under State planning and zoning law, the zoning ordinance and map must be consistent with the locally adopted General Plan. The City's ordinance will be reviewed and revised, as necessary, to conform to the policies and provisions of the General Plan.
Building Code
The City shall continue to utilize the Building Code to regulate new construction, adaptive re-use, and building renovations. The Code shall be reviewed to ensure its consistency with the provisions of the General Plan. It shall also be updated periodically to reflect changes in the Uniform Building Code and State legislation. Periodically, the City shall review the Code and update it as necessary to reflect conditions which are unique to the City.
Subdivision Regulations
Subdivision regulation is an exercise of the police power of a city authorized by the State to control the manner in which land is divided. Like the zoning ordinance, it must be consistent with the General Plan. It will be necessary to review the City's subdivision ordinance and amend it as necessary to reflect the land use goals, objectives, policies, and standards.
Development Fees
The City and other governmental agencies currently assess application, capital improvement and other development fees and service costs to new developments on a pro-rated basis. A new development will be assessed fees or service cost based on the anticipated capital improvements and anticipated service demand generated. The City shall periodically review the fees for adequacy and update the fees, if determined necessary.
City of Westlake Village General Plan
1-38
Chapter I Community Development
1-5	Specific Plans
State law (Government Code Section 63450) authorizes cities to adopt Specific Plans for implementing their general plans in designated areas. They are intended to provide more finite specification of the types of uses to be permitted, development standards (setbacks, heights, landscape, architecture, etc.), and circulation and infrastructure improvements. They are most often used to ensure that multiple property owners and developers adhere to a common development plan or ensure that the individual phases of a long-term, multi-phased development project are integrated and cohesive.
Specific Plans can be initiated, by the City or a private developer. Costs for City-initiated Specific Plans are, most often, reimbursed by pro-rata allocation of fees to developers applying for development permits within the Specific Plan area. The City will continue to utilize specific plans as a mechanism for implementing the goals, objectives, and policies of the Land Use Element.
1-6	Development Agreements
Development agreements are authorized by State law to enable a city to enter into a binding contract with a developer which assures the city as to the type, character, and quality of development and additional "benefits" which may be contributed. Such agreements also assure the developer that the necessary development permits will be issued regardless of subsequent changes in regulations.
This ensures that a developer of a multi-phased project who has established financing on conditions negotiated with the city would not be adversely affected by subsequent, more restrictive regulations, other than health and safety regulations. This, in turn, enables the city to exact a higher level of performance, quality, and contributions than would normally accrue through the entitlement process. The City will continue to utilize development agreements, as appropriate, to implement the provisions of the General Plan.
1-7	Development Review
New development and enlargement of existing structures are subject to review according to their adherence with City of Westlake Village standards and regulations and General Plan policy. Projects subject to discretionary review, including those which must receive planned development permits, conditional use permits or variances and are subject to review by the City Council and formal public hearings. Such review is essential to assure the following:
City of Westlake Village General plan
1-39
Chapter I Community Development
a.	adequate and ample opportunity for public review and comment;
b.	appropriate site design and building architecture;
c.	compatibility with adjacent land uses and overall community character; and
d.	identification and appropriate mitigation of potential adverse impacts.
In reviewing the Zoning Ordinance for consistency with the General Plan, the City will re-evaluate these regulations for their adequacy in providing effective public review and comment on proposed development projects. As necessary, the thresholds for review should be revised to reflect the potential impacts of a project based on type of use, size, locations, traffic generated, infrastructure demands, or other appropriate criteria.
Environmental Review
The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires that the environmental effects of a project must be taken into account when considering development proposals. This involves the review of all projects proposed by private groups and individuals or initiated by the City and a determination as to the potential for significantly affecting the City's and region's environmental resources. If an Initial Study identifies potentially significant impacts, an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) generally must be prepared.
The EIR presents an overview of the environmental setting of the project, assesses how that environment will be effected by a project, prescribes changes to the project which must be made to mitigate any impacts found to be significant and adverse, and identifies and evaluates the impacts of any alternatives. The “environment" of Westlake Village to be evaluated consists of the composite of existing physical elements; including natural environmental components (air quality, geology/seismicity, groundwater, etc.) and man-related components (circulation and traffic, infrastructure, public services, etc.). Economic impacts need not be addressed in an EIR, according to CEQA. This does not preclude the preparation of separate “Fiscal" or “Economic" impact analyses.
On completion of a draft EIR, it is made available for public review and comment. At least one public hearing must be conducted on the draft EIR. Comments received must be responded to and addressed in the Final EIR.
City of Westlake Village general plan
1-40
Chapter I Community Development
Environmental review occurs in concert with the development review process. No discretionary permit can be approved without, first, satisfactory completion of the environmental review process. This may involve the preparation of a complete EIR, "Focused" EIR if found that only a limited number of resources may be impacted, "Supplemental" EIR if the project is a revision of an earlier project or time has passed and conditions have changed, or "Negative Declaration" if the project is determined by the City to have no significant effects.
Where mitigation actions are specified during environmental review, a plan ("Mitigation Monitoring Plan") must be prepared which specifies the manner in which the development project will be monitored to assure that these actions were implemented and effective. This plan must be approved by the City in concert with the certification of the EIR.
The City will continue to utilize the environmental review process as an important tool for assuring conformance with the provisions of the General Plan.
Traffic Impact Review
As a component of the environmental review process, or separately, the City shall require the conduct of an analysis defining the traffic impacts and mitigation measures for new development and the adaptive re-use of existing structures.
Projects classified as "regionally-significant," as determined by the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission, shall be subject to review for their impacts on designated regional highways and compliance with the Los Angeles County Congestion Management Plan (CMP), when adopted.
General Plan Monitoring and Update
The City shall review, revise, and update the General Plan periodically. This process will include a) an update of baseline data, analyses, and issues to account for current conditions; b) evaluation of the policies and programs contained in this Plan according to their effectiveness in achieving the Plan's goals and objectives; and c) revision of the policies and programs to increase their effectiveness, where necessary, and to account for current issues and legislation. Public input shall be actively solicited in the update. In addition, the Plan shall be monitored as needed for its effectiveness in addressing defined issues and achieving its goals and objectives.

Inter-Agency Coordination
Development in the City of Westlake Village impacts and is impacted by the actions of adjacent municipal jurisdictions, utility districts (e.g., Southern California Edison Company), school districts, service providers, and "superior" governmental agencies (e.g., County of Los Angeles and the California Department of Transportation). As a consequence, it is essential that the actions of each jurisdiction which impact one another be closely coordinated. Agreements and procedures for coordination need to be continued or established where they do not currently exist. This will become increasingly important as the State of California moves to establish state-wide and regional policy and administrative mechanisms to address the issues of growth (e.g., congestion management, air quality, solid waste, and traffic) which may impact the City's local decision authorities over time.
Among the many and diverse concerns which should be addressed are the following:
a.	Land use compatibility on the City's periphery and interface of streets and traffic; with the Cities of Agoura Hills and Thousand Oaks.
b.	Regional transportation and public transit (California Department of Transportation, Los Angeles County Transportation Commission, Southern California Rapid Transit District and the Thousand Oaks Transit Agency).
c.	Provision and maintenance of other public and quasi-public utilities; (Southern California Gas Company, Las Virgenes Municipal Water District, Southern California Edison Company, and County of Los Angeles Flood Control).
d.	Provision of education services (Las Virgenes Unified School District).
e.	Regional air quality (South Coast Air Quality Management District).
f.	"Fair share" provision of affordable housing units (Southern California Association of Governments and State of California Department of Housing and Community Development).
g.	Provision of social services (County of Los Angeles, State of California, and local service providers).
Capital Improvements Program
The City of Westlake Village maintains a Capital Improvements Program (CIP) which provides for the construction and upgrade of streets, storm drains (not under the responsibility of Los Angeles County
CITY OF W ESTLAKE VILLAGE GENERAL PLAN

Chapter I Community Development
Flood Control), municipal buildings, and other public physical facilities. It defines the specific improvements to be accomplished annually and allocates budget for these. Normally, the CIP is revised no less often than every five years and is subject to approval by the City Council. The CIP will continue to be utilized as a means of implementing applicable provisions of the General Plan.

B.	FISCAL RESOURCES
This section sets forth the basic parameters of future development impact on the fiscal resources of the City of Westlake Village. An important consideration in planning for future land uses is providing for a balance of municipal costs and revenues. This section discusses the City's general fiscal picture and evaluates the fiscal impacts of various development types based on current revenue and expenditure patterns.
1.	CURRENT MUNICIPAL REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES
Based on the City's budget document for fiscal year 1991-1992, tax collections account for 67 percent of the City's General Government revenues. This is 7 percent greater than the level of collections at the time of the last General Plan document review. Intergovernmental transfer payments for County, State, and Federal subventions total approximately 14.9 percent of current revenues. License and permit fee revenue along with charges for current services and interest income make up the remainder of the general governmental revenues with 18.1 percent.
As in fiscal year 1982-83, sales and use taxes represent the most significant source of revenues (37 percent of total general governmental revenue). In fiscal year 1982-83 retail store sales were estimated to account for approximately 40 percent of these revenues. Current estimates place the retail component at 42 percent of total taxable transactions and the remainder attributed to the manufacturing, services and wholesaling categories.1 The City's share of the total property tax revenues collected by the County is determined annually by the cost of County service contracts at service levels negotiated at incorporation. The City's share accounts for 21.7 percent of its annual revenue, up slightly from fiscal year 1982-83.
In addition to taxes, the other most significant source of revenues are subventions from governmental agencies (14.9 percent of total). The principal components of this source are vehicle in-lieu fees (9 percent of total) and gasoline taxes (4.1 percent). It is important to note that subvention revenue from all higher levels of government has been decreasing during the past decade. In 1982, this revenue source accounted for 33 percent of the City's total revenues.
The City's annual operations expenses account for 83 percent of total municipal expenditures, of which 31 percent is spent for law enforcement activities. The remaining expenditures are divided between general government activities (including development services and street maintenance) at 43 percent, special city programs at 4 percent, and parks and recreation at 5 percent. Capital development expenses (paid mostly from current General Fund revenues) make up the remainder at 17 percent.

Chapter I Community Development
2.	CHANGES IN REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES OVER TIME
As cities grow in their population and employment base, their levels of expenditures for various services can change over time as well as the relative proportion of the various revenue categories. Table 5 illustrates these changes in the City of Westlake Village since fiscal year 1982-83.2 In order to make a comparison between years feasible, the annual expenditure and revenue levels have been adjusted for inflation and reported on a per capita basis.
On the expenditure side, total annual per capita expenditures (including capital outlay) have increased by 38 percent in real, inflation-adjusted terms. (During this period, the city's population grew by approximately 15 percent). With the exception of capital outlays (which varies year-by-year depending on need), all municipal expenditure categories have increased substantially on a per capita basis since fiscal year 1982-83. In some cases, this may be due to an overall increase in the cost to provide these services (e.g., public safety); however, in most cases it is due to the city expanding its workforce (presently through contract employment services), and providing additional services (there are now park maintenance and recreation programs which were not in place eight years ago).
Regarding revenues, while the overall per capita revenue take has increased from $479.00 in fiscal year 1983-84 to $522.00 per capita in fiscal year 1990-91, not all revenue categories have experienced real per capita growth. The tax category, which includes property, sales and use and franchise taxes, has remained stable over time at approximately $313.00 per capita. Intergovernmental transfers and subventions has declined by 10 percent per person in real terms. This is due to an overall reduction in real revenue from the state to cities for cigarette taxes and gasoline taxes (real reduction after adjusting for inflation and population growth). Other revenue categories have grown in importance for Westlake Village to make up for the non-growth of tax and subvention revenue. License and permit revenue and charges for current services have both increased. These increases are no doubt due to the recent development activity experienced by the City.
3.	GENERALIZED LAND USE COSTS AND REVENUES
Prior to undertaking the detailed fiscal impact analysis of the various General Plan alternative land use scenarios for the future development of the City, a preliminary analysis of residential and commercial/industrial land use types and their current estimated fiscal impact on the City's annual service provision has been performed. The Fiscal Year 1991-92 Westlake Village Budget document was used to determine current revenue and expenditure levels.

Current Costs to Provide Services and Current Revenues Received From Occupied Land by Type in the City of Westlake Village Fiscal Year 1991-1992
EXPENDITURES		REVENUES	
Commercial and Industrial	Residential	Commercial and Industrial	Residential
$3,666 per acre	$3,066 per acre	$6,437 per acre	$2,137 per acre
$162 per employee	$293 per resident	$284 per employee	$208 per resident
Note: For expenditures, the above values are averages that represent the total cost to service commercial or residential properties divided by the gross acreage or employee/resident units that currently exists within the City.
As can be seen from the above table, land uses that contain business activity make a significantly different claim to public service needs than do residents of the city. Additionally, residential land uses contribute less in the way of local-publicly received revenues than do business oriented land uses.
All commercial (including retail) and industrial uses typically provide an excess of revenues over service costs whether measured on a per acre of land use or a per employee basis. Businesses activity in a city causes a need for increased public safety, public works/street maintenance, general government and to a limited degree, public recreation (park upkeep). Significant regular revenues received from business activity include property taxes, sales and use taxes, franchise fee revenues, and transient occupancy taxes (hotel "bed taxes").
Residential property typically requires a higher degree of service provision and hence, expenditure levels, than is true for commercial property. Residents have need of public safety, public works, recreation and culture and general government services. The effect of this varying level of service needs and fiscal contributions is that business activity typically subsidizes a portion of the actual cost to provide municipal services to residents. Generally, a productive acre of commercial or industrial land will provide a fiscal surplus to the city of $2,771.00. This fiscal surplus helps to equalize the average deficit of $929.00 per acre usually incurred by occupied residential property.
4.	FISCAL IMPACT ANALYSIS
During the General Plan revision process, a formalized land use plan has been developed by the General Plan Advisory Committee (GPAC) to indicate anticipated areas within the City for further development as well as the type and intensity of development to be allowed. The land use plan is, in effect, a "snapshot" of what the City of Westlake Village may be like at full buildout (intensity) of all available land. City of W estlake Village General Plan
1-47
Chapter I Community Development
As part of the General Plan revision process, a computerized impact model which indicates the anticipated tax, fee, and transfer revenues that the City should receive from all incremental development, as well as the expected annual costs to the City to provide municipal services to this new development has been developed. The ideal land use plan will entail a varying mix of different land uses which will (it is hoped) provide an excess of revenues over expenditures.
Assumptions of the Model
The model's budget parameters were developed using the City of Westlake Village Annual Budget for 1991 - 1992, the City's 1990 assessed valuation as reported by the County Office of the Assessor, 1990 Census data and 1992 data from the California Department of Finance.
As noted above, revenue and expenditure effects of new development are different for residential property and commercial/industrial property. These various general land use categories are segmented into different fiscal-burden types for this analysis. It is for this reason that the typical residential development will experience an overall negative fiscal impact to the City.3 Residents are typically the most significant users of public safety and recreational services provided by the municipality. On the other hand, revenues emanating from residential property typically do not cover the city's entire cost of providing such services. This is why a community which seeks fiscal balance should carefully build a suitable supporting infrastructure of various types of commercial businesses which usually return a net fiscal surplus to the city.4 In the analysis, positive as well as negative fiscal impacts are noted and the overall net impact to the City of all development proposed is added for its cumulative effect. Finally, it should be noted that certain economies of scale apply to the provision of municipal services. As a community grows in size, the marginal cost of adding a new resident or employee will be slightly less than the cost of the initial residents or employees to service. The analysis takes these scale effects into account.
In the analysis, both on-going revenues and one-time revenues are considered, however, only annual recurring revenues and expenditures for the various product types are reported here. It is assumed that most one-time revenues are pass-through funds which directly pay for services rendered to the development (e.g., building permit fees, traffic signalization revenues, etc.) Revenue impacts accrue to the City's General and Special Funds. The following revenues and expenditures are considered:
3	Very expensive residential units are usually an exception to this rule. Units with values of $750,000 to $1 million or more usually make up the revenue/expenditure gap by way of a sizable property tax allotment.
4	Commercial businesses include retail, office, services, light industrial, etc.

Finally, it should also be noted that the following analysis only assesses the fiscal impacts of the GPAC-proposed incremental development in the City. It is assumed that once this occurs, the City will be fully built-out. The analysis is, thus, a static picture of this additive development at build-out. Obviously, actual development will occur in stages over many years and, depending upon the market absorption of development types, the City may experience differing fiscal positions until the "ideal" development pattern envisioned by the land use plan is achieved.
The following assumptions are employed in the fiscal analysis:
•	All projected costs are indicated in constant 1992 dollars, unadjusted for inflation.
•	While the analysis presented here indicates a static picture of the community at full buildout, a rate of population and employment growth was assumed in the calculations. The rate at which a community grows will have a impact on its expenditure patterns.
City of W estlake Village General plan
1-49
Chapter I Community Development
Rapidly growing communities find that the cost of providing services to their residents can be quite high in comparison to a community of similar size which is experiencing a slow, but steady increase in population. Since incorporation in 1982, Westlake Village has added new residents at an average annual rate of 1.7 percent. For the initial model run, this same rate of population growth as assumed.5
•	Development assumptions regarding incremental square footage of allowable commercial and industrial development as well as increment number of dwelling units by area are presented in Table 6. It is estimated that the incremental development as determined in the land use plan will result in an additional 2,463 residents6 and 8,394 employees.
Estimates of average 1992 market value for each of the areas of intensified development are presented in Table 7. Value estimates are based on current costs for construction and development (including financing) which approximates the assessed value which the development would provide when it is entered on the local tax rolls at the time of sale. It is anticipated that new residential property will add $276.2 million in assessed valuation and new commercial and industrial development will add $118.1 million in assessed value to the City's total assessed value base (1992 dollars).
•	All municipal service levels will remain constant with today's standards. This analysis assumes that the City will continue utilizing County fire protection services rather than creating a municipal service protection district.
5.	SUMMARY OF FISCAL IMPACTS
The two tables presented below indicate the results of the fiscal impact analysis of the added development proposed by the GPAC land use plan for the City. The analysis’ indicates that the proposed uses should produce a annual surplus of municipal revenues of approximately $1.5 million (in 1992 dollars). Detail tables from the fiscal impact model run are presented in Appendix C of the General Plan.
5	The rate of City growth assumed for the analysis anticipates an average annual population growth of 127 residents and 433 jobs.
6	It is estimated that 19.5 percent of these residents will be children of school-age._

6.	SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
The above results are the product of various assumptions (outlined in Part 4 of this Section) regarding the future development of Westlake Village. These assumptions may differ from what will actually occur in coming years as the City's vacant and underutilized land areas are built out. For this reason, several model runs were performed using differing assumptions in order to illustrate the relative impact of certain factors on the City's annual operating position. The following summarizes the aspects of the model which were altered and the project fiscal impact that resulted:
Varying rates of Employment Absorption
As indicated above, the City's new population and employment which will result from the incremental development is assumed to be absorbed in the local economy at roughly the same pace. The model assumes that full buildout of both residential and commercial/industrial land will take approximately 20 years. In reality, it is more likely that new residential absorption will occur at a greater pace than new employment creation. Because commercial/industrial development is believed to subsidize a portion of residential service demand, it is possible that a significant increase in the residential population over that of the commercial/industrial land uses may overwhelm the City's capacity to continue to provide a constant public service level. In order to test this assumption, a series of alternative
City of W estlake Village Gen er al Plan
1-53
Chapter 1 Community Development
analyses in the fiscal model have been conducted. The following results are noted and illustrated in Figure 14:
• If residential growth occurring in the proposed new dwellings is held constant with the average growth experienced in Westlake Village since incorporation, and the rate of new employment growth is decreased so that employment (e.g., new commercial and industrial development) is added at a slower pace than new residents, the fiscal surplus declines.
If the Population Growth Rate = 1.7% per pear or an average of 129 residents added per pear as a result of new housing development
AND
Employment growth resulting from new commercial development averages less than 500 new jobs per year
THE PROJECTED FISCAL SURPLUS RESULTING FROM NEW DEVELOPMENT WILL DECLINE
The relative impact of this decline can be seen in Figure 14. At present longterm rates of population growth, if the number of new jobs added to the community each year declines, the expected level of fiscal surplus will also decline until the City absorbs all the jobs which the land use plan allows for.
• If residential growth occurring in the proposed new dwellings is faster than that experienced in Westlake Village since incorporation, and the rate of new employment growth is decreased so that employment (e.g., new commercial and industrial development) is added at a slower pace than new residents, the fiscal surplus declines substantially.
If the Population Growth Rate = 3,3% per year or an average of 249 residents added per year as a result of new housing development
AND
Employment growth resulting from new commercial development is slower than population gains
THE PROJECTED FISCAL SURPLUS RESULTING FROM NEW DEVELOPMENT WILL DECLINE
The relative impact of this decline can also be seen in Figure 14. With a faster rate of population growth assumed, the City will experience somewhat higher costs per capita to provide services in the initial years. This effect is seen when comparing the two lines in Figure 14. At the point where both lines indicate 500 jobs added to the City per year, the expected fiscal surplus differs by more than $850,000 between the two scenarios. Faster population growth increases annual expenditure levels. As each of the two lines moves the right side of the

graph, it is apparent that employment absorption which lags substantially behind population absorption in the City will lessen the projected surplus. Thus from a fiscal perspective, it is necessary to encourage commercial development to proceed apace with any future residential construction.

C.	HOUSING
INTRODUCTION
1.	AUTHORIZATION
In 1967, the California Legislature made it mandatory for each county and general law city in the State to include a housing element as part of their adopted general plans. In requiring the preparation of a housing element, Section 65302(c) of the Government Code indicates that the element shall consist of "standards and plans for the improvement of housing and for the provision of adequate sites for housing." This element shall also "make adequate provision for the housing needs of all segments of the community." This legislation further states that housing elements shall be prepared in accordance with guidelines promulgated by the State Department of Housing and Community Development.
The Department of Housing and Community Development initially promulgated guidelines for the preparation of housing elements in 1977. However, these guidelines were subsequently revised and, in 1980, became statutory requirements with the enactment of AB 2853. This legislation also clearly indicates that the guidelines are advisory in nature.
The Housing Element Guidelines, as contained in Title 25 of the California Administrative Code, require that housing elements include: 1) an evaluation of the local housing problem, including an analysis of the capacity of the existing housing supply to provide all economic segments of the community with decent housing; and 2) a housing program consisting of a comprehensive problem solving strategy adopted by the local governing body which both establishes local housing plans, policies and priorities aimed at alleviated unmet needs and remedying the housing problem, and sets forth the course of action which the locality is undertaking and intends to undertake to effectuate the goals, policies and priorities. Given this legislative background, the Housing Element of the Westlake Village General Plan has been prepared in compliance with Section 654302(c) of the Government Code and the Housing Element Guidelines.
2.	PURPOSE AND CONTENT
The Housing Element of the Westlake Village General Plan is an official policy statement of the City regarding the type and amount of housing to be provided in the community. In setting forth local housing policy, this element reflects existing conditions and constraints as well as opportunities for improving and expanding the housing supply. This element addresses four specific aspects of housing in the City of Westlake Village: 1) quantity or supply; 2) quality or condition; 3) affordability; and 4) accessibility.
CITY OF WESTLAKE VILLAGE GENERAL PLAN
1-57
Chapter I Community Development
As is characteristic of all general plan elements, the housing element is comprehensive, long-range and general in nature. The housing element is comprehensive in that it considers all geographic parts of the City, a full range of housing types and lifestyles, and the needs of all economic segments of the community. The element is iong-range since it addresses both immediate concerns and projected housing needs over an extended period of time (i.e., 5 to 20 years into the future). The element is also general in that it discusses policies and program rather than specific projects.
The housing element is intended to serve as a guide for local decision-making bodies when dealing with housing-related issues. These policies contained in this element will be applied by local decision makers when evaluating specific projects. This document is intended to be a dynamic, action-oriented planning tool. As such, it will be periodically reviewed and updated, as necessary, in order to respond to changing conditions within the community.
The housing element is divided into eight (8) major section. The first section of the element is a community profile which discusses both population and housing characteristics. Having documented existing conditions in the community, the potential to develop additional housing in the City is evaluated in the second section of the element.
Housing needs are assessed and identified in the third section of the element. The need for expanding the overall supply of housing, while maintaining the quality of existing housing, is discussed. The housing assistance needs of low- and moderate-income households are identified in this section and the relevancy of the Regional Housing Needs Assessment is addressed. This section is followed by a discussion of the physical, market and governmental constraints to eliminating or reducing identified housing needs.
The fifth section of the element embodies the City's program for addressing local housing needs. Goals, policies, and priorities which give direction to the local housing program and express the desires and aspirations of the community are contained in this section. These general statements, in turn, have been translated into specifications that have been or will be taken to address local housing needs. These actions have been programmed in order to facilitate implementation and progress evaluation. The sixth section discusses the need to periodically review and update the element and the procedures for doing so, while the seventh section evaluates the accomplishments of the past five years. The final section addresses opportunities for conserving energy through housing design and construction.

3.	RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER ELEMENTS AND PLANS
The California Government Code requires internal consistency among the various element of a general plan. Section 653000.5 of the Government Code states that the general plan and the parts and elements thereof shall comprise an integrated and internally consistent and compatible statement of policies.
The land use allocation contained in the Land Use section of the General plan are supportive of the policies and actions set forth herein and will provide adequate sites to accommodate projected new housing construction. Additionally, the Circulation section of the General plan proposes a transportation system which will provide adequate access to work centers, schools, shopping area, and other destinations for both existing and future residents, which other elements of the General Plan relate to environmental quality, the preservation and conservation of natural resources, and public health and safety. As such, the various policies and programs recommended throughout the General Plan were taken into account during the preparation of this housing element.
4.	USE OF RELEVANT AND CURRENT DATA
To properly understand housing, a complete review and analysis of the community's population characteristics and housing stock must be performed. An attempt has been made to use the most current socioeconomic and building data available in the development of the housing element. The primary sources of data are the US Census, 1980 and 1990 reports, and State Department of Finance updates. Where reasonable available, this data ways updated with more current information.
The 1988 Regional Housing Needs Assessment, formulated by the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG), was utilized at the recommendation of the State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD). The 1988 Regional Housing Needs Assessment is the only model prepared by SCAG which disaggregates housing needs amongst all economic segments of the community.
Finally, the data collected by various sources and utilized in the preparation of this document may reflect totals which are not identical. In most respects, the totals are not as significant as the trends illustrated in the data collected. However, where totals of population and housing counts were reported for the same period, they may have been adjusted to be consistent with the most valid source known.

Chapter I Community Development
5.	CITIZEN PARTICIPATION
This housing element was developed through the combined efforts of City staff, a Citizens Advisory Committee, the City Council, and the City's consultant, Willdan Associates. Citizen input was received by means of public meetings held by the Citizens Advisory Committee and public hearings conducted before the City Council. The notices for the public hearings were published hearings were published in a local newspaper and prominently posted at several public buildings within the City.
Attempts were made to involve all segments of the community in the formulation of the updated housing element. In this regard, the composition of the Citizens Advisory Committee, that was formed by the City Council, represented a true cross section of the community. The members of this Committee consisted of both homeowners and renters, including two tenants of the Oak Forest Mobile Home Park, as well as a representative of the local Chamber of Commerce. The committee met on 15 different occasions between March 1989 and March 1990, to discuss the content of this element before recommending is adoption to the Westlake Village City Council. In addition, the goals that serve as the basis for the element were formulated with extensive citizen participation during the preparation of the land use element and initial housing element in the early 1980s.
As part of the overall General Plan Update, the Housing Element was again reviewed to maintain internal consistency with other plan elements, and was revised to reflect the most recent statistical data from the 1990 Census and the State Department of Finance.
COMMUNITY PROFILE
1.	POPULATION AND HOUSEHOLD CHARACTERISTICS
Through the analysis of certain demographic characteristics, population traits can be identified which affect the type of housing needs and the ability of households to pay for adequate housing. This section examines those characteristics of the City's population, which are summarized in Table 8.
a.	POPULATION AND GROWTH TRENDS
The City has experienced moderate growth in recent years, increasing its population by 11.4 percent between 1980 and 1990. This growth rate can be contrasted with County and State figures of 18.5 percent and 49.0 percent, respectively, for the same period. The City's estimated 1990 population of 7,455 represents a minute fraction of the County's population as a whole.

b.	AGE COMPOSITION
Based on the 1990 Census, the City's age composition is generally consistent with the County's and State's profiles, with approximately half of the population being between the ages of 18 and 54. However, the proportion of City population 18 years of age and younger is slightly lower than the County and State levels. The age group 55 years and older is considerably higher than the County's level for this age group.
c.	RACIAL AND ETHNIC COMPOSITION
The racial and ethnic composition of the City, as documented by the 1990 Census, differs from that of the County and State. More than 89 percent of City residents are white, contrasted with 40.8 percent and 57.2 percent for the County and State, respectively. The City's proportion of minority racial population (10.7 percent) is lower than the State's (42.8 percent), as is the percentage of Spanish Americans.
d.	HOUSEHOLD INCOME
The City's median household income was $33,183.00 in 1980. The average household income was $42,468.00.
Since 1980, the income of local residents has increased. While 1980 Census data continues to be the most accurate and complete information regarding household income, the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has estimated that the current median family income in Los Angeles County is $38,000.00. If the ratio of City to County median household income, reported by the 1980 Census, has remained relatively constant over the past eight years, then the current median household income in the City is approximately $70,000.00.
e.	EMPLOYMENT
The 1980 Census indicates that almost three-quarters of the City's working residents were employed in "white collar" occupations, such as professional, technical, executive, administrative, managerial, clerical, and sales positions. The average commuting time to work was about 29 minutes. Only about eight percent of the total work force commuted less than five minutes, meaning the great majority worked outside of the Westlake Village area. While more recent data is not readily available, it can safely be assumed that the majority of working residents work outside of the local community and may endure longer commute times than were experienced in 1980.
With regard to local employment opportunities, a business census conducted by the Westlake Village Chamber of Commerce in 1987, reported a total of 6,712 jobs within the City. The number of employees per business ranged from a single employee to as many as 1,136 employees in the case of Eaton information management systems. The reported second and third largest employers in the
City of Westlake Village General Plan
1-62
Chapter I Community Development
City were State Farm Insurance and Raypak, Inc. with 878 and 330 employees, respectively.
Recent development trends indicate that the number of jobs within the City may increase dramatically in the coming years. New office, commercial and business park projects, approved by the City since 1987, could result in the creation of nearly 6,000 new jobs within Westlake Village. With over 12,000 jobs, the City would become a major employment center within the Russell/Conejo Valley area.
Future job and housing growth is a key policy issue addressed in the Regional Growth Management Plan prepared by the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG). That plan promotes the concept of balancing job growth and housing production within the various sub regions of Southern California as a means of addressing serious air quality and transportation issues. The "Jobs/Housing Balance" concept forwards the idea that if people can live and work within the same community, the Southern California region as whole will benefit from reduced traffic congestion and improved air quality.'
The City of Westlake Village is located within an area identified by SCAG as the Santa Monica Mountain subregion, which also includes the Cities of Agoura Hills, Calabasas, Hidden Hills, Malibu, and all Los Angeles County unincorporated territory west of the City of Los Angeles. While the City of Westlake Village is "job rich" (i.e., has a significantly greater number of jobs than housing units), the same is not so of the subregion. As defined by SCAG, a balanced subregion is one having an employment to housing ratio of 1.2 jobs per dwelling unit. Since the Santa Monica Mountains subregion is identified as "jobs-poor," with a 1984 ratio of 0.62 jobs per dwelling unit, the Regional Growth Management Plan encourages local job growth over continued residential development.
f.	HOUSEHOLD SIZE
The City's average household size of 2.63 persons, in 1990, is smaller than County or State averages. The percentage of three-, four- and five-person households is lower than the State's in each category, accounting for the lower average household size. In 1989, more than half of the City's households had only one or two members, while households with six or more members represented only 5 percent of the total. This distribution is consistent with 1989 Statewide characteristics. Overcrowded households, in 1989, (more than one person per room) represented less than 1 percent of the City's total households, compared with a 7.4 percent State figure.

Chapter I Community Development
2.	HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS
This section describes certain characteristics of the City's housing supply, including type, condition, ownership, vacancy and costs, which are summarized in Table 9.
a.	TYPE AND SUPPLY
The US Census estimated that there were 3,006 dwelling units in the City in 1990.
In 1989, based on the State Department of Finance estimates, single-family units accounted for 85.6 percent of all units; multi-family units represented 8.8 percent of the total. The City contains a single mobile home park, which contained 5.6 percent of the total housing stock in 1990. The percentage of single family units is higher than that for either the State or County in 1990.
The City is comprised of 17 recognized neighborhoods which represent a broad mix of residential densities, ranging from lot sizes of almost two acres to developments of more than 23 dwelling units per acre. The boundaries of these 17 neighborhoods are depicted on Figure 6 while the prevailing density within each neighborhood is shown in Table 2.
h. HOUSING AGE AND CONDITION
As previously noted, the oldest unit in the City's housing stock was constructed in 1966, with approximately 60 percent of the total stock having been constructed between 1966 and 1969. Residential construction has slowed considerably in recent years as City approaches residential build-out.
All units are well maintained, with virtually no exceptions. All of the City's neighborhoods are governed by stringent Codes, Covenants and Restrictions (CC&Rs) which regulate their appearance and activities. Architectural committees oversee all new construction and building alterations, as well as colors and materials. In the case of First Neighborhood, the architectural committee does a "walk-through" twice a year to survey the condition of the neighborhood. The owners of residences or yards which do not conform to the CC&Rs are notified of the conflict. Based on the homeowner's response, the committee may take the necessary action itself and assess the owner for the costs. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that any kind of rehabilitation program will be needed in the City or that any existing units will be replaced in the near future.
c.	TENURE
According to the 1990 Census, over 87 percent of the City's occupied dwelling units were owner-occupied. This level exceeds County and State averages for owner occupancy. Conversely, renter occupied dwelling units represent 13 percent of the City's housing stock. These units consist of mobile home park spaces, condominiums and single-family homes.

management firms indicates that renter occupancy in some condominium developments within the City may be as high as 30 percent.
d.	VACANCY
The residential vacancy rate, a translation of the number of unoccupied housing units on the market, is a good indicator of the balance between housing supply and demand in a community. When the demand for housing exceeds the available supply, the vacancy rate will be low.
The US. Census estimated that 5.85 percent of the housing stock in Westlake Village was vacant in 1990. This is somewhat higher than the County-wide rate of 5.49 percent and somewhat lower than the Statewide vacancy rate of 7.2 percent.
e.	HOUSING VALUES AND COSTS
The City's 1990 median housing value of nearly $416,000 was 175% greater than the median County. The City's median monthly contract rent of $1,000+ also nearly doubles County levels.
Despite the relatively high cost of housing, affordable housing opportunities do exist for both owners and renters within the City. A 1990 appraisal indicates that certain condominium units have recently sold for between $75,000 and $135,000. In addition, rental rates within the City's mobile home park range from approximately $600 to $900 per month. Based on the analyses presented in the Housing Needs section of this Element, as well as the Fair Market Rents established by HUD for the Section 8 Rental Assistance Program, these housing prices and rents are affordable to low and moderate income households.
3.	ANALYSIS OF POTENTIAL HOUSING SITES
This section evaluates the potential development of additional dwelling units which could occur on vacant land under the City's General Plan, as well as through the development of under-utilized sites and surplus land.
a.	VACANT LAND INVENTORY
There were approximately 833 acres of vacant or undeveloped land remaining within the City in early October 1990. This vacant land area represents 23 percent of the City's total land area and is indicative of the fact that the City is rapidly approaching build-out. Moreover, the vast majority of this undeveloped acreage is either undevelopable, due to severe environmental constraints, or is already committed to development as a result of approved development plans and/or agreements. Vacant or undeveloped sites are listed and discussed in Table 3, while their locations are shown on Figure 7.
City of Westlake Village General Plan
1-66
Chapter 1 Community Development
As seen in Table 3, the undeveloped sites designated for residential use in the Westlake Village General Plan are already committed to residential development. Area 10 remains the largest uncommitted parcel in the City.
In addition to the undeveloped acreage that is currently available for residential development, there is vacant, non-residentially designated property in the City. However, all of this land has been committed to commercial/industrial development. Moreover, it is important that the City retain this property for commercial and industrial purposes in order to achieve a proper relationship among land uses consistent with the sub regional jobs/housing balance suggested by SC AG.
b.	UNDERDEVELOPED AND REDEVELOPABLE AREAS
Underdeveloped sites are defined as properties which are developed at less than their designated maximum densities would permit. While no such sites exist within the City, some intensification of development is expected to occur through the construction of second units on lots with existing, single-family dwellings. Due to the recent development of the City, there are no sites which could be redeveloped with residential uses and there are no apparent opportunities for the replacement of existing non-residential uses with residential uses.
c.	SURPLUS LANDS
The City owns three developed park sites, an undeveloped library site and a site for a possible, future civic center. None of these sites, however, are considered to be surplus properties. Similarly, the City is unaware of any State or Federally controlled land which has been identified as surplus and available for acquisition. While the Las Virgenes Unified School District declared approximately 19 acres of land it owned on Foxfield Drive to be surplus several years ago, it is currently being developed with 33 detached single-family homes.
d.	POTENTIAL HOUSING SITES
Based on the preceding analyses, eight sites have been identified that are both available and suitable for future residential development (Figure 15). These sites could accommodate a wide variety of housing types and densities, ranging from large-lot custom homes to high density senior citizen units. The maximum number of dwelling units which could be developed at each site, and the site characteristics that need to be taken into account when formulating development plans for each of these properties, are summarized in Table 10.
A maximum of 741 (812 including 75 senior housing units as a result of a density bonus) units could be added to the City's housing stock under the existing general plan designations for these sites. This represents a 27 percent increase over the City's 1990 housing stock and exceeds the projected number of new housing units

needed within the City by 1994 according to SCAG's Regional Housing Needs Assessment.
4.	HOUSING NEEDS
While Westlake Village residents are generally adequately housed and the local housing stock is in good condition, there are both existing and projected needs that the City must consider in its housing plans. These needs include: 1) housing affordability; 2) households with special housing needs; 3) the provision of an adequate supply of housing; and 4) the City's role in meeting regional housing needs. Each of these subjects are discussed below.
a.	HOUSING ASSISTANCE NEEDS
Information generated by the Southern California Association of Government's (SCAG's) 1988 Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) indicates that a estimated 147 lower income households living in the City need housing assistance. These households, whose incomes are less that 80 percent of the County-wide median income adjusted for household size, are spending more than 30 percent of their monthly income for housing. This leaves a disproportionate share of their monthly income available to purchase other necessities such as food, medicine, and transportation. Moderate and upper income households may, and often do, expend more that 30 percent of their incomes on housing without experiencing hardships. However, this limitation on housing expenditures is critical to lower income households because of the very limited and sometimes fixed nature of their incomes. A breakdown of existing housing assistance needs is presented in Table 11.
As defined by the State Department of Housing and Community Development, a lower income household is a household whose annual income is equal to or less than 80 percent of the County's median household income. Moderate income equals 80 to 120 percent of the County's median household income. While these thresholds vary with household size, the current (1989) upper limits for low and moderate rate income households in the City of Westlake Village are shown in Table 12, based on a median annual income of $38,000 for a family of four.
Federal and State agencies regard 30 percent of gross annual income as a reasonable expenditure for housing. Based on this guideline, the maximum unit price can be estimated which is affordable to these income groups (assuming 10.5 percent interest rate, 30-year fixed rate and a 10 percent down payment). The same approach can be used to determine maximum monthly rents affordable to each group (which is also equal to the maximum monthly payment affordable to purchase a unit). Using this approach, the upper limits of purchase and rental housing affordable to low and moderate income persons in the City of Westlake Village have been determined and are shown in Table 13.

Chapter I Community Development
h HOUSEHOLDS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS
Within the community’s overall estimated housing needs, there are segments of the population that experience special housing needs. These groups include the elderly, the handicapped, female-headed households, and the homeless. Such special needs within the City of Westlake Village are discussed below.
Elderly Households
According to the 1980 Census, nearly 13 percent of the households in the Westlake Village area* had at least one member 65 years of age or older in 1980. Based on the 1990 Census, there are presently 368 elderly households in the City of Westlake Village. Of these households, it is estimated that 85 households are renting while the remaining 283 households own the dwellings that they reside in. The fixed or limited nature of their income poses a special problem with regard to housing affordability for the elderly. This fact is documented by the 1980 Census which reported that 19 elderly persons were living below the Federal poverty level in the Westlake Village area. In addition, the elderly often have special needs in terms of the size, design, and accessibility of housing.
Handicapped Housing
As reported by the 1980 Census, four percent of the population in the Westlake Village area had work disabilities. A somewhat smaller percentage of the population (.02 percent) had public transportation disabilities. Based on the 1990 Census, there are presently 298 persons residing in the City of Westlake Village with work disabilities and 15 persons with public transportation disabilities. While the needs of certain handicapped individuals (i.e., blind, deaf, or experiencing nervous disorders) may be met without special housing accommodations, persons with ambulatory disabilities often require specially designed barrier-free housing.
Large Families
Of the 3,835* households residing in the Westlake Village area in 1980, 15 percent were comprised of 5 or more persons. Based on the 1990 Census, 425 families living in Westlake Village have five or more members. By comparison, only 26 households are estimated to be living in overcrowded conditions, which represents less than one percent of the City's total households. Therefore, it can be concluded that large families living in the City are generally adequately housed.
This area, as defined in the 1980 Census, included the entire City of Westlake Village, as well as a small portion of the neighboring City of Agoura Hills, neither of which were incorporated at the time.
CITY OF WESTLAKE VILLAGE GENERAL PLAN
1-74
Chapter I Community Development
Female-Headed Households
Approximately eight percent of all households residing in the Westlake Village area in 1980 were female-headed households. Based on the 1990 Census, there are presently 226 female-headed households in the City of Westlake Village.
Because they often have limited incomes, female-headed households experience difficulty in finding adequate, affordable housing. In this regard, it is estimated that 24 female-headed households in the City have incomes below the Federally-recognized poverty level.
Farmworker Housing
The California Government Code requires that the City of Westlake Village consider local farmworker housing needs in formulating the housing element of its General Plan. The State Employment Development Department, in Thousand Oaks, has indicated that there are no farmworker households residing in the City of Westlake Village. Recognizing that the City is located in an urbanizing area in which farming operations no longer exist, it is understandable that there is no need for farmworker housing in the City.
Emergency Shelter
Similar to farmworker housing, State law requires that the City address the emergency housing needs of the homeless within the framework of this Element. In attempting to document or identify the needs of the homeless, local social service agencies and churches, the County Sheriff's Department, the County Fire Department and the City Manager's Office were contacted during the preparation of this Element. According to the agencies that were contacted, the requests for emergency housing received from persons in the City of Westlake Village have been minimal. However, one of the churches in the City, the Calvary Community Church, has responded to a need for shelter and other basics of life from individuals who are either "passing through" Westlake Village (about 200 in number over the last five years) or have settled near the City of Westlake Village but not within its corporate limits.
An estimated 30 persons have settled more or less permanently in the Conejo Valley and utilize the services of the Calvary Community Church for basic food, shelter, and job-finding needs. Members of the church who are involved in helping the local homeless fill these needs in a manner that allows these individuals to "help themselves" afford housing. Churches in Westlake Village and elsewhere in the Conejo Valley, in conjunction with the City of Thousand Oaks, are studying the possibility of buying a motel complex in Thousand Oaks to serve as a temporary shelter for the homeless. These organizations have focused their efforts on Thousand Oaks due to a lack of motels or other congregate living facilities in Westlake Village.
City of Westlake Village General Plan
1-75
Chapter I Community Development
Since the input received from the various public and quasi-public agencies that were contacted indicates that there are no chronically homeless persons in the City of Westlake Village, the City has determined that there is no need to identify sites in this element for the development of an emergency shelter or transitional housing. The City will, however, support the efforts of the neighboring City of Thousand Oaks and local churches to establish a shelter for homeless persons who live elsewhere in the Conejo Valley.
5.	ADEQUATE SUPPLY
SCAG periodically prepares housing need estimates for all cities in Southern California. According to estimates prepared by SCAG in 1988, 448 additional housing units will need to be constructed within the City by 1994 in order to accommodate population growth due to: 1) the formation of new households; 2) the immigration of population to Los Angeles County as a whole; and 3) the redistribution of population within the County based upon factors discussed later in this section. In addition to these units, 17 units would need to be constructed in order to achieve at least a 2 percent vacancy rate for single-family dwellings and a 5 percent rate for multi-family units, while 2 replacement dwellings will need to be constructed within the City by 1994. Therefore, a total of 467 residential units will need to be constructed within the City by 1994. This translates into a minimum of 93 housing starts per year between 1989 and 1994. By contrast, 513 residential units were constructed within the City during the 1984-1988 period, or approximately 103 units per year.
The City has allocated sufficient land to accommodate the projected housing need. The Westlake Village General Plan envisions the construction of approximately 741 additional housing units in the City over the life of the plan. This increase is expected to result from residential infilling or the development of currently vacant land. Aside from scattered, individual residential lots, these projected units would be constructed on eight potential development sites as previously described. The locations of these sites are shown on Figure 15.
6.	REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS
The California Government Code clearly indicates that the community to be served by the local housing element shall include the locality's share of the regional housing need. In the case of the City of Westlake Village, its share of the regional housing need is determined by SCAG. While the process of determining each locality's share of regional housing needs has evolved over the years, the most recent estimates are contained in the RHNA prepared in June 1988.
The RHNA has two primary purposes: 1) identification of housing needs; and 2) allocation of fair share of need to every community. The identification of need refers to the number of housing units necessary to house every household at an affordable price and to replace all dilapidated housing units. The fair share CITY OF W ESTLAKE VILLAGE GENERAL PLAN
1-76
Chapter I Community Development
allocation refers to the number of additional households in each income category who should have housing opportunities available in a particular community. The model strives to obtain an equitable distribution of low and moderate income housing throughout the region. Six major criteria are used in determining the fair share for each community:
1.	Market demand for housing.
2.	Employment opportunities.
3.	Availability of suitable sites and public facilities.
4.	Commuting patterns.
5.	Type and tenure of housing needs.
6.	Housing needs of farmworkers.
In addition, an impaction avoidance factor is considered in an attempt to avoid further impaction of jurisdictions with relatively high proportions of lower-income households.
As indicated earlier, SCAG has forecasted the need to house 467 additional households in the City by 1994. Using the methodology outlined above, SCAG has broken this projection down by income category. The distribution of this projected need by income category is shown in Table 14.
7.	CONSTRAINTS ON HOUSING DEVELOPMENT
The production and cost of housing in the City are directly related to the constraints discussed below, which can generally be divided into non-governmental and governmental constraints.
a.	NON-GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
Non-governmental constraints on the provision of housing include the availability of financing, the price of land and the cost of construction. These and other constraints are discussed below.
Financing Costs
The California State-wide Housing Plan states that throughout the 1980s, the prime rate in California, and the United States as a whole, has been high in relation to that of earlier decades. While the prevailing interest rate of 11 percent in June 1989 is low compared to the 1982 peak of 18.8 percent, it is high compared to the levels of 4 and 5 percent recorded in the early 1960s and the rates of less than 7 percent as recently as 1977. The current rate represents a 22 increase over the June 1988 witnessed level of 9 percent. The long-term trend has been for interest rates to increase significantly over time.

As a potential constraint on the maintenance, improvement and development of housing within the City of Westlake Village, the availability of financing, and the cost thereof, to local residents and/or developers was investigated. Representatives of local lending institutions, consisting of both banks and savings and loan establishments, were contacted regarding this matter, with a focus on their efforts to meet the credit needs of the community as required by the Community Reinvestment Act. Based on this investigation, financing is available to all economic segments of the community and at interest rates that are not significantly different than in surrounding areas.
In conclusion, financing costs have been determined to be a potential constraint on the maintenance, improvement, purchase and development of housing within the City.
Construction Costs
The California State-wide Housing Plan reports that direct construction costs have increased dramatically over the last decade. According to the Real Estate Research Council of Southern California, the total cost of the construction of an "average, hypothetical single-family residence" in the Los Angeles area has risen from $57,450 in January 1983 to $69,400 in April 1989. In the year between April 1988 and 1989, there was an increase of $1,600. The cost per square foot has gone from $36.59 in January 1983 to $44.20 in April 1989 (up from $43.16 in April 1988).
According to the Real Estate Research Council, the cost of the construction of an "average, hypothetical three-story frame and stucco apartment house" has gone from $732,500 in January 1983 to $882,400 in April 1989, up from $861,800 in April 1988. The cost per square foot has increased from $30.52 in January 1988 to $36.77 in April 1989 (up from $35.91 in April 1988).
It has been concluded that construction costs represent an actual constraint on the improvement and purchase of housing within the City. This constraint, however, lies largely outside the purview of local government. This actual constraint is further discussed in the Governmental Constraints section of this Element.
Land Costs
Since the mid-1960s, raw land prices have been significantly higher in Southern California than in the rest of the United States. According to the California Statewide Housing Plan, in the year 1966-67, the price per square foot of raw developable land was $3.58 in California versus $1.58 in the Midwest and $1.64 in the Northeast. In the early 1980s, the average cost of developable land in California was nearly $190,000 per acre, compared to $55,000 for the rest of the Country.
Data for the 1980 price of raw land per square foot in 20 metropolitan areas in the U.S., presented in the California State-wide Housing Plan, reveals that the square City of W estlake Village General PlaIq

Chapter I Community Development
foot cost of raw land was highest in Honolulu, Hawaii, at $10.59 per square foot. The next five metropolitan areas with the highest raw land costs were all located in California; Los Angeles-Long Beach (Los Angeles County) was second at $4.48 per square foot and Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario (Riverside and San Bernardino Counties) was sixth at $2.50 per square foot.
The Construction Industry Research Board (CIRB), in compiling housing component cost data for California for selected years from 1970 to 1980, reported that land costs for a single-family home rose from $6,600.00 (21 percent of the total cost) in 1970 to $26,700 (27.8 percent) in 1980. It is estimated that, at present, this figure is now 32 percent.
Recognizing that new tract homes in Westlake Village are selling for $450,000-$650,000, and that custom-built homes are currently starting at $1,000,000, the 32 percent figure identified above would translate into a raw land price of at least, $144,000 per unit. For the most expensive tract homes ($650,000), this figure would be $208,000.
As an example of the land costs associated with custom home construction, in a recent land sales transaction, a 19-acre parcel in Westlake Village sold for $13.75 million. The developer acquired this property for the purpose of building 33 custom homes, each on a lot averaging a little more than half an acre in size. In this case, the land costs averaged $416,677 per residential lot.
In part, land costs reflect the scarcity of developable land within the City, as previously discussed in the Vacant Land Inventory section of this element. Land costs are an actual constraint on the purchase and development of housing within the City that can only be mitigated through subsidization by local government. However, as discussed in the Governmental Constraints section of this element, the City of Westlake Village does not have the financial resources to assist with land write-down.
Rising Housing Values
The continued rise in the values of existing City residences precludes the creation of a local "trickle-down" situation wherein housing becomes affordable due to its age. Indeed, increasing valuations have led to situations in which present homeowners could not now afford to purchase their own homes.
This is reflected throughout Los Angeles County, where home prices have risen dramatically and at a rising rate. Home prices have risen 31 percent from April 1988 to April 1989, compared to 18.6 percent from April 1987 to April 1988, and 12.5 percent from April 1986 to April 1987 (Real Estate Research Council, 1989 First Quarter Real Estate and Construction Report).
City of Westlake Village General Plan
1-80
Chapter I Community Development
The home price index for Los Angeles County reached 630 in April 1989, indicating that, on average, prices here have increased 6.3 times over the 1975 levels. In conclusion, housing values are an actual constraint on the purchase of housing within the City that is beyond the control of local government.
Land Availability/Environmental Constraints
Most of the developable land area within Westlake Village is designated for residential development and the General Plan provides for a wide range of housing types and densities. Much of the residentially-designated land in the City has already been developed with existing residential development having occurred in the areas of the City which have presented the fewest constraints to development. These include the areas with good access, gentle topography, easily available utility service and no natural or man-made hazards. These are the areas best suited for urban development and most able to accommodate higher density residential uses. Many of the large areas designated for residential uses which are yet to be developed contain more constraints than previously developed areas and are not well-suited to many forms of higher density development. As a result, the land use controls for these areas are designed to reflect the constraints presented by topography, poor access, significant ecological areas and other factors and, therefore, only a limited range of densities and housing types are permitted. Only a small amount of the undeveloped or uncommitted land in the City is potentially suitable for multifamily residential development. The constraints presented by many development sites not only limit the number of residential units which can be constructed, but also add to the cost of development.
In the previously developed areas of the City, most residential parcels are developed to their maximum permitted density and very little opportunity for infill development exists. No moratoriums or other interim controls are in effect which restrict the development of residential units.
Land availability is an actual constraint on the development of housing within the City. The availability of land for future residential development is discussed in greater detail under the Vacant Land Inventory and Potential Housing Sites sections of this element.
b.	GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
Potential constraints on the provision of housing which could be attributed to governmental actions include land use controls, development standards, fees, codes, review procedures, and funding limitations. Each potential constraint and its effect on housing is discussed below.
City of Westlake village General Plan
1-81
Chapter I Community Development
Building Codes
The City's building codes are based upon the Uniform Building, Plumbing, Mechanical, and Electrical Codes and are considered to be the minimum necessary to assure protection of the public's health, safety, and welfare. No regulations have been identified which would unnecessarily add to housing costs. Therefore, it has been concluded that local building codes do not represent either a potential or actual constraint on the provision of affordable housing.
Development Review
The development review process in Westlake Village is relatively streamlined compared to that of most cities. Processing times vary according to the complexity of proposed projects and the extent of the environmental review required by State law, but are considered by the City to be reasonable. Layers of review and decisionmaking are minimized in Westlake Village since the City does not have a Planning Commission, Design Review Board, or other reviewing bodies. Only the City Council and staff review proposed projects.
Development Standards
The overall parameters that dictate the location, type and intensity of new development within the City are established by the General Plan. These parameters define the City's development policy which derives from an attempt to balance housing needs with infrastructure capacities and physical environmental considerations. It should be pointed out that this development policy, as expressed through this element of the General Plan, provides for the construction of 65 percent more units than projected by the RHNA.
One of the primary tools for carrying out the intent of the General Plan is the City's Zoning Ordinance. The Westlake Village Zoning Ordinance and the various development standards set forth therein are totally consistent with the parameters and policies established in the General Plan. The ordinance's development standards respond to natural conditions and reflect the resulting development potential as discussed previously in this element. The specific standards contained in the Zoning Ordinance are similar to those of surrounding communities and do not unreasonably add to the cost of development. Therefore, the City's development standards are not seen as a constraint on the provision of affordable housing.
Development and Permit Fees
Development fees include school impact fees, park development fees (consistent with the Quimby Act) and traffic impact fees. Permits fees include planning application and plan check fees.
City of Westlake Village General Plan
1-82
Chapter I Community Development
Legislation enacted by the California electorate and/or legislature has had a direct impact on the development fees charged by governmental agencies. The adoption of Proposition 13 in 1978 resulted in reduced local government income from ad valorem property taxes. As a result of the restrictions on this revenue source, local governments have tended to increase the burden placed on new development to finance infrastructure. This is done through capital improvement fees (impact fees), utility connection fees and other development fees. Legislatively, State Assembly Bill 2926, which was passed on January 1, 1987, allows school districts to charge developers fees of $1.65 per square foot for residential development, and 27 cents per square foot for non-residential development, on an across-the-board basis for school facilities. Prior to the passage of this bill, school districts were required to establish proof that they were "overcrowded" in order to be allowed to charge such fees. The passage of this bill has allowed such fees to be almost universally charged by California school districts.
The fees specifically charged by the City at the time of development include: 1) a traffic signalization and capital improvement fee to contribute towards the future installation of such signals on a citywide basis; 2) an in lieu fee for the acquisition and/or development of public parkland in those cases where land is not dedicated pursuant to the Quimby Act, nor adequate private recreational facilities are provided on-site; and 3) the Arterial System Financing Program Fee to support improvement of the City's major and secondary highway system. Charges assessed by other agencies include a school impact fee assessed by the Las Virgenes Unified School District, in accordance with AB 2926, and meter installation and hook-up fees charged by the Las Virgenes Municipal Water District to help defray the capital costs associated with providing water and sewer services. Although all of the above development fees and charges can be viewed as costs which affect the price of housing, they are not considered excessive or beyond the amount required to cover expenditures.
The City of Westlake Village charges permit fees to cover the costs for the processing and checking of development, building, plumbing, electrical, and grading plans. A recent survey of such fees charged by cities that are similar to Westlake Village (incorporated within the last 10 years and with relatively brisk development activity on an ongoing basis) found that Westlake Village's fees are comparable to and even lower than those charged by similar cities. The comparison of these fees is shown in Table 15.
In conclusion, neither the development nor the permit fees charged by the City are seen to constitute a constraint on the provision of affordable housing.
On and Off-Site Improvement Requirements
As a result of the master-planned nature of the community, most infrastructure, such as streets, storm drains, waterlines, sewer and utility lines are already in place. Therefore, future requirements for the construction of citywide infrastructure will ‘ City of W estlake V illage General Plan

likely be minimal. However, residential development in the hillside areas of the southern section of the City, where there is very little existing infrastructure, will necessitate the extension of local roadways, utilities, drainage systems and other public improvements. Therefore, the provision of needed infrastructure may represent an actual constraint on the development of affordable housing in the more remote hillside areas of the City. Moreover, the ability of the City to assist with these off-site improvement costs has been hampered by the funding limitations imposed by Propositions 13 and 4.
Utilization of State and Federal Assistance Programs
The availability of future government funding for the provision of affordable housing in the City is at best difficult to determine. Federal and State funding for housing programs has dramatically declined in recent years, and their future availability is highly uncertain. The City's ability to use certain housing assistance programs is further hindered by the absence of those population and housing characteristics which would allow it to qualify for participation in such programs. Indices such as the percentage of lower-income residents and the age and level of deterioration of the housing stock are used by the Federal government to determine whether a given community is qualified to participate in its housing and community development programs. The City's housing stock is relatively new and well maintained, and its lower-income population is negligible. Additionally, the City's high housing values result in rents which generally exceed the maximum levels for participation in the Section 8/Housing Voucher Assistance Payments Programs under which the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development pays landlords the difference between what a lower income household can afford (30 percent of its income) and the fair market rent for adequate housing in the private market.
The City does not have a Redevelopment Agency and, therefore, does not have the use of tax increment financing as a funding mechanism for affordable housing. Moreover, it would be inappropriate for the City to consider the formation of a Redevelopment Agency since there is no need for redevelopment (due to the absence of blight) within the community. It has been concluded, therefore, that the availability of Federal and State funding for housing programs is an actual constraint. However, despite the general inapplicability or unavailability of funding under such programs, limited opportunities do exist to use State and Federal funds to provide affordable housing. Some of the most commonly utilized programs are discussed in the appendix to this Element while their applicability to the City of Westlake Village is examined in Table 16.

Section 8 Existing	Local rents generally exceed FMR's for program. Some units in City would qualify, but Countywide demand far in excess of funding availability limits participation by local residents. Availability of assistance depends on efforts and priorities of Los Angeles County Housing Authority.
Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation	Inapplicable due to well-maintained condition of local housing stock.
Section 8 New Construction	Keen competition for limited funds available. Also see comments related to Section 8 Existing.
Section 202	Limited funding and intense competition for available funds. Requires non-profit housing sponsor.	Potential funding source for elderly/handicapped housing on Site D, depending on developer.”
Section 106(b)-Seed Money Loans	Used solely in connection with Section 202 loans. See comments related to Section 202 program.
Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)	Funds may be used for rehabilitation, land write-down and off-site improvement costs, but not for actual construction of new housing. Due to prevailing socio-economic and housing characteristics, City receives nominal funding (less than $30,000) per year. Funds are inadequate to have measurable impact on affordable housing opportunities.
SB 99-Redevelopment Construction Loans	Inapplicable since City has no need or cause for use of redevelopment law.
CHFA-Direct Lending	Overall construction costs, and resulting rents, are deterrent to local use of program. Developers must apply directly to CHFA for loans.
CHFA-HOHI Program	No need for program due to well-maintained condition of housing stock.
California Self-Help Housing	Local land costs are major deterrent to use of program.
Mobile Home Park Assistance	Program is applicable to and is being used in conjunction with conversion of Oak Forest Mobile Home Park to resident ownership.
Emergency Shelter	Needs are adequately being met at this time; no need for program.

Predevelopment Loans	Could possibly be used by non-profit sponsor to cover predevelopment expenses associated with potential elderly/handi-capped housing development on Site D. Eligible expenses are the same as for Section 106, loans which would more likely be used in conjunction with Section 202 loans.
Senior Citizen Shared Housing	Program could be used to provide outreach, referral and placement services to senior citizens interested in shared housing arrangements. Ongoing costs and lack of in-house administrative staff are obstacles to use of program.
Rental Housing Construction	As name implies, program applies to construction of rental housing. Preference of local developers to construct purchase housing is obstacle to use of program, as are local overall construction costs.
Deferred Payment Rehabilitation Loans	No need for program in light of condition of housing stock.
Marks Foran Rehabilitation Loans	No need for program due to well-maintained condition of local housing stock.
AB 1151-Density Bonuses	Applies to all local governments in California. City's Zoning Ordinance provides density bonuses, or other incentives in lieu thereof, for housing developments that meet criteria set forth in California Government Code.
AB 655-Multi-Family Revenue Bonds	City would have to execute Cooperative Agreement in order to make Countywide bond proceeds available locally. However, use of funds depends on developer interest. Rents allowed under program could be deterrent to use by local developers.
Single-Family Mortgage Revenue Bonds	Similar to multi-family bond program, City would have to execute Cooperative Agreement in order to make Countywide bond proceeds available within City. Sale prices allowed under program eliminate new homes from consideration. However, some resale homes within City fall within program limits. Limited applicability.

Jobs/Housing Balance
In response to the requirements of the Federal Clean Air Act, the State of California has formulated a State Implementation Plan (SIP) that sets forth the measures that are necessary to ensure the attainment and maintenance of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) contained in the Act. As a means of carrying out the SIP and ensuring that the NAAQS are attained in the South Coast Air Basin, in which the City of Westlake Village is located, the Southern California Association of Governments and the South Coast Air Quality Management District have adopted a Regional Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP). The AQMP, in turn, requires all jurisdictions within the South Coast Air Basin to revise their General Plans to be consistent with the SIP by January 1, 1992. A local General Plan is consistent with the SIP if the development allowed thereunder is consistent with the jobs/housing balance ratios in the SIP.
As previously discussed, the City of Westlake Village is located within a subregion that SCAG has identified as being "jobs poor", with an employment to housing ratio of 0.62 jobs per dwelling unit. As defined by SCAG, a balanced subregion is one having an employment to housing ratio of 1.2 jobs per dwelling unit. Consequently, the Regional Growth Management Plan encourages local job growth over continued residential development in the Santa Monica Mountain subregion, within which the City of Westlake Village is one of the major employment centers. Therefore, adherence to the jobs/housing balance ratios in the SIP represents an actual constraint on the expansion of housing opportunities within the City.
8.	POLICIES AND PROGRAMS
The City's housing goals and policies are implemented through its housing program, which sets forth actions the City intends to take through the administration of land use and development controls, the provision of regulatory concessions and incentives, and the utilization of appropriate Federal and State financing and subsidy programs when available.
As discussed in previous housing sections, it is apparent that essentially all of the City's residents are presently sheltered in recently constructed and sound housing, located in attractive surroundings. Therefore, the greatest concerns regarding existing housing conditions are related to preserving the present environment.
Recognizing the potential and actual constraints on the City's ability to provide affordable housing, the City's housing program is primarily oriented towards those measures which can be accomplished at the local level.

potential funding, and schedule for each action is discussed. The anticipated accomplishments have been quantified where possible.
As seen in this table, the potential housing sites identified in the Element could accommodate the construction of as many as 870 additional housing units. Of the 870 units, some would be affordable to low and moderate income households. It is not possible to predict how many of these units would be affordable to households in each specific income category (i.e., moderate, low and very low) due to uncertainties regarding funding sources and the economic feasibility of specific levels of housing, subsidies for projected residential developments.
By comparison, the RHNA projects a need for 160 additional units affordable to low and moderate income households by 1994. Therefore, the programs to be undertaken by the City will meet 56 percent of the projected need. This represents an ambitious effort to address the RHNA forecasts, particularly in light of the numerous prevailing constraints that were previously discussed.
With regard to existing housing need, the only manner in which this need can be addressed is through the provision of rental assistance. As previously mentioned, the RHNA estimates that there are 147 lower income households in need of rental assistance within the City. Recognizing that the rental assistance funds that are available are very limited and intensely competed for (see Appendix D for a discussion of potential funding mechanisms), the City can realistically expect to meet only a fraction of this need and, then, only with the cooperation and assistance of the Los Angeles County Housing Authority. According to the County Housing Authority, the maximum number of lower income households likely to receive rental assistance in Westlake Village over the next five years would be five households per year, or a total of 25 households. In conclusion, the City will produce the maximum number of affordable housing units that is feasible over the next five years in light of the fiscal, environmental, land supply and other nongovernmental constraints outlined in this element. The programs that will be used to create affordable housing opportunities and estimates for the anticipated accomplishments under each program are summarized in Table 18.
a.	PRIORITIES
As previously indicated, the ability of the City of Westlake Village to affect local housing needs is limited by the resources available for this purpose. These resources include land, enabling legislation, political leverage or housing expertise, and funding. Local governments in particular are constrained by the availability of funding for housing-related activities.

Chapter I Community Development
In order that available resources are used most effectively, thereby maximizing the benefits derived therefrom, a prioritization of local housing needs is essential as a guide in distributing those resources. Therefore, where conflict may arise in the implementation of the housing program set forth herein, the City shall allocate its limited resources on the basis of the following priorities:
Priority 1 - Expansion of the local housing supply in terms of both market-rate and affordable housing.
Priority 2 - Preservation of existing affordable housing opportunities.
Priority 3 - Maintenance and improvement of the existing housing stock.
9.	UPDATE ANALYSIS
As part of the periodic review of the housing element, each local government is required to evaluate its progress toward achieving the goals contained in the previous five-year housing element. This evaluation should include a discussion of the following: 1) the effectiveness of the housing element in the attainment of the State housing goal; 2) an analysis of the significant differences between what was projected and what was achieved; and 3) a description of how the goals, objectives, policies and programs of updated element incorporate what has been learned from the results of the previous element.
While various housing needs and/or problems continue to persist within the community, the City has made progress toward the attainment of the goals stated in its initial housing element adopted in 1982. The actions that have been taken by the City Council during the intervening years have expanded the supply and improved the quality of housing within the community.
Since the objectives contained in the City's initial housing element were unquantified, it is impossible to measure the degree to which they have been attained. However, during the 1984-1988 period, 513 new residential units were constructed within the City. Of these units, 365 are single family homes and 148 are residential condominiums. Due to financial and other nongovernmental constraints, none of these dwelling units were affordable housing. The general locations of these units are shown in Figure 16.
In addition to these units constructed over the 1984-1988 period, 147 units were under construction at the time of the preparation of this document, but not completed and ready for occupancy. Therefore, these units were not included in the inventory of existing units. Instead, these units are accounted for in the Housing Program section of the element.

The goals, objectives, and policies of the updated housing element, like the previous housing element, represent realistic, attainable housing goals based on the City's existing personnel, financial resources, and development opportunities.
10.	REVIEW AND UPDATE
In order to maintain the housing element as a viable, working document, it must be reviewed and updated periodically. Periodic review will allow the City to evaluate the progress made toward the attainment of established housing goals. It will also provide the City with an opportunity to adjust programs to respond to changing needs and/or fiscal conditions within the community. The Housing Action Plan has been structured so as to facilitate performance evaluation.
The housing element will be updated as need dictates. In addition to this periodic updating, the City will annually review and evaluate the effectiveness of its housing programs in accomplishing established goals and policies. This review will be conducted in conjunction with the preparation of the City's annual Community Development Block Grant application and specifically the Housing Assistance Plan component thereof. Opportunities for local residents to participate in the periodic review and updating of the housing element will continue to be provided through advertised meetings and/or hearings before the and City Council.
In preparing this updated element, the City did re-examine the goals and policies that give direction to the City's housing programs, as well as the progress that has been made toward their attainment. As previously stated, the housing goals that were adopted by the City Council in 1983 are responsive to the State housing goals and continue to reflect the desires and aspirations of the community. Hence, through the adoption of this updated element, the City of Westlake Village has reaffirmed its commitment to these goals, which are as follows:
•	To provide a safe, stable and pleasant living environment for City residents.
•	To fulfill the City's local housing needs and its share of regional housing needs to the maximum feasible extent.
•	To preserve the high quality of the City's existing housing stock and residential environment.
11.	OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENERGY CONSERVATION
As non-renewable energy resources have been progressively depleted and energy costs continue to rise, homeowners have become increasingly aware of energy conserving measures primarily as a means to offset and control the rising costs of fuel. While the use of alternative energy sources is most advantageous in developing new housing, there are numerous energy conserving measures which
Cl TY OF W ESTLAKE VILLAGE GENERAL PLAN
1-104
Chapter I Community Development
can be retrofitted onto existing and older housing which conserve the use of nonrenewable fuels arid save money. Some of the most readily available and feasible measures are briefly described below. In addition, energy conserving fixtures for new and existing units and energy conservation measures for residents are presented in Tables 19 and 20, at the end of this section. Southern California Gas Company (SCG) and Southern California Edison (SCE) offer rebate programs for residents and businesses who implement energy conservation recommendation. Details pertaining to SCG and SCE energy conservation rebates are provided by the individual purveyors.
a.	INSULATION AND WEATHERPROOFING
Most homes in Westlake Village were built within the past twenty-five years, so there are few homes within the City that were constructed during times when there was little concern for the use of electricity, oil and natural gas for heating purposes. However, to conserve the heat generated by older heating units and minimize the heat loss ratio, the earlier-built homes in Westlake Village can be insulated in the attic space and exterior walls. Windows and exterior doors, in these less recent homes, can be fitted with air-tight devices, caulking, or other means to maximize heating and cooling efforts.
b.	NATURAL LIGHTING
Daytime interior lighting costs can be significantly reduced or eliminated with the use of properly designed and located skylights. Skylights can be easily installed at reasonable expense in existing houses, thereby substantially reducing electricity costs and energy consumption.
c.	SOLAR ENERGY
Solar energy is a practical, cost effective, and environmentally sound way to heat and cool a home. In California, with its plentiful year-round sunshine, the potential uses of solar energy are numerous. With proper building designs, this resource provides for cooling in the summer and heating in the winter; it can also heat water for domestic use and swimming pools and generate electricity.
Unlike oil or natural gas, solar energy is an unlimited resource which will always be available. Once a solar system is installed, the only additional costs are for the maintenance or replacement of the system itself. The user is not subject to unpredictable fuel price increases. Moreover, solar energy can be utilized without any serious safety or environmental concerns.
Solar heating and cooling systems are of three general types: passive, active, or a combination thereof. In passive solar systems, the building structure itself is designed to collect the sun's energy, then store and circulate the resulting heat similar to a green house. Passive buildings are typically designed with a southerly orientation to maximize solar exposure, and constructed with dense materials such ClTY OF W ESTLAKE VILLAGE GENERAL PLAN

as concrete or adobe to better absorb the heat. Properly placed windows and overhanging eaves also contribute to keeping a house cool.
Active systems collect and store solar energy in panels attached to the exterior of a house. This type of system utilizes mechanical fans or pumps to circulate the warm/cool air, while heated water can flow directly into a home's hot water system.
Although passive systems generally maximize use of the sun's energy and are less costly to install, active systems have greater potential application to both cool and heat the house and provide hot water. This may mean lower energy costs for Westlake Village residents presently dependent on conventional fuels. The City should also encourage the use of passive solar systems in new residential construction to improve energy efficiency for its citizens.
d.	WATER CONSERVATION
Simple water conservation techniques can save a family thousands of gallons of water per year, plus many dollars in water and associated energy consumption costs. Many plumbing products are now available which eliminate unnecessary water waste by restricting the volume of water flow from faucets, shower heads, and toilets. The use of plant materials in residential landscaping that are well adapted to the climate in the Westlake Village area can also measurably contribute to water conservation by reducing the need for irrigation, much of which is often lost through evaporation.
A family can also save water by simply fixing dripping faucets and using water more conservatively. In addition, such conservation practices save on gas and electricity needed to heat water and the sewage system facilities needed to treat it. By encouraging residents to conserve water and retrofit existing plumbing fixtures with water saving devices, the City can greatly reduce its water consumption needs and expenses.
e.	ENERGY AUDITS
The Southern California Edison Company provides energy audits to local residents on request. Many citizens are not aware of this program. The City can aid in expanding this program by supplying the public with pertinent information regarding the process including the appropriate contacts. Energy audits are extremely valuable in pinpointing specific areas in residences which are responsible for energy losses. The inspections also result in specific recommendations to remedy energy inefficiency.
f.	NEW CONSTRUCTION
The City of Westlake Village will continue to require the incorporation of energy conserving appliances, fixtures, and other devices into the design of new residential units. The City will also continue to review new subdivisions to ensure that each City of W estlake village General plan
1-110
Chapter I Community Development
lot optimizes proper solar access and orientation to the extent possible. Additionally, the City should consider enacting an ordinance that prohibits property owners from obstructing the solar access of their neighbors. Two State laws enacted in 1978 (the Solar Rights Act and the Solar Shade Control Act) offer a variety of methods to preserve solar access. However, to date there has been no local enactment of this State enabling legislation.

INFRASTRUCTURE & COMMUNITY SERVICES
Chapter II Infrastructure and Community Services
A.	CIRCULATION
This section contains policies and measures directed at providing for the efficient movement of people, goods and services throughout the City in a manner which minimizes the effects of traffic on City residents. In addition to accommodating the private automobile, provisions are made for alternative modes of transportation, such as bus and bicycle. The projections and analyses in this chapter have considered traffic associated with build-out of the City and traffic contributed to the City's circulation system by outside sources.
1.	EXISTING CIRCULATION SYSTEM
Characteristic of all infrastructure systems which were designated to serve the ultimate needs of the City, its established circulation network currently provides for a high level of service. Six arterials serve as the major means of movement to businesses, employment centers, neighborhoods and the Ventura Freeway. Direct access to residences is generally provided by gently-winding two-lane roadways. The eight-lane freeway is oriented in a roughly east-west direction through the City, and functions as the major travel corridor to the Los Angeles metropolitan area to the east, and Ventura County to the west.
Streets are well maintained and show few signs of deterioration. Significant portions of the City's arterials have landscaped medians which are presently planted. Many of the local streets and arterials are characterized by an attractive tree-lined appearance.
a.	CITY ARTERIALS
The City's six arterials are depicted on Figure 17. The characteristics of each are shown in Table 21 and described below. Traffic volumes (1990) are set forth in Table 22 and Figure 18.
•	Thousand Oaks Boulevard - This major highway has historically served as the focus of commercial activities in the area and functioned as the region’s primary traffic route prior to completion of the Ventura Freeway, which it parallels on the north. The boulevard presently extends approximately eight miles from Moorpark Road (City of Thousand Oaks) to Kanan Road (City of Agoura Hills). Current traffic volumes are moderate and are primarily attributed to the City's Westlake Canyon Oaks neighborhood, the Lake Lindero neighborhood of the City of Agoura Hills, and the business park and shopping center which it borders on the north and south, respectively.
•	Via Colinas - This roadway has been constructed to secondary highway standards. It is primarily used by the surrounding business park and as a connection between Thousand Oaks Boulevard and Lindero Canyon Road.

Chapter II Infrastructure and Community Services
•	Agoura Road - This major highway serves as a major traffic corridor for the master planned community of Westlake Village (both the Cities of Thousand Oaks and Westlake Village). A significant portion of the community's commercial and industrial activities center on this arterial, which parallels the Ventura Freeway on the south. It is also used by residents of both cities to access the freeway. After passing through the City, Agoura Road continues to the east through the City of Agoura Hills. Present traffic flows are moderate.
•	Lakeview Canyon Road - This secondary highway functions primarily as access to residences within the City and to Westlake Community Hospital and as a link between Agoura Road and Lindero Canyon Road. Current traffic flows are low south of Watergate Road and moderate north of Watergate Road. A frontage road parallels Lakeview Canyon Road between Watergate and Lindero Canyon Road to provide internal circulation for the adjacent neighborhood.
•	Triunfo Canyon Road - This major highway mainly serves residences in the area and provides freeway access via Lindero Canyon Road and Westlake Boulevard. Existing traffic volumes are low. A frontage road parallels Triunfo Canyon Road between Mainsail and Capstan Circles to provide internal circulation for the adjacent neighborhood. The paved roadway presently terminates within the City just east of Lindero Canyon Road.
•	Lindero Canyon Road - This major highway provides the City's only direct connection to the freeway and serves as a major traffic corridor for traffic associated with local residences, traffic related to business parks north and south of the freeway, and traffic related to the residential areas north of the City of Westlake Village in the City of Thousand Oaks and the County of Ventura. Lindero Canyon Road currently extends southerly from just north of Kanan Road in the City of Thousand Oaks and terminates at Triunfo Canyon Road. Present traffic volumes range from moderate levels north of Via Colinas and south of Agoura Road to heavy levels between Via Colinas and Agoura Road.
h LOCAL STREETS
Local, residential streets generally range from 36 to 64 feet in width. Many of the City's single-family homes are located on cul-de-sacs and are thereby protected from the hazards and noise of through traffic. Most multi-family development is served by private, internal streets.

c.	TRAFFIC CONTROLS
Twelve traffic signals are located within the City at the following intersections:
1.	Thousand Oaks Boulevard/Via Colinas
2.	Thousand Oaks Boulevard/Lindero Canyon Road
3.	Thousand Oaks Boulevard/Gateway Shopping Center Entrance
4.	Lindero Canyon Road/Via Colinas
5.	Lindero Canyon Road/Northbound Ventura Freeway Off-Ramp
6.	Lindero Canyon Road/Southbound Ventura Freeway Off-Ramp
7.	Agoura Road/Lakeview Canyon Road
8.	Agoura Road/Lindero Canyon Road
9.	Agoura Road/Park Terrace Drive
10.	Lindero Canyon Road/Lakeview Canyon Road
11.	Triunfo Canyon Road/Three Springs Drive
12.	Triunfo Canyon Road/Lindero Canyon Road
Other arterial/side street intersections are currently controlled by stop signs.
d.	TRUCK TRAFFIC
The City presently has relatively small volumes of truck movements and, except for direct deliveries of residential goods, most of these flows are between commercial and industrial establishments and the Freeway. This condition is expected to continue into the future.
e.	PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION
Public transportation at present consists of a dial-a-ride taxi service for handicapped and seniors funded by Proposition A proceeds and bus service provided by the Southern California Rapid Transit District (SCRTD). Two lines, Numbers 161 and 423, now operate via Agoura Road, Lindero Canyon Road, Lakeview Canyon Road, and Thousand Oaks Boulevard. Thousand Oaks Transit service (Route 4) also touches the City at the intersection of Lakeview Canyon and Agoura Roads; therefore, inter-company transfers are possible. These transit routes are shown on Figure 19.
The SCRTD Line 423 service consists of three buses inbound to downtown Los Angeles on normal weekday mornings and four outbound buses in the afternoons. These trips require approximately one and one-half hours. The Line 161 service is between Westlake Village and Canoga Park and essentially is an hourly service between 6:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. on weekdays only. The buses assigned to both these SCRTD routes are accessible to the handicapped. The Thousand Oaks Transit service passes the intersection of Lakeview Canyon Road and Agoura Road eight times a day, two in each of the peak periods of flow and four mid-day.

Chapter II Infrastructure and Community Services
f.	BIKEWAYS
Bikeways are classified and defined in three categories -- bike paths (Class I) are separate pathways completely separated from the traveled roadways, typically used in major parks or along streambeds; bike lanes (Class II) are delineated lanes on the street system designated for bicycle use only; and bike routes (Class III) are signed routes only along the public street system.
As shown on Figure 19, Class II bikeways are provided along most of the City's major streets. Where appropriate and/or necessary, Class II bikeways may be replaced with Class I bikeways in the future as vehicular traffic volumes increase.
g.	PARKING
Off-street parking has been provided throughout the City as part of each development project, therefore, no parking problems are apparent. In multi-family residential areas, guest parking is available in addition to private assigned spaces. On-street parking along arterials is generally prohibited.
h.	PEDESTRIAN ACCESS
Pedestrian access is generally well accommodated within the City. Sidewalks are provided on one side of most arterials, separated from the road by a parkway. Single-family detached development is usually served by sidewalks immediately adjacent to the curb on both sides of the street; however, sidewalks do not exist in some custom home areas of the City. Pedestrian access within multi-family development is provided by paths which meander throughout each project.
i.	SERVICE LEVELS
Most City arterials currently operate under free flow conditions, well within their capacities. Some congestion is experienced during brief portions of peak hours at the Lindero Canyon Road intersections with Agoura Road, Route 101 Freeway offramps, Via Colinas, and Thousand Oaks Boulevard.
2.	FUTURE TRAVEL DEMANDS
As future development occurs both within the City's boundaries and in external areas, traffic moving to and from this new or expanded development will increase. Therefore, consideration must be given to projecting future traffic flows in relation to needed roadway improvements if future travel conditions are to be maintained in a satisfactory manner.
CITY OF WESTLAKE VILLAGE GENERAL PLAN

Chapter II Infrastructure and Community Services
a.	TRAVEL PROJECTIONS
Although most of the City's usable land area has been developed, build-out is expected to result in approximately 1,050 additional dwelling units, 358 new hotel rooms, 2,227,200 added square feet of commercial/industrial area and absorption of 302,400 square feet of vacant buildings*- The development projections by location for the City of Westlake Village are presented in Table 23 and depicted on Figure 20. Table 10 additionally estimates the amount of estimated daily traffic volumes expected to be generated by each area. The greatest number of additional trips would be generated by development of Location 11 with nearly 27,500 trips per day expected. The next largest generator would be Location 9 with about 4,700 trips per day.
The projected daily traffic volumes from each location have been assigned to the existing street system to determine future traffic volumes on each major street. To avoid double counting of local trips, the total number of projected trips was discounted by 15%. (The Los Angeles Regional Transportation Study indicates that between 13 to 18% of all trips are local in nature, that is, to schools, parks, shopping centers, social activities, etc.) Traffic volumes associated with shopping centers and restaurants were discounted by an additional 20% to account for pass-by trips. The discount factors applied to large mixed-use developments were determined on an individual basis.
Cumulative projects located near the City of Westlake Village in the City of Thousand Oaks, City of Agoura Hills, or County of Ventura were also evaluated in order to estimate traffic volumes associated with developments located outside of the City limits. Additionally, in order to account for normal growth in traffic, a 0,5% per year increase in existing traffic was applied through the year 2010. Assignment of the resulting traffic volumes was accomplished on the basis of type of use, location, and the freeway orientation of uses. A composite future travel projections map is presented in Figure 21.
In large part, the residential elements of the community are oriented to the freeway and to major commercial and recreation facilities. The residential community serves primarily as a bedroom community to the Los Angeles metropolitan area and therefore displays a heavy freeway orientation with major directional travel movements to and from the east. However, a significant portion of directional travel movements are also oriented to and from the west toward cities within Ventura County. Future residential development can be expected to continue this orientation.
* For purposes of the circulation element, buildout assumptions include all new development projected to occur after the establishment of baseline traffic conditions reflecting 1990 citywide traffic counts. While these assumptions provide a conservative basis for estimating future travel demand, buildout figures set forth on Table 4 of the Land Use Element are more recent and are a more reliable indicator of future growth within the City. _________________________

Chapter II Infrastructure and Community Services
The proposed commercial and industrial locations will be expected to attract trips to and from the surrounding residential community as well as from more distant residential centers. In the case of Location 11, projected to consist primarily of community and sub-regional commercial and business park uses, the travel patterns will have a high freeway orientation. Other commercial sites supporting neighborhood commercial uses would exhibit a more local pattern.
As shown in Table 22, traffic volumes are expected to increase most significantly on Lindero Canyon road due to the fact that a substantial portion of future trips will utilize this corridor to access the freeway and Agoura Road. Because Lindero Canyon Road extends northerly into the City of Thousand Oaks and Ventura County, additional external traffic from the Oak Park/North Ranch area will also contribute approximately 7,000 vehicles per day to Lindero Canyon Road north of Thousand Oaks Boulevard. About 6,000 of these vehicles are expected to use Lindero Canyon Road between Thousand Oaks Boulevard and the freeway.
b.	FUTURE TRAVEL CONDITIONS
The existing street system, for the most part, should be adequate to carry the anticipated future traffic volumes. Two primary improvements will be required involving the widening of Lindero Canyon Road from Agoura Road to Thousand Oaks Boulevard and the extension of La Tienda Road from Via Rocas to Lindero Canyon Road. Additionally, Via Colinas should be restriped to provide four travel lanes. One proposed traffic signal location is also expected (see following section).
The term Level of Service (LOS) is generally used to define the quality of traffic flow over specific street or road segments or through individual intersections. LOS's express relationships between the volumes of present or anticipated traffic and the ability of road networks to carry them. For planning purposes, comparisons of volumes to capacities for road segments are generally used rather than those for intersections. This is due to the fact that the calculation of intersection LOS's requires detailed data regarding the numbers of vehicles moving on each intersection approach and the percentages of these vehicles making turning movements, which is seldom known for future travel conditions. A description of the six standard levels of service for road segments is shown in Table 24, along with the roadway capacities for each level of service.
It is the City standard to require Level of Service "C" or better to be maintained throughout the City circulation system. Due to the unique nature of Lindero Canyon Road, Level of Service "D" or better will be acceptable within the portion of the Lindero Canyon Road corridor that extends from Via Colinas to Agoura Road.
Based on the level of service definitions and roadway levels of service, the estimated future LOS's on various segments of the City's major streets can be calculated and are shown in Table 22. Note that the LOS's for future conditions are City of Westlake village General plan

based on roadway geometries that include recommended roadway improvements. As indicated in Table 22, most roadway segments are expected to operate with satisfactory travel conditions, with no roadways expected to experience severe congestion if the improvements recommended below are implemented.
c.	STREET STANDARDS
The design of future street improvements will be guided by the standards contained in Table 21 and the street cross sections shown in Figure 22. The actual design details of future streets will also depend on anticipated volumes and the existing circulation pattern. The typical rights-of-way and paved roadway requirements for each street classification are summarized below:
Street Classification	Right-of-Wav	Roadwav
Local	50-60 ft.	30-36 ft.
Collector	60-64 ft.	40-44 ft.
Secondary Highway	84 ft.	68 ft.
Major Highway	100-108 ft.	84-88 ft.
The function of each type of street can be described as follows:
Local - Local streets are the smallest in the hierarchy of roadway classifications. They are designed to serve individual projects or neighborhoods.
Collector - Collector streets connect local streets to secondary highways or major highways. Several areas or neighborhoods may be accessed by a collector street.
Secondary Highway - Secondary highways represent the smallest of the arterial highway classifications. They carry traffic around the perimeters of major urban development units. They generally provide four travel lanes and a parallel parking lane on each side. These roadways are usually "through" streets enabling traffic to easily cross large areas of the City. Individual lot access is generally restricted from secondary highways.
Major Highway - Major highways are designed to carry high traffic volumes and provide connections between population and employment centers.
d.	PROJECTED IMPROVEMENTS TO EXISTING ROADWAYS
In order to accommodate the levels of traffic expected to occur at build-out in an acceptable manner, improvements will be needed in certain areas of the City's circulation system (see Figure 23). The improvements discussed in this section are based on the land use projections shown in Table 23 and the methodology described in the traffic projections section; the traffic impacts associated with actual development proposals should be evaluated at the project level to determine the timing and design of specific improvements.

Chapter II Infrastructure and Community Services
In order to accommodate anticipated volumes, it appears that the widening of Lindero Canyon Road from four to six lanes will be required between Cardoza Drive and Via Colinas. It also appears that the widening of Lindero Canyon Road from six to eight lanes will be required between Agoura Road and Via Colinas. These improvements may be accomplished through widening of the freeway bridge, narrowing of the landscaped median or parkways, restriping and/or the acquisition of additional right-of-way. The level of service projected for these segments will be LOS "B"-"C" between Cardoza Drive and Via Colinas, and LOS	between Via
Colinas and Agoura Road.
In addition to the above roadway improvements, it is anticipated that a new traffic signal will be required on Lindero Canyon Road at a location between Via Colinas and Thousand Oaks Boulevard. The specific location for this signal will depend upon the development plan for Location 11 (Westlake North). To the maximum extent possible, it should be located approximately mid-way between Via Colinas and Thousand Oaks Boulevard. Existing stop signs should provide adequate control at the City's other presently non-signalized intersections. Lane configuration revisions and additional prohibitions of on-street parking, however, will be required as traffic volumes increase at both signalized and non-signalized intersections.
It is also anticipated that increasing traffic volumes may ultimately require dual left-turn lane capability and separate right-turn lanes at major intersections along Lindero Canyon Road, namely, Thousand Oaks Boulevard, the access signal to Location 11, Via Colinas, the eastbound and westbound freeway off-ramps, and Agoura Road. Additional right-of-way should be provided on intersection approaches at those locations wherever possible as new development is undertaken. The right-of-way widths on the six-lane approaches should be approximately 120 feet (in lieu of 100 feet), with approximately 100-foot rights-of-way for the four-lane approaches (in lieu of 84 feet).
e.	FUTURE ROAD EXTENSIONS
Extensions of several existing roadways within the City and surrounding areas are evaluated in the following paragraphs.
Triunfo Canyon Road currently terminates several hundred feet east of Lindero Canyon Road within the City. The paved segment east of Lindero Canyon Road varies from 44 to 84 feet in width and functions as the only access to Oak Forest Mobile Estates. Within Los Angeles County, Triunfo Canyon Road is improved from Kanan Road westerly to just outside of the City limits. It is anticipated that the uncompleted section in the County's jurisdiction will be constructed in conjunction with development in the area. The portion of Triunfo Canyon Road within the City will not connect with the roadway section outside of the City, the current terminus of Triunfo Canyon Road will be its ultimate terminus.
CITY OP W ESTLAKE VILLAGE GENERAL PLAN
11-19
Chapter II Infrastructure and Community Services
The southern portion of Lindero Canyon Road currently terminates at Triunfo Canyon Road. The Lindero Canyon Road/Triunfo Canyon Road intersection will be the ultimate terminus of the Lindero Canyon Road corridor. Any southerly roadway extension to serve development clustered near Triunfo Canyon Road and the reservoir will be offset to the east of the Lindero Canyon Road/Triunfo Canyon Road intersection and will not be considered as part of Lindero Canyon Road.
As future development occurs, associated street improvements should incorporate adequate access for emergency and evacuation purposes, either through the local street system or by emergency accessways.
The eastern portion of La Tienda Road currently terminated at Via Rocas. However, in order to enhance the local circulation system and accommodate future traffic demands, La Tienda Road will be extended easterly to connect with the northbound Route 101 Freeway ramps at Lindero Canyon Road. In addition, the project will include widening of the freeway overcrossing and realignment and reconstruction of the interchange at the existing northbound off-ramp, northbound on-ramp and northbound direct on-ramp.
f.	PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AND CARPOOLING
The City's present public transportation service is expected to remain basically unchanged in the future. The number of trips associated with the RTD line 423 service to downtown Los Angeles, however, has gradually increased in the last two years and future improvements in this service may take place as the City population and work force grow. New bus service to the proposed major commercial and industrial areas also may become appropriate as these developments occur. The dial-a-ride taxi service is expected to be maintained, based on funding availability and continued use of the service. Commuter parking now occurs near the freeway interchanges as commuters pool together. Consideration should be given to the expenditure of Proposition A funds for the construction of additional commuter parking facilities to encourage this activity.
g.	BIKEWAYS
As indicated previously, Class II bikeways may be replaced with Class I bikeways as vehicular traffic volumes increase. The Lindero Canyon Road corridor is an example of where this may be appropriate.
3.	IMPROVEMENT FUNDING
The major sources of funds for street related improvements not constructed by developers or paid for by developers through the proposed Arterial System Financing Program are the State gasoline tax and the Surface Transportation Program. Funds for public transit purposes can be derived from the Local Transportation Fund (SB 325) and the Federal Urban Mass Transportation Act. City of westlake village General Plan
11-20
Chapter II Infrastructure and Community Services
Expenditures for the construction of bikeways can also be financed with SB 325 funds and from special funds made available through State legislation. The expenditure of all Federal and State funds requires prior approval of a Transportation Improvement Program by the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission, the Southern California Association of Governments, and certain state and federal agencies.
The following is a summary of the various significant funding programs available to the City:
Arterial System Financing Program, The established Arterial System Financing Program (ASFP) enables the City to collect funds from all developments occurring within the City. These funds will then be used for the sole purpose of implementing various improvements to the City's arterial street system. The ASFP fee system will distribute the costs of identified arterial street improvements to new developments based solely on the proportioned share of total traffic that the proposed development will generate. Each improvement is necessary to mitigate traffic impacts associated with proposed developments so that an acceptable level of service will continue to be maintained. The fee is directly proportional to the benefit that each new development will ultimately receive. Also, note that the fee system will recognize a fee credit to developers who construct portions of the identified traffic projects.
Gas Tax. This tax is a State-administered subvention to the City of a portion of the tax collected on gasoline. These funds are expected to provide the main support for the City's street construction program. These funds may also be used for street maintenance.
Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA). The Surface Transportation Program (STP) is a block grant type program that provides funds that may be used by the states and local agencies for any roads that are functionally classified as Federal-aid roads. The STP provides broad discretion for state and local governments to fund a wide variety of activities including highway and transit capital projects, carpool projects, bicycle and pedestrian facilities, planning, and research and development.
Federal Highway Safety Act. Under this act, the City is eligible to participate in programs such as Hazard Elimination safety.
Ouarter-cent Sales Tax (SB 325). Funds obtained through this source must be used for public transportation and for right-of-way acquisition and construction of major streets and roads. Funds may only be expended for public transportation purposes unless there are no "unmet" transit needs within the jurisdiction. The SB 325 funds can be used to defray operating as well as capital costs of transit services in the City.
Proposition A Funds. The proceeds from this one-half cent sales tax are used to finance a Transit Development Program in Los Angeles County. This program is
City of Westlake village General Plan
11-21
Chapter II Infrastructure and Community Services
administered by the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission. Proposition A proceeds also fund a dial-a-ride taxi service within the City.
Proposition C Funds. This one-half cent Los Angeles County sales tax is similar to Proposition A funds.
4.	CONGESTION MANAGEMENT
The County of Los Angeles has implemented a Congestion Management Program (CMP) that affects local agencies. Los Angeles County was required to develop a CMP by Proposition 111, which provides for a nine cent increase in the state gas tax over a five year period. Although the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission has several responsibilities associated with the CMP, the City's responsibilities are as follows:
•	Analyze the traffic impacts of local land use decisions.
•	Adopt and implement a Trip Reduction and Travel Demand Ordinance.
The City will adopt a Transportation Demand Management Ordinance. The Ordinance will have a goal of reducing peak hour trips so that future improvements will not be necessary. For instance a reduction of left turn traffic volumes will eliminate the future need to provide three southbound left turn lanes on Lindero Canyon Road at Agoura Road.
5.	POLICIES AND IMPLEMENTATION MEASURES
Circulation Adequacy/Accessibility
Policy:
1	Provide for the efficient movement of people, goods and
services within the City and to and from major destinations outside the City.
Implementation Measures:
11.1	Utilize Chapter Two, Section A as the City's Master Plan of Streets and Highways in order to accommodate projected future traffic levels.
11.2	Implement roadway improvements in accordance with the Master Plan as development occurs.
11.3	Require Level of Service "C" or better to be maintained throughout the City circulation system. Due to the unique nature of Lindero Canyon Road, Level of Service "D" or better may be acceptable within the portion of the Lindero Canyon Road corridor that extends from Via Colinas to Agoura Road.

B.	UTILITIES
The City’s infrastructure was initially designed to accommodate a much larger population than will ultimately occur. Therefore, service deficiencies are not anticipated locally and would be limited to the regional, state or national level, such as restrictions on water and energy supplies, or the availability of waste disposal methods.
1.	WATER SERVICE
Water service is provided by the Las Virgenes Municipal Water District (LVMWD). The LVMWD's service area includes the Cities of Agoura Hills, Calabasas, Hidden Hills, Westlake Village, and portions of unincorporated Los Angeles County. LVMWD receives their water supply from the Southern California Metropolitan Water District (MWD).
Within the Westlake Village corporate boundaries are major components of the LVMWD's infrastructure including LVMWD's sole reservoir and filtration plant, a pump station, and several storage tanks (Figure 24). These key components are connected through a series of distribution lines located throughout the Westlake Village area.
The District supplies reclaimed water from Tapia Water Reclamation Facility to the City. The reclaimed water has been available to the City since 1984 and is used for median and parkway landscape irrigation. The reclaimed water is distributed through a separate pipeline system.
The design capacities of the water system in the City of Westlake Village are based on the ability to deliver maximum day demand, plus fire flow, at a residual pressure of 20 pounds per square inch to all development. The City's existing water system and storage capacities have been found by the District to adequately meet present demands. However, it is estimated that the Westlake filtration plant will be required to provide 33.2 cubic feet per second (CFS) during projected future periods of peak demand. The filtration plant currently is under sized to meet the projected peak demand, and will be upgraded with two additional filters by the year 2000.
In addition, there are several other improvements recommended by the LVMWD (Figure 24):
1.	Add a new 3 million gallon storage tank adjacent to the existing Equestrian Trail tank by 1993.
2.	Install new inlet/outlet 16" pipelines with the new 3 million gallon storage tank by 1993.

3.	Install a second 24” pipeline adjacent to the existing Triunfo Canyon Road 24" pipeline, by the year 2000.
4.	Attach a new 24" pipeline linking the existing 16" inlet/outlet pipeline associated with the Equestrian Trails tank.
5.	By the year 2000, install a 24" pipeline at the Westlake Reservoir to increase the Reservoir's refill rate during the winter months.
In order to comply with State water standards, the existing pumping plant at the reservoir site has been upgraded to include a diatomaceous earth filter plant. The plant processes 15 million gallons of water per day. This additional treatment reduces turbidity below the required maximum limit and removes the algae accumulation which can cause taste and odor problems.
Southern California is subject to periodic drought conditions. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, California received significantly less than the average amount of precipitation. In response, MWD required most cities and communities to implement a voluntary rationing program, and many jurisdictions implemented mandatory water reduction programs. The 1990 - 1991 winter-spring season brought significant precipitation to Southern California. The Los Angeles area received just short of the average anticipated rainfall. However, the Los Angeles area would need to receive average or above average rains for a number of years to alleviate the current drought conditions.
2.	STORM DRAINS
The Los Angeles County Flood Control District (LACFCD) owns the mainline storm drain pipelines in the City. The City owns lateral lines and catch basins connecting with the LACFCD mainlines. The City's lateral lines and catch basins are maintained by the Los Angeles County Road Department. Maintenance of the lateral lines, catch basins, and mainline is conducted annually. No capital improvements are planned in the near future; although, any proposed connections with the mainline must be approved by the LACFCD prior to construction.
Most Westlake Village run-off water drains into Westlake Lake. If the Westlake Lake is nearing capacity, the excess run-off water drains into the Triunfo Canyon Creek. Excess waters flow through Triunfo Canyon into Malibu Canyon, and ultimately to the Pacific Ocean. A small percentage of Westlake Village's run-off water drains into Lake Lindero in Agoura Hills.
3.	SANITATION SERVICE
The Las Virgenes Municipal Water District provides sewer service to the City of Westlake Village. A 30" trunk sewer is located along Lindero and Triunfo Canyon Roads which transports wastewater generated in the portion of the City located
CITY OF W ESTLAKE VILLAGE GENERAL PLAN
11-30
Chapter II Infrastructure and Community Services
south of U.S. Highway 101 (see Figure 25). An 18" sewer trunk line along the northern Westlake Village/Agoura Hills boundary collects wastewater generated by development north of the freeway.
All developed portions of the City are sewered. Los Angeles County provides sewer collector lines to each residence or building in the City requiring service. The planning, engineering, construction and maintenance of sewer collector lines which collect wastewater and transport it to the sewer trunk lines of LVMWD are under the jurisdiction of Los Angeles County, Water and Sewage Division.
The design capacity of the City's trunk lines is 10.5 million gallons per day (MGD), with a current flow of about 1.5 MGD. The current contributing flows from the area within the City limits are approximately 0.7 MGD. The capacity of these Jines is far in excess of current or projected flows.
Sewage is conveyed to the Tapia Water Reclamation Facility in Malibu Canyon, operated by LVMWD. The current design capacity of the facility is 10.0 MGD with current average daily flows of 7.4 MGD. In May, 1991, construction began on a 6.1 MGD treatment expansion which is scheduled for completion by 1993. This expansion represents the final stage of the facility's current master plan.
Any future development in the City will tie into existing sewer lines. It will be the responsibility of the developer in each case to submit preliminary engineering plans for provision of sewer service to the County and to LVMWD for review. The costs of system expansion for sewer line collectors are borne by new development.
4.	NATURAL GAS SUPPLY
Natural gas is provided to the City by Southern California Gas Company. As a public utility, Southern California Gas Company ("SCG") is required by law to provide service to any development within its legally defined service area. The Company is under the jurisdiction of the California Public Utilities Commission and can be affected by the actions of Federal regulatory agencies. Should these agencies take any action which affects gas supply or conditions of service, service would be provided in accordance with the policies and extension rules on file with the California Public Utilities Commission at the time contractual arrangements are made.
Company representatives anticipate no problems in serving City residences or businesses in the short- or long-term. Recently, SCG installed a main along Decker Canyon Road south to the Los Angeles County border as shown in Figure 26. Both the new main and a master plan which plans improvements over the next 50 years will adequately serve any new demand.

5.	ELECTRICAL SUPPLY
Electricity is provided to the City by Southern California Edison Company (SCE). As a public utility, SCE is required by law to provide service to any development within its legally defined service area. Most electrical lines are underground within the City except for a string of 66 kilovolt transmission lines. Those lines are located within a 100-foot-wide easement which runs along the Westlake Village/Agoura Hills boundary north of the Ventura Freeway. No substations are located within the City, however, the Potrero substation is located in Thousand Oaks near the Westlake Village-Thousand Oaks corporate boundary.
SCE expects its total system demand to continue to increase annually. However, SCE officials indicate that the system's ability to serve all customer loads during peak demand periods will be adequate during the decade of the 90s.

C.	INSTITUTIONAL FACILITIES
1.	CIVIC CENTER
Since incorporation, city offices have been located in leased facilities. Preliminary consideration has been given to constructing permanent civic center facilities at various locations within the City. There are currently no plans for construction of such permanent facilities, nor has an appropriate site been selected.
2.	EDUCATION
Las Virgenes Unified School District (LVUSD) provides elementary, intermediate and high school service to the City of Westlake Village. Three of the District's eleven schools are currently serving the City; they are White Oak Elementary School, Lindero Canyon Middle School, and Agoura High School (see Figure 27). The characteristics of each are shown below:
School
Grades	1991 Projected Capacitv	Enrollment
White Oak	K-5
Lindero Canyon	6-8
Agoura High	9-12
Indian Hills (Continuation School) 9-12
535	680
1,018	1,036
1,954	1,860
90	90
Overall, the District has experienced continued growth over the past five years and expects to continue its growth pattern through the turn of the century. Current district enrollment is 9,600 students. However, there is approximately 812 potential residential units to be developed in Westlake Village, assuming build out under this General Plan.
Using a distribution of 512 single-family units and 300 multi-family units, District generation factors of 0.23 students (K-5), 0.04 students (6-8), and 0.10 students (9-12) per multi-family unit and 0.61 students (K-5), 0.22 students (6-8), 0.18 students (9-12) per single-family unit, an anticipated 381 elementary students, 125 middle school students, and 122 high school students would be generated by the proposed 812 units.
Generally speaking, any proposed development of 200 homes within the City of Westlake Village would have a significant impact on White Oak Elementary and Lindero Canyon Middle Schools. White Oak Elementary is currently above capacity and is serving the overflow students with portable classrooms brought to the site. The district is unable to serve additional students at White Oak Elementary without significant mitigation measures provided by the development. The District

currently indicates to proposed developers that the District would seek a dedicated school site within any planned development of over 200 homes.
Funding for new school construction is extremely limited. The District currently collects builder fees as provided by AB 2926. While there are no current plans for utilizing any of these funds for additional construction in Westlake Village or schools serving Westlake Village, these funds would be used for providing unanticipated classroom needs. Anticipated solutions include placement of relocatable facilities and/or construction of an additional elementary school should it be deemed necessary in the next 10 to 15 years. The District has pursued a policy of requiring mitigation over and above fees collected under AB 2926. Such measures included additional funding and/or dedication of land for interim or permanent school facilities. Using these methods, the District would be able to accommodate projected growth within the City through the year 2000.
The junior college district serving the City is the Los Angeles Community College District. The nearest junior college is Pierce, located approximately 18 miles east of the City.
3.	LIBRARIES
The Westlake Village Library, located at 4371 Park Terrace Drive, Westlake Village, is operated by the County of Los Angeles Public Library. The Westlake Village Library, opened in 1993, houses a collection of 22,500 items in a 6,000 square feet structure. The ultimate collection will meet the Public Library's planning standard.
The City is also served by the Las Virgenes Public Library at 29130 West Roadside Drive in Agoura Hills. It is a branch of the Los Angeles County Public Library and serves residents of Los Angeles County and Ventura County residents by reciprocal agreement with the Ventura County Public Library.
Las Virgenes Public Library has approximately 43,000 volumes in a building of about 7,500 square feet. Its circulation is between 15,000 and 20,000 items per month, which is considered a large number for a medium-sized library. Library staff indicate that the percent usage by City residents is fairly high, although no precise record is available. The library is heavily used by senior citizens, preschool and young students, and families with younger children. It serves about 11, 500 registrants (the library does not issue library cards, but keeps a listing of borrowers).
No expansion of the Las Virgenes Public Library facility is proposed at this time, although it is heavily used. Concurrent with the development of an Agoura Hills library and a Westlake Village library, the Las Virgenes Public Library will close.
The City of Thousand Oaks Library (1401 East Janss Road, Thousand Oaks) offers a major library center with extensive community services. The library has over 200,000 volumes, with 420 subscription publications, housed in a 64,000 square foot City 67 w estlake village Gen eral plan
11-41
Chapter II Infrastructure and Community Services
building. It also offers the use of computers, three conference rooms, a kitchen and projection room. Various preschool and children's reading programs are also available. Residents of the City of Westlake Village currently use the facility, with user fees partially subsidized by the city.
Although no accurate count of users is available, the head librarian estimates that a large percentage of users are from the Westlake Village area, including City residents. The library also serves Agoura Hills, Simi Valley and Camarillo. About 50,000 persons use the facility each month, with an estimated library circulation of 55,000-65,000 books and periodicals.
The Thousand Oaks Library opened a Newbury Park branch in January, 1991, located in a 17,000 square foot building with 18,000 volumes.
The California Lutheran College Library (60 West Olsen Road, Thousand Oaks) is open to the public. It has about 105,000 volumes focusing on religion and education. Most of the non-CLC student use is by local high school students. Community residents may use the library for reading and studying without charge. An annual fee of $25 allows local residents to borrow materials and books.
Moorpark College Library (7075 Campus Road, Moorpark) is available for use by community residents. It is not used extensively by City residents. The head librarian estimates that only 3% of its patrons are from the Westlake area. The library has about 61,588 volumes, 600 technical reports, and 275 periodicals in a building of 19,000 square feet. The second story of the building is used for non-library purposes at present, but is available for library expansion as necessary. With its academic focus, the library serves as the main educational facility serving users between University of California, Santa Barbara and California State University, Northridge.
The Agoura High School Library is located at 28545 West Driver Avenue, Agoura Hills. It operates primarily as a resource for students who attend Agoura High School and for residents in the immediate area. There is very little use of this library by City residents. Westlake High School at 100 N. Lakeview Canyon Road, Westlake Village, also provides some limited library use for City residents.

D.	PUBLIC SAFETY
1.	LAW ENFORCEMENT
The City is served by the County of Los Angeles Sheriff Department, and does not intend to establish its own police department at the present time. The primary sheriff's facility is the Lost Hills Station, located in Calabasas, 10 miles from Westlake Village (see Figure 28). All radio calls are dispatched from the Lost Hills Station to the Westlake patrol unit that is patrolling within the City boundaries. The Lost Hills Station, located in the City of Calabasas, was completed and became operational in October, 1991.
One full-time patrol unit from the Lost Hills Sheriff Station provides law enforcement services to the City. In addition, three other units are available should the City car need assistance. The City's patrol unit consists of two deputies on early morning and evening shifts and one deputy on day shift. With the completion of the Lost Hills Station, an additional traffic car provides patrol service within the City. Police services include, but are not limited to, emergency responses, routine service calls, crime prevention patrol, and traffic enforcement. Additional services include detective and staff support.
Response times based on statistics for fiscal year 1990-1991 vary according to the nature of the service requested, the time of day and the availability of a patrol unit. Response times averaged about 7.5 minutes in 1991. The overwhelming percentage of emergency calls are medical emergencies that are the primary responsibility of the Fire Paramedic Unit.
The desired patrol car per population ratio varies from district to district with no one ratio considered ideal. Societal groupings, geographic peculiarities and some lesser variables are the most common yardsticks used in formulating an effective ratio. Statistical data supports the desirability of an around-the-clock patrol car to maintain a high level of law enforcement service.
The ratio of population growth to reported crime is seen as one variable means of gauging the effectiveness of the law enforcement effort. To date, the rise in criminal statistics for the greater Las Virgenes service area has not exceeded the population growth. Within the City limits, one patrol unit on a 24-hour basis with no increase in reported crime is the goal of the Sheriff Department, given anticipated growth in the City.
2.	FIRE PROTECTION
The City is provided with fire services by the County of Los Angeles. For major fire emergencies, such as brush fires, all necessary crews and equipment are made available. The State Division of Forestry fire crews can also be called for severe and City of W estlak e Village General Plan

widespread fire emergencies, and mutual assistance agreements are in place with neighboring cities and Ventura County.
For routine fire services, the City has one fire station within the City limits. Fire Station 144 is located at 31981 Foxfield Drive, (see Figure 28). The station has one engine company, equipped with paramedic supplies, and a patrol vehicle with a water tender. The patrol vehicle is smaller than the main engine, enabling the fire fighters to reach obscure locations to strategically fight brush fire. Four persons are on duty at all times .
Additional fire and rescue services are provided to the City as needed by six other fire stations. Response times depend on the location of the responding station, and are shown for each station in Table 25.
3.	HEALTH CARE
Westlake Medical Center is located within the City on Lakeview Canyon Road. The Center has a staff of approximately 450 physicians and dentists representing nine major departments. The Center serves residents of the Conejo and Western San Fernando Valley areas with a 126-bed capacity and emergency room service. Critical care, surgery, maternity, neonatal, pediatrics, cardiology, radiology, orthopedics, psychiatry and physical therapy are available to the community. The Center also serves as a base station for Ventura and Los Angeles County paramedics. The emergency department has its own heliport and is approved by the American Heart Association as a first-hour facility for heart attack victims. Expansion of the Westlake Medical Center may occur commensurate with community needs.
Los Robles Regional Medical Center is located on West Janss Road in the City of Thousand Oaks. The Center has a staff of 350 physicians representing 11 major departments. The Center serves Conejo Valley residents with a 228-bed capacity and emergency room service. Ventura Heart Institute, cardiology, occupational, speech and physical therapy, radiology, respiratory, maternity, pediatrics, orthopedics, oncology, surgery and social services are available to users. The Regional Medical Center contains a heliport and also serves a base station for Ventura and Los Angeles County paramedics.
Long-term care services which provide skilled nursing or intermediate care are available in Newbury Park and Thousand Oaks. Ventura Estates Health Manor, Thousand Oaks, offers 66 beds and was operating at 95-100% occupancy in 1991. Mary Health Convalescent Hospital, in Newbury Park, provides long-term, full service care for women, has 61 beds with a 100% occupancy rate (1991). Thousand Oaks Health Care Center, a full care convalescent hospital, has 124 beds and operates at 100% occupancy (1991).
The closest public health care and social services facilities include the Ventura County Medical Center on Loma Vista Road in Ventura, the Thousand Oaks Mental City of W estlake Village General Plan

The Conejo Community Services Center, which is supported in whole by voluntary donations, offers general medicine, lab and ophthalmology services, mental health and social services, family planning and gynecology.
In general, the City is adequately served by major care facilities, however, long-term and intermediate care patients are under served by local convalescent health facilities. The long-term and intermediate care patients would benefit from the construction and operation of new state-of-the art facilities.

E.	RECREATION
1.	EXISTING RECREATIONAL FACILITIES
Public parks and recreational facilities presently available to City residents are listed in Table 26 and shown on Figure 29. The three developed parks within the City are Bennett Park, Canyon Oaks Park, and Three Springs Park. Bennett Park is a 5.15-acre park developed with a picnic area, children's play area and outdoor basketball courts. The adjacent White Oak School grounds are used during non-school hours by athletic groups and clubs as well as by neighborhood residents. Canyon Oaks Park is 2.49 acres developed with passive uses such as picnic areas and a tot lot. The Three Springs Park is a 6,2-acre developed park with a vitacourse, basketball courts, play area, and picnic tables. The approved Westlake North Specific Plan incorporates a 4-acre park with multi-purpose field for softball and soccer, a vitacourse (a jogging, chin up, sit-up, and other exercises course), and picnic area.
Outside of the City, Glastonbury Park is situated within a half-mile of the City limits and is developed as a neighborhood park. City residents also have access to a community park located within a mile of the City limits (Triunfo Community Park) and several regional and State parks which exist within reasonable distances, as well as the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area.
The City maintains bicycle lanes along its major arterials which are used by joggers and runners as well as cyclists. The City's residents are well-served by private recreational facilities located within the City which include the 18-hole Westlake Golf Course, Westlake Tennis and Swim Club (13 tennis courts and pool), Westlake Village Racquet Club (10 tennis courts), Westlake Courthouse (racquetball and exercise), and the 150-acre Westlake Lake (fishing and sailing). Many residents have access to commonly-owned pool and spa facilities. Additionally, the majority of single-family detached units within the City have private pools.
Throughout the City, pedestrian paths and sidewalks provide recreation space for joggers and runners. In many areas, residents may walk to recreational and commercial facilities from their homes. In some private residential areas, however, sidewalks and pedestrian paths are not provided.
2.	FUTURE RECREATIONAL NEEDS
Some need for the provision of senior citizen facilities, hiking trails, softball/soccer fields and play equipment are evident. The future expenditure of funds for recreational facilities and activities may be prioritized as follows:
a.	Maintenance and enhancement of existing facilities and programs
b.	Aquisition and development of additional active and passive parks
c.	Development of interconnecting trail systems.

Based on the City's development standard, 26.2 acres of parkland are required for the existing 2,714 dwelling units. The 21.42 acres of existing public park does not adequately serve the City's present development; however, when including greenbelts and other open space facilities, the City would meet the park standard for its current population.
3.	POTENTIAL RECREATIONAL SITES AND FACILITIES
a.	FUTURE PARKS
Other than a dedication of the Westlake North park, there are no plans at present for the designation or acquisition of additional park sites within the City. Future residential development in the area south and west of Triunfo Canyon Road will likely require an additional park in that area.
h RESERVOIR WATERSHED OPEN SPACE
The Las Virgenes Municipal Water District owns 342 acres of open space located southwest of Westlake Reservoir. It may be possible to use part or all of this area for limited recreational uses in the future, such as hiking, without jeopardizing reservoir operations (only about one-third of the parcel actually functions as watershed).
c.	SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS NATIONAL RECREATION AREA
Approximately one-fourth of the City is located in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area (NRA), which was established by Congress in 1978 (Public Law 95-625) to preserve and enhance the area's scenic, natural, cultural and historical setting and its public health value as an airshed for the Southern California metropolitan area while providing for the recreational and educational needs of the visiting public." The NRA is a 46-mile-long chain of peaks and valleys extending from Oxnard to Griffith Park, encompassing some 150,000 acres, and is managed by the National Park Service (NPS). None of the land within the City limits is under the ownership of the NPS as of June 1992.
A General Management Plan has been prepared to establish goals and objectives for the development and management of the NRA, and a classification system has been devised to provide a set of broad land management goals. Figure 30 depicts the approximate boundaries of the classifications which affect the undeveloped or uncommitted areas of the City. The three land classifications which apply to the City are described below, along with related management emphasis and land uses considered appropriate (as contained in the Plan).
Special Natural or Cultural Area
Resource Characteristics: Natural and cultural resources that are essentially intact and have significant values; areas sensitive to human activity.

Chapter II Infrastructure and Community Services
Management Emphasis: Perpetuation of biological, geological, and cultural values; protection from development and visitor uses that could damage irreplaceable resources, important biological areas, critical habitat, archaeological sites, and significant landform features.
Appropriate Uses: Hiking, primitive camping, nature study, interpretive programs (conducted and self-guided), horseback riding (restricted in some areas); research; existing residential use; new residential development that maintains the significant natural and cultural values.
Active Management: Management of endangered species and their habitats; monitoring of the effects of visitor use on natural and cultural values; regulation of use .when necessary to maintain integrity; perpetuation of natural processes; management of historic and archaeological resources according to approved policies; where natural resources have been altered, management to encourage restoration of a natural regime; reduction of adverse impacts from fuel breaks and firebreaks by relocating them or using less destructive means of vegetation manipulation; establishment of recreational use capacities; transfer of development rights to other areas.
Watershed Buffer Area
Resource Characteristics: Watersheds that contain natural and cultural resources that could be altered by erosion or water pollution; watersheds that provide important wildlife habitat; watersheds upstream of important natural or cultural features sensitive to watershed impacts.
Management Emphasis: Protection of natural values within the watershed where activities could adversely affect downstream areas of biological importance; protection of natural wildlife corridors between protected watersheds.
Appropriate Uses: Hiking, hike-in camping, nature study, interpretive walks, horseback riding; research; picnicking; existing and new low-density residential development where cumulative impacts to habitat and watershed value can be mitigated and parcels already have legal road access and water service.
Active Management: Restoration of disturbed areas to minimize erosion and desedimentation; monitoring of water quality; establishment of recreational use capacities; review of development proposals to suggest impact mitigations.
City of Westlake village General plan
11-57
Chapter II Infrastructure and Community Services
Scenic and Resource-Oriented Recreation Area
Resource Characteristics: Natural settings, less sensitive natural communities, modified landscapes in process of recovery, lands that are important to the view from scenic roads and trails, and agricultural landscapes.
Management Emphasis: Provision of environmentally compatible recreational activities, with small dispersed facilities that have a minimal effect on natural resources, natural processes, and scenery; protection of natural and man-made views, scenic features, and compatible landscapes, including agricultural areas.
Appropriate Uses: Farming, ranching, and grazing; scenic driving, hiking, hike-in and walk-in camping (group or family), sight-seeing, nature study, interpretive walks, outdoor education, fishing, bicycling, horseback riding, unstructured outdoor sports and games, picnicking; research; information; rural residential use; development clustered to preserve open space atmosphere.
Active Management: Landscape management to reestablish or create a natural appearance, including reclamation and restoration of disturbed areas, screening of facilities, and protection of views; suggestion of design and grading mitigating measures on development seen from roads and trail viewpoints; protection and preservation of existing resources; monitoring of agricultural and scenic easements.
The Plan also designates an "Activity Site" near the intersection of Decker Road and Carlisle Canyon Road, which would function as an orientation and "jumping off" point to the backcountry and the rest of the NRA, which will be largely devoted to passive recreational use. In addition, the Plan designates one area of open space within the City for possible future acquisition, however, this area has not been given a high purchase priority.
Some of the Management Plan's classifications and designations conflict with the General Plan land use designations for the area. The greatest inconsistency is between the Management Plan's "Activity Site" designation for the area near the intersection of Carlisle Canyon and Decker Roads, and the General Plan's designation of "Residential". The NPS has no regulatory authority over land within the NRA that it does not own. Local permitting procedures and ordinances apply to all privately-owned land within the NRA, including lands on which the NPS has acquired an easement. However, the NPS will comment to the appropriate local jurisdiction as an interested and affected landowner on land use proposals made by others within the NRA boundary and zone when those proposals have the potential to affect the intent of the enabling legislation that established the NRA.

Chapter II Infrastructure and Community Services
d.	TRAILS
Several trail systems have been adopted and are being implemented by other jurisdictions, and are available to City residents. Some proposed segments of these trails are located within the City itself. One trail network, adopted by the National Park Service and incorporated in Los Angeles County's Malibu/Santa Monica Mountains Area Plan, consists of the Backbone Trail planned to run from Will Rogers State Park in the east to Point Mugu State Park in the west, with feeder trails connecting to parks, beaches and population areas (see Figure 31). One of these feeder trails is proposed to run along the ridge of Lady-Face Mountain, which is south of and proximate to the City. A feeder trail to serve the City could be extended from the Lady Face trail along the north side of Triunfo Canyon to Lindero Canyon Road. A major portion of this trail right-of-way has already been preserved by the City.
Another proposed trail affecting the City is the National Recreation Area trail which would pass through the southwestern portion of the City, roughly paralleling Decker Road. A trail head is also proposed near the intersection of Decker and Carlisle Canyon. This alignment could be secured, as the property is presently undeveloped. (The current approved development plan for this property includes such an alignment.)
The Master Plan of Equestrian/Hiking Trails adopted by the Conejo Recreation and Parks District indicates an existing trail extending from the City of Thousand Oaks into the City at the northern end of the golf course, after using the Lakeview Canyon overpass to cross the freeway. The District also proposes trails through their Lake Eleanor property, extending east into the City of Westlake Village along Decker Road connecting to the NRA trail system.
4.	ACQUISITION AND FINANCING OF RECREATIONAL FACILITIES
As part of the subdivision approval process, the City may require dedication of land for park and recreational uses, the payment of in-lieu fees or a combination of both, provided it has enacted an enabling ordinance and the requirement is consistent with the principles and standards contained in this Chapter.
A partial credit may be granted against the requirement of land dedication or in-lieu fees for private open space within a proposed subdivision which is to be used for park and recreation purposes and is to be privately owned and maintained by the future residents of the subdivision. Private open space may be improved with recreational amenities such as a children's play areas, picnic areas, game courts, turf playfields, swimming pools and/or recreation centers.

F.	SOLID WASTE/SOURCE REDUCTION AND RECYCLING
The City of Westlake Village's Source Reduction and Recycling (SRRE) and Household Hazardous Waste (HHW) elements were developed in response to Assembly Bill 939, the California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 (AB939). AB 939 requires every city and county in the State of California to prepare an SRR element that identifies how each jurisdiction will meet the mandatory waste diversion goals set by the State of 25% by 1995 (short term) and 50% by 2000 (medium term). The law also requires every jurisdiction to develop an HHW element to plan for the proper management of hazardous wastes that are generated by households. This section presents a summary of each of the components included in the separately published SRR and HHW elements, on file at City Hall.
1.	SOLID WASTE GENERATION STUDY COMPONENT
In 1990, a solid waste generation study was conducted to quantify and characterize the solid waste generated, diverted, and disposed by the City of Westlake Village. The study indicated that 12,865 tons of solid waste were generated in the City annually. Through a number of existing diversion programs operated by the City and by the private sector, 1,483 tons annually were diverted from disposal at nearby landfills. This existing level of solid waste diversion equaled approximately 11.5% of the total solid waste generated.
2.	SOURCE REDUCTION COMPONENT
Source reduction simply means producing less waste. Because source reduction is intangible, it is the most difficult to quantify.
The SRRE identifies and evaluates four broad categories of source reduction activities. These include: 1) education and technical assistance; 2) rate structure modifications; 3) economic incentives; and 4) regulatory programs.
The alternatives selected for implementation are shown in Table 27. It is anticipated that expanded source reduction programs will result in an additional 3.5% diversion by 1995, and 7.0% by 2000. These programs do not require any major new or expanded facilities. The effectiveness of these programs is tied directly to the education and public information activities undertaken by the City.
3.	RECYCLING COMPONENT
Recycling activities within the City include business recycling, material salvage by haulers, and routine cardboard recycling by grocery stores and other major businesses. In addition, a number of private recycling activities are in place. In 1990, the City diverted approximately 1,338 tons of solid waste through recycling. This represented 90.2% of that year's total diversion rate.

Chapter II Infrastructure and Community Services
To further increase recycling in Westlake Village, a number of new programs will be implemented and existing programs expanded. These programs are summarized in Table 27. These programs require capital expenditures for facilities and/or equipment associated with residential collection of recyclables, multifamily collection, and mechanized material recovery. The selected programs will be implemented in the short term and continued through the medium term.
4.	COMPOSTING COMPONENT
Composting can play a key role in the City's integrated waste management system. Yard waste and readily decomposable material make up a significant portion of the total waste stream. In 1990, yard waste in Westlake Village contributed 1,243 tons or 10.4% of the total waste disposed.
The City has targeted yard waste for ongoing composting programs. Yard waste includes grass, leaves, and prunings. The composting program, which will include residential and commercial collection of materials, and materials processing and marketing, will be implemented in the short term and continue through the medium term. By implementing a residential and commercial yard waste collection program the estimated total diversion is anticipated to be approximately 3.6% of the total waste stream in the short term and 4.3% in the medium term.
5.	SPECIAL WASTE COMPONENT
Special waste includes difficult to handle materials such as tires, construction debris, white goods, sofas, and mattresses; and potentially hazardous wastes such as sewage, sludge, asbestos, auto bodies, or ash. The special waste addressed in this component includes bulky items such as white goods and tires, and inert solids such as demolition and construction waste.
Three alternatives were evaluated and selected for implementation. Alternative 1 is a used tire program, Alternative 2 focuses on diverting construction and demolition waste in the private sector through new regulatory programs, and Alternative 3 is a white goods recovery program. Implementation of these three alternatives will divert 21 tons in the short term and 80 tons in the medium term. The expected diversion from these programs is presented in Table 27.
6.	EDUCATION AND PUBLIC INFORMATION COMPONENT
Based on the generators and targeted materials, a number of new programs are selected for implementation that target the residential sector, commercial/industrial sector, governmental sector and schools. As shown in Table 27, several programs are recommended for each of the four sectors. All programs will be implemented within the short-term planning period and continue into the medium-term.

Chapter II Infrastructure and Community Services
7.	HOUSEHOLD HAZARDOUS WASTE
Household hazardous wastes are any household discarded materials that may threaten human health or the environment if disposed of improperly. Potential hazards are found in materials that are toxic, flammable, corrosive, or reactive.
Several alternatives were considered for the City's household hazardous waste program. The City will continue to participate in the periodic roundup events sponsored by the LACSD and Los Angeles County DWP until the permanent County program is in place. The City will also participate in the permanent County program, which will use mobile collection facilities for regularly scheduled collection events. Also, the City will cooperate with neighboring cities on possible programs to augment the County's planned program. The load-checking programs will continue at all landfills used by the City. There is no capital investment by the City for participation in the County program. The County will completely fund the permanent program and recover costs through a surcharge on the fees at all landfills in the County.

NATURAL RESOURCES
Chapter 111 Natural Resources
A.	BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES
Located along the northern edge of the Santa Monica Mountains, the City of Westlake Village encompasses large expanses of undeveloped open space, particularly in the southern, mountainous portions of the City. These natural areas support a wide array of native vegetation and an associated high-diversity of native wildlife. Natural communities range from sparse coastal sage scrub and chaparral on steep rocky slopes, to dense oak and riparian woodlands lining creekbeds and canyons. Such natural communities were once widespread along the foothills and valleys, however, gradual expansion of urban areas in western Los Angeles and eastern Ventura Counties have reduced these communities to small pockets surrounded by development in the lowlands, with larger areas restricted to the remote, mountainous areas. The City's natural features include prominent ridgelines and hillsides, lending to the area's overall natural and scenic character. With careful planning and sensitive development designs, these resources can be maintained in conjunction with urban growth.
Vegetation and wildlife have been described on the basis of recognizable assemblages of species known as natural communities. Natural communities occurring within the City are briefly discussed below and their general locations in the undeveloped areas of the City are depicted in Figure 32. Lists of representative species are presented in Appendix E.
1.	NATURAL COMMUNITIES
a.	OAK WOODLANDS AND SAVANNAHS
Perhaps the most widely-recognized and most environmentally sensitive resource of the City of Westlake Village are the oak woodlands and oak savannahs (the term "savannah" refers to areas of widely-spaced oaks), which are found in several locations throughout the City. These natural communities often occupy gentle terrain which is topographically quite suitable for urban development. As a result, oak-dominated communities have been replaced or altered by urban land uses throughout much of Southern California. Native oak communities are considered biologically critical not only for the majestic trees themselves, but also because they support a tremendous variety of wildlife, many of which are secretive and ill-adapted to urban areas. The importance of oak communities is heightened by their decline statewide. Valley oak is considered the most sensitive of the native oak species occurring within the City due to its restricted distribution, small numbers, and poor regeneration throughout its range. In addition to valley oak and coast live oak, representative species of the City's natural oak communities include shrubs such as toyon, California coffeeberry, and native grasses such as blue wildrye and California brome.

Chapter III Natural Resources
Large mammals such as mule deer, coyote, gray fox and bobcat can be found here in these woodlands, as well as raccoon, skunk and opossum. Small mammals include California ground squirrel, dusky-footed woodrat, several species of mouse and vole, and occasionally western gray squirrel. Birds abound in the woodlands. Typical residents include California towhee, California quail, scrub jay, bushtit, plain titmouse and several species of woodpeckers, hawks and owls. These are seasonally augmented by numerous migratory or wintering species. Most amphibians and reptiles of the region will frequent woodlands. Typical species include black-bellied slender salamander, California toad, Pacific treefrog, Great Basin fence lizard, San Diego alligator lizard, California kingsnake, and southern Pacific rattlesnake.
Oak savannah is characterized by widely-spaced valley oaks growing amidst a dense cover of native and introduced grasses such as purple needlegrass, wild oats, and brome grasses. Typical wildlife species of oak savannah include those from grassland and woodland habitats. Large mammals, including American badger and long-tailed weasel may be seen searching for prey such as California ground squirrel, Botta's pocket gopher, and various rats and mice. Typical bird species include great horned owl, red-tailed hawk, red-shouldered hawk, loggerhead shrike, mourning dove, and various woodpeckers. Large as well as small mammals are present in oak savannah, including several mice, California ground squirrel and Botta's pocket gopher. Typical amphibians and reptiles are those mentioned above for woodlands, with the addition of red coachwhip and California black-headed snake.
b.	CHAPARRAL AND COASTAL SAGE SCRUB
Chaparral is the most common and widespread biotic community in Southern California, forming a dense mantle over rocky slopes and mountainous terrain. Chaparral vegetation plays a vital role in stabilizing steep slopes and in reducing erosion. Because of its density and dryness during summer and fall, chaparral burns intensely, especially during Santa Ana wind conditions. However, shrubs which make up chaparral vegetation have natural mechanisms for recovery from wildfires and quickly re-establish themselves within several years. Representative chaparral plants in the City and vicinity include chamise, California lilac, laurel sumac, and scrub oak.
Coastal sage scrub is much like chaparral in that it is composed of native shrubs adapted to dry, rocky slopes. Unlike chaparral, however, coastal sage scrub vegetation is deciduous during the summer and fall, and thus appears dormant during these seasons. The most common plants of this community in the City of Westlake Village include coastal sagebrush, purple sage, black sage, California buckwheat, laurel sumac, and yucca. Showy spring wildflowers are often abundant in the openings between these shrubs, particularly on the City's steeper, volcanic slopes. Common species are perennial, bulb-forming ones such as shooting stars, golden stars, Mariposas, blue dicks, and numerous annual and perennial herbs.
CITY OF WESTLAKE VILLAGE GENERAL PLAN
III-3
Chapter III Natural Resources
Typical wildlife of chaparral and coastal sage scrub includes a few amphibians such as Monterey ensatina and black-bellied slender salamander, and numerous reptiles such as coast horned lizard, Great Basin fence lizard, coastal whiptail, California kingsnake, chaparral whipsnake, coast patch-nosed snake, and southern Pacific rattlesnake. Characteristic mammals of chaparral and coastal sage scrub habitats include mule deer, coyote, bobcat and gray fox, hare and rabbit, dusky-footed woodrat, and several species of mice and rats. Birds commonly observed include scrub jay, common raven, California towhee, Bewick's wren, wrentit, bushtit, California quail, Anna's hummingbird, and California thrasher.
Coastal sage scrub and chaparral are the most widespread natural communities of the City and the adjoining Santa Monica Mountains. Although common, these communities harbor large numbers of native species and care should be taken to retain significant stands of these habitats within the City.
c.	GRASSLAND
The grassland community occurs on slopes and in valleys that have heavy, clay soils and is characterized by low annual herbs. Originally, the California grassland community was dominated by native perennial bunchgrasses, but was converted naturally to a non-native, annual vegetation during Spanish settlement of California as a result of overgrazing and the introduction of weedy European grasses and herbs.
Grassland vegetation is characterized by wild oats, black mustard, brome-grasses and other European species, although many native wildflowers, such as fiddleneck, owl's clover, Indian paintbrush and blow-wives are abundant in grassland areas during the spring months. Grasslands provide critical foraging areas to large birds of prey seen soaring over the City, such as red-tailed hawk, American kestrel, northern harrier and turkey vulture. Most of the carnivores such as coyote, bobcat, gray fox, American badger and long-tailed weasel can be observed in grasslands, preying upon an abundance of small rodents, rabbit and hare, and songbirds. A number of resident and migratory songbirds are typical of grasslands such as Say's phoebe, western kingbird, lark sparrow, grasshopper sparrow, and western meadowlark.
d.	WEEDY FIELDS AND BARREN AREAS
Several open space areas within the City are sparsely vegetated, highly disturbed and are best termed "weedy fields". Species of plants and animals in these areas are predominantly non-native species such as Russian-thistle, tocalote, mustard, telegraph weed, and introduced grasses previously discussed. Wildlife species are those adapted to the urbanized environment and frequent disturbance, particularly discing for weed control. Typical animals include European starling, house finch,

house sparrow, mourning dove, Botta's pocket gopher, California ground squirrel, coyote, and domestic dog and cat.
2.	RARE AND ENDANGERED SPECIES AND SPECIAL NATURAL
COMMUNITIES
a.	PLANT SPECIES AND NATURAL COMMUNITIES
The vascular plant species and community assemblages that comprise the flora of the City have been cross-referenced with state and federal listings of rare, threatened and endangered species, the California Native Plant Society's inventory of sensitive species (Smith and Berg, 1988), and those "Special Plants" and "Special Natural Communities" of the California Department of Fish and Game's (CDFG) Nongame Heritage Program. Table 28 summarizes the occurrences of sensitive plant species and natural communities reported in the California Natural Diversity Data Base (CDFG, 1990) for all elements within a nine-quadrangle area centered around the Thousand Oaks quadrangle. A number of species and natural communities that are closely associated with the immediate coastal environment have been excluded because there are no corresponding conditions present within the City.
As can be seen in Table 28, a number of sensitive plant species are potentially present within the City. One species, Lyon's pentachaeta (Pentachaeta lyonii) is known to occur within the City limits. This species is listed as California Endangered. Another species present is Agoura dudleya (D. c. agourensisf This species is endemic to the western Santa Monica Mountains and although, not currently listed, it should be considered in-fact rare and endangered species, with a high probability of future listing. All of the riparian habitats, as well as associated aquatic habitats are considered sensitive by state and federal wildlife agencies. Additional sensitive habitats are Valley Needlegrass Grasslands and Woodlands containing California walnut and valley oak.
b.	WILDLIFE SPECIES
The CDFG's Natural Diversity Data Base (CDFG, 1990) reports no occurrences of any state- or federally-listed threatened or endangered animal species in the City. However, literature research regarding range and habitat preferences of animals in conjunction with existing habitats provides substantial evidence to conclude that the City is potentially utilized by a number of animal species which are considered "Special Animals" by the Department, even if their presence may be seasonal, sporadic, or otherwise infrequent. Table 29 summarizes the occurrences of sensitive region encompassed by the nine-quadrangle area centered on the Thousand Oaks quadrangle. There are several species, primarily invertebrates and birds, associated with the immediate coastline environment that have been excluded from this list because there is no corresponding habitat within the City.

Although the California Natural Diversity Data Base (NDDB) is probably the best system of its kind for tracking elements of biological diversity, there are a number of elements that would be expected within the region under proper habitat conditions for which NDDB reports no occurrences. In addition, there are several species expected for the region which, although not considered Special Animals by the Department of Fish and Game, would nonetheless be considered of local concern by knowledgeable individuals and local agencies, most notably the National Park Service, Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area (USDLNPS, 1982). In the following compilation of the animal species of concern for the region, each species is discussed briefly in terms of its legal, or other listing status, source(s) indicating that the species is present in the region, records for the region where known, and habitat preferences1.
Invertebrates
Insects
Monarch (Danaus plexippus) (Status: SA). Fall-migrating butterfly species which overwinters along the south coast. Can be found where its larval host plant (milkweed) occurs. Narrow leaf milkweed (Asclepias fascicular is), a larval host, is present, and adult monarchs were observed. There is a possibility of winter roosting by this species in the City, since suitable trees including oak, sycamore, and walnut are available, and the NDDB reports several local occurrences (exact locations are suppressed due to sensitivity).
Valley Oak Ant (Proceratium californicum) (F2, SA). Known from only a few collections in the Sacramento Valley and south coast ranges of California, including the type location at Tapia Park in the Santa Monica Mountains. Their range is

expected to coincide with that of valley oak (Quercus lobata), and perhaps other species as well. Species occurs in small colonies of perhaps 30 individuals in deep moist litter of woodland habitats. Little is known of their biology (Ward, 1988; Snelling, 1967). Although the City is within the known range of the species, too little is known of their habitat requirements upon which to base a conclusion regarding their presence here.
Vertebrates
Amphibians and Reptiles
Southwestern Arroyo Toad (Bufo microscaphus califomicus) (CSC, F2) (1, 4). Found in arroyos and canyon bottoms in oak woodland and coastal sage scrub communities of Los Angeles County (Dixon, 1967) and elsewhere from San Luis Obispo County to Baja California (Stebbins, 1972). Reported in the Santa Monica Mountains (De Lisle, et al., 1986), however, no additional information provided. Potential presence of species is questionable.
Ensatina (Ensatina eschscholtzi) (u). Found along the entire coast of California and the length of the Sierra Nevada western slope. Although it is most common in redwood and mixed conifer forests, it also occurs in mixed chaparral, oak woodland, and riparian woodland. Prefers moist but unsaturated soil. Many of the sites where this species has been recorded in the Santa Monica Mountains have been destroyed by development. There is suitable habitat for ensatinas in the oak and riparian woodlands in the City.
Arboreal Salamander (Aneides lugubris) (u). Most abundant in areas with good surface moisture or permanent water sources. Prefers valley-foothill hardwood and mixed conifer woodlands. In Southern California, arboreal salamanders may be found in chaparral. In any habitat, they are only active during wet weather. Suitable habitat for this species exists in the City.
Red-Legged Frog (Rana aurora draytoni) (CSC, F2) (4, 5). Found in areas with permanent water among oak woodland communities in Los Angeles County (Dixon, 1967) and elsewhere in coastal and Sierran mountain ranges from northern California to Baja California (Stebbins, 1972). Formerly found in all larger streams of the Santa Monica Mountains from Rustic Canyon to Trancas Canyon. Perhaps extirpated from the range. Last recorded sighting in 1975 (Sweet, 1983). Habitat is present, and the City may include historical range for the species, however, given the current status of this species in the range, it is not likely to be present.
Foothill Yellow-Legged Frog (Rana boylei) (CSC). Found in streams in arroyos and canyon bottoms in the oak woodland communities of Los Angeles County (Dixon, 1967) and elsewhere throughout cismontane California (Stebbins, 1972). Not specifically reported from the Santa Monica Mountains. Species prefers slow water

and wide pools. Habitat is present, however, there is no physical record of their occurrence in the range. Therefore, this species is thought to be absent.
Western Pond Turtle (Clemmys marmorata pallida) (Status*: CSC, F2) (Sources: 1, 2, 4, 5). Occurs in streams of the Los Angeles area, mostly in oak woodland and coastal sage scrub communities (Dixon, 1967). For Santa Monica Mountains: not common, declining. Populations persist in all of the original habitat from Topanga Creek to Point Mugu. This species requires riparian habitat with reasonably deep pools for escape from predators and for hibernation between late October and April.
(Coastal) Western Whiptail (Cnemidophorus tigris multiscutatus) (F2). The coastal race of the western whiptail is uncommon over most of its range. It occurs in a variety of habitats, including annual grasslands, oak woodlands, chaparral, coastal sage scrub, and valley-foothill riparian. It is found in scattered locations throughout the Santa Monica Mountains (DeLisle et al., 1986). There is suitable habitat for the western whiptail in the undisturbed chaparral and coastal sage scrub habitats in the City.
San Diego Coast Horned Lizard (Phrynosoma coronatum blainvillei) (F2, CSC) (1, 2). Found in variety of habitats (Dixon, 1967) in cismontane California from Los Angeles County to Baja California (Behler and King, 1979). The occurrence of the San Diego subspecies in the Santa Monica Mountains is questionable. De Lisle et al. (1986) indicate that the California subspecies (P. c. frontale) (CSC) is the one found here. However, literature and distribution maps (Dixon, 1967; Stebbins, 1966; Smith and Brodie, 1982; Behler and King, 1979) would suggest that the San Diego subspecies is present. Moreover, the California Natural Diversity Data Base (CDFG, 1988) includes several occurrences of the San Diego subspecies in the Santa Monica Mountains (as at Franklin Canyon, Stunt Ranch, Topanga Canyon, Tapia Park) as well as the surrounding region of the Los Angeles Basin, Verdugo Mountains, San Fernando Valley, Santa Susana Mountains and San Gabriel Mountains and Valley, and even the Antelope Valley. Any subspecies present in the range is considered sensitive. This species requires loose soil for burrowing, open areas for sunning, and abundant insect prey, especially harvester ants. These factors are present throughout the upland herbaceous and scrub habitats in the plan area. The horned lizard is considered to be a probable resident of the City.
Silvery Legless Lizard (Anniella p. pulchra) (U) (1, 2, 4, 5). Found in coastal sage scrub and oak woodland communities of Los Angeles County (Dixon, 1967) and elsewhere in loose alluvial soils and beach dunes from Contra Costa County southward to Baja California (Stebbins, 1972). For the Santa Monica Mountains: Prefers sandy areas within other major habitats. Formerly the largest population occurred at Point Dume, which has been severely affected by a housing tract. Populations occur scattered through the length of the range where not limited by heavy clay soils. Moist, sandy soils and surface litter buildup within the riparian City of w estlak e village General plan

and chaparral areas of the city appear to offer suitable conditions for this species. There is moderate potential for the presence of this species in the City.
San Diego Mountain Kingsnake (Lampropeltis zonata pulchra) (F2, CSC) (1, 2, 4, 5). Found in chaparral areas of coastal Los Angeles County (Dixon, 1967) and elsewhere in the transverse and peninsular ranges from the Santa Monica Mountains to Baja California (Stebbins, 1985). For the Santa Monica Mountains: Prefers canyon bottoms, but sometimes frequents adjacent coastal sage scrub, valley oak savannah, or southern oak woodland. Apparently limited to the coastal side of the range from Franklin and Solstice Canyon west up the Malibu drainage inland as far as Lake Eleanor (De Lisle et al., 1986). The secretive nature of this species make this range determination suspect, and conditions are probably suitable for this species in the City. There is moderate potential for the presence of this species in the City.
Hammond Two-Striped Garter Snake (Thamnophis h. hammondi) (F2, CSC) (1, 2, 4, 5). Found along streams in oak woodland communities of Los Angeles County (Dixon, 1967) and elsewhere in south coastal, transverse and peninsular ranges from San Luis Obispo County to Baja California (Stebbins, 1972; 1985). For the Santa Monica Mountains: Fairly common in the few remaining undisturbed habitats. It is severely affected by draining, dredging activities, and complete de-population has been known to occur, as at Lake Sherwood. Feeds upon toads and tree frogs, and occasionally lizards and small mice. Apparently hibernates beginning in September. Conditions are suitable for this species and it is considered a probable resident in the City.
Southwestern Blind Snake (Leptotyphlops humilis) (u) (5). Inhabitant of chaparral and Joshua tree forests of the Los Angeles area (Dixon, 1967). Very rare and known only from oak woodlands in the Malibu Creek drainage of the Santa Monica Mountains, feeding chiefly on termites (De Lisle, et al., 1986). This burrowing species requires loose soil or leaf litter. There is moderate potential for the presence of this species in the City.
San Bernardino Ringneck Snake (Diadophis punctatus modestus) (F2). Found in all habitat types in the Santa Monica Mountains (DeLisle et al., 1986). Prefers the cover of rocks, logs, boards, etc., where there is some dampness. Usually observed in open, relatively rocky areas. Reported as common but declining in the region (DeLisle et al., 1986). May occur in the City in rocky habitat.
Coast Patch-nosed Snake (Salvadora hexalepis virgultea) (F2). Widely distributed throughout California in a variety of habitats. Uncommon in the western half of the range in rocky areas within chaparral and canyon bottoms. Suitable habitat exists in the City and the patch-nosed snake may be present.

California Red-Sided Garter Snake (Thamnophis sirtalis infernalis) (u) (5). Found in permanent streams, but probably extirpated from the range, having been last reported in 1967. Formerly known from the Topanga and Malibu Creek drainages (De Lisle, et al., 1986). Suitable habitat is present, however, given the status of this species in the range, its presence in the City is questionable.
Western Yellow-bellied Racer (Coluber constrictor mormon) (u) (5). Found in chaparral and oak woodland communities of the Los Angeles Area, seeming to prefer the edge of wooded areas, open grassy fields, and brushy areas along streams (Dixon, 1967). Uncommonly found in open grassy areas in chaparral and coastal sage scrub, and nearby woodlands and streams (De Lisle, et al., 1986). There is moderate potential for the presence of this species in the City.
Red Coachwhip (Masticophis flagellum piceus) (u) (5). Occurs in coastal sage scrub, pinon-juniper woodland, and Joshua tree forest of the Los Angeles area (Dixon, 1967). Not common and limited to grassy areas of oak savanna, woodland, and chaparral of the upper Topanga and Las Virgenes drainages (De Lisle, et al., 1986). We question the reported limited distribution of this species in the range and forward that local conditions are suitable, and there is a moderate potential for the presence of this species in the City.
Birds
Great Blue Heron (Ardea herodias) (Status*: SA) (Source+: 1, 2,3 ). Fairly common resident throughout most of the region, breeding historically at Chatsworth and Santa Monica (Garrett and Dunn, 1981). Observed regularly in the local area, occasionally feeding along small streams. Abundance of crayfish and mosquito fish would appear to provide an attraction. This species is expected to utilize the City's open areas occasionally for foraging stops while traveling between larger wetland areas.
Least Bittern (Ixobrychus exilis) (CSC) (3). Rare year-round visitor to freshwater marshes, formerly at Lake Sherwood (USDLNPS, 1987). Primarily a resident of lake and marsh habitats, and a rare occurrence along the coast (Garrett and Dunn, 1981). There is moderate potential for the presence of this species in the City.
Black-Crowned Night-Heron (Nycticorax nycticorax) (SA) (1, 2, 3). Fairly common winter visitor and uncommon summer visitor in dense riparian areas (USDLNPS, 1987). Forages along the margins of lakes, bays, and marshes, roosting in dense trees, but not necessarily near feeding grounds, and nesting in colonies in trees (Grinnell and Miller, 1944). This species is expected as a visitor to the City.
California Condor (Gymnogyps californianus) (FE, CE, CP) (1, 3). Formerly a widespread resident in the foothill and montane regions of the south coastal, transverse, and southern Sierra Nevada mountain ranges. Until recently, no wild City of W estlake village General Plan

individuals existed. The Santa Monica Mountains are outside the recent range which corresponds to the proposed recovery range for the species (USFWS, 1984), although, following the planned re-introduction, there is moderate potential for the presence of this species in the City.
Osprey {Pandion haliaetus) (CSC). Rare to uncommon year-round resident; most widely noted in the fall and winter on the coast and in migration in the interior. Found along the coast and around larger bodies of water (Garrett and Dunn 1981). They are often observed at Lake Sherwood and are to be expected in the Westlake reservoir area.
Cooper's Hawk {Accipiter cooperi) (CSC, B) (1, 2, 3). Uncommon year-round resident and fairly common fall transient in oak woodland and riparian communities of the Santa Monica Mountains (USDLNPS, 1987). Nesting sites are predominantly in riparian groves of deciduous trees, although live oaks are sometimes used (Grinnell and Miller, 1944). Regularly seen in the region and expected to utilize the City at least during fall migration, although, nesting habitat would appear also to be present.
Sharp-Shinned Hawk {Accipiter striatus) (CSC, B) (1, 2, 3). Common fall transient and fairly common winter visitor in oak and riparian woodlands, chaparral and suburban areas of the Santa Monica Mountains (USDLNPS, 1987). Regularly observed in the region, and expected as a transient to the City.
Golden Eagle {Aquila chrysaetos) (CP, CSC) (1, 2, 3). Uncommon year-round resident of grasslands and oak savannah of the Santa Monica Mountains, nesting on cliffs (USDLNPS, 1987). The City is within the home range of one or a family of golden eagles, and known nesting sites are located nearby to the City (Plantrich, 1989).
Northern Harrier {Circus cyaneus) (CSC, B) (1, 2, 3). Fairly common winter and rare summer visitor to marshes and fields throughout (Garrett and Dunn, 1981). This species is occasionally observed in the region, and has been observed at the adjacent Dos Vientos Ranch toward the west. Regularly observed and expected to utilize the more open areas of the City for foraging on a transient basis.
Black-Shouldered Kite {Elanus caerulea) (SA, CP) (1, 2, 3). Uncommon year-round resident of grassy and cultivated fields, marshes, and riparian habitat (USDLNPS, 1987) Seems to prefer a combination of open grasslands, meadows, or marshes for foraging, primarily for meadow mice, and nearby isolated, dense-topped trees for perching and nesting. Habitat is present but considered marginal in quality and size. There is moderate potential for the presence of this species, primarily as a visitant, or perhaps for winter roosting.

Chapter III Natural Resources
Ferruginous Hawk {Buteo regalis) (F2, CSC). Fairly common winter visitant to grassland and agricultural regions of the desert and some valleys in the interior of the coastal district (Garrett and Dunn, 1981). This species does not nest in the state, but Southern California is important as wintering habitat. It is expected to occur in the grasslands and open fields within the City.
Red-Shouldered Hawk {Buteo lineatus) (B) (1, 2, 3). Fairly common year-round resident of riparian and oak woodlands (USDLNPS, 1987). Commonly observed in the City; probably a resident nesting species.
Prairie Falcon {Falco mexicanus) (CSC) (1, 3). Rare winter and casual summer visitor to grassy and cultivated fields and rocky hills in the Santa Monica Mountains (USDLNPS, 1987). Prairie falcons are generally birds of open areas and generally shun heavily wooded areas. Nesting has been recorded recently in the western Santa Monica Mountains (Garrett and Dunn, 1981). There is moderate potential for the presence of this species in the City.
American Peregrine Falcon {Falco peregrinus anatum) (FE, CE, CP) (1,2). Rare winter and casual summer visitor to estuaries, lakes, streams and marshes. Last known to have nested in the Santa Monica Mountains in the mid-1950s. Nine captive-bred fledglings have been reintroduced to the mountains from 1981-1983 (USDLNPS, 1987). Peregrines prefer coastal estuaries where the are concentrations of waterfowl and shorebirds upon which they prey. Conditions in the City are marginally suitable and there is low potential for the presence of this species in the City.
Merlin {Falco columbarius) (SC) (1, 2, 3). Uncommon fall transient and rare winter visitor found in open woodlands, riparian areas and estuaries. Few records exist for the region, but species may be more common than records indicate (Garrett and Dunn, 1981). There is moderate potential for the presence of this species in the City.
Barn Owl {Tyto alba) (SC) (1, 2, 3). Fairly common year-round resident of grasslands with nearby trees or buildings, oak savannah and residential areas (USDLNPS, 1987). Commonly observed in the region and anticipated as a resident in the City.
Long-Eared Owl {Asio otus) (CSC) (1, 2, 3). Rare transient and winter visitor; casual summer visitor to riparian woodlands and willow thickets, although once fairly common breeding residents (USDLNPS, 1987). Suitable habitat for this species is present and the City is probably historical breeding habitat. This species is expected to have a low potential for presence in the City, primarily as a visitor.
Short-Eared Owl {Asio flammeus) (CSC) (1, 3). Uncommon winter visitor and rare to casual spring and fall transient to open marshes, estuaries and grasslands. Formerly a common winter visitor (USDLNPS, 1987). Prefers swamp lands,

lowland meadows, and irrigated agricultural fields, with adjacent tule patches or tall grass for daytime seclusion (Grinnel and Miller, 1944). There is low potential for the presence of this species in the City.
Burrowing Owl (Athene cunicularia) (CSC) (1, 3). Rare, year-round resident of grassland and open scrub (USDLNPS, 1987). This species is commensal with California ground squirrel, whose burrows they utilize. There is moderate potential for the presence of this species in the City.
Lewis' Woodpecker (Melanerptes lewis') (SC) (1, 2, 3). Irregularly rare to uncommon winter visitor to oak and riparian woodlands (USDLNPS, 1987). This species utilizes a variety of woodland habitats, and in the coastal district they are partial to oaks (Garrett and Dunn, 1981). There is moderate potential for the presence of this species in the City.
Black Swift (Cypseloides niger) (CSC) (1, 2, 3). Rare spring and fall transient which may be seen over any habitat (USDLNPS, 1987). Requires waterfall areas in steep canyons for nesting, and is a rare transient away from breeding locations. Conditions for nesting are absent from the City, although there is moderate potential for the transient presence of this species in the City.
Willow flycatcher (Empidonax traillii) (CSC) (1, 2, 3). Uncommon to fairly common spring and fall transient to riparian woodlands and willow thickets. Once a fairly common summer resident but no longer breeding in the Santa Monica Mountains (USDLNPS, 1987). Suitable breeding habitat may be present, but the City is outside of the known breeding range. There is low potential for the presence of this species in the City.
Purple Martin (Progne subis) (CSC, SC) (1, 2, 3). Rare spring transient, previously a fairly common summer resident. Declines due to competition for nesting space with European starling (USDLNPS, 1987). For breeding, typically utilizes areas where large trees which afford large holes in their trunks or branches, created by large woodpeckers such as acorn woodpecker, Lewis' woodpecker, or northern flicker. These conditions would appear to be present in the woodlands of the City, but there is low potential for their presence here as a breeding species, as most records for the region are at higher elevations.
Bank Swallow (Riparia riparia) (CSC) (1, 3). Rare spring and fall transient, formerly a fairly common summer resident (USDLNPS, 1987), but now virtually extirpated from the region as a breeder (Garrett and Dunn, 1981). Specialized summer nesting requirement for vertical banks or bluffs of sandy soil such as sea bluffs and stream banks in the lower courses of streams. Foraging widely over meadow, prairie, or marshes. Nesting habitat is probably absent in the City, although, it is considered that there is moderate potential for this species to forage here during migration.

Western Bluebird (Sialia mexicana) (S, SC) (1, 2, 3). Uncommon year-round resident of oak woodlands, declining due to competition for nesting sites with European starling (USDLNPS, 1987). In fact, this species probably does not breed in the range, preferring instead the higher elevation conifer and oak woodlands of the interior. In winter, they are regularly seen in the range when there is an erratic downslope movement to the coastal lowlands (Garrett and Dunn, 1981). A regularly observed resident of the City.
Loggerhead Shrike (Lanius ludovicianus) (S, B) (2, 3). Uncommon year-round resident of grasslands, open woodlands and broken chaparral; numbers augmented in winter (USDLNPS, 1987). Absent from the more heavily wooded and urbanized portions of the coastal district (Garrett and Dunn, 1981). A regularly observed resident of the City.
California Gnatcatcher (Polioptila californica) (F2, CSC, SC) (3). Uncommon and local resident in arid coastal sages scrub and cactus scrub habitats of the San Gabriel Mountains and Palos Verdes Peninsula southward. Formerly nesting in the Santa Clara River of Ventura County and in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles County (Garrett and Dunn, 1981), but perhaps extirpated from the northern portion by the 1920s (Garrett, 1992). Habitat requirements are for low, fairly dense tracts of xerophilous brush on mesas and bajadas, or in dry washes. Nesting within three feet of the ground. Typical associations preferred include coastal sagebrush, laurel sumac, sage, or cactus. These conditions exist generally in the local area. However, the City is outside of the recent historical range for the species and there is low potential for its presence.
Least Bell's Vireo (Vireo belli pusillus) (FE, CE) (3). Formerly a fairly common summer resident, but now a rare summer resident of willow and riparian habitats and restricted to southern California. Breeding sites are presently concentrated along the Santa Ynez, Santa Clara, Santa Ana, Santa Margarita and San Luis Rey Rivers. No recent records for the Santa Monica Mountains (USDLNPS, 1987). Preferred habitat includes low riparian growth, either in the vicinity of water or in dry parts of river bottoms. Activity is centered within a few feet of the ground, in the fairly open twigs canopied above by the foliage of willow and cottonwoods. Most typical plants found are willow, mule fat, and wild blackberry, less commonly live and valley oaks, wild grape, poison oak and sumac (Grinnell and Miller, 1944). For nesting, these vireos prefer bottomland riparian conditions, where dense vegetation is unbroken for 10 meters or more, rather than narrow canyons with lesser lateral extent of vegetation (Garrett, K., personal communication). Hendricks and Reiger (1988) concluded that although this species is a generalist nester, that restoration plans for vireo habitat should incorporate a persistent low and high shrub layer and a tree canopy. Conditions for this species may be marginal for nesting of this species, although, the City is within the present and historical range City 6~f Westlake village General plan

for the species, and there is moderate potential for the presence of this species in the City.
Tricolored Blackbird (Agelaius tricolor) (F2) (1, 3). Uncommon year-round resident breeding especially in cattail marshes (USDLNPS, 1987) Populations are very localized with specific requirement for marsh habitat. There is moderate potential for the presence of this species in the City.
Yellow Warbler (Dendroica petechia brewsteri) (CSC) (2, 3). Fairly common summer resident and common spring and fall transient; casual in winter. Inhabits riparian woodlands, favoring cottonwood trees (USDLNPS, 1987). Prefers riparian associations of willow, cottonwood, sycamore, and alders. Orchard and shade trees in cities are sometimes occupied, as are oaks, particularly deciduous species along stream courses (Grinnell and Miller, 1944). Suitable habitat appears to be present and the species is considered to have moderate potential for occurrence in the City.
Yellow-Breasted Chat (Icteria virens) (CSC) (3). Uncommon summer resident and rare fall transient to riparian habitats. Formerly a common summer resident (USDLNPS, 1987). For breeding prefers dense riparian growth, commonly of willow and tangles of blackberry and grape vines (Grinnell and Miller, 1944). Suitable habitat appears to be present and the species is considered to have moderate potential for occurrence in the City.
Western Yellow-billed Cuckoo (Coccyzus americanus occidentalis) (CT, F2). Formerly much more common and widespread, particularly in the coastal district, where it nested in the lowland stream courses of coastal Los Angeles and Ventura Counties (Garrett and Dunn, 1981). Preferred habitat of river bottomlands with dense old growth of willow, often with cottonwoods, and a tangled understory of blackberry, nettle, or wild grape (Grinnell and Miller, 1944). Conditions would appear suitable for this species in the City. An individual was observed at nearby Arroyo Conejo during October, 1990 (Wishner, 1990). The potential for the occurrence of this species is considered moderate, at least on a transient basis.
Southern California Rufous-crowned Sparrow (Aimophila ruficeps canescens) (F2). Found on steep, rocky slopes with sparse brush intermixed with grassy areas. Most often found in coastal sage scrub, and is absent from dense chaparral (Garrett and Dunn, 1981). Although there is limited suitable habitats for rufous-crowned sparrow in the City its potential for occurrence is considered moderate.
Mammals
Spotted Bat (Euderma maculatum) (Status*: F2). Rare, known in southern California from widely scattered records (Booth, 1968; Jameson and Peeters, 1988). Appear to roost mainly in rock crevices and females favor Ponderosa Pine forest during reproductive season (Williams, 1986). Abundance and pattern of

distribution not understood, winter range unknown (Barbour and Davis, 1979). Too few data upon which to base conclusions about potential for occurrence in the City.
Pallid Bat (Antrozous pallidas') (SA). Ranges from the southwestern deserts in the central plateau of Mexico, north through California, and east of the coast range in Oregon and Washington, to southern British Columbia and in the low elevations of Nevada, east to the Edwards Plateau of Texas; probably a permanent resident throughout most of its range. It occurs in a variety of habitats throughout its range, including grasslands, shrublands, and woodlands at all elevations where there are suitable roost sites. This species probably occurs in the City only during foraging bouts, as roost sites are sensitive to disturbance.
Pale Big-Eared Bat (Plecotus townsendi pallescens) (SA). Occurs throughout California except the humid coastal regions of northern and central California (Williams, 1986). Roosting sites in California include limestone caves, lava tubes, mine tunnels and buildings. Habitat must include roosting maternity, and hibernacula sites free from disturbances by humans, as a single visit can cause them to abandon a roost (Williams, 1986). A late-flying species that begins foraging after dark, and is rarely taken in mist nets (Barbour and Davis, 1979). Too few data upon which to base conclusions about potential for occurrence in the City.
California Leaf-Nose Bat (Macrotis californicus) (CSC). Ranging from sea coast through desert region of the Sonoran life zone (Barbour and Davis, 1969). Occurring throughout southern California from southern Ventura and Los Angeles Counties to eastern San Bernardino County and southward (Jameson and Peeters, 1988). Prefers rock-walled canyons where open water is readily available (Barbour and Davis, 1969). Too few data upon which to base conclusions about potential for occurrence in the City.
California Mastiff Bat (Eumops perotis californicus) (CSC, F2). Uncommon from Alameda, Tuolomne and Stanislaus Counties southward through the sierra, south coast, transverse and peninsular ranges to Baja California (Ingles, 1965; Jameson and Peeters, 1988). Resident at low elevations in the coastal basins of California, favoring rugged, rocky areas with suitable crevices for day roosts (Williams, 1986). Occurs in rocky canyons and cliffs, using crevices as daytime retreats (Barbour and Davis, 1969). Too few data upon which to base conclusions about potential for occurrence in the City.
Ringtail (Bassariscus astutus) (CP) (1). Occurs the entire length of California along the coastal ranges and Sierra Nevada (Ingles, 1965). Principal habitat requirement seem to be den sites among boulders or within hollow trees and food in the form of rodents or other small prey. There is moderate potential for the presence of this species in the City.

Long-Tailed Weasel (Mustela frenata) (U) (1, 2). Occurs throughout the Pacific states, except on the deserts (Ingles, 1965) Prefers riparian habitat (USDLFWS, 1990). This species is a probable resident in the City.
American Badger (Taxidea taxus) (CSC) (1). Occurs throughout the Pacific states, except the north coastal forests (Ingles, 1965). They have been extirpated from many areas of southern California through habitat loss, deliberate killing, and secondary poisoning. They occupy a diversity of habitats, preferring friable soils, and relatively uncultivated ground of grassland, savannah and meadow, preying on gophers, ground squirrels, and kangaroo rats (Williams, 1986). This species is a probable resident in the City.
Mountain Lion (Felis concolor) (U) (1, 2). Occurs throughout the coastal and Sierra Nevada mountain ranges of California (Ingles, 1965). The population in the Santa Monica Mountains is estimated to be seven individuals (Leiberstein et al., 1987). This species is very secretive, and will generally shun areas near human habitation. There are larger tracts of remote land adjacent to the City that are suitable for mountain lion. The City's open space may serve as a focal point for wildlife activities, including that of the few mountain lion thought to remain in the range. There is moderate potential for occurrence of this species in the City.
In addition to the extensive listing and discussion above, there are additional species (birds) which have recently been identified as being of concern for southern California (USDLFWS, 1990), In the interest of brevity, these will not be discussed in detail here, but it should be noted that the following are expected to occur in the City: belted kingfisher, hairy woodpecker, blue-gray gnatcatcher, warbling vireo, Wilson's warbler, blue grosbeak, and lazuli bunting.
3.	BIOLOGICAL SENSITIVITY
The natural areas within the City have been assessed as to their overall biological sensitivity, a term which refers to an area's importance as a vegetation and wildlife habitat. Although any natural area provides a refuge for native species, certain types of communities are considered more sensitive (i.e., more important) than others on the basis of the following criteria:
•	overall distribution and abundance of natural community on a local and regional basis;
•	presence of plant or wildlife species that are declining in numbers or are uncommon, rare or endangered;
•	degree of disturbance;
•	native plant and wildlife species diversity;
•	overall size of natural community; and

Based on these criteria, a natural area of highest sensitivity is one which supports a community restricted in distribution, harbors unique or declining species, lacks major urban-related disturbances such as loud noises, traffic or impacts on vegetation, is composed of a large number and variety of native species as opposed to only a few, is large in area, and which provides a wildlife movement corridor from one natural area to another.
In general, the biotic communities located within the City of Westlake Village have been assigned the following sensitivity levels:
Biotic Communities	Sensitivitv
Oak Woodland Riparian Woodland	Very High
Oak Savannah Rock Outcrops	High
Mixed Chaparral & Grassland Coastal Sage Scrub	Moderate
Grassland	Low
Weedy Field Bare Ground	Very Low
Those communities with a "Very High" or "High" biological sensitivity have been designated as "Sensitive Biological Communities" in Figure 33 and should therefore be subject to special study as part of any development which could affect the habitat.
4.	INVENTORY OF BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES
More detailed evaluations of the undeveloped areas of the City or open space areas which contain sensitive biological resources are given below (see Figure 33 for area identification).
Area A supports well-preserved oak woodlands, coastal sage scrub and grassland. These biotic communities provide valuable foraging and roosting habitat for sensitive birds of prey and contain a varied array of native spring flowers. The oak woodland contains large valley and coast live oaks.
Area B supports expanses of oak savannah containing numerous healthy oak trees and provides critical foraging and roosting areas for sensitive birds of prey. Of particular sensitivity on this site are the narrow riparian corridors located near the southwestern and eastern boundaries.

Area C is considered highly sensitive. The area is extremely biologically diverse, as it encompasses a very dense coast live oak woodland, a more open oak savannah and an annual grassland, all of which are nearly undisturbed habitats. The area is heavily utilized by native wildlife due to the large variety of vegetation present within a relatively small area. This area has become a dedicated open space area as part of the Westlake Spectrum development.
Area D consists of rugged brush-covered slopes similar to those surrounding the Westlake reservoir. Native wildlife are expected to be particularly abundant in this area due to its position adjacent to remote open space. Some of the rocky slopes in this area also support abundant spring wildflowers of botanical and aesthetic interest.
Area E contains a portion of Triunfo Canyon, an area rich in native trees and wildlife. The canyon bottom and creek banks of Triunfo Canyon are highly sensitive, as they support dense riparian thickets and trees and clusters of oak trees which provide cover and shelter to native wildlife. These species appear tolerant of the noise and movement generated by the mobile home park to the east.
Area F encompasses an oak woodland which is considered highly sensitive. However, unauthorized use of the area for trash disposal has detracted from its overall ecological condition.
Area G consists of slopes and ridges surrounding the reservoir. This area constitutes a remote and relatively undisturbed natural area dominated by chaparral and grassland. This type of community once covered virtually all the rugged terrain of the City but is now primarily limited to this reservoir region. The entire area constitutes a large contiguous natural area rich in wildlife (including secretive non-urban forms such as bobcats and mountain lions). The overall sensitivity of the area is considered high.
Area H encompasses relatively undisturbed chaparral and grassland similar to that surrounding the reservoir. In addition, a mixed oak/sycamore riparian woodland lines the canyon in the western portion of the area. The woodland is the area's most significant and biologically sensitive habitat, as it is composed of vigorous native trees and provides a suitable roosting and nesting habitat for sensitive birds of prey. The brush-covered slopes are valuable as undisturbed natural lands which form a contiguous ecological unit with dedicated open space areas to the northeast. The eastern 102 acres of the area are owned by COSCA.

B.	VISUAL RESOURCES/SCENIC HIGHWAYS
The Santa Monica Mountains provide the predominant scenic backdrop for the City of Westlake Village and serve to define its southern and easterly boundaries. The area of the City generally south and east of Triunfo Canyon and Lindero Canyon Roads is comprised of foothills and ridgelines which transition into steeply-sloping terrain accented by volcanic rock outcroppings. Figure 34 depicts the natural topographic characteristics of the City's undeveloped areas.
The high visibility of most of the City's hillsides and ridgelines requires that particular attention be given to development within these areas in order to preserve their visual amenities. The southeastern ridgeline is especially important in that it provides a physical separation between the City and the area outside the city limits to the south. The City's prominent ridgelines, defined as those which form a part of the skyline visible from any City arterial, are shown in Figure 10.
Other significant visual resources within the City include the tree-lined parkways and landscaped medians of all major arterials; Westlake Lake, which is surrounded by landscaped shores and frequently dotted with sailboats; Westlake Golf Course, which is heavily vegetated and provides a pleasant stretch of open space along both Agoura Road and the Ventura Freeway; and Westlake Reservoir, which due to its location and elevation, is primarily visible from adjacent hillside neighborhoods.
1.	SCENIC CORRIDORS
There are no highways, presently within the City, designated as part of the State Scenic Highway system. However, opportunities for preserving scenic corridors within the City exist along Decker Road and Ventura Freeway.
Decker Road traverses undisturbed, mountainous terrain and affords exceptional views of oak woodland, heavily-vegetated hillsides and volcanic peaks. A significant portion of this view corridor is preserved as Las Virgenes Municipal Water District open space. However, development of the expanse of land lying between Decker Road and the Water District's permanent open space could obstruct these views or negatively impact the existing landscape. Therefore, it is of great importance that future development within this area be well integrated with the natural environment to maintain the visual qualities of the Decker Road corridor. Visual impacts could be minimized by clustering development and/or maintaining most of the property in open space (especially that portion contiguous to the LVMWD open space).
Although located in an urbanized setting, the Ventura Freeway corridor provides significant views of the City. Travelers presently receive agreeable impressions of the City through views of the golf course, the Santa Monica Mountains backdrop

and well-designed business park development. The City is currently cooperating with the City of Agoura Hills and the City of Thousand Oaks in seeking designation of the freeway as a State Scenic Highway. The freeway scenic corridor may extend as far as Agoura Road on the south, and a similar distance on the north. Design review of new development which will be readily visible from the freeway will be required to preserve and enhance the scenic amenities of this corridor.
2.	STREETSCAPE
The City's major arterials (Lindero Canyon Road, Agoura Road, Triunfo Canyon Road, and Thousand Oaks Boulevard) all have landscaped medians. These streets, and many others, are lined with parkways and trees. Almost all of the City's neighborhoods also have parkway plantings which generally are maintained by the City. The City is also implementing an ongoing reforestation program which involves removing older or damaged trees and replacing them with species which are more drought tolerant and less damaging to public improvements.

C.	OPEN SPACE
Open space is defined by State law as any area of land or water dedicated to the following general categories of uses:
•	Preservation of natural resources;
•	Managed production of resources;
•	Provision of outdoor recreation; and
•	Protection of the public health and safety.
Approximately 37% (1,298.27 acres) of the City's land area is devoted to open space uses. These uses are inventoried in Table 30 by open space category and are discussed below.
1.	NATURAL RESOURCES PRESERVATION
Opportunities for natural resources preservation within the City through the provision of open space are generally limited to biological resources and watershed areas, which are discussed in their respective sections within this chapter.
2.	MANAGED PRODUCTION OF RESOURCES
As can be seen from Table 30, the City contains no open space devoted to the management of resource production, nor is it likely that the City will ever support such activities as timber harvesting, fishing or resource extraction. An evaluation of the City's agricultural capability indicates that the area had historically been used for dry farming, grazing, and limited orchard and crop production. However, the most productive soils in the City generally underlie existing urban development, while most of the undeveloped areas are considered only moderately productive.
Future agricultural uses within the City are highly unlikely due to potential interface problems between urban development and commercial farming (i.e., noise, odor, dust, pesticides) and the fact that parcels suitable for farming based on soil capability are scattered and small in size.
3.	PROVISION OF OUTDOOR RECREATION
The maintenance of open space for outdoor recreation and scenic resource purposes is discussed within Chapter Two, Infrastructure and Community Services, and the Visual Resources section of this chapter, respectively.
4.	PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY PRESERVATION
Please refer to Chapter Four, Hazards, for a discussion of hazard areas to be preserved as open space.

D.	WATERSHED AREAS
1.	WATERSHED PRESERVATION
The high quality of water contained in Westlake Reservoir and Westlake Lake must be ensured through appropriate conservation practices. The protection of the reservoir's 600-acre watershed is of particular importance, in that it serves as the City's drinking water supply. The limits of the watershed area are shown in Figure 13. A portion of this area is already preserved as open space and owned by Las Virgenes Municipal Water District.
The management of runoff into Westlake Lake is important in order to limit fertilizers and pesticides, which generate excessive sedimentation and algae growth and adversely affect the fish stock. Development within the Triunfo Canyon watershed must also be regulated to limit the effects of erosion, runoff and pollutant impacts on the riparian environment found on the canyon bottom and creek banks. This habitat is biologically significant, as it provides water and shelter to native wildlife.
2.	GOALS, POLICIES, AND PROGRAMS
The following presents the goals, objectives, and policies for Watershed Areas in the City of Westlake Village. At the end of each policy is a listed "I" and number in parentheses which refers to a corresponding implementation program.

Chapter III Natural Resources
E.	SCARCE RESOURCES
1.	ENERGY RESOURCES
All traditional energy resources consumed by the residents of the City of Westlake Village are imported, as there are no deposits of oil, natural gas and coal found within its limits. The limited availability of such energy sources has become increasingly apparent. Additionally, recent restrictions on water importation have caused the resource of imported water to be added to the list of scarce resources.
It is evident that man's continued and future activities are dependent on the conservation of existing, and the development of new, resources. The City can promote these actions by creating patterns of land use which reduce reliance upon the automobile and vehicle miles traveled, encouraging structural designs which reduce heat gain and loss, supporting water conservation measures and furthering the use of alternative energy sources.
Existing State regulations require the incorporation of energy-saving design features into new residential development. Section 66473.1 of the Government Code requires that a tentative tract map provide, to the extent feasible, for future passive or natural heating or cooling opportunities in the subdivision. These opportunities include designing the lot sizes and configurations to permit orienting structures so as to take advantage of a southern exposure, shade or prevailing breezes. All new construction (both residential and non-residential) is also required to comply with "energy budget" standards which establish maximum allowable energy use from depletable sources. These requirements apply to such design components as structural insulation, air infiltration and leakage control, setback features on thermostats, water heating system insulation (tanks and pipes) and swimming pool covers if a pool is equipped with a fossil fuel or electric heater. The California Energy Commission is responsible for establishing and monitoring building standards for both residential and non-residential structures which will result in increased energy efficiency.
2.	WATER RESOURCES
The City is located in the rain poor Mediterranean climate of the Los Angeles Basin. As such, much of the City's water supply is imported from other areas. In an effort to utilize limited water resources efficiently, the City currently uses reclaimed water from LVMWD to irrigate medians and parkway landscaping. LVMWD requires the installation of double piping in all new development to allow for the use of reclaimed water, where available.

Chapter III Natural Resources
F.	AIR QUALITY
The City of Westlake Village's air quality, like other natural resources, is limited. Within any time period, the local air basin has a restricted ability to dilute contaminants and maintain air quality air levels which do not adversely affect the population.
1.	CLIMATIC CONDITIONS
The City is located within the South Coast Air Basin at the boundary with the Ventura County portion of the South Central Coast Air Basin. The South Coast Air Basin is a 6,600 square mile basin encompassing all of Orange County, most of Los Angeles and Riverside Counties, and the western portion of San Bernardino County.
The climate of the South Coast Air Basin is determined by latitude, proximity to the eastern Pacific Ocean, and topography. The region is generally dominated by the Hawaiian subtropical high pressure zone of the eastern Pacific Ocean. The climate is mild because of the cool sea breezes; but can be interrupted by periods of extremely hot weather, winter storms, or Santa Ana winds.
The closest weather station which records both temperature and precipitation is located at Pierce College in Canoga Park, about 16 miles northeast of the City. The maximum temperature, averaged over the year, is 70.8° Fahrenheit. The minimum temperature, averaged over the year, is 47.1° Fahrenheit. The city's temperature range is probably slightly narrower given its closer proximity to the moderating influence of the Pacific Ocean. Precipitation at the Canoga Park station occurs mainly between November and April, with about 4 inches falling in the month of January. The station's 30-year average annual precipitation level is 16.00 inches. The City's precipitation level is expected to be comparable. The most representative wind monitoring station is located in Reseda, about 20 miles northeast of the city. Predominant winds at this location blow from the east 28.1% of the year at an annual average speed of 2.4 miles per hour.
2.	AIR POLLUTION
Air pollution forms either directly or indirectly from pollutants emitted from a variety of sources. These sources can be natural, such as oil seeps, vegetation, or windblown dust. Emissions may also result from combustion, as in automobile engines; from evaporation of organic liquids, such as those used in coating and cleaning processes; or through abrasion, such as from tires or roadways.
The topography and climate of southern California combine to make the Basin an area of high air pollution potential. The Hawaiian subtropical high pressure zone of CITY OF WESTLAKE VILLAGE GENERAL PLAN

Chapter III Natural Resources
warm and dry descending air restricts the movement of cooler air near the surface and frequently results in the formation of temperature inversions. Persistent temperature inversions restrict the vertical dispersion of air pollutants. When a persistent inversion layer is combined with sunlight and air pollutants, photochemical smog frequently results. Light winds, low mixing heights and sunshine are favorable conditions for the production of photochemical oxidants from spring through autumn. High sulfate concentrations often occur during spring and summer. High carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide and nitrate concentrations are associated with strong surface temperatures inversions and calm winds during winter nights November through January.
Concern over the poor air quality in southern California is based on the significant health and economic impacts of air pollution. An SCAQMD report (June, 1989) indicates that ozone causes basin residents to experience coughing, eye irritation, sore throats, headaches, chest discomfort, and minor restrictions in activities for millions of person-days per year. Air pollution impacts are particularly acute for sensitive receptors, such as children, senior citizens and those with respiratory conditions.
State and Federal agencies have established ambient air quality standards for specific air pollutants. The characteristics, sources and effects of these air contaminants are provided in Table 31. National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) have been established for carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), sulfur oxides (SOX), nitrogen oxides (NOX), fine particulate matter (PM10) and lead (Pb). The State of California has established ambient air quality standards for additional pollutants. The State of California standards are generally more stringent than corresponding Federal standards. The ambient air quality standards (both State and Federal) for ten air pollutants are provided in Table 32. Episodes of potentially unhealthful air can be described as Stages 1 through 3. State and Federal episodic criteria defining each stage and the actions to be taken are provided in Table 33.
Since the end of World War II, the Basin has experienced faster population growth than the rest of the nation. Although per capita emissions have been reduced substantially in the Basin through 40 years of controls, increases in the population over that time have made substantial overall emission reductions more difficult. Many sources such as automobiles have been significantly controlled. However, increases in the number of sources, particularly those growing proportionately to population, reduce the potential air quality benefits of new controls. The net result is that unless dramatic steps are taken to control air pollution - at a much faster rate than ever before - growth will overwhelm the improvements expected from the existing control program.
Ozone levels have declined by almost half over the past 30 years, sulfur dioxide and lead standards have been met, and other criteria pollutant concentrations have City of w estlake village General plan

TABLE 31
Selected Air Contaminants and Emission Comparisons PHOTOCHEMICAL OXIDANT (Ox)
Characteristics - The term "photochemical oxidant" can include several different pollutants, but consists primarily of ozone (more than 90 percent) and a group of chemicals called organic peroxynitrates. Photochemical oxidants are created in the atmosphere rather than emitted directly into the air. Reactive organic gases, including hydrocarbons, and oxides of nitrogen are the emitted contaminants which participate in the reaction. Ozone is a pungent, colorless toxic gas which is produced by the photochemical process. Photochemical oxidant is a characteristic of southern California type smog, and reaches highest concentrations during the summer and early fall.
Sources - Photochemical smog is caused by complex atmospheric reactions involving oxides of nitrogen and reactive organic gases with ultraviolet energy from sunlight. Motor vehicles are the major source of oxides of nitrogen and reactive organic gases in the basin.
Effects - The common manifestations of oxidants are damage to vegetation and cracking of untreated rubber. Photochemical oxidants in high concentrations can also directly affect the lungs, causing respiratory irritation and possible changes in lung functions.
CARBON MONOXIDE (CO)
Characteristics - CO is a colorless, odorless, toxic gas produced through the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels. Concentrations are higher in winter when more fuel is burned and weather conditions favor the build-up of directly emitted contaminants.
Sources - The use of gasoline powered engines is the major source of this contaminant, with the automobiles being the primary contributor. However, various industrial processes also produce CO emissions through incomplete combustion of fossil fuels.
Effects - CO does not irritate the respiratory tract, however, it passes through the lungs directly into the blood stream and, by interfering with the transfer of oxygen, deprives sensitive tissues of oxygen. NITROGEN OXIDES (NOx)
Characteristics - It primarily consists of nitric oxides (NO) (a colorless, odorless gas formed from atmospheric nitrogen and oxygen when petroleum combustion takes place under high temperatures and/or pressure) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) (a reddish-brown irritating gas formed by the combination of nitric oxide with oxygen).
Sources - High combustion temperatures cause nitrogen and oxygen to combine and form nitric oxide. Further reaction produces additional oxides of nitrogen. Combustion in motor vehicle engines, power plants, refineries and other industrial operations are the primary sources in the region. Ships, railroads and aircraft are other significant emitters.
Effects - Oxides of nitrogen are direct participants in photochemical smog reactions. The emitted compound, nitric oxide, combines with oxygen in the atmosphere in the presence of hydrocarbons and sunlight, to form nitrogen dioxide and ozone. Nitrogen dioxide, the most significant of these pollutants, can color the atmosphere at concentrations as low as 0.5 ppm on days of 210-mile visibility. NOx is an important air pollutant in the region because it is a primary receptor of ultraviolet light which initiates the reactions producing photochemical smog. It will also react in the air to form nitrate particulates.
SULFUR DIOXIDE (SO2)
Characteristics - SO2 is a colorless, pungent, irritating gas formed primarily by the combustion of sulfur-containing fossil fuels. In humid atmospheres some of SO2 may be changed to sulfur trioxide and CITY OF W ESTLAKE V I LL A GE GENERAL PLAN
ni-42
Chapter III Natural Resources
TABLE 31 (continued)
sulfuric acid mist, with some of the latter eventually reacting with other materials to produce sulfate particulates.
Sources - This contaminant is the natural combustion product of sulfur or sulfur-containing fuels. Fuel combustion is the major source, while chemical plants, sulfur recovery plants, and metal processing are minor contributors.
Effects - SO2 appears able to do still greater harm by injuring lung tissues. Sulfur oxides, in combination with moisture and oxygen, can yellow the leaves of plants, dissolve marble and eat away iron and steel. Sulfur oxides can also react to give sulfates which reduce visibility and cut down the light from the sun.
PARTICULATES (TSP and PM10)
Characteristics - Atmospheric particulates are made up of finely divided solids or liquids such as soot, dust, aerosols, fumes and mists. About 90% by weight of the emitted particles are larger than 10 microns in diameter, but about 90% of the total number of particulates are less than 5 microns in diameter. The aerosols formed in the atmosphere, primarily sulfate and nitrate, are usually smaller than 1 micron. In areas close to major sources, particulate concentrations are generally higher in the winter, when more fuel is burned, and meteorological conditions favor the build-up of directly-emitted contaminants. However, in areas remote from major sources and subject to photochemical smog, particulate concentrations are higher during summer months.
Sources - Particulate matter consists of particles in the atmosphere resulting from many kinds of dust and fume-producing industrial and agricultural operations, from combustion, and from atmospheric photochemical reactions. Natural activities also put particulates into the atmosphere; wind-raised dust and ocean spray are two such sources of particulates.
Effects - In the respiratory tract very small particles of certain substances may produce injury by themselves, or may contain absorbed gases that are injurious. Suspended in the air, particulates of aerosol size can both scatter and absorb sunlight, producing haze and reducing visibility. They can also cause a wide range of damage to materials.
HYDROCARBONS AND OTHER ORGANIC GASES (THC, CH4, NMHC, AHC, NHC)
Characteristics - Any of the vast family of compounds consisting of hydrogen and carbon in various combinations are known as hydrocarbons. Fossil fuels are included in this group. Many hydrocarbon compounds are major air pollutants, and those which can be classified as olefins or aromatics are highly photochemically reactive. Atmospheric hydrocarbon concentrations are generally higher in winter because the reactive hydrocarbons react more slowly in the winter and meteorological conditions are more favorable to their accumulating in the atmosphere to higher concentration before producing photochemical oxidants.
Sources - Motor vehicles are a major source of anthropogenic hydrocarbons (AHC) in the basin. Other sources include evaporation of organic solvents and petroleum refining and marketing operations. Trees are the principal emitters of biogenic or natural hydrocarbons (NHC) (Chameides, 1988).
Effects - Certain hydrocarbons can damage plants by inhibiting growth and causing flowers and leaves to fall. Levels of hydrocarbons currently measured in urban areas are not known to cause adverse effects in humans. However, certain members of this contaminant group are important components in the reactions which produce photochemical oxidants.

significantly declined. However, the Basin still experiences exceedances of health-based standards for ozone, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter under ten microns (PMio).
3.	CURRENT AIR QUALITY CONDITIONS
With regard to current air quality conditions in the South Coast Air Basin, significant progress has been made in reducing ozone concentrations over the past decade in the Basin and the Southeast Desert Air Basin (SEDAB). However, the Basin still exceeds the federal ozone standard far more frequently than any other area of the United States. The number of days exceeding the carbon monoxide standards decreased substantially between the mid-70s and the mid-80s. Since the mid-80s, however, there has been an increase in the number of exceedances. The observed increase is probably due to increased vehicle miles traveled. In 1989, Los Angeles County recorded more exceedances of the federal carbon monoxide standard than any other area of the United Stated. Concentrations of nitrogen dioxide decreased over the period 1976-1989. By 1989, exceedances of the federal standard were limited to three locations in Los Angeles County, with the highest concentration seven percent greater than the federal standard. Los Angeles County is the only county in the United States that does not meet the federal nitrogen dioxide standards. In 1989, state PMio standards were exceeded in all areas, frequently by a wide margin. The less stringent federal PMio standards were also exceeded in many areas. The 1989 annual average PMio concentration in the Basin was the highest in the United States.
Though sulfur dioxide concentrations have been reduced to levels well below state and federal standards, further reductions in emissions of sulfur oxides are needed to attain compliance with standards for other pollutants (sulfate and PMio). In 1989, only one exceedance of the sulfate standard was recorded. Sulfate concentrations have been reduced by the increasingly stringent controls placed on stationary source emissions of sulfur dioxide and limits on the sulfur contents of fuels. Lead concentrations once exceeded the state and federal standards by a wide margin, but have not exceeded any standard since 1983. In 1989, the highest concentrations recorded were only a small fraction of the standards. The effect of air pollution on visibility is not limited to simply reducing the distance a person can see, but also includes negative aesthetic impacts on the color, form, and contrast of the scene being viewed. In 1989, the state visibility standard was violated in a wide area of the Basin and by a significant margin.
Based upon NAAQS criteria thresholds, specific geographic areas are classified under the Federal Clean Air Act as either an "attainment" or "non-attainment" area for each pollutant. The County of Los Angeles is classified as a non-attainment area for ozone, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and fine particulate matter and an attainment area for sulfur oxides and lead.

Chapter HI Natural Resources
With regard to local air quality conditions, the closest air quality monitoring station operated by the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) is located in Reseda. However, the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District (VCAPCD) monitors ozone at a station in Thousand Oaks which is much closer and therefore more indicative of the City of Westlake Village's air quality. With regard to critical pollutants other than ozone, VCAPCD's monitoring station in Simi Valley most closely represents conditions in the City of Westlake Village. Table 34 presents ambient air quality data from both of these stations for the years 1989 to 1991.
As Table 34 indicates, maximum ozone concentration recorded at the Thousand Oaks Station declined during the recording period. However, the state ozone standard was exceeded many times during the recording period and it appears that the number of exceedance days per year has not been substantially reduced. At the Simi Valley station, ambient carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide levels did not exceed state standards between 1989 and 1991. However, maximum concentrations of fine particulate matter (PMio) have not declined substantially and the state standard continues to be exceeded. It should be noted that PMio concentrations in the City of Westlake Village may not be high in Simi Valley due to the lack of open, agricultural areas.
4.	AIR QUALITY REGULATION
The California Air Resources Board (CARB) regulates mobile emissions and oversees the activities of County Air Pollution Control Districts (APCDs) and regional Air Quality Management Districts (AQMDs) in California. The South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) is the regional agency empowered to regulate stationary sources in the South Coast Air Basin. The SCAQMD develops and enforces air quality rules and regulations in air quality planning, and operates the regional air quality monitoring network.
In response to the requirements of the Federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977, the State of California has formulated a State Implementation Plan (SIP). As a means of carrying out the SIP in the South Coast Air Basin, a Regional Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP) was approved by the South Coast Air Quality Management District in March, 1989. The AQMP establishes air pollution control strategies to lead the South Coast Air Basin into compliance with all Federal and California air quality standards.
The SCAQMD hopes to attain Federal and California ozone and fine particulate matter standards no later than December 31, 2007, and nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide standards no later than December 31, 1996 and December 31, 1997, respectively. The AQMP also has interim goals for ozone and fine particulate matter through the year 2000. For ozone, the interim goal is to reduce maximum concentrations to no higher than the Stage I emergency episode level (0.20 ppm) and reduce overall exposure by 70%. The interim goal for fine particulate matter is to City of w estlake Village General Plan

attain Federal standards (SCAQMD, 1988). The adoption of Air Quality Elements by local jurisdictions is necessary in order to achieve these goals.
5.	CONTRIBUTING FACTORS
There are several air quality issues which will need to be addressed by the City in order to help achieve the goals of the AQMP. These issues and their contributing factors are discussed below.
a.	TRANSPORTATION
Vehicle trips in the Basin are projected to increase by 40 percent between 1985 and 2010 without implementation of the AQMP and the Regional Mobility Plan (RMP). The City of Westlake Village is both the origin and destination for many vehicle work trips in the Basin and, as such, is responsible for reducing transportation-related emissions through trip reduction, diversion of truck travel from peak travel periods, and traffic flow improvements such as synchronization of traffic signals.
Of particular importance is SCAQMD's Regulation XV, which deals with employer-sponsored trip reduction methods. The regulation now calls for all businesses with 100 or more employees to submit a transportation plan to SCAQMD, stating how the business intends to reduce vehicle trips to the work place and increase vehicle occupancy rates. The City of Westlake Village has approximately 11 businesses at this time which are subject to this regulation.
h LAND USE
The dispersed land use pattern common in southern California tends to separate jobs from housing and encourages dependency on car travel. Future job and housing growth is a key policy issue addressed in the Regional Growth Management Plan prepared by the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG). The plan promotes the concept of balancing job growth and housing production within the various subregions of southern California as a means of addressing both air quality and transportation issues. The "Jobs/Housing Balance" concept forwards the idea that if people can live and work within the same community, the southern California region as whole will benefit from reduced traffic congestion and improved air quality. According to SCAG, a subregion with an job/housing ratio of 1.2 jobs per dwelling unit is considered balanced.
The City of Westlake Village is located within an area identified by SCAG as the Santa Monica Mountain subregion, which also includes the City of Agoura Hills and all Los Angeles County unincorporated territory west of the City of Los Angeles. Although the City of Westlake Village is "jobs rich" (i.e., has a significantly greater number of jobs than housing units), the same is not so of the subregion. The Santa Monica Mountains subregion is identified as "jobs poor," with a 1984 ratio of 0.62 jobs per dwelling unit. Furthermore, the subregion's housing growth continues to City of w estlake village General plan
m-5o
Chapter til Natural Resources
outpace job growth beyond that called for in SCAG's Regional Growth Management Plan. Therefore, the Regional Growth Management Plan encourages local job growth over continued residential development. Indeed, the City of Westlake Village's 1989 jobs-housing ratio (JHR) was 2.35 (6,370 jobs and 2,714 dwelling units) which is a positive contribution to the "jobs poor" condition of the subregion. However, an informal survey of the major employers of the City indicates that only 3-16% of all surveyed employees actually live and work within the Westlake Village community.
The City of Westlake Village is part of the greater master-planned community of Westlake Village which straddles the Los Angeles-Ventura County line. As such, the larger Westlake Village community has been designed to provide employment, commercial services and recreation to a series of planned neighborhoods. On a large scale, the Westlake Village community is a balance of all key land uses, each located within three miles of the other. However, on a smaller, more human, scale, the community's land uses generally remain isolated from each other. For example, commercial services are located sufficiently far away from residential neighborhoods such that a vehicle is still necessary to make a small shopping trip convenient.
The City has a responsibility to maintain its JHR and improve its spatial mix of land uses as much as possible in order to provide for a potential reduction in trip lengths and quantities.
c.	STATIONARY SOURCES
Stationary sources, such as auto body shops and heavy manufacturers, release significant quantities of reactive and toxic organic gases into the air of the South Coast Air Basin. The City of Westlake Village does not contain many stationary air pollution sources other than auto body shops. One other known stationary air pollution source located in the City is the groundwater reclamation ("stripping") plant on the property once occupied by Memorex which releases the hazardous substance TCE from the site's contaminated groundwater into the atmosphere. Permitted by the SCAQMD and the Regional Water Quality Control Board, this reclamation activity is expected to continue for ten years.
Particulates and other emissions generated during grading and construction activities can be considered to be another significant stationary source of air pollutants in the Basin. There are 804 acres of vacant lands which will also contribute emissions from these activities as they are developed. The City will need to work with SCAQMD in ensuring enforcement of emission reduction methods.
Emissions from stationary sources are also created indirectly when electricity is utilized because generation of electricity generally creates air emissions of its own. If the Basin is to increasingly rely upon electricity as a less polluting source of energy, City of w estlake village General plan
hi-51
Chapter III Natural Resources
there will be a need for major additional conservation efforts. This includes increasing the recycling of waste glass and paper which, when used by local glass and paper manufacturers, lowers air emissions due to decreased energy consumption.

HAZARDS


Chapter IV Hazards
A.	GEOLOGIC, SEISMIC AND FLOODING HAZARDS
1.	GEOLOGIC AND SEISMIC SETTING
The City of Westlake Village is located in the Transverse Ranges Geologic Province, a system of east-west trending valleys and mountain ranges that extends from Cajon Pass on the east to Point Conception on the west. These major physiographic features are controlled by the trends of major faults and folds in the rock units that also trend east-west. This orientation is in striking contrast to the northwest-southeast trend in most of the remainder of the State.
Rock and soil units within the City consist of a "basement" rock composed primarily of volcanic units but with a relatively limited area of sedimentary rocks, primarily shale and siltstone, in the hills north of the freeway. The volcanic units include basaltic lava flows and complex combinations of ash and other material ejected from ancient volcanoes. These units are overlain in the valleys by alluvium (stream deposits) composed of varying amounts of sand, silt and clay.
The . geologic structure of the rock units is only moderately complex and consists primarily of a relatively consistent north to northeast inclination of the rock layers at angles generally in the range of 20 to 30 degrees. This simple arrangement is interrupted by a moderately complex pattern of faulting, and some rock units, particularly the sediments, are more intensely deformed near the faults. There is no direct evidence to indicate that any of these faults have been active in the recent geologic past, nor is there any reason to suspect from regional relationships that any of them should be considered hazardous.
Significant earthquakes which should be expected to occur in the foreseeable future and which should be considered in the design of structures in the City are of two distinct types: (1) major events generated by movement on a very large but relatively distant fault, and (2) medium-sized events generated by movement on a closer fault.
With regard to the first types, the most likely event is a Richter magnitude 8-8.5 earthquake on the San Andreas fault within the next 100 years. The shaking that would accompany this earthquake is expected to be only moderately strong in Westlake Village because the source fault is 42 miles away at its nearest point. The maximum ground accelerations should be in the range of only 0.1-0.2g (Young, 1981), where "g" is the decimal fraction of the acceleration of gravity. However, because of the length of the fault break and the way in which ruptures propagate, the shaking will probably last for at least one minute. For comparison purposes, the duration of the 1971 San Fernando earthquake was 12-15 seconds.
More intense, but shorter-duration shaking should be expected from one of the active faults closer to the City. One possibility is the San Fernando fault located CITY OF W ESTLAKE VILLAGE GENERAL PLAN
IV-1
Chapter IV Hazards
approximately 20 miles to the northeast. This fault ruptured in 1971 resulting in the damaging earthquake of that year in the Sylmar/San Fernando area. Since active segments of this fault zone extend to the east of the 1971 break but not to the west, the shaking from future movements on this fault should not exceed, and would likely be less than, that which occurred in Westlake Village in 1971.
A more likely candidate for the maximum-intensity earthquake shaking that should be taken into account in the design of structures in the City is the offshore Malibu fault. Movement on this fault zone generated the Richter magnitude 6.0 Point Mugu earthquake of 1973, and the future movement of a segment more southerly of Westlake Village could generate' higher intensities of shaking than those which occurred in 1973. Little is known about the earthquake history of this fault zone, but, considering that a magnitude 6.0 has occurred within the recent historic past, a design magnitude of 6.5 is reasonable1.
An important consideration for estimating earthquake shaking that this fault could generate in Westlake Village is its northerly inclination at depth. Studies of the aftershocks of the 1973 earthquake (Stierman and Ellsworth) demonstrate that while the surface trace of this fault is located about three miles offshore (south) of Point Dume, the fault plane is inclined to the north at angles approaching 45 degrees. Therefore, the earthquake-generating portion of the fault plane, which lies primarily at depths of 5-10 miles, is only a few miles south of the City. Maximum ground accelerations that should be expected from a magnitude 6.5 event on this fault should be in the range of 0.3-0.4g (Schnabel and Seed, 1973) .
In addition to the above, it should be noted that other active or potentially active faults may be considered capable of generating strong earthquake shaking in the City. However, the levels of shaking that can reasonably be postulated as resulting from movement on these faults is less than that for the faults discussed above, and design for these identified events should accommodate lesser levels of shaking from other faults.
2.	GEOLOGIC CONSTRAINTS TO DEVELOPMENT
Constraints related to soil and rock types present in the City and actions that will be required prior to development are summarized in Table 35 and shown on Figure 35. Table 36 summarizes the anticipated technical investigations necessary for the major undeveloped areas. The individual hazards and conditions are discussed below.
1 The Lake Eleanor Hills EIR (McClelland Consultants, December, 199) cites a maximum credible earthquake magnitude of 7.5 and a maximum probable earthquake magnitude of 5.75 on the Malibu Coast fault. Peak ground accelerations are estimated to be ,5g and .2g, respectively._

IV-5
Chapter IV Hazards
a.	SEISMICITY
Earthquake shaking that should be expected even with the most adverse event that it is reasonable to postulate (i.e., magnitude 6.5 earthquake on the offshore Malibu fault) would most likely be in the range of 0.3 to 0.4g. Since construction under the provisions of the Uniform Building Code (1988) generally takes into account shaking up to approximately 0.5g, no additional action is required beyond implementation of this code.
h LIQUEFACTION
The potential for liquefaction in areas of alluvium and shallow groundwater has been previously identified by the County of Los Angeles and more recently by the California Division of Mines and Geology (Davis et al., 1982). However, for liquefaction to actually occur, strong earthquake shaking, shallow groundwater, and poorly consolidated soils are all required. Since the latter can only be determined by detailed soils investigations on individual sites, the evaluation and mitigation of this potential hazard should occur as a part of the soils engineering investigation required for all development sites.
c.	LANDSLIDES
Potential landslide hazards are primarily limited to the areas of sedimentary rocks in the northeast tip of the City. Thorough geologic investigations will be important in this area prior to any development.
d.	VOLCANICS
A major part of the City's undeveloped area is in volcanic rock. The major development constraint related to volcanics is excavation difficulty; blasting may be required which results in higher grading costs.
e.	SHRINK-SWELL POTENTIAL
The thick alluvial soils within the valley areas contain a significant amount of "expansive-type" clays. Within the hilly portions of the City, thin residual soils overlying bedrock also commonly contain considerable amounts of expansive clays. However, within those hilly areas, grading generally removes the expansive materials or results in the mixing-in of nonexpansive materials such that no additional design and construction measures are required. The significant shrink-swell potential in the valley areas can be mitigated by proper design and construction of floor slabs and footings as determined in a soils investigation.
f.	EROSION
Erosion is not a significant problem for the City, as the hillside areas are underlain by very resistant volcanic bedrock. Implementation of erosion control measures on ClTY OF W ESTLAKE VILLAGE GENERAL PLAN
IV-6
Chapter IV Hazards
all graded slopes (i.e., planting of deep-rooted vegetation, terracing, etc.) will prevent accelerated erosion resulting from development of hillside areas.
g.	GROUNDWATER AND PERCOLATION
Groundwater is not a significant resource to the City or adjacent areas. Consequently, the reduction of groundwater recharge resulting from an increase in impervious ground cover accompanying future development is not expected to significantly impact groundwater resources.
Higher groundwater generally does not occur within the City. The volcanic bedrock in the area is virtually impervious to water. Consequently, water flows through fractures in the rock and locally seeps to the surface. These seeps can result in instability of fill slopes. The location of seeps and design measures to insure fill slope stability (i.e., internal drainage systems or the use of impervious fill material) should be determined in a soils investigation.
h.	SUBSIDENCE
Subsidence is not a potential problem in the City. Potential settlement of compacted fill and appropriate design criteria would be addressed in a soils investigation.
i.	DAM SAFETY
The two dams located in the City were constructed to create Westlake Reservoir and Westlake Lake. Westlake Reservoir Dam, located in the southern part of the City, was constructed in 1972 as a compacted earth fill. It is 150 feet high, 1400 feet long at its crest and has a capacity of 10,000 acre-feet (California Department of Water Resources, 1974). Since its drainage area is only 0.9 square miles, runoff into the reservoir is insignificant compared to its capacity to store water delivered to it from other sources. The reservoir is owned and operated by the Las Virgenes Municipal Water District.
Potrero Dam, which impounds Westlake Lake, was completed in 1967, and is a gravity dam operated by Westlake Lake Management. It is 40 feet in height and has a storage capacity of only 791 acre-feet. It has a relatively large drainage area of 28.9 square miles, but, because it is maintained in a near-full condition for recreational purposes, flood flows are bypassed downstream.
Failure of either dam during some catastrophic event, such as a severe earthquake, is considered very unlikely. The methods of construction which were utilized are very different than the hydraulic fill technique used on some older dams, such as Van Norman, that partially failed in the 1971 earthquake. Modern dams have performed very well in earthquakes, and failure is not expected to occur. However, it should be noted that State law requires that, for purposes of emergency preparedness, maps be prepared for all large dams showing the area that would be inundated should the dam fail and the time of arrival of the flood waters. Such City of W estlake Village General Plan
IV-7
Chapter IV Hazards
maps have been prepared for Westlake Reservoir and Westlake Lake, but because of the extremely low probability of failure of either dam, the hazard involved is not a significant consideration in planning of the affected areas.
j.	FLOOD HAZARD
Flood hazard areas within the City are limited to the Triunfo Canyon drainage below Westlake Lake and the banks of the lake itself. A storm drain system has been constructed in the vicinity of the canyon to moderate the effects of storm runoff. The Los Angeles County Flood Control District has prepared a Triunfo Creek Floodway Map (LACFCD 154-ML2, Ord.81-0021 ), which defines the physical limits of the flood hazard and the minimum floor elevations required for structures outside of the hazard area (see Figure 12, Chapter One). Any development within the canyon will be subject to the review and approval of the District.
Development on the shores of Westlake Lake has been set back several feet from the highest water level which could be expected to occur. This setback is recognized as a flood hazard area and is maintained as open space. The "spillover" design of the Westlake Lake dam ensures that flooding beyond the lake's banks cannot occur.
k.	SUMMARY
In summary, there are no geologic, seismic or flooding hazards which are expected to negatively affect or be affected by development within the City if the standard codes and procedures are adhered to.

Chapter IV Hazards
B.	FIRE HAZARD
1. EXISTING FIRE HAZARD
The City is partially located in a mountainous watershed area which experiences periods of severe fire hazard when the weather is characterized by high temperatures, low humidity, and high wind velocities. Fire hazard within the City is primarily related to highly flammable brush which ignites readily, burns with intense heat and spreads rapidly. Large, destructive fires have burned through the Santa Monica Mountains and in and near the City of Westlake Village on a regular basis.
Additionally, areas of the City developed prior to the Non-Combustible Roofing Ordinance of 1977 include structures with combustible wood shingle/shake roofs. These roofs present a hazard and fire fighting problem during severe fire weather due to flying brands from a wildland or structure fire. However, according to the Los Angeles County Fire Department and the County Building and Safety Department, the entire City is a Fire Zone 3 area because the City is an independent jurisdiction, and all remaining wildland areas are easily accessible.
Increased development in and adjacent to the naturally-vegetated areas of the City will expose additional structures to potential wildland fires. Reduction of risk is possible based on sound construction practices, sufficient water flows, brush clearance and the provision of adequate access. The Los Angeles County Fire Department, which provides and oversees all fire protection services to the City, requires that all buildings and structures be constructed to meet the standards specified in the current edition of the Uniform Building Code of Los Angeles County.
Adequate water mains, fire hydrants, and fire flows are essential for fighting structure fires and suppressing brush fires. Water availability, or "fire flow", is the combination of water quantity and pressure, measured in gallons per minute (GPM). Fire flow requirements are based on the types of land use intended to be served. For example, single-family development may have a required fire flow of 1250 GPM, while industrial development could have a requirement of 5000 GPM (maximum fire flow).
Brush and dense undergrowth are a primary hazard to structures. As such, brush clearance is necessary to reduce structural exposure to flames and radiant heat, and to prevent the otherwise avoidable loss of structures and property. Property owners are presently required to maintain a firebreak around and adjacent to all buildings and structures by removing all flammable vegetation or other combustible growth for a minimum distance of 30 feet from the structure or to the property line, whichever is closer. This requirement does not apply to single specimens of trees, ornamental shrubbery or cultivated ground cover such as green grass, ivy, City of w estlake village General plan
iv-io
Chapter IV Hazards
succulents, or similar plants used as ground covers, provided that they do not form a means of readily transmitting fire from the native growth to any structure. Additional fuel modification may be required when it is found that because of extra hazardous conditions a firebreak of only 30 feet around such structures is not sufficient to provide reasonable fire safety.
Road networks, either public or private, should provide safe and ready access for emergency equipment and the evacuation of citizens during disasters. Restricted access, particularly within a brush fire hazard area, can and has in many communities, has led to disastrous consequences.

C.	NOISE
1. NOISE SOURCES
The sources of noise can be both interior or exterior, and mobile or stationary. Interior noises are generally stationary and include all of those devices and machines in the home, office and factory that can create sounds loud enough to damage hearing, interfere with communication or disturb sleep. Exterior noise can be both mobile and stationary and is generated by motorized vehicles, construction work, industrial operations, human activities (shouting, playing radio too loudly) and other miscellaneous generators such as emergency vehicles, air conditioning units, and trash collection vehicles and containers. The primary concern of this section, however, is exterior noise which can be regulated through local government controls. Noise generated by vehicular traffic is the most significant noise source within the City and, therefore, is the emphasis of this section.
County helicopter landings at the emergency helipad located at the Westlake Community Hospital is one type of stationary noise source within the City. Helicopter operations at this facility generally consist of emergency transport of accident victims from the canyon roads, mountains and beaches of the local area to the hospital and have averaged approximately 75 flights per year over the past few years. The helicopters take off and land at the helipad to and from the north, flying over businesses and parking lots. Although single-event noise exposure resulting from helicopter operations are potentially annoying, the relatively low frequency and short duration of these operations do not significantly affect the average daily noise levels within the City. No other stationary sources have been identified which significantly contribute to the City's noise environment.
Vehicular traffic noise is generally attributed to buses, trucks and construction equipment transport. However, as a group, these types of vehicles normally comprise only a small percentage of the total daily traffic flow. Since their noise is within the range generated by normal auto and truck traffic, it is generally assumed to be contained within the overall mix of cars and truck noise.
The three principal components of both automobile and truck noise are the engine, exhaust and tires. Fans operating as part of the cooling system are a major contribution to engine noise, hot gases escaping out of the tail pipe create exhaust noise, and the escape of air between tire treads and the road surface is the source of tire noise. Four major factors contribute to the noise level of vehicles: speed, acceleration, road grade and road surface. Generally, vehicular noise levels increase directly with increases in speed, acceleration, road grade and rougher road surfaces.

2.	NOISE MEASUREMENT
Common noises experienced on a daily basis may range from a whisper to a passing locomotive train. The range of sound energy represented by these two events is so large that it cannot be represented mathematically without using numbers in the millions and billions. To avoid this inconvenience, sound levels have been compressed in a standard logarithmic scale called the decibel (dB) scale. The reference level for the scale, 0 dB, is not the absence of sound, but the weakest sound a person with very good hearing can detect in a quiet place. The most important feature of the decibel scale is its logarithmic nature. An increase from 0 to 10 dB represents a tenfold increase in sound energy, but an increase to 20 dB represents a hundredfold increase, while an increase to 30 represents a thousandfold increase over 0 dB.
Another important characteristic of the decibel scale is that sound levels are not directly combined when added. For example, if one truck emits 65 dB while idling, parking another truck producing 65 dB next to it does not generate a total noise level of 130 dB. Rather, the total noise level would be 68 dB. The result is based on the logarithmic nature of the decibel scale. This is an important concept to remember when considering an area exposed to more than one source of noise.
The average range of sounds that we are commonly exposed to generally falls in the 30 to 100 dB range (see Table 37 for examples and human responses). However, not all sound waves affect us equally. The human ear is more sensitive to high-pitch sounds, such as a whistle, than it is to low-pitch sounds, such as a drumbeat. To account for this effect in noise measurements, it is necessary to use an electronic filter in sound level meters which acts as the equivalent of the human ear in filtering out some of the higher and lower frequencies of sound. This filter is called the A-scale weighting network, and is abbreviated by the A in the notation dB(A).
A-scale decibel measurements can be taken at any time in the community to record the sound levels of various noise sources. However, to develop an indicator of varying sound levels occurring over the 24-hour day, it is necessary to average the sound occurring at each moment throughout the day. The day-night noise level, or Ldn, is the result of this procedure, and gives a general, single-number index of noise exposure over an average 24-hour day. In computing the Ldn levels, it is also necessary to apply a weighting to noise that occurs at night to account for the greater sensitivity that people have to such noise. This system of calculating noise exposure has been recommended as the uniformly-accepted index by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Typical Ldn noise level ranges are indicated in Figure 36.
Quantitative estimates of noise exposure in the City are provided in tabular form and through contour maps. The noise contours are lines connecting points of equal sound intensity. Analysis of attenuation and reverberation due to small sideline features, such as buildings, is beyond the scope of this analysis, and would not be appropriate to noise evaluation at a city-wide level for general planning purposes.

should be remembered that the noise contours are general indicators of noise exposure and not precise levels. It should also be noted that the noise contours only represent noise generated by vehicular traffic. These contours do not account for interior noise or outdoor noise generated by construction work, individual persons, miscellaneous noises such as air conditioning units, or other stationary sources.
The preparation of a noise contour map involves a certain amount of estimating and smoothing. For example, the contour lines at intersections of roads were rounded away from the intersections, indicating an increase in noise levels. Intersections are generally noisier than line sources because traffic volumes increase there. Additionally, many vehicles (e.g., trucks) create more noise under stop-and-go conditions than at steady speeds. The rounding of the contour lines represents this condition, but is not an exact estimate of the magnitude. Precise estimates should be made through site analysis.
3.	LAND USE COMPATIBILITY
The State Office of Noise Control has established guidelines identifying community noise levels which are deemed to be generally acceptable. Figure 37 depicts noise exposure levels which are considered compatible with various types of land uses. Where a land use is denoted as "normally acceptable" for the given Ldn noise environment, the highest noise level in that range should be considered the maximum desirable for conventional construction which does not incorporate any special acoustic treatment. The acceptability of noise environments classified as "conditionally acceptable" or "normally unacceptable" will depend on the anticipated amount of time which will normally be spent outside the structure and the acoustic treatment to be incorporated in the structure's design (see Section 5, Noise Control Measures, for description of specific noise attenuation measures).
With regard to residential uses, the recommended outdoor noise limits of 60 dB and 65 dB for single-family and multi-family residences, respectively, would permit achievement of the 45 dB interior noise level recommended by federal and state standards. This level would result from the noise reduction associated with typical residential construction, which ranges from 12 to 18 dB (with windows partially open).
4.	EXISTING NOISE CONDITIONS
Existing noise levels within the City are shown on Table 38 and graphically depicted by Figure 38. As previously mentioned, noise levels in the City of Westlake Village are primarily influenced by vehicular traffic along the major roadways traversing the City. The most prominent noise source is the Ventura Freeway (U.S. Highway 101), an eight-lane roadway that bisects the City in an east-west direction. The freeway presently carries an average daily traffic flow of 145,000 vehicles, an estimated 9.5% of which are trucks (Caltrans, 1989).

Based on a noise prediction model created by the Federal Highway Transportation Administration, existing (1989) traffic volumes along the Ventura Freeway corridor generate noise levels of approximately 75 dB(A) Ldn at 50 feet from the roadside, exclusive of topographical and/or structural noise attenuation. Given an uninterrupted line of sight and a noise reduction of 3.0 dB(A) per doubling of distance (characteristic of "line source" noise attenuation), the 60 and 65 dB(A) Ldn noise level contours would extend approximately 510 and 330 feet from the edge of the freeway, respectively. Actual distances to these contours along the freeway corridor vary depending upon roadside development and elevation.
Existing development along the Ventura Freeway corridor of the City include noise-tolerant industrial/commercial uses northwest and southeast of the Ventura Freeway/Lindero Canyon Road interchange, and the Westlake Golf Course located southwest of the Ventura Freeway/Lindero Canyon Road interchange. Figure 37 indicates that the existing 60-75 dB(A) noise level range at the golf course is normally acceptable for this type of land use.
Secondary noise corridors include Lindero Canyon Road, Agoura Road and, to a lesser degree, Triunfo Canyon Road, Lakeview Canyon Road and Thousand Oaks Boulevard. There are residential uses located along Lindero Canyon Road, Agoura Road, Triunfo Canyon Road and Lakeview Canyon Road that are exposed to noise levels exceeding 60.0 dB(A) Ldn, the normally acceptable level (Figure 39). However, the majority of these properties are provided with noise attenuation barriers (e.g., walls) which effectively lower first-floor noise levels below 60.0 dB(A) Ldn.
The only areas within the City that currently experience exterior noise levels exceeding 60.0 dB(A) Ldn are second stories of residential units within 50 feet of Lindero Canyon Road, Agoura Road, Triunfo Canyon, and Lakeview Canyon Road, and residential structures on the eastern end of Agoura Road (Colony Townhomes) which are within 50 feet of the roadway and are not provided with noise attenuation barriers.
5.	NOISE CONTROL MEASURES
Noise can be controlled at its source, along its transmission path, at the receiver or through a combination of these measures. Federal and State regulations provide for certain controls on noise sources, such as motor vehicles. The City has adopted additional provisions which restrict the generation of noise within the community. Table 39 indicates some of the existing City limitations on noise produced by equipment operation, human activities, construction, loading operations and refuse collection. The City's health officer has primary responsibility for the enforcement of these regulations.

a. SITE DESIGN
The most common methods of shielding the interior of a building from exterior noise sources are to orient structures away from the noise and to set buildings back from the noise source as far as possible. A long building or a row of buildings along a traffic corridor may also be used to provide some reduction of noise to the side of the building away from the noise source and to areas beyond that row. A site's natural topography can also be exploited by placing buildings in low noise pockets, if they exist.
Limitations of project noise sources may include restrictions on activities permitted, equipment operation, and operating hours. The review of project designs can also allow for the control of noise along its transmission path and at the receiver. Several methods of noise reduction in these areas are briefly discussed below.
h BUILDING CONSTRUCTION
The impacts of exterior noise levels on indoor living and working areas are reduced by normal building materials and construction techniques, even if the building has open windows. The actual amount of reduction depends on building construction, orientation, wall area, window area, open window area, interior acoustic absorption, etc. Approximate noise reduction values provided by a few typical building construction types are shown in Table 40.
Noise-reducing construction techniques include:
a.	Increasing the mass and stiffness of the wall. Doubling the thickness of a partition can result in as much as a 6 dB reduction in sound; the relative stiffness of the wall material can influence its sound attenuation value.
b.	Using cavity partitions in walls. The use of two or more layers separated by an airspace makes a more effective sound insulator than a single wall of equal weight.
c.	Increasing the width of the airspace. Increasing the width of an airspace from three to six inches can reduce noise levels by 5 dB.
d.	Increasing the spacing between studs. In a single-stud wall, 24-inch stud spacing gives a 2 to 5 dB increase in noise reduction over the common 16-inch spacing.
e.	Adding acoustical blankets. Made from sound-absorbing materials such as mineral or rock wool, fiberglass, hair felt or wood fibers, acoustical blankets can attenuate noise as much as 10 dB.

Chapter IV Hazards
Windows are one of the weakest parts of a wall in terms of noise attenuation. The following techniques can be used to reduce noise entering a structure via its windows:
a.	Closing windows. Open windows, even if only slightly open for ventilation, will lower the sound-reducing properties of a building facade to only 10-15 dB no matter what kind of window and wall system is used. The greatest amount of sound insulation can be achieved if windows are permanently sealed. Whether or not windows are permanently sealed, however, keeping windows closed necessitates the installation of an air conditioning system, which may also provide some masking of noise.
b.	Reducing window size. The smaller the windows, the greater the transmission loss of the total partition of which the window is a part. However, this technique is not very effective in reducing noise, as reducing the proportion of window to wall size from 50% to 20% only reduces noise by 3 dB.
c.	Increasing glass thickness. Increasing the thickness of glass from 3/16 inch (normal) to 1/2 inch provides an additional 10 dB noise reduction.
d.	Using double-glazed windows. The use of paired window panes separated by an airspace or hung in a special frame can provide greater noise attenuation than the use of thicker glass as described above and can cost less. The performance of double glazed windows can be enhanced through increased airspace width, increased glass thickness, proper use of sealings, slightly dissimilar thickness of the panes and slightly nonparallel panes.
Other noise-reduction measures related to the design of buildings include the limitation of residential structures exposed to noise to one story in height. Coupled with a barrier, the use of one-story structures can result in acceptable noise levels, both exterior and interior, under adverse noise conditions.
c. BARRIERS
A noise barrier is an obstacle placed between a noise source and a receiver which interrupts the path of the noise. Walls are the most common noise barrier used, although earth berms, hills, cuts, embankments or other types of natural or constructed solid structure may serve as barriers. A barrier can be expected to reduce noise by 5 to 10 dB(A); the actual amount of attenuation is dependent on whether it intercepts by a substantial amount the "line-of-sight" between the ear level of the observer and the effective source of the noise, and how solid its composition is. To be most effective, a barrier must be long and continuous to prevent sounds from passing around the ends. It must also be solid, with few, if any, holes, cracks or openings.
City of Westlake Village General plan
IV-29
Chapter IV Hazards
d.	LANDSCAPING
Shrubs and trees have aesthetic and psychological value as visual barriers of such noise sources as traffic corridors, but provide negligible attenuation of sound. Effective belts of trees for useful noise control [approximately 5 dB(A) attenuation] must be 50 feet tall or more and 75 to 100 feet wide in a long, continuous strip, must have dense foliage down to ground level and must be evergreen so that the protection is effective year-round. This type of stand takes 20 years to grow and is usually extravagant in terms of site space required.
Most of the above strategies deal primarily with reducing future noise problems rather than existing ones. Where a noise problem already exists, one or more of five general solutions are available: (1) the noise can be reduced at the sources, (2) the noise can be checked by a barrier, (3) the source can be removed from people and other receivers, (4) the receiver can be removed from the source, or (5) the time exposure to the noise can be minimized. As is true with most environmental hazards, early efforts to prevent or reduce adverse noise impacts are easier and less expensive than resolving existing problems.

3.2	Implement requirements under Title 24 of the State Building Code to ensure that interior noise levels attributable to exterior sources shall not exceed an Ldn of 45 dB(A) in any habitable room within new hotels, long-term care facilities, apartment houses, and dwellings other than detached single-family units (1-3).
3.3	Require adequate sound insulation of single-family homes in areas potentially exposed to overall (ambient) noise levels exceeding an Ldn of 60 dB(A) (1-3).
3.4	Prohibit the development of new industrial, commercial, or related land uses or the expansion of existing land uses when it can be demonstrated that such new or expanded land uses would directly and unavoidably cause overall (ambient) noise levels to exceed an Ldn of 65 dB(A) exterior upon areas containing housing, schools, health care facilities, or other "noise sensitive" land uses (1-4).
City of Westlake Village General Plan
IV-3I
Chapter JV Hazards
3.5	Require that loading and shipping facilities of commercial and industrial land uses be located and designed in a manner to minimize the potential noise impacts upon adjoining residential areas to the greatest degree practicable (1-5).
3.6	Require that all parking areas for commercial and industrial land uses abutting residential areas be buffered and shielded by landscaped walls, fences, or other effective noise barriers (1-5).
3.7	Control high-noise generating commercial/industrial equipment and activities to reduce the potentially adverse noise impacts of such equipment upon adjacent residential uses (1-6).
3.8	Encourage "noise sensitive" land uses, including school, libraries, health care facilities, and residential uses, to incorporate landscaped fences, walls, and/or other noise buffers and barriers, where appropriate and feasible to do so (1-5).
3.9	Require an acoustical analyses for any new or expanded land use determined by the City of Westlake Village to be a potential major stationary noise source. Recommended mitigation measures shall be implemented and tested, prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy for said land use (1-7).
Traffic-Related Noise Impacts
Objective It shall be the objective of the City of Westlake Village to:
4	Minimize the adverse impacts of traffic-generated noise on residential
and other "noise sensitive" uses.
Policies It shall be the policy of the City of Westlake Village to:
4.1	Require that all new non-residential development incorporate on-site ingress and egress points designed to divert traffic (and its resultant noise) away form "noise sensitive" land uses to the greatest degree practicable, consistent with applicable safety and planning considerations (1-5).
4.2	Discourage the intrusion of commercial and industrial traffic onto local residential streets (1-10).
Implementation Programs
1-1	The City of Westlake Village shall continue to enforce an appropriate
and legally adequate local Noise Ordinance to comply with the State's noise insulation standards. Said ordinance shall contain policies and regulations addressing both overall (ambient) and stationary source (intrusive) noise impacts.
City of W estlake Village General plan
IV-32
Chapter IV Hazards
1-2	The City of Westlake Village shall record changes that occur in the
community's noise environment by reviewing available technical and acoustical data and studies which have been conducted for proposed projects. The existing local noise map shall be updated as new information about the noise environment changes or becomes available to ensure the highest possible level of accuracy in planning for land use compatibility and the mitigation of noise impacts.
1-3	Utilize the development and environmental review process to ensure
that noise impacts, including street noise and traffic noise impacts, are adequately addressed, sufficiently mitigated and that adverse conditions will not result (in accordance with the California insulation standards of the State Building Code, and the policies set forth in the Noise Element of the General Plan).
1-4	A noise impact evaluation will be required for all projects as part of the
local planning and environmental review process to determine if unacceptable noise levels will be created or experienced. Should noise abatement be necessary, a required technical report containing a detailed evaluation of existing and/or projected noise impacts and effective mitigation measures shall be submitted.
1-5	During the local planning, development and environmental review
process ensure that development is designed in a fashion which would minimize potential noise impacts throughout the community. This shall include consideration of the following:
a)	Proximity of noise sensitive land uses;
b)	Ingress and egress points of non-residential uses.
c)	Adequate mitigation for ambient and intrusive noise impacts.
1-6	Continue to enforce City Noise Ordinance provisions regulating and
limiting high noise-generating equipment, construction activities, and the hours of truck deliveries to commercial or industrial land uses abutting residential areas, to reduce their potential impacts upon local residential land uses.
1-7	Based on the results of the local Initial Study and Environmental
Checklist process completed by the City of Westlake Village Planning Department, all new development provisions to be potential major stationary noise sources, shall be accompanied by a specific acoustical analysis to identify and analyze potential noise impacts and effective mitigation measures.
1-8	Ensure through development review that commercial and industrial
street patterns are designed not to impact adjacent residential or noise sensitive uses.

APPENDIX D
Housing Programs
FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Section 8 Existing
Under this program, the Federal government assists lower-income households so that they expend no more than 30 percent of their monthly income on decent, sanitary housing. Rental assistance payments that constitute the difference between 30 percent of the household's monthly income and the fair market rent for the unit under contract are made monthly to the property owner by local housing agencies. In order to be eligible for such assistance, a household's annual income must not exceed 80 percent of the median family income for the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA) in which it resides. In order for a rental unit to qualify, it must rent within fair market rents (FMRs) established by the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation
Under this program, housing assistance payment (HAP) contracts can be executed between local governments and participating property owners for units that have undergone moderate rehabilitation. Contracts can be executed for a five-year term, renewable for up to 15 years. Landlords are required to make a minimum investment of $2,000 per unit for upgrading in structures containing 12 or fewer units, or $1,000 per unit in structures having more than 12 units. Contract rents may be approved up to 120 percent of the fair market rents for the Section 8 Existing Program.
The Moderate Rehabilitation program, like other Section 8 programs, has no predesigned financing mechanism for owners. The local government would be expected to market the program to private lenders, as well as to owners. However, a city could provide financing through its Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds, if it so desired. In this manner, a city could "piggy-back" long-term Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation HAP contracts with CDBG-funded rehabilitation loans.
Section 8 New Construction
This program is designed to develop new affordable housing for the elderly, the handicapped, or lower-income families. Sponsors of assisted housing under this program may be individuals, profit or nonprofit organizations, or public housing agencies. Proposals are submitted directly to HUD by interested sponsors. When a proposal is accepted by HUD, a rental assistance contract is executed between HUD and the owner under which HUD agrees to make payments equivalent to the difference between 30 percent of an eligible household's monthly income and the fair market rent for the unit under contract. Such payments can be made for a specified term of up to 20 years, or up to 40 years for projects assisted by a loan or loan guarantee from a State or local agency. The Section 8 New Construction
program does not provide construction financing, but the rental assistance contract can be pledged as security for financing.
Section 202
This program provides for long-term direct loans from HUD to private nonprofit sponsors to finance rental or cooperative housing facilities for elderly and handicapped persons. Households of one or more persons, the head of which is at least 62 years old or is handicapped, are eligible tenants. In tandem with construction financing, tenants may receive rental assistance from a national set-aside of Section 8 funds.
Section 106(b) - Seed Money Loans
Section 106 (b) provides for interest-free seed money loans to non-profit sponsors to cover 80 percent of the preconstruction expenses in planning low and moderate-income housing projects. At present, the loans are being made only in connection with Section 202 loans for housing for the elderly and handicapped. The seed money is repaid from the permanent mortgage loan proceeds.
Eligible expenses include organization costs, legal, consultant, architectural, preliminary site engineering, application and construction loan fees, and site options.
Community Development Block Grant
Through the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, HUD provides grants and loans to local governments for funding a wide range of community development activities. No local match is required.
A city can help to facilitate the construction of low and moderate-income housing through the use of its CDBG funds. For example, CDBG funds can be used to upgrade public works, such as sewers needed to serve new residential construction. These funds could also be used for: 1) acquisition and disposition of real property; 2) public facilities and improvements; 3) slum clearance activities; 4) public services; 5) interim assistance; 6) payment of non-Federal share of a grant-in-aid program; 7) relocation; 8) removal of architectural barriers to the physically handicapped; and 9) privately-owned utilities.
CDBG assistance may also be used for the following rehabilitation and preservation activities; 1) rehabilitation of public residential structures, 2) modernization of public housing, 3) rehabilitation of private properties, 4) temporary relocation assistance, 5) code enforcement, and 6) historic preservation.
Except in limited circumstances, CDBGs may not be used for new construction of housing.
STATE FSQGRAMS
SB 99 - Redevelopment Construction Loans
Chapter 8 of the California Community Redevelopment Law, Redevelopment Construction Loans, was promulgated by passage of SB 99 in 1975 and authorizes redevelopment agencies to issue revenue bonds to finance residential construction in redevelopment project areas and elsewhere via long-term, low-interest loans through qualified mortgage lenders. Alternatively, the agency may purchase insured loans made by qualified lenders. The proceeds from the issuance of bonds are used to finance or purchase mortgages and write down the interest rates thereon. The mortgage payments made by property owners, in turn, retire the bonds. Loans made under SB 99 must be insured.
SB 418 (Marks), an urgency statute of 1980, expanded the types of projects to which SB 99 revenue bond financing can be applied. If a redevelopment agency determines that a commercial neighborhood service center is an integral part of a residential neighborhood, then they can issue bonds to procure financing for commercial and mixed use (commercial/residential) construction. The rehabilitation of structures, i.e., repairs and improvements to a substandard residence in order to meet local codes, is also allowed. Income level limitations on future occupants and other specific criteria must be met.
California Housing Financing Agency (CHFA) - Direct Lending
Under this program, CHFA provides mortgage loans to profit-oriented developers, nonprofit sponsors, and local housing agencies for the construction or rehabilitation of housing developments containing five or more units. The agency lends directly to the sponsor through its loan underwriting process. A project usually receives a loan from the agency accompanied by a commitment of rental assistance for all or a portion of the units. The rental assistance allocations are made by HUD under the Section 8 program, but are administered by CHFA. The agency sells long-term tax exempt bonds to provide up to 40-year mortgage financing.
California Housing Finance Agency - Home Ownership and Home Improvement
Loan (HOHI) Program
Under this program, local governments designate areas that are in need of rehabilitation and request CHFA financing for the purchase and/or rehabilitation of housing by low and moderate-income persons therein. Local lenders, in turn, purchase commitments from CHFA to originate and service loans in the designated areas. Loans are made by private lenders to owner occupants and, in some circumstances, to non-occupant investors. These below market rate loans are insured and may be used for: 1) rehabilitation only; 2) purchase only; 3) purchase with rehabilitation; and 4) financing with rehabilitation. In order to qualify for a
loan under this program, a household's annual income must not exceed 120 percent of the County median income.
California Self-Help Housing Program
The California Self-Help Housing Program (CSHHP), formerly the California Housing Advisory Service, provides grants and loans to local government agencies and nonprofit corporations that assist low and moderate-income families to build or rehabilitate their homes with their own labor. Mortgage and technical assistance funds are available. CSHHP technical assistance grants are used to cover the various administrative and training costs associated with the provision of technical assistance to self-help households. These services include: training and supervision of self-help builders; project planning; loan packaging and counseling services; and workshops. Mortgage assistance funds are used to reduce the cost of the self-help units.
Mobilehome Park Assistance Program
The Mobilehome Park Assistance Program (MPAP) provides financial and technical assistance to low-income mobilehome park residents or to organizations formed by park residents who wish to own and/or operate their mobilehome parks. The technical assistance component of the program was established in 1983 by AB 1008 (McClintock). In 1984, SB 2240 (Seymour) established a revolving loan fund which added the financial assistance component to the program. MPAP loans bear a seven percent interest rate per annum. Conversion loans must be repaid within three years. The repayment of blanket and individual loans may be scheduled for up to 30 years.
Emergency Shelter Program
The Emergency Shelter Program (ESP) provides direct grants to local government agencies and nonprofit corporations that shelter the homeless on an emergency basis. Eligible grant activities include: rehabilitation; expansion of existing facilities; site acquisition (lease/purchase of site and/or facility); equipment purchase; onetime rent to prevent eviction; vouchers; and administration costs (no more than five percent of any single grantee award). New construction is not an eligible program activity.
Special User Housing Rehabilitation Program
The Special User Housing Rehabilitation Program (SUHRP) was enacted in 1983 by SB 26 (Petis) as an outgrowth of the Demonstration Housing Rehabilitation Program for the Elderly and Handicapped, which was established in 1979. The program utilizes a three percent, 30-year deferred payment loan, which provides up-front subsidies for the rehabilitation and/or acquisition of substandard housing. SUHRP funds may be used for acquisition and/or rehabilitation of: substandard apartments
which will be occupied by the elderly; group residences and apartments which will be occupied by the physically, developmentally or mentally disabled; and residential hotels, which will be occupied by low or very low-income persons.
Predevelopment Loan Program
The Predevelopment Loan Program (PLP) provides seven percent loans to local government agencies and nonprofit corporations. The loans can be used for a variety of predevelopment expenses incurred in securing the long-term financing for the production or rehabilitation of subsidized low-income housing in both rural and urban areas. Loan terms range from one to three years. Loan funds may be used to purchase land or land options; pay advance fees for architectural, engineering, consultant, and legal services or permits; pay bonding and applications fees; cover site preparation expenses (including water and sewer development) and other related costs. Loans are also made to eligible borrowers for land purchase to land bank sites for future development of low income housing.
Senior Citizens Shared Housing Program
The Senior Citizens Shared Housing Program (SCSH) provides grants to local government agencies and nonprofit corporations to assist seniors in finding others with whom they can share housing. Services funded by the grants include: outreach, information and referral, client counseling, placement and follow-up. The program results in reduced housing costs, prevention of premature institutionalization, efficient use of existing housing stock, and increased security and companionship for seniors.
Rental Housing Construction Program
A Rental Housing Construction Incentive Fund was established via the passage of AB 333 in October 1979. Under this program, the State Department of Housing and Community Development may make cash grants to CHFA or local governments to pay for all or a portion of the development costs associated with the construction of rental housing. In exchange for such assistance, a regulatory agreement would be executed with the property owner restricting a portion of the units for occupancy by lower-income persons. The agreement would be in effect for 40 years.
As defined in the State Health and Safety Code, "development costs" means the aggregate of all costs incurred in connection with the construction of a rental housing development including: 1) the cost of land acquisition, whether by purchase or lease; 2) the cost of construction; 3) the cost of associated architectural, legal and accounting fees; and 4) the cost of related off-site improvements, such as sewers, utilities and streets. These costs may be defrayed as they are incurred or an annuity trust fund may be established to reduce monthly debit service payments over the life of the regulatory agreement. In this respect, the program could operate similarly to the Federal Section 8 program. In order to be eligible for assistance, a
rental housing development must contain at least 5 units and not less than 30 percent of the units shall be reserved for lower-income households.
Deferred Payment Rehabilitation Loans
Established by the passage of SB 966 (Marks), Chapter 884 of 1978, and authorized in Health and Safety Code Section 50660, the Deferred-Payment Housing Rehabilitation Loan Program was designed to assist cities and counties with the rehabilitation of housing for low and moderate-income households. With the passage of AB 333 (Hughes), Chapter 1043 of 1979, and SB 229 (Roberti), Chapter 1042 of 1979 (in September 1979), the program was expanded to include local public entities other than cities and counties and nonprofit corporations that operate housing rehabilitation programs with Federal rehabilitation funds. Loans are made to public entities and nonprofit corporations that will, in turn, lend the funds to eligible property owners in the form of three percent interest, deferred-payment loans.
In order for a local public entity or nonprofit corporation to be eligible for loan funds from this program, it must have an operating rehabilitation program. Acceptable rehabilitation programs are outlined in the program regulations.
Generally, eligible borrowers are low or moderate-income owner-occupants of one-to-four-unit properties and nonowner-occupants of rental properties. Loans are made to borrowers at three percent interest and must be repaid at the end of five years or upon the sale or transfer of the property, whichever comes first. Loans may be extended for additional five-year periods if owner-occupants are unable to repay the loans or, in the case of rental properties, if low-income tenants continue to benefit. There is no five-year repayment requirement on loans made to elderly owner-occupants. Local public entities/nonprofits repay the State at three percent interest upon collection from property owners.
LOCAL ERQ.GEAMS
Marks-Foran Residential Rehabilitation Act
The Marks-Foran Act authorizes cities, counties, housing authorities, and redevelopment agencies to issue tax-exempt revenue bonds to finance residential rehabilitation. Under Marks-Foran, loans are made in areas designated for residential rehabilitation through a formal public hearing process. The community must make a commitment to enforce rehabilitation standards on 95 percent of the structures in the rehabilitation area and to provide the public improvements necessary to support rehabilitation.
Marks-Foran rehabilitation loans can be made for terms much longer than conventional loans (up to 40 years), bringing the cost within the reach of low and moderate-income residents. The loans may be made in any amount up to a maximum of $35,000 per unit, or 95 percent of the anticipated value of the property
after rehabilitation.
Marks-Foran loans are made through qualified lenders and must be insured. Loans and insurance may be by private mortgage insurers, as well as FHA, the California Housing Finance Agency, or a local agency using CDBG funds.
SB 170 (Marks), 1979, expanded the activities eligible for financing under the Marks-Foran Residential Rehabilitation Act to include the construction of new infill housing for low and moderate-income persons where it has been included in the adopted rehabilitation program plan, and acquisition of real property for rehabilitation, or property which has recently been rehabilitated. No more than 35 percent of the aggregate principle amount of all loans made in a rehabilitation area can be used for these purposes.
AB 1151 - Density Bonuses and Other Incentives
This legislation, which was enacted in October 1979, added Chapter 4.3 to the California Government Code requiring local governments to offer either density bonuses or other incentives to developers, who agree to construct either: 1) 25 percent of the total units in a housing development for low and moderate-income persons; 2) 10 percent of the total units of a housing development for lower-income households; or 3) 50 percent of the total dwelling units of a housing development for qualifying residents. This density bonus shall apply to housing developments consisting of five or more dwelling units. If a density bonus is granted, it must be at least 25 percent above the present allowable zoning. In lieu of a density bonus, a local government must provide at least two other incentives, limited only by the creativity of local officials. Incentives suggested in the legislation include: 1) exemption from park dedication requirements and the payment of fees in lieu thereof; 2) city construction of public improvements appurtenant to the proposed housing development; 3) local write-down of land costs; and 4) exemption from any provision of local ordinances which may cause an indirect increase in the cost of the units to be developed.
If the local government offers a direct financial contribution to a housing development through subsidization of infrastructure, land, or construction costs, steps must be taken to assure the availability of the low and moderate-income units for 30 years.
AB 655 - Multi-Family Bond Program
The County of Los Angeles, Community Development Commission has implemented a tax-exempt revenue bond program for new multi-family rental housing. The purpose of the program is to increase the supply of rental housing in the County and provide at least 20 percent of the units as affordable housing for low-to-moderate income residents.
The program utilizes tax-exempt revenue bonds issued by the County under AB 665. The bonds do not involve any pledge of County revenues, taxes, or assets.
Bonds are issued for projects which: 1) meet program requirements; 2) are located in the unincorporated areas of the County or in the incorporated areas with approval by both the City and the County and the execution of a "Cooperative Agreement"; 3) have the commitment fee paid by the developer; and 4) have necessary credit support from a private lender.
Permanent financing is currently being provided by the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA). Loans are amortized for 30 years and are due 12 years after the sale of bonds. Effective loan rates are anticipated to be between 10.5 and 11 percent. However, actual loan rates will depend upon market conditions at the time of bond sale.
Construction financing may be either conventional or funded with bond proceeds if FNMA is provided with an unconditional irrevocable Letter of Credit which meets its requirements. Permanent loans must be originated and serviced by a FNMA approved multi-family lender.
Mortgage Revenue Bonds
Mortgage revenue bonds (MRBs) are issued by cities and counties, housing authorities, redevelopment agencies, and State agencies, such as the California Housing Finance Agency, to support the development of multi-family or singlefamily housing for low and moderate-income households. MRBs enable the issuer (localities, housing authorities, etc.) to offer low-interest mortgage loans increasing ownership of opportunities for households who have difficulty obtaining conventional financing.
MRBs for single-family housing are issued to finance the purchase or rehabilitation of owner-occupied homes. Proceeds from the bond sales are used to make mortgage or rehabilitation loans to qualified low or moderate-income home buyers. The bonds are serviced and repaid from the mortgage payments made by the property owners.
Multi-family MRBs are used to finance construction and mortgage loans as well as capital improvements for multi-family housing. Federal law requires that 20 percent of the total units in an assisted project be reserved for lower-income households (80 percent of median income).
Redevelopment - Tax Increment Financing
California Community Redevelopment Law allows redevelopment agencies to utilize the incremental increases in tax revenues generated by a project to pay for project-related activities. Under this technique, known as tax increment financing, a
redevelopment agency may borrow money or sell bonds to finance improvements in a redevelopment project area and repay these debts utilizing the incremental increases in tax revenues generated by new or improved development occurring after the adoption of the redevelopment plan for the area. State law generally allows the local community to determine the manner in which these tax increments will be used. However, the law specifically requires that 20 percent of the tax increments generated by redevelopment projects initiated after January 1, 1977, be devoted to the provision of housing for low and moderate-income persons. Such housing can be provided within the redevelopment project area or elsewhere in the City.
