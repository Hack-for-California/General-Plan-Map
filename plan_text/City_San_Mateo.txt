   A. INTRODUCTION
The City is striving toward making it convenient for many residents to travel to work, obtain
services, shop, recreate, and travel to school without always using single occupant vehicle trips.
To support that end the Circulation Element focuses on human mobility such as public transit,
bikeways, pedestrian routes, roadways, and parking facilities. The Circulation Element includes
goals and policies from the City’s adopted Climate Action Plan (CAP) which is an appendix to
the General Plan. The CAP identifies the City’s transportation objectives for reducing vehicle
trips and expanding alternative transit. Strategies in the CAP also include transportation demand
management and other programs that foster more sustainable forms of transportation.
The Circulation Element embraces a Complete Streets approach by considering all modes of
transportation addressing pedestrian and bicycle master planning, bike parking facilities, and
transit improvements. Other critical components of the Circulation Element address the
Transportation Fee Ordinance, High Speed Rail, Transit Oriented Development, Transportation
Demand Measures, and the establishment of a Transportation Management Association all to
reduce vehicle trips, encourage transit use, and promote bicycle and pedestrian accessibility and
funding.
The Circulation Element analyzes traffic, transit, bikeway and pedestrian conditions and needed
improvements so that existing and projected circulation needs may be adequately met. It is
integral to many other portions of the General Plan, particularly the Land Use Element. Traffic
congestion and other circulation constraints have been major considerations in determining land
use policies which will guide the future development of the community.

    B. FUNCTION OF THE ROADWAY
            SYSTEM
BACKGROUND
San Mateo has a hierarchy of streets which serve different functions. These include freeways,
arterials, collectors, local streets and alleyways, as shown on Figure C-1.
Freeways
Freeways route traffic through the community and are characterized by large traffic volumes and
high speed travel. There are two freeways in San Mateo: US 101 (Bayshore Freeway) and SR 92
(J. Arthur Younger Freeway). State Route 280 also provides regional access to the community
and is located just west of the City's sphere of influence.
The Land Use Element of the General Plan concentrates large-scale commercial development
close to freeway ramps so that regional traffic is not routed through the community. The SR 92
corridor, for example, contains several high intensity commercial centers which are suitable for
intensification, given their good freeway access and relative isolation from residential
neighborhoods.
Arterials
Arterials link residential and commercial districts, and serve shorter through traffic needs. Due
to the heavier traffic on arterials, adjacent land uses are intended to be a mix of commercial and
multi-family residential, such as along El Camino Real and San Mateo Drive. In San Mateo,
however, many arterials are located in single-family neighborhoods. Examples include portions
of Hillsdale Boulevard, Norfolk Street, and Alameda de las Pulgas.
Because the primary function of arterials is to move relatively high volumes of traffic,
interruptions to traffic flow caused by turning movements at driveways and intersections should
ideally be minimized. In San Mateo, however, established patterns of development have created
driveways along most arterials. While the Land Use Element retains established single-family
neighborhoods along many arterials, it is expected that increased traffic on these roadways will
occur.
Collectors
Collector streets link neighborhoods to arterials and are not intended for through traffic, but are
nonetheless intended to move traffic in an efficient manner. Collectors should not form a
continuous system, so that they are not used as convenient substitutes to arterials. In San Mateo,
as drivers avoid congested thoroughfares, traffic diversion onto collectors has increasingly

impacted neighborhoods close to such major arterials as El Camino Real and Hillsdale
Boulevard.
Local Streets
Local streets are designed to serve only adjacent land uses and are intended to protect residents
from through traffic impacts. New multi-family residential and commercial development should
not have primary access on local streets, except where there is no feasible alternative.
Typical traffic capacities for local streets and the other roadway types in San Mateo are listed in
the following table:

GOALS AND POLICIES
GOAL 1:            Design and regulate use of city streets according to their classification and
                   intended function as shown in Figure C-1.
POLICIES
C 1.1:             Minimize Traffic Diversion. Discourage non-local and commercial traffic from
                   using local and collector residential streets through land use restrictions and
                   traffic control devices, where appropriate. Design existing arterial roadways to
                   minimize the diversion of traffic onto local residential streets.
It is intended that residential neighborhoods be protected from the impacts of traffic diversion
onto local and collector streets from the more heavily traveled roadways. This can be
accomplished by ensuring, where feasible, adequate capacity of arterials, regulating the direction
of traffic flow, and/or through placement of cul-de-sacs, ovals or islands or some other
delineation device to avoid convenient substitute routes.
C 1.2:             Minimize Curb Cuts On Arterial Streets. Discourage creation of new curb cuts
                   on arterial streets to access new development. Take advantage of opportunities to
                   combine driveways and reduce the number of existing curb cuts on arterial streets.

Circulation
C 1.3:          Protect Local Streets. Minimize the impact of new development on local
                streets. When warranted, construct improvements on local streets consistent with
                the City’s Neighborhood Traffic Management Program.
Arterial streets are intended to carry the highest level of traffic within the City. Proper
functioning of the arterial street system minimizes potential impacts on local streets. Curb cuts
cause friction to the traffic stream and can reduce the capacity of arterial streets. Reducing the
number of curb cuts on arterial streets will result in better traffic performance of the arterial
street and can help prevent diversion of traffic onto local streets. This may result in some
increase in traffic on some local street segments. This impact should be reduced by thoughtful
placement of project driveways and, when appropriate, implementation of local street
improvements consistent with the City’s Neighborhood Traffic Management Program.
The General Plan ensures that arterials and collectors provide access to the higher intensity
commercial and residential districts. It is intended that local streets in single-family districts be
protected from the adverse impacts associated with traffic generated by either higher intensity
development or changing travel patterns. Individual project design should minimize traffic
impacts by considering the direction of access in the placement of driveways. In neighborhoods
where the existing or future impacts of motor vehicle traffic are severe, NTMP measures may be
used. The process for determining the application of NTMP measures is described in the City’s
adopted Neighborhood Traffic Management Program.
C 1.4:          Neighborhood Traffic Management. Manage traffic and speeds on arterials,
                collector and local streets using techniques specified in the City’s Neighborhood
                Traffic Management Program (NTMP).
C 1.5:          Restrict Truck Traffic. Restrict the use of city streets by trucks not serving
                businesses within San Mateo as designated by City ordinance and the adopted
                Truck Route Program.
Trucks adversely affect traffic flow and roadway capacity. The noise, vibrations and exhaust
fumes generated by trucks also create nuisance problems for residential neighborhoods. To
minimize these impacts, truck through traffic is restricted to the freeways and truck routes
designated by City ordinance and the adopted Truck Route Study and Policy document. These
routes provide efficient through circulation and truck access to the major commercial areas in the
community.

  C. EXISTING TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
BACKGROUND
Levels of Service
Traffic volumes are measured in terms of Average Daily Traffic (ADT) and peak hour volumes.
The AM peak hour generally occurs sometime between 7:00 and 9:00 AM, and the PM peak
hour between 4:00 and 6:00 PM. It is during these periods that the most congested traffic
conditions occur on an average day.
Street capacity is restricted primarily by intersections, which can provide limited flow to each
intersection approach. The adopted methodology for determining levels of service is the average
intersection delay, which is calculated by summing the average delay for vehicles in each lane
for all intersection approaches. The average delay ratings are divided into six "Levels of
Service" (LOS), A through F, representing conditions ranging from free-flow with little or no
delay (LOS A) to extreme traffic congestion with excessive delay (LOS F), Table C-2. When the
average delay reaches 80.0 seconds, the intersection is "at capacity" and theoretically can not
accommodate additional traffic. This condition is described as Level of Service F.
Trends and Conditions
Because of its location in the Bay Area, San Mateo is a focal point for traffic. The City is at the
crossroads of two major freeways, is centrally located between San Francisco and Santa Clara
County's "Silicon Valley", and has direct access to the East Bay and coast via SR 92. As a result,
heavy traffic conditions characterize most arterials and the two highways in San Mateo. Average
Daily Traffic rates for US 101, SR 92 and El Camino Real are shown in Table C-3.
Increased traffic in San Mateo has been noticeable in recent years. This has been evident on the
freeways where traffic volumes have increased on US 101 and SR 92 between 0.4% and 5.2%
from 2000 and 2005 as shown on Table C-3. This increase in traffic is due to growth on the
Peninsula in general and a regional imbalance of where people live and work. However, traffic
on El Camino Real (south of SR 92) decreased 35.5% between 2000 and 2005 as shown in Table
C-3. This is mostly attributable to improvements to the roadway network that redistributed
traffic to other areas of the city. The most significant improvements have been near the 3rd & 4th
avenues interchange with US 101 and at the Hillsdale/US 101 interchange which have most
likely have led to an increase in usage of US 101 relative to El Camino Real.
San Mateo has a substantial employment base of its own, causing significant commute traffic
into the City in the morning and away from the City in the evening. The College of San Mateo
contributes to congestion on SR 92, particularly in the morning. Both westbound and eastbound
congestion occurs on SR 92 during the evening as commuters travel to the coast, connect with I-
280, or return to the East Bay. Congestion on US 101 occurs during both morning and evening
peak periods.

In 2030, the majority of the signalized intersections will continue to operate at acceptable levels
of service (mid D LOS with an average delay of less than 45 seconds). However, the following
three intersections will exceed the established level of service standard with anticipated levels of
development:
         •         Delaware Street and 19th Avenue
         •         Grant Street and 19th Avenue
         •         El Camino Real and Crystal Springs Road
Improvements are recommended to maintain acceptable levels of service at these subject
intersections. Improvements to the intersection at El Camino Real and Crystal Springs Road
include widening the curb lane to allow a right turn movement onto Crystal Springs Road from
El Camino Real (southbound). Restriping is called for at the intersections of Grant Street and
19th Avenue and Delaware and 19th Avenue. Diagrams of planned improvements at these three
intersections are shown in the Traffic Mitigation Report.
Peak period Levels of Service for this and other intersections are shown in Table C-4. The year
2005 is used as a basis for evaluation. The City's traffic model is based on population and
employment data derived from the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG). This is
consistent with the traffic model used by the San Mateo City/County Association of
Governments (C/CAG) as part of its Congestion Management Plan.

   D. FUTURE TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
BACKGROUND
Traffic Model
Year 2030 traffic volumes were determined by the San Mateo travel demand model, which is the
transportation planning tool used to estimate future travel demand. It is essentially a
mathematical model developed to simulate observed travel patterns. A travel demand model
requires many inputs, primarily the transportation network and the land use characteristics of an
area. The model estimates how many trips people make, where the trips are coming from and
going to, which mode of transportation (auto, transit) people use, and which roads or transit lines
people use to get from their origin to their destination.
The transportation system is represented by a computerized network of lines, links, and nodes.
The land use data, based on the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) projections and
Census data, describe the activities for a specific area, which attract and produce traffic. Traffic
is assigned to the transportation network based on many factors including: auto availability,
travel time, travel cost, and transit accessibility. Initially, the model estimates traffic for a 3-hour
time period during commute hours. The 3-hour volumes are used for comparison and are then
factored into one-hour turning movements. Turning movements at intersections are the least
accurate of the model outputs. Nevertheless, many studies require the evaluation of future levels
of service at key intersections. In order to increase the reliability of future turning movement
estimates, adjustments are made based on the actual count data and the performance in the base
year. This calibration/validation process ensures that the model replicates observed travel
patterns.
Regional Growth and Related Traffic
The travel demand model has shown that the recent increases in regional traffic will continue in
the future. In the mid-county region, most growth will be concentrated in Foster City,
Redwood City, and San Mateo. An even balance of jobs and employed residents in the City is
projected to continue until 2030. The County as a whole, however, is expected to have many
more new jobs compared to new resident workers, which may mean that there will be more
commuting into the area or that economic growth will slow below projections due to lack of
employees to fill the projected jobs.
The San Mateo traffic model shows that regional growth will result in a 12% increase between
the 2005 and the 2030 levels of daily traffic on freeways that pass through San Mateo, including
US 101 and SR 92. The traffic increase is partially due to development along the Route 101
corridor, which will occur despite current levels of congestion. The result will be longer periods
of congestion. Auxiliary lane projects on Route 101 and 92 are programmed by 2030 throughout
San Mateo County, which translates into some added highway capacity in the future.

Local Traffic
According to the model, increases in traffic on most San Mateo streets are expected to be up 15%
by the year 2030. Generally, streets that will be congested in the future are currently congested,
or are located close to planned development. Future congestion, especially on El Camino Real,
will be attributable to a combination of new traffic and existing problems. Additionally, while
increased traffic on El Camino Real is partly due to the projected increase in jobs and households
within the City of San Mateo, it is also attributable to diverted traffic from Route 92 and Route
101 due to congestion on the freeways.
Table C-4 compares the 2030 levels of service to 2005 conditions and identifies intersections
with unacceptable Levels of Service. The Traffic Mitigation Report prepared by Hexagon
Transportation Consultants, Inc. includes discussion of the recommended improvements to
improve the operating conditions of these intersections. These improvements include street
extensions, freeway widening, and upgrade of several intersections, including added turning
lanes, restriping and signalization.

Circulation
    E. ROADWAY IMPROVEMENTS
BACKGROUND
The planned roadway improvements needed to reduce existing traffic problems and to
accommodate the development anticipated by the General Plan are discussed in detail in the
City’s Traffic Mitigation Report prepared by Hexagon Transportation Consultants, Inc.
Target Level of Service
The anticipated growth planned for by the General Plan would result in substantial degradation
of traffic conditions at several intersections, if not mitigated. The intent of the Traffic Mitigation
Report is threefold: to solve existing congestion problems, to maintain existing traffic conditions
where they are good, particularly on residential streets, and to reduce the impacts of anticipated
growth.
Only feasible traffic improvements are included in the Report. Determination of "feasibility"
involved a number of factors: physical constraints (i.e., right-of-way need versus availability),
cost (including construction and right-of-way), and net benefit (the additional roadway capacity
gained versus cost, loss of on-street parking, and the impact on neighbors).
GOALS AND POLICIES
GOAL 2:         Maintain a street and highway system which accommodates future growth while
                maintaining acceptable levels of service.
POLICIES
C 2.1:          Acceptable Levels of Service. Maintain a Level of Service no worse than mid
                LOS D, average delay of 45.0 seconds, as the acceptable Level of Service for all
                intersections within the City.
C 2.2:          Traffic Improvement Master Plan. Maintain a master plan for street system
                improvements necessary to accommodate future growth and maintain acceptable
                levels of service. Intended improvements within the time frame of the Plan are
                listed in Appendix D, and may be updated by Resolution of the City Council
                consistent with Policy C-2.1.
C 2.3:          Roadway Improvement Implementation. Enact fiscal policies to provide that
                the roadway improvements listed in Appendix D are funded and accomplished
                throughout the timeframe of the General Plan to achieve the Level of Service
                standards set forth in Policy C-2.1
A peak hour Level of Service mid-D, average delay of 45 seconds, is the desirable "worst case"
Level of Service for intersections. This is generally considered acceptable for peak period

operations under urban traffic conditions such as those in San Mateo. It represents "tolerable"
delay in which a motorist would expect to typically wait through one and possibly a maximum of
two signal cycles.
The Traffic Mitigation Report prepared by Hexagon Transportation Consultants, Inc.
summarizes the anticipated street system improvements that would occur within the time horizon
of the General Plan. There are only limited opportunities for new roadway facilities in the
heavily built-up areas of San Mateo. In most cases, the assumed intersection improvement
would result in an average delay of 45 seconds or better; however, in some cases a situation
worse than the desirable target Level of Service is expected due to physical constraints making
full mitigation infeasible. In these areas, a combination of techniques should be employed to
minimize further traffic congestion, including constraining the permitted scale of development in
the vicinity of the congestion problem and requiring the implementation of a Transportation
Demand Management Program as a condition of development project approval.
It is intended by the General Plan that all the roadway improvements listed in Appendix D be
implemented within the timeframe of the Plan, with the possible exception of improvements
indicated as needing further study.
C 2.4:             Transportation Fee Ordinance. Require new developments to pay for on-site
                   improvements to meet the needs of development and their proportionate share of
                   the costs for mitigating cumulative traffic impacts within the City of San Mateo.
                   Utilize a Transportation Fee Ordinance to finance necessary off-site
                   improvements equitably. The off-site improvements will include intersection and
                   street improvements to maintain intersection levels of service, traffic safety
                   improvements and improvements to reduce single occupant vehicle trips such as
                   bicycle system enhancements, pedestrian improvements, and trip reduction
                   measures.
It is clear that future development in San Mateo will cause added burden on the transportation
system. The revenue generated by a traffic impact fee will offset the cost of roadway
improvements which are needed as a result of this development. San Mateo has adopted an
Impact Fee Ordinance which establishes a per unit fee amount on new commercial and
residential development. This fee structure and amount is derived from the Land Use Plan and
the related road improvements needed to achieve an "acceptable" Level of Service established by
the Plan. The fee reflects only the incremental increase in demand placed on the circulation
system by new development projects and is not imposed retroactively on existing land uses.
The revenues derived from the fee offset only a small portion of the total costs of roadway
improvements, and will be used primarily to pay for the less substantial mitigations. The
percentage varies depending on the improvement, please see Table 2-1 in the Traffic Mitigation
Report (Appendix D), which shows actual percentages. To make up the deficit, a development
project may be required to pay the full cost of off-site traffic improvements through the
environmental assessment process, in addition to paying the impact fee, with a possible provision
for reimbursement by the City.

C 2.5:          Traffic Studies. Require site-specific traffic studies for development projects
                where there may be a substantial impact on the local street system. Traffic
                impacts caused by a development project are considered to be unacceptable and
                warrant mitigation if the addition of project traffic results in a cumulative
                intersection level of service exceeding the acceptable level established in Policy
                C-2.1; where there may be safety hazards created; or where there may be other
                substantial impacts on the circulation system.
The traffic model does not identify all site specific impacts. To ensure that adequate traffic
capacity is maintained and project related impacts are identified a traffic impact study is required
of all public and private development projects for which an environmental assessment is
prepared and where there is the potential for traffic impact. This study should include a traffic
flow analysis to determine trip generation and the distribution and assignment of traffic resulting
from the proposed project. A development project may be denied or the project may be required
to be revised based on the degree of traffic impacts created relative to the acceptable Level of
Service established by Policy C-2.1, resultant circulation hazards, or other substantial impacts on
the circulation system.
C 2.6:          Prioritization and Timing of Roadway Improvements.                                       Roadway
                improvements shall be periodically prioritized to be correlated with the
                distribution and pace of development, and to reflect the degree of need for
                mitigation.
C 2.7:          Exceeding the Acceptable Level of Service. In addition to paying the
                transportation impact fee, a development project may be required to fund off-site
                circulation improvements which are needed as a result of project generated traffic,
                if:
                        a.      The level of service at the intersection drops below mid-level LOS
                                D (average delay of more than 45 seconds) when the project traffic
                                is added, and
                        b.      An intersection that operates below its level of service standard
                                under the base year conditions experiences an increase in delay of
                                four or more seconds, and
                        c.      The needed improvement of the intersection(s) is not funded in the
                                applicable five-year City Capital Improvement Program from the
                                date of application approval.
The cost of the off-site improvements may be reimbursed by the City if a reimbursement
program is established throughout the timeframe of the Traffic Mitigation Report or at the time
when the improvement was initially scheduled.
Roadway improvements will be prioritized by the City Public Works Department and phased
over the timeframe of the General Plan based on the degree of need and availability of funds. It

is intended that the Traffic Mitigation Report be periodically reviewed and updated to reflect
changes in growth projections and traffic conditions.
Situations may arise where the traffic of a proposed development project would result in an
intersection Level of Service in excess of what is determined to be acceptable, and the
improvement of the intersection is not scheduled for years to come. If the impact is significant,
the City may require the development project to wait until the roadway improvements are made
or require the developer to pay the cost of needed off-site improvements with a provision for
City reimbursement throughout the timeframe of the Plan or at the time when the improvement
was initially scheduled.
C 2.8:             Traffic Signal Installation. A development project may be required to fund
                   signalization of off-site unsignalized intersections if warranted as a result of
                   project generated traffic. In addition, existing conditions may warrant
                   signalization of unsignalized intersections. A warrant analysis to determine the
                   need for signalization shall include consideration of both existing and projected
                   traffic and pedestrian volumes, traffic delays and interruptions, accident history,
                   and proximity of sensitive land uses, such as schools.
The installation of properly located traffic signals will provide for the orderly movement of
traffic, increase the capacity of the intersection, reduce frequency of accidents, can allow for
continuous movement along a given route, and permit minor street traffic to enter and cross
major streets in a safe and continuous manner. Improper or unwarranted signal installation may
cause excessive delay, increased accident frequency, circuitous travel along alternate routes and
disobedience of signal indications.
The need for traffic signals will be measured by acceptable traffic engineering standards, such as
the Federal Highway Administration Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for traffic
signal standards. Where appropriate traffic signal warrants are met, the City may require
installation of a traffic signal after consideration of impacts on surrounding land uses and the
need for coordination with other existing and planned intersection improvements.
C 2.9:             Dedication of Needed Right-of-Way for Roadway Improvements. Require
                   dedication of needed rights-of-way for roadway improvements shown in
                   Appendix D, which are deficient in land area. Dedication shall be required where
                   the development project contributes to the need for the roadway improvement and
                   where the cost of dedication is not so disproportionate to the size of the project or
                   traffic generated to make it unreasonable.
In some cases, adequate public right-of-way is not available to accomplish necessary roadway
improvements. The City will need to purchase right-of-way or require its dedication as a
condition of development project approval. Dedication is required where a development project
creates the need for the roadway improvement and where the required mitigation is reasonable
(i.e., where the severance impact on the property is not excessive to the degree that it is greater
than the benefit to the street system).

C 2.10:         Transportation Demand Management (TDM). Participate in the TDM
                Program as outlined by the San Mateo City/County Association of Governments
                (C/CAG). Encourage TDM measures as a condition of approval for development
                projects, which are anticipated to cause substantial traffic impacts. C/CAG
                requires the preparation of a TDM program for all new development that would
                add 100 peak hour trips or more to the regional road network.
To minimize traffic congestion, a comprehensive program is needed that provides mitigation to
solve traffic problems. The City of San Mateo, which is almost built-out, offers limited
opportunities for physical improvements on the roadway network. In cases where it is
impractical or prohibitively expensive to increase the physical capacity of the street, the demand
on the roadway system must be reduced.
The Transportation Demand Management (TDM) program involves measures designed to
change travel behavior so that the number of vehicles on the roadway system during peak traffic
periods is reduced. The program provides a basis for crediting project trips based on specific trip
reduction measures for a variety of land uses such as retail, office, and residential. TDM
programs can involve a number of measures, including: Ridesharing, Work Pattern Changes,
Transit and Bicycle Use, Shuttles, Telecommuting, and Preferential Parking Controls. TDM
measures for residential development also may include development of schools and/or
community facilities in new subdivisions, creation of housing within one-quarter mile of rail
stations, and transportation kiosks.

  F.         TRANSIT
BACKGROUND
Transit service is provided by the Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board (Caltrain) and the San
Mateo County Transit District (SamTrans). Both extend service throughout San Mateo County
and into adjoining San Francisco and Santa Clara Counties. ParaTransit services are provided
Redi-Wheels Program of SamTrans and private taxi companies.
Future congestion of San Mateo roadways will necessitate a fundamental shift away from
automobile travel to transit services. This will especially be true for peak period commute travel
as the region's highways become increasingly clogged by motorists. In 2000, transit played a
modest role in the circulation system. However, in comparison to many other cities throughout
California, San Mateo has a higher percentage of transit riders. According to the 2000 Census,
approximately 6.2% of the San Mateo workforce used public transit to commute to work, which
is slightly higher than the 5.1% of Californians on average. Generally, cities in the San
Francisco Bay Area have higher percentages of commuters using public transit. Even though a
significant percentage of workers in San Mateo use public transit, the public transit system is
somewhat limited in its service.
Bus & Shuttle Service
Shuttle services are a key way to provide feeder service as well as local circulation. SamTrans
and Caltrain shuttle services are complementary and integrated, not duplicative. Several
SamTrans routes operate in San Mateo with major transfer points located at the downtown San
Mateo Caltrain Station in the northern portion of the City and El Camino Real and Hillsdale
Boulevard in the southern portion (See Figure C-4). Express lines operate daily into San
Francisco during the morning and return in the evening. Most of the local routes are located in
the midsection of town, extending in a north/south direction on arterials such as El Camino Real,
Alameda de las Pulgas, Delaware Street, and Norfolk Street. Service is also provided on
Hillsdale Boulevard, Highway 92, Parrott Drive and Polhemus Road to the outlying east/west
regions.
Free commuter shuttles are available at the Hillsdale Caltrain Stations, and within the
Bridgepointe business area. These commuter shuttles are funded through grants and City and
employer participation. The shuttle service operates during commute hours between transit
stations and major employment areas. The Norfolk Area Shuttle serves the areas in the vicinity
of SR-92 between Delaware Street and Norfolk Street. The Campus Drive Area Shuttle operates
between the Hillsdale Station and the Campus Drive office development. The Mariners’ Island
Area Shuttle operates from the Hillsdale Station, serving a business park off Saratoga Drive
before continuing to serve participating businesses in Foster City near SR-92. This shuttle stops
along Mariners Island Boulevard, adjacent to the Bridgepointe Shopping Center in San Mateo.
The North Foster City Shuttle also serves employers in the area of the Bridgepointe Shopping

Center in addition to other Foster City area employers. It transports riders to the Millbrae Station
for BART and Caltrain rail access.
Rail Service
The 2008 progress report for Caltrain indicates for the third year in a row, the commuter railroad
posted record-breaking ridership and recorded the highest annual ridership in the railroad’s 145-
year history.
In Fiscal Year 2008, Caltrain carried nearly 12 million riders, up 8.6 percent from the previous
year. Revenue was $40.1 million, up 15.1 percent from FY07. Some new riders were seeking
relief from high gas prices, but some were attracted to Caltrain’s Baby Bullet express service.
Since the service was introduced in 2004, ridership has increased 48 percent. The 100-year old
railroad bridges that cross Tilton Avenue, Monte Diablo and Santa Inez streets and Poplar
Avenue in San Mateo will be replaced to meet current seismic standards. In addition, the bridge
that crosses Poplar Avenue will be raised to improve access to the neighborhood for emergency
vehicles, such as fire trucks. New retaining walls will be built along the right of way to support
the track embankments. The abutments, which hold up the bridges, will be retrofitted and
finally, the bridges themselves will be replaced. The project will begin in summer 2009 and take
approximately one year to complete.
Caltrain plans to electrify the railroad by 2015. Not only will electrification reduce emissions, it
also will allow Caltrain to offer more frequent service; however, the overhead contact system of
poles and wires would result in changes that would increase visual clutter in some locations and
be perceived as negative by some residents and business occupants. In which case, the City
encourages the use of headspans to lighten overhead elements in sensitive areas. Additionally,
the City will coordinate with Caltrain to ensure aesthetic treatments of overhead poles and wires
throughout San Mateo.
Other transit projects that serve or will serve the City of San Mateo include High Speed Rail,
Dunbarton Rail and AC Transit regional express service.
GOALS AND POLICIES
GOAL 3:          Support the provision of public transit services adequate to provide a viable

                                         higher-density, compact development with pedestrian-friendly
                                         environments, to especially justify increasing levels of transit
                                         service.
Most of the City's area is within a quarter mile of bus routes; however, there is substantially less
accessibility to designated bus stops. It is SamTrans' policy to restrict passenger boarding and
alighting to designated bus stops.
Bus service limitations are also in scheduling. Local and express service is generally provided
up until 7 p.m., resulting in a lack of nighttime bus service for several areas of the City. Late
night service occurs on El Camino Real and Delaware Street. Local bus service to the train
stations is limited to standard commuter times, allowing little schedule flexibility in bus/train
transfer.
SamTrans operates express bus service at the US 101/SR 92 Park-n-Ride lot, which was
developed in 1987. The lot, which is substantially underutilized, contains approximately 150
parking stalls, with an expansion potential of 150 more stalls.
SamTrans' marketing and promotional effort has included: a school outreach program, market
studies for employee complexes, expansion of signage, targeted promotions for special events
such as the County Fair, 49er football games, media usage, and efforts to increase employer
purchase centers for passes, among other activities. It is intended that the City work closely with
SamTrans to achieve an optimal level of bus service in San Mateo and to ensure that adequate
transit information is made available to the community.
C 3.2:             Caltrain. Continue the City's strong support of Caltrain as an essential element
                   of the overall circulation system on the Peninsula and in the City. Support the

                       f.      Caltrain’s Project 2025 future vision includes three major phases
                               of development: state of good repair, electrification enhancements
                               and post-electrification enhancements. All three phases of the
                               program will provide increased frequency of service to San Mateo
                               and Peninsula residents and commuters.
The importance of Caltrain is evident in light of the projected traffic increases and limited
expansion potential of US 101, the major north/south transportation corridor that parallels the rail
line on the Peninsula.
Increased Caltrain ridership is limited by a number of factors: the lack of a convenient downtown
terminal in San Francisco, insufficient parking at train stations, limited bus/train transfer, and
schedule limitations, including the number of daily trains and the times of operation and lack of
connecting bicycle pathways.
A Joint Powers Board (JPB) between the local transit operators and San Francisco, San Mateo
and Santa Clara Counties has been formed to facilitate coordinated transit management, public
acquisition of the railroad right-of-way which was owned by Southern Pacific Transportation
Company, and transition of Caltrain to a transit system capable of providing frequent service,
comparable to BART. Public acquisition of the railroad right-of-way operations corridor was
completed on December 27, 1991. Transfer of individual train station site ownership is presently
being pursued by the JPB.
There are three Caltrain stations in San Mateo: Downtown, Hayward Park, and Hillsdale. The
San Mateo Travel Model shows that the majority of passengers drive alone to the stations and
park their cars. The Climate Action Plan (CAP) identifies the City’s strategies to expand shuttle
ridership and reduce single-occupant commute trips to Caltrain. Three public shuttles operated
by the regional Commute Alliance operate in San Mateo, transporting riders from the Hillsdale

Caltrain station to employment centers in the community. In 2013, these shuttles served
approximately 72,000 riders annually during morning and afternoon commute times.
Improvement of San Mateo train stations is considered a key element in increasing local transit
usage. This should include parking lot expansion and improved bus and shuttle access.
The Downtown Station is sited at 2 North B Street, north of First Avenue. Parking for the station
is provided on the State-owned commuter lot located to the north of First Avenue and containing
approximately 175 stalls.
C 3.3:             Hayward Park Station. Improve pedestrian and vehicular access to the station.
                   Redevelop the surrounding area with mixed-use and transit-oriented development.
The Hayward Park Station is sited on the east side of the railroad tracks just north of Concar
Drive. Parking for commuters is provided by a 130-stall parking lot accessible from Concar
Drive, west of Delaware Street. Access to the Station from the west of the tracks is limited due
to the lack of a grade separated crossing. Presently, the station is located behind a commercial
building, which does not offer pedestrian friendly access from Delaware Street. Redevelopment
of the surrounding area into a transit-oriented community will provide improved pedestrian
access to the station. Ideally, pedestrian and bicycle access should also be provided to Trinta
Park located to the southwest of the Hayward Park Station.
C 3.4:             Hillsdale Station. In conjunction with Caltrain, relocate the Hillsdale Station
                   northward to a new location in the vicinity of between 28th Avenue and 31st
                   Avenue, allow parking lot expansion and new parking garages, improve vehicular
                   circulation and pedestrian access, and facilitate direct on-site bus/train transfer.
                   Establish a circulation system for Hillsdale Station that will safely meet the needs
                   of the station as a major transit hub and heart of a transit village, and will
                   efficiently accommodate the many modes of transit it will serve. Also,
                   incorporate the concepts of transit-oriented development into the designs of the
                   areas surrounding the station such as mixed-use development, pedestrian friendly
                   design, and a variety of housing within walking distance, consistent with the
                   guidance of the City’s Climate Action Plan. Use the Transit Center Program in
                   the Hillsdale Station Area Plan as a starting point for station design. If necessary,
                   consider the 31st Avenue Alternative Program, which makes use of a more limited
                   number of parcels for the first stage of development and is found in Appendix B
                   to the Hillsdale Station Area Plan.
The Hillsdale Station is the most heavily used station in San Mateo and provides transit access to
several major destination points: Hillsdale Shopping Mall, Bay Meadows Phase II Specific Plan
transit-oriented development, and the San Mateo County Events Center. It is located on the west
side of the tracks at El Camino Real, north of Hillsdale Boulevard. Four commuter parking lots
are available, totaling approximately 497 parking stalls.
The planned relocation of the Hillsdale Station consists of installing a raised platform on an
aerial viaduct, which will provide safer access and easier transfers to buses and shuttles.
Improved vehicular access will also be an important component of the relocated station. The

transit center will include a new parking garage along El Camino Real near 31st Avenue, with
approximately 636 parking spaces. In Phase II of the Transit Center Program, a second parking
garage on South Delaware Street in the Bay Meadows Phase II project area will be developed,
with approximately 500 parking spaces. Future development near the station should be designed
to take maximum advantage of the proximity to transit.
Because Caltrain is predominantly at-grade, local circulation is impeded where crossings do not
exist and during times when crossing gates are closed. The majority of track crossings exist in
the northern section of the City and in the Downtown. Only four crossings, SR 92, Hillsdale
Boulevard, 25th Avenue and Laurie Meadows Drive/42nd Avenue are located south of Ninth
Avenue to the Belmont border -- a length of approximately three miles.
C 3.5:          Grade Separation of Rail Line. Promote the elimination of existing at grade
                crossings to improve local circulation and safety.
C 3.6:          Below Grade Rail Line. Depress the rail line through the downtown with street
                crossings remaining at grade as Caltrain service is increased and high speed rail
                through the corridor is implemented. Depressing the rail line in downtown should
                include examination of a tunnel alternative and potential use of air rights.
C 3.7:          San Mateo Rail Corridor Transit-Oriented Development Plan (Corridor
                Plan). Improve east-west access via new grade-separated rail crossings at 28th and
                31st Avenues.
Only seven of the total 18 rail crossings in San Mateo are grade-separated, four of which are
scheduled to be replaced to meet current seismic standards due to disrepair and inadequate
vertical clearance. These improvements are scheduled for the summer of 2009 and include the
Poplar, Tilton, Monte Diablo and Santa Inez bridges. Problems have resulted from the at-grade
system. During peak hours, the train causes a backup on nearby streets. Grade separation of the
rail line would allow unobstructed street circulation and improved traffic and pedestrian safety.
The key purpose of grade separations is to improve local traffic circulation and safety. The San
Mateo County Transportation Authority’s 2004 Measure A Expenditure Plan provides a list of
candidate projects for new or upgraded grade separations. Implementation of this policy also
supports transportation demand management strategies in the City’s Climate Action Plan.
The Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board is preparing Footprint Studies for the Hillsdale and
Downtown rail corridors. Slight raising of the alignment in the vicinity of the proposed 31st
Avenue grade separation will facilitate relocation of the existing station north to between 28th
and 31st Avenues and will avoid requiring realignment of El Camino Real. While a range of
alternatives are being considered for the rail alignment through downtown San Mateo, the City
has established its preference for a depressed alignment that would avoid impacts to the existing
street system and would reduce access to adjacent properties.
C 3.8:          Child Care Facilities Adjacent to Public Transit Stations. Consider including
                child care space in, or adjacent to, public transit stations/hubs.

impacted by the location of child care. Locating child care along major transit routes and in or
adjacent to transit stations, such as in the redevelopment and/or relocation of the city’s three
Caltrain stations, can reduce the miles driven and even enable parents to use public transit.

  G. BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN
BACKGROUND
San Mateo Bikeways System
Bicycling has steadily been gaining in popularity in recent years as a recreational activity and a
sustainable means of transportation. San Mateo is well suited for bicycling due to its pleasant
climate, relatively flat terrain, close spatial distribution of services, and varied scenic amenities.
The City and County are responsible for planning, constructing, and maintaining the bikeways
system.
The Bikeways System is shown on Figure C-5. The system generally provides good access to
the more important bicycle destination areas. This includes access within a few blocks of all
schools, parks, and train stations, and direct access to the three high schools and the College of
San Mateo.
The proposed bikeway improvements shown on Figure C-5 constitute recommendations for
improvements to the existing system. The actual design and type of these type of facilities may
be altered due to physical constraints identified in the field. Priorities for improvements are
indicated in policy C4.1: Bicycle Master Plan, which also calls for coordination with the
Countywide bikeways system.
A major inadequacy with the system is the high reliance on bicycle routes on major streets to
provide critical linkages. Bike routes consist merely of signs which guide the cyclist and caution
the motorist that there is a higher likelihood of bicycles being present. Bicycle lanes and paths
provide semi-exclusive and fully exclusive "right-of-way" to the cyclist. Lanes and paths are
safer and more enjoyable to cyclists, but their development is more costly and difficult due to the
extra space needed.
San Mateo Pedestrian System
Ideally, services such as jobs, schools, shopping and recreation facilities are within walking
distance of where people in the community live. Generally, San Mateo has a good distribution of
these services relative to residential neighborhoods. The distribution of retail centers includes
ten neighborhood shopping areas, two regional centers, the Central Business District and the El
Camino Real commercial strip. Sixty-five percent of all San Mateo households are within
walking distance of at least one of these retail centers.
Households east of the Bayshore Freeway have the best pedestrian access to recreation facilities.
Households in the northwest and southwest portions of the City have the poorest pedestrian
access to these facilities. It is the intent of the City to improve pedestrian accessibility to

recreation facilities in neighborhoods where it is most limited. (See the Open Space,
Conservation, and Recreation Element for discussion of the parks distribution).
GOALS AND POLICIES
GOAL 4:            Maintain a comprehensive bicycle and pedestrian circulation network which
                   provides safe recreation opportunities and an alternative to automobile travel.
POLICIES
C 4.1:             Bicycle Master Plan. Implement the Bicycle Master Plan’s recommended
                   programs and projects to create and maintain a fully-connected safe and logical
                   bikeways system; support the City's Sustainable Transportation Actions; and
                   coordinate with the countywide system.
It is the City’s intent to have a bicycling system that makes it convenient and safe for residents to
travel to work, obtain services, shop, recreate, and get to school on their bicycles.
Physical barriers such as US 101 and the rail corridor impede circulation on the bikeways system
in some areas. General linkage improvements are needed to some schools, major office parks,
and recreational areas, such as Sugarloaf Mountain, Crystal Springs Reservoir, and Shoreline
Park.
East/west access over US 101 is limited and considered potentially dangerous in areas due to
high speeds and volumes of traffic, necessary ramp crossings, and minimal area for exclusive
bicycle/pedestrian travel. Critical links include the Peninsula Avenue, Monte Diablo Avenue,
Third Avenue and Hillsdale Boulevard crossings.
North/south bikeways access in the Hillsdale area, east of El Camino Real, is lacking. The future
roadway system within the Bay Meadows II redevelopment site will become critical links of the
Bikeways System.
C 4.2:             Bicycle Facilities on Transit. Encourage additional bicycle capacity on Caltrain
                   and SamTrans (especially to the College of San Mateo). Provide an adequate
                   supply of secure covered bicycle parking at the Caltrain stations.
SamTrans and Caltrain provide limited facilities for the transport of bicycles. Bicycle racks on
buses would encourage more bicycle use between the hilly and lowlands areas. The Caltrain
Bike Parking and Access Plan includes improvements and innovative ideas to address the
demand for bikes on board the trains.
C 4.3:             Dedication of Needed Right-of-Way for Bikeways. Require dedication of
                   necessary rights-of-way for bike lanes and paths shown on Figure C-5, which are
                   deficient in land area. Dedication shall be required where the development
                   project contributes to the need for the bikeways improvement and where the cost
                   of dedication is not so disproportionate to the size of the project to make it
                   unreasonable.

Circulation
In some cases, adequate right-of-way is not available to accomplish intended bikeways
improvements. The City will need to purchase right-of-way or require its dedication as a
condition of development project approval. Dedication is required where a development project
creates the need for the bikeways improvement and where the mitigation is reasonable (i.e.,
where the severance impact on the property is not excessive to the degree that it is greater than
the benefit to the bikeways system).
C 4.4:       Pedestrian Master Plan. Implement the Pedestrian Master Plan’s recommended
             programs and projects to create and maintain a walkable environment in San Mateo
             and support the City’s Sustainable Transportation Actions.
C 4.5:       Pedestrian Enhancements with New Development. Continue to require as a
             condition of development project approval the provision of sidewalks and wheelchair
             ramps where lacking and the repair or replacement of damaged sidewalks. Require
             that utility poles, signs, street lights, and street landscaping on sidewalks be placed
             and maintained to permit wheelchair access and pedestrian use. Increase awareness
             of existing trails and routes by promoting these amenities to residents.
C 4.6:       Wheelchair Access and Pedestrian Accessibility. Continue to assess and improve
             wheelchair access throughout the City. Install wheelchair ramps or take other
             corrective measures where most needed in accordance with the established Citywide
             Wheelchair Program.
C 4.7:       Pedestrian Safety. Pedestrian safety shall be made a priority in the design of
             intersection and other roadway improvements.
It is the City's policy to require the installation of curb, gutter, sidewalk and wheelchair curb
ramps as a condition of project approval for all applicable development proposals. With the
exception of areas within the San Mateo Park neighborhood and isolated cases throughout the
community, sidewalks are provided citywide. Wheelchair access, however, is restricted in many
areas due to the past placement of utility poles, street lights, signs, and street landscaping within
the sidewalk area. All public projects are designed to be wheelchair accessible, and requests
from the public to install wheelchair ramps at specific locations are responded to by the City,
where feasible. These ramps are also beneficial for use by adults with strollers and the elderly.
As development occurs in San Mateo, traffic increases cumulatively. When an intersection
exceeds the adopted level of service standard, intersection improvements are recommended. To
provide an increase in capacity at an intersection, additional lanes may be added at the
intersection’s approach. This may have a negative impact on bicycle and pedestrian mobility
through the intersection. The City should value and consider both pedestrian and bicycle
accessibility and mobility needs when designing roadway improvements in conformance with
the City’s Climate Action Plan.
C 4.8: Pedestrian and Bicycle Mobility Needs.                  Balance pedestrian mobility and bicycle
accessibility and safety with vehicular congestion when considering intersection improvements
to address level of service degradation.

C 4.9:             Pedestrian and Bicycle Connections. Implement an area-wide pedestrian and
                   bicycle circulation plan which will result in convenient and direct connections
                   throughout San Mateo. Implementing connections in the Rail Corridor Transit-
                   Oriented Development Plan (Corridor Plan) area and into adjacent neighborhoods
                   and districts is a priority.
Both the adopted Pedestrian Master Plan and Bicycle Master Plan foster area-wide connections
throughout the community. The Climate Action Plan presents bicycle and pedestrian strategies
as complementary actions to reduce vehicular trips. Promoting alternative transportation also
supports the City’s transportation demand management efforts.
C 4.10:            Bikeway Systems. Review the City’s planned bikeways systems for adequacy,
                   consistency and connectivity throughout the City to facilitate ease of use and
                   safety for the users including adequate parking for bicycles.
The City will seek to implement infrastructure improvements citywide that support bicycle
activity. The Bicycle Master Plan identifies prioritized improvements for bicycle lanes, bicycle
parking at Caltrain stations and downtown, and other improvements such as pavement markers.
These strategies also implement the City’s Climate Action Plan.
C 4.11:            Hillsdale Bicycle and Pedestrian Over Crossing. Construct a bicycle and

A bicycle and pedestrian over crossing in the vicinity of Hillsdale Boulevard over US 101 has been
identified as an essential connection between the neighborhoods of San Mateo and destinations
such as the Bay Trail which is currently separated by US 101.
Through strategic capital improvements, programming, and better internal coordination of
bicycling projects, bicycling will become safer, more convenient, and more accessible in all
reaches of the City.

  H. MOTOR VEHICLE PARKING
BACKGROUND
Parking is a community-wide concern ranking equal to circulation. The need to provide adequate
parking is essential for the City's continued economic growth and stability, and to avoid adverse
effects of development.
GOALS AND POLICIES
GOAL 5:       Provide an adequate parking supply for new development.
POLICIES
C 5.1:        Parking Standards.
              a.    Review parking requirements periodically to ensure adequate parking supply as
                    a condition of development approval.
              b.    Review parking requirements periodically to ensure adequate parking supply for
                    change and/or expansion of land use resulting in increased parking demand.
It is important that each new development project provides adequate parking. San Mateo is
heavily dependent on automobiles and on-street spaces are at a premium in many neighborhoods.
Parking is generally judged to be adequate if it meets or exceeds the City's requirements and does
not generate demand for the limited supply of on-street spaces. Near transit hubs balance the level
of parking with TOD to maximize ridership and minimize vehicle miles traveled.
City parking requirements need to be periodically reviewed and new standards developed due to
changes in the size and number of automobiles and development or enhancement of alternative
travel modes. Parking spaces, especially structured spaces, are expensive to construct and can be
the most critical determinant in a development's feasibility. This is especially true for the upgrade
or changed use of older projects where adequate parking according to current standards is not
available. It is the intent of these policies that a balance be achieved between parking need and the
affect on the feasibility of new development.

    I. SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION
             ACTIONS
BACKGROUND
City staff, in partnership with the Sustainability Commission and a consultant, prepared a
Climate Action Plan (CAP). The CAP addresses eight environmental topics to reduce
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Topics include renewable energy, energy efficiency, and
alternative transportation. Strategies in the CAP for alternative transportation foster all modes of
transportation and identify strategies to expand on the City’s current transportation demand
management efforts.
The following transportation related goals and policies reflect the variable nature of mode
selection based on trip length, traveler age, and trip purpose. They will require significant shifts
in personal travel behavior, transit availability and convenience, transportation pricing and
vehicle variety. As it is not practical to eliminate all single occupant vehicle trips, the goals and
policies also address ways in which to reduce the emission impacts of all trips.
GOALS AND POLICIES
GOAL 6:            Implement the transportation objectives of the Climate Action Plan.
POLICIES
C 6.1:             Modal Share. Increase mode share for pedestrian and bicycle travel, for trips of
                   one mile or less, by regularly updating and implementing plans for sustainable
                   transportation infrastructure including the Bicyle Master Plan and the Pedestrian
                   Master Plan. Additional potential supportive actions to increase mode share are
                   detailed in the Climate Action Plan.
C 6.2:             Single Occupancy Vehicles. Reduce single occupant automobile usage for local
                   trips by implementing flexible alternative transportation programs within San
                   Mateo such as bike share programs, car share programs, additional local shuttles
                   for Caltrain connections and other programs that support reduced single-occupant
                   vehicle trips. Partners and program opportunities are identified and in the Climate
                   Action Plan.
C 6.3:             Travel to Schools. Reduce private automobile school trips by collaborating with
                   private and public partners to increase the number of students walking or
                   bicycling to school, expanding pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure for school
                   routes, implementing “walking pools” to schools, increasing carpooling for
                   students, and making flexible local transit available for student travel.

Circulation
C 6.4:           Commuting. Reduce single occupant commuting 20% before 2020 by expanding
                 the Transportation Management Association beyond Corridor Plan Area,
                 establishing parking maximums, requiring trip reduction for all development and
                 facilitating the provision of transit passes or other direct transit subsidies for
                 residents and employees within San Mateo. Additional actions to reduce single
                 occupant commuting is detailed in the Climate Action Plan, Appendix of the
                 General Plan.
C 6.5:           Transit Oriented Development Areas (TOD). Concentrate future development
                 near rail transit stations in the City’s designated TOD areas by collaborating with
                 partners to provide incentives for development and transportation demand
                 management within TOD areas, and encouraging developments within Transit
                 Oriented Development Areas (TOD) to maximize population and employment
                 within allowable zoning limits, consistent with direction from the City’s Climate
                 Action Plan.
C 6.6:           Fuel Consumption and Emissions. Expand the use of alternative- and clean-fuel
                 vehicles to reduce fuel consumption and vehicle emissions for trips originating in
                 or destined for the City of San Mateo by expanding infrastructure for electric
                 vehicle charging stations at public and private locations; promoting the use of
                 alternative fuel vehicles; and providing requirements and incentives for the
                 provision of alternative fuel infrastructure such as electric vehicle charging
                 stations. Community-wide targets for share of electric or alternative-fuel vehicles
                 are established in the City’s Climate Action Plan.
C 6.7:           Evaluate Progress. Monitor the City’s progress reducing vehicular trips as part
                 of the annual Climate Action Plan monitoring and reporting process, as described
                 in Policy LU 8.3 of the Land Use Element.
Most person trips generated in San Mateo are nine miles in length or less. About 99% of all
origins and destinations for trips made within San Mateo are within five miles of each other. 1
Without any significant change in the modes selected for this travel, it is predicted that as much
as half of these trips will be made by single occupant private automobile. Alternatively, many of
these trips can be made by bicycle or, for shorter distances, walking. For trips approaching five
miles in length, bus transit may be an option if a transit stop is conveniently located and service
is frequent enough to make it a viable option for all or some of the trip.
The age of the traveler can also impact the range of feasible travel modes. Over 30% of the City
of San Mateo population is between the age of 20 and 39. 2 Another 27% of the San Mateo
population is between 40 to 59 years of age. When combined, these two age groups represent
about 58% of the City’s population. These same groups also are among the most mobile and

generally include a significant share of the population that could elect to walk or bicycle to
nearby destinations.
Other factors impacting the choice of mode include weather, trip purpose, special needs of the
traveler and travel time limits. For example, more flexibility in mode selection exists for
recreational travel than for commute trips. In part, this may be a result of greater limitations on
allowable travel time for commute trips.
Work trips are slightly more than 21% of all daily trips. Commute trips average about 25 minutes
in length. 3 This is a factor that has remained relatively stable over time and suggests that
commute length is one important consideration when selecting both where to live and where to
work. Other factors include affordability, schools, etc. For the Bay Area and San Mateo, in
particular, cost of housing is a significant obstacle for people wanting to locate closer to their
workplace. Only about 11% of all commute trips have both origin and destination within San
Mateo. 4 The Metropolitan Transportation Commission has identified reducing the cost of
housing as a potential major transportation objective in their development of the next Regional
Transportation Plan. However, the committee has chosen to not set a goal in regards to housing
because the City is currently pursuing this question through other processes. Sustainability
should be addressed in future discussions on housing and land use as they relate to
transportation.
Modal choice for commute trips is distinctly different compared with the shorter local trips. The
modal choice for commute trips originating or destined for San Mateo compared with all trip
types is:

The City of San Mateo Travel Forecasting Model can potentially provide some interesting
metrics for evaluation of land use and transportation issues. Two commonly used metrics are
vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and vehicle hours traveled (VHT). It is predicted that in 2020, trips
with either origin or destination within San Mateo will produce almost 3.5 million VMT and

almost 85,000 VHT. Fuel consumption and vehicle emissions can also be used as program
objectives or to estimate the impact of trip reduction programs.
Producing a significant travel behavior for our daily trips or modal shift in commute trips will
require an array of changes to existing land use patterns, transportation alternatives and
transportation pricing on a regional basis. Many things have been tried over recent years.
Transportation Demand Management has been an integral part of transportation planning for
almost two decades but commute and travel patterns in the region have not changed substantially
in that time.
Reaching aggressive transportation goals is difficult to envision without some intervening and
unanticipated events. For example, significant progress in reducing vehicle miles traveled could
be anticipated with a severe shortage of gasoline and the accompanying increased costs. There
may be other unanticipated events that will move San Mateo and other communities toward a
more carbon neutral travel behavior including advances in communication, introduction of new
vehicles or availability of alternative fuels.
Addressing the transportation goals and policies will require reallocation of some staff activities
as well as investment in transportation services and infrastructure. The Public Works Department
annual work programs will include specific tasks and programs to be implemented to advance
the transportation objectives of the CAP. Annual CAP monitoring and reporting will also allow
the City to review overall community-wide progress reducing VMT and expanding infrastructure
for alternative transportation.
It is anticipated that the trip reduction tasks will be assigned to the Peninsula Congestion Relief
Alliance (Alliance). Some supplemental funding would be required since some of the requested
services will exceed what are typically provided by the Alliance. Introducing a Transportation
Management Association (TMA) to serve the downtown or other areas of the City would be
expected. Management of the TMA would also be assigned to the Alliance. Funding of a TMA
would be provided primarily by the participating businesses and residents that benefit from the
programs provided by the TMA.
Implementing a Community Transit Service requires a significant annual investment. While
some grant funding may be available, some grant funds are provided as “seed money” to initiate
new services and must be replaced with some on-going revenue source. On-going grants from
the Bay Area Air Quality Management District require that 25% of all costs be paid by the local
agency or participating businesses. Total annual operating costs for the current San Mateo
shuttles are almost $300,000 of which about $225,000 is funded through grants. The costs for
implementing a Community Transit Service would depend on the type and richness of service to
be provided as well as the availability of grant funding. It would also depend on the level of
funding provided by Sam Trans as part of their overall transit services provided within the
County.
The most costly and potentially time-consuming response to the CAP recommendations will be
implementation of bicycle and pedestrian enhancements, consistent with the City’s Bicycle
Master Plan and Pedestrian Master Plan. Seemingly simple improvements such as corner “bulb-

outs” to shorten pedestrian crossing distances can be costly. Often drainage or other design
issues result in significant costs for this type of project. For example, the bulb out that was
constructed in the northeast quadrant of the intersection of Baldwin and San Mateo Drive cost
over $70,000. Similarly, other pedestrian enhancements that include sidewalk widening,
streetscape improvements and other amenities can also be very costly depending on the work to
be done, impacts to the street cross section, drainage modifications required and specific
streetscape improvements planned. It will take a variety of different funding sources to effect
these changes, including Measure A, Transportation Development Act, Transportation for
Livable Communities and improvements included in new development projects.
Some bicycle improvements may be relatively simple to implement. This would include
improved signage and designation of appropriate routes. However, some improvements required
to implement bicycle lanes may require street widening and can become expensive to construct.
Public Works is currently designing bike lanes on Delaware Street between Bermuda and 25th
Avenue. This 1/2-mile project, which requires some street widening, is currently estimated at
about $250,000.
Achieving aggressive transportation goals cannot be achieved through San Mateo actions alone
and cannot be achieved using the same techniques that have been used in the past or even those
being used today. Instead, much more difficult policy choices will need to be considered and
many will need to be selected if aggressive goals are to be achieved. These difficult and
politically challenging strategies will include concepts like congestion pricing, paid parking,
higher tolls, increased land use densities and heights and aggressive strategies to make housing
more affordable in San Mateo County.

     Parks & Recreation
  A. INTRODUCTION
The Conservation, Open Space, Parks and Recreation Element (C/OS) sets forth the City's goals
and policies regarding the development, management, and preservation of San Mateo's natural,
cultural, and recreational resources.
This Element combines conservation and open space topics required by State law with related
non-mandatory topics which have been considered important to the physical development of the
City, including parks and recreation facilities and historic structures. Appendix F outlines State-
mandated issues and their relationship to San Mateo's C/OS Element.
Figure C/OS-1 illustrates the type and nature of open space in San Mateo as defined by State
law. "Open-space land" is any parcel or area of land or water which is essentially unimproved
and devoted to an open-space use and which is designated on a local, regional, or state open-
space plan as one or more of four types of use. Specifically, these four types of open space uses
are as follows:
         Open Space for Preservation of Natural Resources. This includes areas required for
         plant and animal habitat or for ecological and scientific study. In San Mateo these open
         spaces include areas such as the Bay Marshes, creeks and private open spaces, and
         Sugarloaf Mountain.

         Open Space for Managed Production of Resources. This includes forest and
         agricultural lands, water bodies important to the management of commercial fisheries,
         and mineral deposits. San Mateo does not include any such areas.
         Open Space for Outdoor Recreation. This includes parks and areas of scenic and
         cultural value, stream banks, trails, and other links between open spaces. In San Mateo
         these open spaces include Marina Lagoon, designated private land reserves, and a variety
         of park sites.
         Open Space for Public Health and Safety. This includes areas which require special
         management because of hazardous conditions such as unstable soils, fire risk, fault zones,
         or flood. In San Mateo these open spaces include portions of the shoreline, Sugarloaf,
         and San Mateo Creek.
  B. BACKGROUND
This section summarizes the setting for the goals and policies of this Element. The Conservation
and Open Space Background Report (March, 1989) provides more detailed information.
NATURAL RESOURCES
The significant natural resource areas in San Mateo are the Bay Shoreline, Marina Lagoon,
Sugarloaf Mountain, San Mateo and Laurel creeks, and certain undeveloped private lands which
provide open space and wildlife habitat.
The Bay Shoreline
The City limits of San Mateo include
roughly 1,200 acres of bay waters and
some three miles of shoreline. Most
of the Bay frontage is owned by the
City of San Mateo and the County of
San Mateo, with some properties held
in private ownership. The portion
under City jurisdiction is the subject
of the Shoreline Parks Specific Plan.
The Plan's goals include the
improvement of the shoreline,
provision of public access, and
enhancement of marsh vegetation and
wildlife habitat.
Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010 VI-2                       Resolution No. 134-2010
Amended by the City Council on April 18, 2011                                Resolution No. 42 (2011)
                                                             Conservation and Open Space Element
The Bay Conservation and Development Commission has rated the San Mateo shoreline as
"high" for value as waterfowl habitat. The largest tidal marsh area, and the City's most
significant wetland, is the 50-acre "Bay Marshes" off-shore in the southeast corner of the City
adjacent to Foster City. Harvestable shellfish beds exist off of Coyote Point Park and the
Bayfront.
Any adverse impacts that the City has on the Bay's water quality are most likely to come from
urban runoff which enters the Bay untreated. Sources of runoff are residential streets,
commercial operations, parking lots, landscaped areas, and industrial processes. The runoff is
assumed to include significant amounts of oils, grease, heavy metals, sediment, pesticides,
nutrients, litter, and bacteria.
Marina Lagoon
Marina Lagoon is 185 acres in size and approximately 4.5 miles long. While the lagoon
primarily serves a flood control
purpose, it also has recreational,
aesthetic and wildlife value.                 The
Lagoon includes a small (.4 acre)
island at the mouth of the former Seal
Slough which supports roosting,
nesting, and feeding shorebirds and
waterfowl. Like the Bay, Marina
Lagoon receives urban runoff directly.
The Lagoon has been significantly
affected in summer by algae blooms
and aquatic weed growth caused by
high nutrient levels. In 1999, the City’s
Public Works Department developed
the Marina Lagoon Management Plan, which recognizes the need to manage the Lagoon in a
manner that balances its three primary purposes: flood control, wildlife habitat, and recreation.
Creeks and Channels
San Mateo’s creeks have in large part been channelized, culverted, or subjected to development
well within their riparian corridors. Well vegetated sections do exist, however, and though non-
contiguous, support bird life, amphibians, small mammals, and some fish (Figure C/OS-2).
The exact status of water quality in the creeks and channels varies by creek and channel, and is
generally thought to be poor. The reason for this is that channels carrying urban runoff generally
deliver oils, grease, pesticides, sediment, litter, and metals. To improve the quality of its runoff,
San Mateo implemented the Stormwater Pollution Prevention Program (STOPPP) which is
consistent with the San Mateo Countywide Water Pollution Prevention Program (SMCWPPP).

activities in municipal maintenance, commercial and industrial business, construction and new
development, illicit discharges, and public information. Its strategy is to keep pollution from
entering the storm drain system and the Bay.
San Mateo Creek is the largest channel crossing the City; almost 75% of the creek's length is
above ground and well vegetated. The Water Quality Control Plan for the San Francisco Bay
Basin Region recognizes San Mateo Creek for its current value as groundwater recharge, wildlife
habitat, and fish migration. The upper Creek, however, is dammed, and the creek carries only
seasonal flows.
San Mateo Creek is the only channel for which a concentrated planning effort has been
undertaken. Pursuant to the 1985 Downtown Plan, a comprehensive study of the Creek was
completed and includes recommendations regarding flood control improvements. The Shoreline
Park Master Plan addresses the east end of the Creek by proposing improvements from US 101
to the Bay.
The upper reaches of Laurel Creek are within the Sugarloaf Mountain area. The natural
character of Sugarloaf Mountain helps to reduce runoff and erosion into Laurel Creek. The
Creek divides into two branches, each flanking Sugarloaf and having a flood control dam in
place. The two significant interruptions of the riparian corridor occur in the vicinity of
El Camino Real and through the center of the San Mateo Village area. There appear to be
opportunities for enhancement of other stretches of Laurel Creek since the Creek passes through
or is adjacent to a number of public facilities -- parks, schools, and a library.
Other notable creeks are the scenic Cherry Canyon Creek, which parallels Edgewood Road as it
crosses along private yards, Borel Creek that runs from the Western Hills to the 19th Avenue
Channel, and the small but relatively natural Beresford Creek, which flows from the canyons
south of Campus Drive to the 19th Avenue Channel. Other channels, partially lined or artificial,
flow through the City; potential for aesthetic and habitat improvement is generally thought to
exist but has not been studied.
Sugarloaf Mountain
In 1977, the Sugarloaf Specific Plan was
adopted proposing that approximately 225
acres be maintained as general open space
and public recreation. In 1988 the City
purchased the site. The proximity of this
open space to intense urban development
and its relationship to Laurel Creek makes
Sugarloaf the City's most valuable inland
natural resource, having scenic value,
potential for outdoor recreation, and
valuable wildlife habitat, and serving public

health and safety by reducing runoff and erosion in the Laurel Creek watershed. The City's 37-
acre Laurelwood Park is part of Sugarloaf Mountain and occupies the upper reaches and north
side of Laurel Creek.
Within this area, there occurs five vegetative communities each contributing valuable wildlife
habitat: grassland, shrub-chaparral, woodland, oldfield succession, and riparian. A management
plan for Sugarloaf Mountain was adopted by the City in 2007.
Private Lands/Western Hills
Among the City's private or semi-public land holdings, there are a few significant reservoirs of
vegetation and habitat. Within the City's sphere of influence there are roughly 400 acres of open
space, grasslands and woodlands in the unincorporated Highlands area.
Approximately 7 acres of undeveloped oak and shrub land are located on the northeast side of
Campus Drive adjacent to the 5 acre Verona Ridge development. On the south side of Campus
Drive is approximately 20 acres of undeveloped land; this steep canyon includes oak and shrub
acreage connecting with the Beresford Creek riparian corridor to provide valuable habitat.
Finally, extensive woodlands in and around the College of San Mateo continue the habitat and
open spaces of Hillsborough into the City of San Mateo.
Threatened and Endangered Species
A variety of plant, bird, reptile, insect, and mammal species of concern have been associated
with the San Mateo area. Figure C/OS-3 displays areas in which conditions exist such that
species could possibly be found. The status and general habitat of each plant and animal species
of concern can be found in Appendix G.
Many of the animal species of concern exist
in marsh and shoreline habitat, a resource
area that the City has jurisdiction over in
terms of enhancement, interpretation, and
access. The remaining animal species and
most of the plant species exist in grasslands,
creeks and canyons. Jurisdiction over these
remaining areas is variable. Nevertheless, the
City of San Mateo has management control
over Sugarloaf Mountain, City parkland, and
parts of San Mateo Creek and other creeks.
The City can make decisions regarding
development on public and private lands, and
may review and provide comments on
developments in unincorporated areas.

URBAN RESOURCES
Urban resources significant to San Mateo are "Heritage Trees", street trees, public open spaces,
pedestrian trails, scenic roadways, and archaeological and historical resources.
Heritage Trees
In 1968, the City adopted a Heritage Tree ordinance. The ordinance, which has been amended
several times since 1968, established the intent of preserving as many of these significant trees as
possible through the regulation of
removal and pruning. A Heritage Tree is
defined, in part, as one which is of
historical significance or which has a
trunk with a diameter of 10 inches or
more, if indigenous, and 16 inches or
more for all other trees, as measured at
48 inches above natural grade. The
ordinance also applies to a stand of trees,
the nature of which makes each tree
dependent upon the others for survival.
These         regulations          affect       both
undeveloped and developed properties.
When a tree qualifying as a Heritage Tree is removed for new construction, the owner must plant
additional vegetation on site or pay a fee to the City based on the calculated value of the tree
removed per City ordinance.
Street Trees
The planting, maintenance care, and removal of street trees is governed by the City's Municipal
Code. The intent of the Street Trees Ordinance is to foster the planting of trees, to promote
aesthetic value of streets, and to provide an orderly means of maintaining the trees. The Parks
and Recreation Department is responsible for administering the street tree program, which
includes over 20,000 trees on roadway medians in street-side planter strips, and in the public
right-of-way behind monolithic sidewalks.
No person may trim, remove, or plant a street tree without a permit from the Parks and
Recreation Department. When a permit for removal is granted, the tree must be replaced. A
Street Tree Master Plan has been prepared pursuant to the Ordinance; the Plan stipulates the
specific species that may be planted on each block throughout the City.
Public Open Space in Private Developments
The City of San Mateo Zoning Code includes open space requirements for planned
developments (residential and non-residential), projects in a variety of multi-family zones, and

projects in the Central Business District. Open space plazas for public use are required for large
buildings in the Central Business District. These plazas must be located on the ground floor
adjacent to the public sidewalk. The Zoning Code offers bonuses for the provision of open
spaces in the R-5 multi-family district and requires landscaped open space in the executive office
districts.
The Bay Meadows Phase I development provided approximately 4.6 acres of privately owned
and maintained park space. In addition, there is significant open space within the Franklin
Templeton Office Campus. The Bay Meadows Phase II development provides approximately 15
acres of public park land. Along with Bay Meadows Phase II, the City should seek additional
urban open space at the intersections of El Camino Real with 28th Avenue, 31st Avenue, and
Hillsdale Boulevard, as well as along Laurel Creek. These locations and concepts for urban open
space are described in the Hillsdale Station Area Plan.
Pedestrian Trails
Convenient, safe, and scenic walking trails and pedestrian routes serve citizens by providing for
travel, recreation, and exercise. There are two significant trails within the City limits: Bayfront
(Shoreline) and Laurelwood. The Bayfront trail is part of the City's Shoreline Park and the 400
mile San Francisco Bay Trail system now being constructed around San Francisco and San Pablo
Bays. Two trails cross through Laurelwood Park and will connect with Sugarloaf Mountain area
and be a potential Bay Area Ridge Trail link. Other significant trails related to San Mateo, but
outside the City, include Sawyer Camp and Crystal Springs. San Mateo Creek, crossing the City
from the DeAnza Expedition Site to the Bay, is a potential pedestrian and bicycle amenity to the
Downtown, a link to Caltrain, and a connection to the Shoreline in conjunction with the Third
Avenue/US 101 interchange. Crystal Springs Road is also a significant potential pedestrian trail.
If made more useable and safe for pedestrians, Crystal Springs would be a key link between the
City and the Reservoir trails, and in combination with San Mateo Creek, a key link between the
developing Bay and Ridge Trails. The Circulation Element of this General Plan reviews the
entire Bikeways system in San Mateo.
Scenic Roadways
The City of San Mateo does not contain any officially designated State of California scenic
highways. The County of San Mateo General Plan states that Alameda de las Pulgas, Crystal
Springs Road, Polhemus Road, and State Route 92 are County designated scenic roads. These
notable roadways, and J. Hart Clinton Drive, within and adjacent to the City (Figure C/OS-4)
offer views of creeks, hillsides, the Bay, and San Francisco and East Bay skylines among other
sights. Visual liabilities include inconsistent vegetation and poorly screened development.
Historical Resources
The establishment of the Downtown at B Street and Third Avenue as a result of the arrival of the
railroad is one key to the development character and history of the City. The second key is the

establishment of estates and country homes in San Mateo during the 1800's and then the
subdivision of those estates in the early 1900's. As a result of this early start in suburbanization,
San Mateo has many historically significant buildings, structures, and landmark sites. Individual
buildings of distinction are important to San Mateo's economy and quality of life. These
structures contribute to neighborhood identity and cultural diversity; they add to the overall
character of the City and the viability of the City for new businesses. Over the years, significant
buildings have been lost to fire, demolition, or neglect. Interest in preservation of these
structures among City residents has grown over the last few years.
In 1988 a historic building survey was commissioned by the City Council and performed by a
private consultant in conjunction with the San Mateo County Historical Association. This survey
work confirms that San Mateo is a "mature" community; with many properties over 50 years old.
The Survey identified some 200 historically significant buildings. Approximately 37 of these
structures are individually eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. The final Survey
Report (1989) identified these structures along with all buildings of local significance and areas
which could be classified as historic districts; all surveyed structures are mapped in the Report.
Because of the large number of structures, the Survey focused primarily on the oldest
neighborhoods, most of which are located east of El Camino Real. Survey efforts were
concentrated in the traditional downtown area, particularly along B Street and Third Avenue, and
the neighborhoods of Central, East San Mateo, Hayward Park, San Mateo Heights, and North
Central. Other areas west of El Camino Real and south of Hayward Park through 25th Avenue
were visually surveyed only. One area of particular note not included in the full Survey is San
Mateo Park. This neighborhood includes some 900 structures and warrants further study as a
historic district in the future.
In addition to the historic building survey work done in 1989, there have been other historic
evaluations performed on structures in the City. These evaluations typically coincided with
planning applications for alterations or substantial removal of dwellings and commercial
buildings. These evaluations have led to additional buildings being added to the City’s data base
for historic structures. Historic buildings and structures are shown on Figure C/OS 5, along with
their respective ratings of potential significance. It should be noted that there are five buildings in
the City that are listed on the National Register of Historic Places (listed by official name of
resource): Ernest Coxhead House on East Santa Inez; De Sabla Teahouse and Tea Garden on De
Sabla Avenue; Hotel Saint Matthew on Second Avenue; National Bank of San Mateo on B
Street: and the US Post Office on South Ellsworth Street.
Archaeological Resources
The City of San Mateo has an exciting past. It was initially the home of Ohlone Indians, on the
path of Spanish explorers, the first European settlement in San Mateo County, and incorporated
as a town before 1900.
Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010 VI-8                          Resolution No. 134-2010
Amended by the City Council on April 18, 2011                                   Resolution No. 42 (2011)

It is known that the Ohlone congregated near San Mateo Creek and the Bay Marshes. A 1983
archaeological survey concluded that while soil removal and construction have eliminated most
aboveground shellmounds, good potential still exists for the presence of undisturbed subsurface
archaeological deposits at surveyed sites. It was also concluded that high research potential exists
for sites adjacent to San Mateo Creek.
The City has been mapped for "archaeological sensitivity". The "high sensitivity" zone includes
recorded archaeological sites and the immediate area which are favorable sites. The "medium
sensitivity" zone includes areas surrounding the high sensitivity areas and other locales where,
while no sites are recorded, the settings are similar to those where recorded sites do occur. The
majority of the City is in a "low sensitivity" zone wherein archaeological resources are not
generally expected but may occur. (Because of concerns over the looting of sites, this map is
available only for inspection in the Planning Division office.)
PARKS AND RECREATION
The City operates a variety of park
facilities      including         playgrounds,
ballfields, turf areas, courts, picnic
areas, and gardens along with five
community centers, a senior center,
two swim centers, the Marina Lagoon,
and Poplar Creek Golf Course.
Diverse programs are offered year
round at these facilities for pre-
schoolers, youths, teens, adults, and
seniors.
Recreation Programs
The Parks and Recreation Department strives to provide a comprehensive program of activities
for all age groups serving five critical Service Outcomes:
         Active and Healthy Lifestyles
         Child and Youth Development
         Creative Outlets
         Enrichment and Lifelong Learning
         Creating Community
Fees for service are an integral part of the system of programs, and a Cost Recovery Policy has
been adopted by the City Council to provide a balance between service values and cost recovery.
Critical to the mission of Parks and Recreation is to provide access for all in this increasingly
diverse community, reducing financial, language and disability barriers to participation.
Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010 VI-9                        Resolution No. 134-2010

City resources to meet the Parks and Recreation mission are augmented by leveraging
community organizations and resources through cooperative, collaborative and sponsorship
relationships with other stakeholders in the identified Service Outcomes. In addition, in some
cases community non-profits are the service provider, and the City’s role is to facilitate and
support their efforts (e.g. youth sports organizations such as Little League, AYSO, etc.)
City Community Centers and Pool Facilities
The current inventory of community centers was built on a neighborhood services model
primarily to meet the drop-in needs of neighborhood children with low and no cost programs that
were prevalent during the 1950’s and 1960’s, the period during which nearly all of the facilities
were constructed. As such, the centers are generally small and have almost entirely multi-use
rooms. Table C/OS 1 provides the year of construction, and gross and programmable square
footage for each center.
This pattern of use is no longer prevalent and these facilities are no longer configured or
adequate to meet current or future needs. Moreover, multiple small facilities are not
operationally efficient due to higher square footage maintenance and operations costs and limited
opportunity for cost recovery.
Both swim centers were constructed in the 1960’s, and neither meets the operational or
programmatic standards or codes for community aquatic centers being built today. The current
facilities operate with inadequate water circulation systems, undersized mechanical rooms and
without the benefit of family locker or restroom facilities. Programmatically, each pool is
significantly limited. Current contemporary aquatic center installations support multiple skill and
interest levels with multi-activity configurations, including warm water (for play, lessons,
therapy) and cool water (for exercise), zero-depth entry, and water play features.

Three studies of the needs for community center and pool spaces have been conducted. Younger
and Pros was engaged in 2002 to conduct and develop a comprehensive assessment and strategic
plan for Parks and Recreation facilities and programs. The above descriptions of current facilities
are the result the Younger and Pros assessment and a specific study of Joinville Swim Center
conducted by Jones Madhaven in 2001. Younger and Pros’ recommendations for community
centers and pools were further refined in a 2004-05 analysis by Sports Management Group of
appropriate sizes, configurations and locations to provide adequate facilities to meet current and
future needs. Their study concluded that a total of 175,000 square feet of community center and
aquatics space, in a combination of multi-use and specialized-use spaces, would be needed to
meet current and future need.
City Parks and Open Space
The City has 40 park sites, two open space
areas, and one inaccessible open space area.
Figure C/OS-6 displays the locations and
classification of existing and currently planned
park facilities. Table C/OS-2 outlines acreage
information, and the Standards section includes
a description of park classifications.
An accepted method of evaluating the adequacy
of recreation facilities is through the
establishment of standards relating facilities to
population. These standards can be acreage
general or facility specific. This Plan sets a
goal of an overall acreage standard of
6.0 acres/1,000 population. San Mateo's 6.0-
acre goal consists of 1.5 acres of neighborhood
parkland per 1,000 persons and 4.5 acres of community and regional parkland per 1,000 persons.
Recent City projections of population for the year 2030 estimate approximately 119,800
residents in the City and sphere of influence areas. With this population and the currently
identified inventory of designated neighborhood and community parkland, the City would have
3.88 acres/1,000 persons (Table C/OS-3).

lack one or more of the recreation
facilities considered desirable in a
neighborhood.               Neighborhoods

El Camino Real (SR 82) and north

between SR 92 and the Downtown,
and northwest of downtown San
Mateo in particular have inadequate
parkland. The northwest sector of the City (located north of SR 92 and west of US 101) will
likely experience the greatest increase in population and density, exacerbating the acreage per
population deficit unless additional parkland is acquired. It is likely that the best acquisition and
dedication opportunities will be available within the San Mateo Rail Corridor Transit-Oriented
Development Plan.
Park Maintenance and Infrastructure Management
Equally important as developing or redeveloping park and recreation facilities is the necessity to
provide on-going maintenance and infrastructure management. Parks are a collection of living
components that in some cases, require daily attention. The impacts that result from public
usage, such as trash, vandalism and/or overuse add to the list of tasks that must be integrated into
an overall maintenance plan.
As fiscal resources become more constrained, it is even more important to establish both the
priority and frequency of maintenance cycles in concert with park users. Unfortunately, not all
landscaped areas are able to receive the same level of maintenance; therefore, a set of standards
that provides tiered levels of service that can be adjusted based on the financial capacity of the
organization becomes a necessity.
In addition to maintenance, consideration must be given to insuring that all park and recreation
assets, but especially those with a defined lifecycle, are managed in such a way as to extend their
useful life and insure that sufficient funds are available to replace or significantly rehabilitate the
asset once it reaches the end of its lifecycle. Ideally, an on-going funding stream, i.e. sinking
fund, should be created that would incrementally set aside money for improvements rather than
attempting to accrue funds at the time of a specific project.
As the primary stewards for the city’s natural environment including parks, open spaces,
landscaped medians and islands, and the urban forest it is important to effectively manage those
assets in such a way as to insure they are protected for the long term benefit and enjoyment by
the community.

School Sites
San Mateo's parkland, while providing for diverse interests, is significantly inadequate to meet
current and future community recreation needs. (For specific requirements, see the Standards
Section following Parks and Recreation Policies.) School facilities have been heavily relied
upon to augment City facilities. More than one-half of the soccer, tennis, swimming, and adult
hardball facilities and all but one of the gymnasiums are located at schools.
Unfortunately, in most cases school sites are of reduced value in addressing community
recreational needs because of restricted accessibility and availability; inadequate maintenance;
prohibitive user fees; or limited facilities that are not designed for park usage; or bureaucratic
user policies and regulations. Schools are frequently located within the service areas of parks
which do little to improve the geographic imbalance of facilities’ distribution throughout the city.
Even considering all school facilities available, the inventory of active facilities is inadequate to
meet current and future needs in several key areas.
Several means for improving the quality and availability of school facilities exist, including
cooperative maintenance and operating agreements, partnering in school improvement projects,
valuing city provided services such as public safety as a consideration towards enhancing
community access, and purchase of closed school sites when available. Table C/OS- 4 outlines
the ranking of priorities of issues to be considered when evaluating school properties. These
priorities would be applied in future consideration of City participation in school property use,
maintenance, and redevelopment.

In-Lieu Fees, Taxes, and Dedications
Pursuant to the Subdivision Map Act, local governments may exact land dedications, in-lieu fees,
or a combination of both for park and recreation purposes as a condition of approving a
subdivision map. The City has done so, through ordinance, for residential projects since 1969
and most recently revised in 2008. The amount of in-lieu fees collected is based upon the size
and nature of the project.
Various residential construction projects are subject to Park and Recreation Land and Facilities
tax and/ or a Park Impact Fee that applies to residential construction projects not covered by the
In-Lieu Fee provision. Parkland fees on commercial development are also allowed in California;
strict requirements are in place, which require a clear connection between the impact of
commercial development on facility needs, the fee, and the use of the fee. San Mateo does not
have such a fee. Day care fees have also been designed to mitigate development impacts on

community services. The City of San Mateo has a Child Care Development fee applicable to
commercial development that has been designated to assist in funding the development of child
care facilities.
A limited number of sites have been acquired through the City's dedication ordinance. Most
future growth of San Mateo will occur as a result of redevelopment, since there is little vacant
land available in the City. Redevelopment may provide smaller scale opportunities for
dedications adjacent to existing parks or schools.
   C. GOALS AND POLICIES
ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP
GOAL 1:             Protect and enhance the City's natural resource areas which provide plant and
                    animal habitat.
GOAL 2:             Conserve and manage the City's natural resources to ensure that current and future
                    generations will enjoy the environmental, social and economic benefits derived
                    from our urban forest, parks and open spaces.
POLICIES:
1.       BAY SHORELINE AND MARINA LAGOON
C/OS 1.1:           Lagoon Habitat. Enhance the wildlife habitat value of Marina Lagoon,
                    whenever possible, in conjunction with recreational use and flood control
                    management activities.
C/OS 1.2:           Bird Island. Maintain "Bird Island" as a bird nesting and breeding site.
Management decisions regarding Marina Lagoon have focused on recreational uses and flood
control needs. Decisions regarding access, boating, water levels, chemical use, and construction,
among others, also impact wildlife habitat; Policy 1.1 directs that habitat values also be
considered in decision making and that enhancement is an objective of management. The
companion Policy 1.2 directs that Bird Island be managed for its habitat value.
C/OS 1.3:           Interpretive Opportunities. Promote public awareness of the value and care of
                    the Shoreline through on-site interpretive programs or outdoor displays which are
                    in character with the adjacent open spaces.
Greater public understanding of the Shoreline is key to maintaining habitat values, water quality,

                    of the remaining phases of the Shoreline Parks Master Plan through RDA and
                    grant funding.
The implementation of the remaining phases of the Shoreline Parks Master Plan that was adopted
in 2000 will require time, effort and funding. Policy 1.4 directs the City to continue to seek
funds through Redevelopment Agency Funds and grants.
Implementation: C/OS 1.1 Lagoon Habitat, C/OS 1.2 Bird Island, C/OS 1.3 Interpretive
Opportunities, and C/OS 1.4 Shoreline Parks Master Plan
         The 1999 Marina Lagoon Management Plan incorporates preservation of wildlife habitat
         as a primary purpose in the management of the Lagoon. Remaining phases of the
         Shoreline Parks Master Plan to be completed include the Bayfront Nature Area,
         Tidelands Park, remaining improvements along San Mateo Creek east of Highway101
         and improvements along J. Hart Clinton Drive.
         The City has implemented the Stormwater Pollution Prevention Program (STOPPP) to
         increase the quality of runoff flowing into Marina Lagoon, and thus improve the quality
         of the lagoon for all users.

C/OS 1.5:           Conversion of Incompatible Uses. Encourage the conversion of existing land
                    uses which are not compatible with adjacent Lagoon or wetlands to permitted
                    compatible uses.
The adopted Land Use Element and Shoreline Park and Detroit Drive Plans, as well as the
Shoreline Zoning District allow for a limited number of recreation related land uses. Some land
uses not directly related to recreation or marine areas can be compatible with the shoreline and
Lagoon environment. Similarly, uses and development types which are not compatible due to
concerns about noise, runoff, habitat, and aesthetics should be restricted.
Implementation: C\OS 1.5 Conversion of Incompatible Uses
         This policy is implemented as specific development proposals are processed. However,
         existing legal, nonconforming uses would be allowed to continue for the life of the use.

2.       CREEKS AND CHANNELS
C/OS 2.1:           Aesthetic and Habitat Values -- Public Creeks. Preserve and enhance the
                    aesthetic and habitat values of San Mateo, Laurel and Beresford creeks and other
                    City-owned channels in all activities affecting these creeks.
C/OS 2.2:           Aesthetic and Habitat Values – Private Creeks. Preserve and enhance the
                    aesthetic and habitat values of privately owned sections of all other creeks and
                    channels, shown in Figure C/OS-2, whenever cost effective or whenever these
                    values outweigh economic considerations.
San Mateo, Laurel, and Beresford creeks have been identified as having significant natural
values. Policy 2.1 directs that aesthetic and habitat considerations be a part of all activities
affecting these creeks; revegetation, erosion control, and adequate setbacks are among the
possible actions. Further, while other City-owned channels have not been considered as
providing much scenic or wildlife opportunities, significant potential exists; Policy 2.1 directs
that these values be a part of channel management. Other creeks that cross through private
property are worthy of protection and enhancement; implementation of such measures is
promoted by Policy 2.2 with consideration of cost in the development process.
C/OS 2.3:           Hydrologic Impacts. Ensure that improvement to creeks and other waterways do
                    not cause adverse hydrologic impacts on upstream or downstream portions of the
                    subject creek; comply with Safety Element Policy S-2.1 regarding flood control.
Any alteration within or adjacent to a creek may affect upstream or downstream channel
conditions; Policy 2.3 directs that adverse hydrologic impacts be avoided or mitigated.

C/OS 2.4:           New Creekside Development Requirements.               Require that new creekside
                    development include the following:
                    a.       Adequate setback from the creek bank for flood control as directed by the
                             Safety Element Policy S-2.2.
                    b.       Protection or enhancement of riparian vegetation and water (including
                             stormwater) quality.
                    c.       Dedication of maintenance/bank stabilization easement in exchange for
                             City assumption of maintenance responsibility.
                    d.       Dedication of a public access easement where possible and desirable.
C/OS 2.5:           Creekside Development Density. Require that new development on creekside
                    lots be of a bulk and density appropriate to the buildable portion of the subject lot
                    in conformance with the City’s creek and slope standards.
In order to ensure safe, sensitive treatment of creekside development, Policy 2.4 directs that
habitat enhancement, maintenance, flood control, and access be accounted for in the design and
construction of projects adjacent to creeks. Creekside lots are impacted to varying degrees by
the size and location of the creek channel which generally represents unbuildable area of a
parcel; inclusion of this area in density calculations results in overbuilding on the remaining
portion of the parcel.
Implementation: C/OS 2.4 New Creekside Development Requirements, C/OS 2.5 Creekside
Development Density
         San Mateo Creek setbacks were established as part of the Revised Downtown Specific
         Plan in 1993. The Site Development Code and Zoning Code were revised in 1993 to
         address slope and creek setback, floor area, and density issues. Development adjacent to
         creeks is reviewed on a case by case basis with respect to setbacks, protection of the
         environment, and maintenance easements.

C/OS 2.6:           Water Quality. Continue to strive for the highest possible level of water quality
                    reasonable for an urban environment in City creeks, channels, Marina Lagoon,
                    and the Bay through the provision of administrative, maintenance, and treatment
                    measures. At a minimum, water quality levels must meet Environmental
                    Protection Agency (EPA) standards, allow for limited water recreation and sustain
                    aquatic/wildlife habitat appropriate to the water flow. The more stringent
                    requirements applicable to contact water recreation would apply to Marina
                    Lagoon and beach areas.
The City's creeks and channels (including Marina Lagoon) carry urban runoff and solid waste
through the City degrading aesthetic, habitat, and recreation values. Impacts on water quality are
most likely to come from urban runoff which enters creeks, channels, and the Bay. The runoff is
assumed to include significant amounts of oils, grease, heavy metals, sediment, pesticides,
nutrients, litter, and bacteria. Policy 2.6 directs that water quality be a management objective.
The minimum acceptable level of water quality is set by the EPA and includes the ability to
maintain aquatic and aquatic dependant habitat and to allow at least limited water recreation.
Non-contact recreation includes picnicking, hiking, boating, sightseeing, and interpretive study.
Contact recreation includes swimming.
Implementation: C/OS 2.6 Water Quality
         The City has implemented the Stormwater Pollution Prevention Program (STOPPP) and
         the Integrated Pest Management policy to increase the quality of runoff flowing into
         creeks, channels, Marina Lagoon, and the Bay which will improve the quality of these
         bodies of water for all users. The Public Works Department maintains water quality of
         Marina Lagoon adequate for recreational use (swimming and boating) by pumping in sea
         water to keep the Lagoon water from stagnating. This helps to prevent mosquitoes, algae
         growth and siltation.

                             minimum lot area for subdivisions and parcel maps, permitted floor area
                             ratio (FAR), and density of multi-family development.
                    b.       Cluster development to preserve steep slopes as private or common open
                             spaces.
                    c.       Preserve the form of the existing topography by limiting cuts and fills, and
                             the height and visibility of new development.
                    d.       Comply with Safety Element Policies S 1.1, S 1.2, and S 1.3 regarding site
                             stability.
C/OS 3.2:           Low-Impact Development. Regulate the location, density, and design of
                    development throughout the City in order to preserve topographic forms and to
                    minimize adverse impacts on vegetation, water, and wildlife resources.
Great care is needed in the design and construction of development on hillside properties if
stability, aesthetics, and habitat are to be maintained. Policy 3.1 directs that subdivision and
development potential be determined, in part, by the steepness of slope on this subject site. It
further directs that development proposals be designed to minimize grading, and adverse visual
impacts. Policy 3.2 directs that alteration of topography and habitat be minimized on all terrain
in the City.
Implementation: C/OS 3.1 Hillside Development Principles, C/OS 3.2 Low Impact

         The Land Use Plan, Building Height Plan and Building Intensity Plan take into account
         topographic forms and natural features in designating appropriate land uses, building
         heights and intensities/densities. The City's Site Development Code, Zoning Code, and
         environmental review process are used on a project-by-project basis to implement these
         policies during the planning application and building permit process.

                    in character with the open space consistent with the adopted management plan.
Sugarloaf Mountain is a significant regional resource. Policy 4.1 calls for the implementation of
phase one improvements to Upper Laurelwood Park and designates management as a City
priority once funds become available and demands for improvements to higher priority existing
facilities is reduced. Policies 4.2 and 4.3 direct that Sugarloaf be managed as open space but
remain accessible to the public and include interpretive opportunities to promote further
appreciation of the site.

                             site through restoration and/or habitat creation that would ensure no net
                             loss of wetland acreage, function, water quality protection, and habitat
                             value. Allow restoration of wetlands off-site only when an applicant has
                             demonstrated that no net loss of wetlands would occur and that on-site
                             restoration is not feasible. Off-site wetland mitigation preferably will
                             consist of the same habitat type as the wetland area that would be lost.
Although the City of San Mateo is a mostly built-out community, a variety of plant, bird, reptile,
insect, and mammal species of concern have been associated with the San Mateo area. It is
important to recognize the contributions that wildlife, plants, and habitat areas make to the
quality of life enjoyed by the residents of the City and adjacent communities. It is the City’s
intent to preserve and protect special status species, sensitive natural communities, wetlands, and
other habitat areas that may be affected by development. Policies 5.3 and 5.4 discuss
preservation of these resources and avoidance or minimal disturbance to these resources. Figure
C/OS-3 shows the various biological communities, and Appendix L provides a listing of special
status species that may occur in the San Mateo area related to these biological communities.
Implementation: C/OS 5.3 Special-Status Species and C/OS 5.4 Sensitive Natural
Communities
         The City shall protect sensitive biological resources and habitat corridors through
         environmental review of development applications in compliance with CEQA provisions,
         participation in comprehensive habitat management programs with other local and
         resource agencies, and continued management of open space lands that provide for
         protection of important natural habitats and sensitive natural communities. Protect
         wetlands and waters of the United States in accordance with the regulations of the U.S.
         Army Corps of Engineers and other appropriate agencies.

URBAN RESOURCES
GOAL 3:             Protect heritage trees and human-made elements of the urban environment which
                    reflect the City's history and contribute to the quality of life.
Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010   VI-26                               Resolution No. 134-2010
Amended by the City Council on April 18, 2011                                         Resolution No. 42 (2011)

                                                                  Conservation and Open Space Element
GOAL 4:             Expand the aesthetic and functional contributions made to the urban environment
                    by public open spaces, trail systems, scenic roadways, and street trees and
                    plantings.
POLICIES:
6.       HERITAGE TREES
C/OS 6.1:           Tree Preservation. Preserve heritage trees in accordance with the City's Heritage
                    Tree Ordinance.
C/OS 6.2:           Replacement Planting. Require significant replacement planting when the
                    removal of heritage trees is permitted.
Preservation of heritage trees is a major concern in San Mateo; Policy 6.1 directs that these trees
be preserved according to the regulations adopted as part of the City's Heritage Tree Ordinance.
The ordinance requires review and approval of pruning and/or removal of heritage trees by the
Director of Parks and Recreation or designee. Factors such as tree condition (disease, threat to
public health, safety, and welfare), topography, reasonable economic enjoyment of the property,
and impacts on soil erosion and on the number of trees in the neighborhood are evaluated in the
determination made by the Director of Parks and Recreation or designee. Policy 6.2 directs that
when heritage trees must be removed, significant replacement trees, of a species and a size as to
have an optimum opportunity for survival, must be planted; the determination of size and species
will be made by the Director of Parks and Recreation or designee.
C/OS 6.3:           New Development Requirements. Require the protection of heritage trees
                    during construction activity; require that landscaping, buildings, and other
                    improvements located adjacent to heritage trees be designed and maintained to be
                    consistent with the continued health of the tree.
C/OS 6.4:           Tree and Stand Retention. Retain the maximum feasible number of trees and
                    preserve the character of stands or groves of trees in the design of new or
                    modified projects.
Even trees scheduled to remain on site may be damaged during construction or later through the
maintenance of other landscaping. Policy 6.3 directs that plans demonstrate both the
protection of trees during construction and the siting of structures and the selection of landscape
materials so as to not adversely affect remaining heritage trees. Policy 6.4 similarly directs that
designs for new development preserve stands of trees.
C/OS 6.5:           Public Awareness. Pursue public awareness/education programs concerning the
                    identification, care, and regulation of heritage trees.
All efforts at protecting heritage trees will be aided by increased public knowledge as directed by
Policy 6.5.
Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010  VI-27                           Resolution No. 134-2010
Amended by the City Council on April 18, 2011                                     Resolution No. 42 (2011)
                                                                    Conservation and Open Space Element
C/OS 6.6:           New Development Street Trees. Require street tree planting as a condition of all
                    new developments in accordance with the adopted Street Tree Master Plan, El
                    Camino Real Master Plan, or Hillsdale Station Area Plan, as applicable.
C/OS 6.7:           Street Tree Planting. Encourage the planting of new street trees throughout the
                    City and especially in gateway areas such as Third Avenue, Fourth Avenue, El
                    Camino Real (SR 82), Hillsdale Boulevard, and 42nd Avenue; encourage
                    neighborhood participation in tree planting programs; explore non-City funded
                    tree planting programs.
C/OS 6.8:           Street Tree Preservation. Preserve existing street trees; ensure adequate siting,
                    selection, and regular maintenance of City trees, including neighborhood
                    participation, for the purpose of keeping the trees in a safe and aesthetic
                    condition.
San Mateo is a "Tree City". In order to enhance the visual quality and enjoyment of City streets,
policies 6.6, 6.7, and 6.8 direct efforts at a more coordinated and comprehensive street planting
plan. Creative private and joint-venture planting programs should be considered. Strong
neighborhood commitment to keeping trees in good condition and discouraging illegal removal
is needed for an expanded program to work.
7.       ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESOURCES
C/OS 7.1:           Resource Protection. Preserve, to the maximum extent feasible, archaeological
                    sites with significant cultural, historical, or sociological merit.
Known and potential sites of archaeological resources have been identified in the 1983 Chavez
investigation. The critical time for protection of these sites is prior to the construction process.
In order to assist property owners, developers, and the City make an appropriate decision when
archaeological resources may be affected, specific procedures for investigation of high and
medium sensitivity sites must be established. All determinations of level of sensitivity are to be
based on the 1983 Chavez investigation unless superseded by future investigation. An additional
source of the degree of significance along with the type of research needed is the California
Archaeological Inventory Northwest Information Center. By agreement with the State of
California Office of Historic Preservation, the Center is the official repository of archaeological
site information for San Mateo County. The Inventory conducts project-specific reviews which
evaluate the potential for impact on archaeological resources and determines whether or not
further study is warranted.
8.       HISTORICAL RESOURCES
C/OS 8.1:           Historic Preservation. Preserve, where feasible, historic buildings as follows:
Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010   VI-28                             Resolution No. 134-2010
Amended by the City Council on April 18, 2011                                        Resolution No. 42 (2011)
                                                                  Conservation and Open Space Element
                    a.       Prohibit the demolition of historic buildings until a building permit is
                             authorized subject to approval of a planning application.
                    b.       Require the applicant to submit alternatives on how to preserve the
                             historic building as part of any planning application and implement
                             methods of preservation unless health and safety requirements cannot be
                             met.
                    c.       Require that all exterior renovations of historic buildings conform to the
                             Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for
                             Rehabilitating Historic Structures.
                    d.       Historic building shall mean buildings which are on or individually
                             eligible for the National Register of Historic Places, California Register of
                             Historical Resources, or Downtown Historic District contributor buildings
                             as designated in the 1989 Historic Building Survey Report, or as
                             determined to be eligible through documentation contained in a historic
                             resources report.
Policy C/OS 8.1 confirms the City’s commitment that the protection, enhancement, perpetuation,
and use of historic structures are of economic, cultural, and aesthetic benefit to the City of San
Mateo. In addition, the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires public agencies
to consider the effects of actions on historic resources. Under CEQA, a historic resource is any
resource that is listed in or determined to be eligible for listing in the California Register of
Historical Resources. Any resource that is eligible for listing in the California Register of
Historical Resources is considered significant for the purposes of CEQA. The California Register
of Historical Resources also includes resources listed in or eligible for listing in the National
Register of Historic Places. Properties that are designated significant in an adopted local survey
are also presumed to be eligible for the California Register, and are considered significant.
C/OS 8.2:           Historic Districts. Consider the protection of concentrations of buildings which
                    convey the flavor of local historical periods or provide an atmosphere of
                    exceptional architectural interest or integrity, after additional study.
The City currently has two identified historic districts, the Downtown Historic District and the
Glazenwood Historic District. The Downtown area is of particular importance and interest with
respect to historic structures. Overall, the Downtown maintains a 1930's character. The
residential neighborhood of Glazenwood has remained a striking early 1920's development of
Spanish Colonial Revival homes. Other areas of the City may contain buildings of exceptional
architectural interest or capture the flavor of local historical periods. In consideration of future
historic districts, specific regulations to maintain historic character shall be developed. To
preserve the integrity of the City’s historic resources, the Zoning Administrator may require a
historic report and a planning application for modifications and alterations to individually
Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010   VI-29                             Resolution No. 134-2010
Amended by the City Council on April 18, 2011                                        Resolution No. 42 (2011)

                                                                  Conservation and Open Space Element
eligible or contributor buildings, and buildings that may be eligible for listing as historic
resources.
C/OS 8.3:           Structure Rehabilitation. Promote the rehabilitation of historic structures;
                    consider alternative building codes and give historic structures priority status for
                    available rehabilitation funds. (Note: Related Safety Policy S 1.5.)
Historic buildings generally warrant special consideration when structural alterations are planned
(or required, as in the case of unreinforced masonry buildings) or the site is planned for
redevelopment. Policy 8.3 directs that alternative codes that have been developed by the State of
California and the International Conference of Building Officials be considered for application
with designated structures. Policy 8.3 also requires that such buildings be given a priority for
City rehabilitation loans or grants.
C/OS 8.4:           Inventory Maintenance. Establish and maintain an inventory of architecturally,
                    culturally, and historically significant structures and sites.
C/OS 8.5:           Public Awareness. Foster public awareness and appreciation of the City's
                    historic, architectural, and archaeological resources.
The 1989 Historic Building Survey is the first and critical step in establishing and maintaining a
record of the City's remaining historic resources. The Survey inventory provides a reliable
source of documentation for City staff and the public when creating a preservation ordinance,
reviewing development proposals in historically sensitive areas, and educating the community
about its history. Without maintenance, the inventory becomes unreliable and unusable. Other
direct measures of public awareness are available to the City particularly through the County
Historical Association and interested groups of residents and business persons. An awareness
among residents that preservation is important and possible is necessary for the City to maintain
its special identity and its continuity with the past.
9.       SCENIC ROADWAYS AND BICYCLE/PEDESTRIAN TRAILS
C/OS 9.1:           Development Requirements. Require new developments to protect and enhance
                    the character of scenic roadways and trails designated on Figure C/OS-4,
                    including but not limited to treatment of signs and screening, land uses, and
                    preservation of view corridors.
New development or redevelopment on parcels adjacent to scenic roadways or trails is an
opportunity for design which protects the existing scenic qualities of the roadway or improves on
those qualities. Policy 9.1 directs that developments avoid or mitigate adverse visual impacts
which might be created particularly by grading, signage, and heights above the ridgeline.
Implementation: C/OS 9.1 Development Requirements
Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010   VI-30                            Resolution No. 134-2010
Amended by the City Council on April 18, 2011                                      Resolution No. 42 (2011)
                                                                Conservation and Open Space Element
         This policy is implemented on a project-by-project basis as individual planning
         applications are reviewed by the City.
         Lead: Planning Division.
         (Ongoing)
C/OS 9.2:           Enhancement of Gateways. Enhance all City gateways. In particular, create a
                    gateway statement at Third Avenue/US 101, J. Hart Clinton Drive at the Foster
                    City city limit, El Camino Real (SR 82) at Peninsula Avenue and 42nd Avenue,
                    SR 92 at El Camino Real (SR 82), and Hillsdale Boulevard. (Note: Related Urban
                    Design Policy UD-1.3.)
Major entrances to San Mateo create an image of the City. Policy 9.2 directs that positive
gateway statements be created to foster a positive image of the City. Gateways may be
constructed in a variety of ways: a prominent landscape or architectural feature, a notable open
area or possibly an arch to pass through. All gateways should have some common element or
feature to give San Mateo a unique and consistent image. Gateway features should include
landscaping and signage and would apply to public and private projects.
Implementation: C/OS 9.2 Enhancement of Gateways
         Gateway features have been constructed at Third Avenue and Humboldt Street and along
         J. Hart Clinton Drive as part of the Shoreline Park Master Plan. As funds become
         available, or through private development at entrances to the City, gateway features shall
         be designed and constructed to promote a positive City image.

C/OS 9.3:           Crystal Springs Road Access. Pursue safe pedestrian/bicycle access to
                    San Francisco Water District lands via Crystal Springs Road through coordination
                    with the Town of Hillsborough and with State and County assistance.
Crystal Springs Road represents a significant link between San Mateo and the watershed trails.
Policy 9.3 directs the City to pursue cooperative methods of creating a safe, attractive trail. The
Circulation Element contains policies for bicycle and pedestrian mobility, safety and
connectivity, and the development of pedestrian and bicycle master plans. These plans will
provide strategies for improving recreational and transit related use of bicycle and pedestrian
connections, as well as addressing safety issues.
C/OS 9.4:           Interjurisdiction Coordination.         Support the coordination of adjacent
                    jurisdictions in the development of bicycle and pedestrian trails, the connection of
                    trails in San Francisco watershed lands, the development of Bay Trail and Ridge
                    Trail systems, and potential connections into the City of Belmont in the
                    development of a trail system with Sugarloaf Mountain.
Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010 VI-31                            Resolution No. 134-2010

All of the major trails in the San Mateo area require cooperation of several jurisdictions. Policy
9.4 affirms the City's support for trail development. The City will seek the cooperation of other
jurisdictions in the development of future bicycle and pedestrian master plans.
Implementation: C/OS 9.3 Crystal Springs Road Access, C/OS 9.4 Interjurisdiction
Coordination
         The City’s Public Works Commission is the Bicycle Advisory Committee for the City of
         San Mateo. One of the duties of the Committee is to make recommendations to the City
         Council in the development of comprehensive bicycle and pedestrian circulation
         networks that provide safe recreation opportunities as well as alternatives to automobile
         travel. Cooperation with other jurisdictions in the development of bicycle and pedestrian
         trails occurs on a regular basis as funds become available for trail design and
         construction.

10.      URBAN OPEN SPACES
C/OS 10.1:          Public Open Space Design. Review planning applications for opportunities to
                    promote exceptional design and use of public open spaces in new developments
                    and new public buildings. (Note: Related Urban Design policies UD-2.9, 2.10.)
Streetside, public open spaces are an important element in the urban environment both
functionally and aesthetically. New developments should consider location, amenities, exposure,
visual interest, and landscaping in the design of public open space areas
Implementation: C/OS 10.1 Public Open Space Design Criteria
         Both the Planning Division and Parks and Recreation Department review project plans
         for new development in the City. The plan check process entails review of open space
         areas, landscaping, and amenities pertaining to a development’s visual and useable public
         open space areas. In addition, the Zoning Code contains standards for public open space
         in the Central Business District and Central Business District Support District for larger
         developments. Specific plans developed for various areas of the City contain provisions
         for public open space areas and/or amenities.

12.      MAXIMIZING PARKS AND OPEN SPACE
C/OS 12.1:          Balanced Park System. Provide the appropriate mix of parkland that balances
                    the needs of active and passive facilities, formal and informal uses and that are
                    accessible for all residents, and meet existing and future recreation needs.
As new development or redevelopment of existing parkland occurs, it is important to insure that
design considerations achieve a balance between formal, active and organized use areas and less
formal, passive and drop-in areas.
C/OS 12.2:          Facility Standards. Adopt and use the Park and Recreation Facility Standards to
                    assess the adequacy of existing facilities, designing, developing and redeveloping
                    sites, and acquiring or accepting new sites.

Standards are established to provide a guide for the types of facilities that a community ought to
have. Specific standards for San Mateo directed by Policy 12.2 have been developed that are
based upon general norms and the unique needs of San Mateo.
(Standards Section following Policies.)
Implementation: C/OS 12.2 Facility Standards
            These standards were adopted as part of the Parks and Recreation Element of the
            General Plan and will be used in developing priorities for the long term capital
            improvement.
            Lead: Parks and Recreation Department (Ongoing)
C/OS 12.3:          Maximizing Park Assets: Create an asset management plan that identifies the
                    highest and best use of undeveloped parcels or underutilized areas within existing
                    parks to insure they are best positioned to meet current and future needs and
                    where appropriate, consider options for alternate non-park uses. Ensure that
                    appropriate value or credit is restored to the park system for loss of land.
Undeveloped parcels and under-utilized areas within existing parks need to be evaluated to
insure they can provide the highest and most appropriate value.
C/OS 12.4:          Parks as Learning Environments: Enhance the role of parks as learning
                    environments by providing interpretive opportunities to increase public awareness
                    of their unique cultural, historical and environmental characteristics.
Park settings provide a unique opportunity to educate the community on a variety of special
interest topics that highlight the diversity and uniqueness of San Mateo’s past heritage as well as
the surrounding ecological environment.
Implementation: C/OS 12.4 Parks as Learning Environments
             In partnership with community organizations, such as the San Mateo County Historical
             Society, Coyote Point Museum, etc. develop interpretive signage, brochures and other
             collateral material that facilitates public education of our park system.
             Lead: Parks and Recreation Department.
             (Ongoing)
C/OS 12.5:          Compatible Public Use. Provide for public access, study, and recreation
                    opportunities at the Shoreline, Sugarloaf Mountain, San Mateo and Laurel creeks
                    that are compatible with their setting and natural attributes; ensure that significant
                    natural qualities and habitat are protected.
Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010   VI-36                            Resolution No. 134-2010
Amended by the City Council on April 18, 2011                                      Resolution No. 42 (2011)

                                                                 Conservation and Open Space Element
Natural and habitat areas are limited in San Mateo; what exists should be protected. Policy 12.5
directs that compatible recreational uses be incorporated where possible and used to enrich our
understanding and appreciation of the environment.
Implementation: C/OS 12.5 Compatible Public Use
            The master plan for Sugarloaf Mountain will consider public use opportunities. The
            Shoreline Parks Master Plan includes public access with pedestrian and bicycle trails,
            and identifies wetlands areas to be enhanced thereby providing future educational
            opportunities. The Gateway Park project incorporates public access and recreational
            opportunities along San Mateo Creek. Construction of these facilities will incorporate
            master plan amenities, while preserving natural attributes, qualities, and habitats.
            Lead: Parks and Recreation Department.
            (Ongoing)
C/OS 12.6:          Resident Access. Provide use and reservation policies that give priority to
                    residents of San Mateo; in particular, ensure that regional usage of Sugarloaf and
                    Shoreline does not diminish resident opportunities to use these facilities.
Many City park and recreational facilities are regionally popular. Policy 12.6 directs that San
Mateo residents receive ample, priority opportunities to use such areas.
C/OS 12.7:          Park Preservation. Preserve existing parklands, open spaces and the golf course
                    for open space and recreational use as directed by ordinance.
Existing parkland has been found to be inadequate to meet community needs, and protection of
what is available is of significant importance. City ordinance allows for the dedication of
parkland that is four acres or more such that a majority vote of the electorate is required to
convert the parkland to a different use.
13.      PARK MAINTENANCE AND INFRASTRUCTURE MANAGEMENT
C/OS 13.1:          Maintenance Standards. Maintain the park system by a set of maintenance
                    standards that reflect community values and in a manner that maintains, promotes,
                    and optimizes positive use, and prevents degradation of facilities and ensures that
                    particular equipment and facilities are maintained in a safe condition.
Poorly maintained facilities and uncorrected vandalism encourage further degradation and inhibit
positive uses; prompt action directed by Policy 13.1 helps to stem further destruction.
C/OS 13.2:          Rehabilitation Priorities. Give priority to Capital Improvement Program
                    projects that rehabilitate facilities that have become or will become costly to
                    maintain, only marginally usable, or located in neighborhoods that are in the
                    greatest need of quality of life improvements.
Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010   VI-37                           Resolution No. 134-2010
Amended by the City Council on April 18, 2011                                     Resolution No. 42 (2011)
                                                                Conservation and Open Space Element
C/OS 13.3:          Site Modification. When existing parks undergo reconstruction or rehabilitation
                    the site facilities and layout must be reviewed to determine if they effectively
                    meet community needs, and whether modification would provide significant
                    benefits in relation to costs.
The need to rehabilitate existing, aging infrastructure is critical, particularly in a relatively
mature park system. Policy 13.3 directs that at the time of any major rehabilitation, an
examination be conducted of how appropriate and effective the existing facilities and layout are,
and whether new needs have evolved that should be addressed.
C/OS 13.4:          Lifecycle Management: Utilize an infrastructure lifecycle management program
                    that extends the useful life of all park and recreation assets and insures that
                    sufficient funds are available for replacement or major rehabilitation.
Once in place, an infrastructure lifecycle management program will allow park and recreation
assets to be managed over a long-term basis and can help establish priorities when developing
the department’s Capital Improvement Program.
Implementation: C/OS 13.1 Maintenance Standards, C/OS 13.2 Rehabilitation Priorities,
C/OS 13.3 Site Modification, and C/OS 13.4 Lifecycle Management
            Maintenance standards have been developed and their use will be further supported with
            the implementation of computerized maintenance management software.
            Priority within the long term Capital Improvement Program has been given to
            renovation and rehabilitation projects which upgrade children's playgrounds and
            enhance their safety and accessibility. These policies will be used during the Capital
            Improvement Program budget preparation process and the master plan process for
            future park renovation projects.
            Lead: Parks and Recreation Department.
           (Ongoing)
C/OS 13.5:          Community Partnerships. Promote City and community partnerships for clean-
                    up and development assistance at park sites and landscaped areas.
Neighborhood involvement increases pride and sense of ownership of facilities which can
supplement City resources; Policy 13.5 directs City promotion of such involvement.
Implementation: C/OS 13.5 Community Partnerships
            The park system has benefited greatly from a variety of neighborhood and community
            partnerships that have lead to improvements at Bay Tree Park, Rotary Picnic Grove in
            Central Park and island beautification projects in the San Mateo Park neighborhood. As
Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010    VI-38                         Resolution No. 134-2010
Amended by the City Council on April 18, 2011                                    Resolution No. 42 (2011)

            fiscal resources become more constrained, the City will increase its efforts to seek
            neighborhood support for enhancement and beautification projects.
            Lead: Parks and Recreation Department (Ongoing)
C/OS 13.6:          Sustainability Practices. Establish management and operating practices that are
                    environmentally, socially and economically sustainable.
Policy 13.6 responds to the community’s expectation that more pro-active efforts need to be
implemented to reduce the dependency on consumable resources such as water and energy and to
encourage the expansion of recycling and waste reduction practices in park facilities.
Implementation 13.6: Sustainability Practices
            Utilize native and drought tolerant plant species to the greatest extent possible where
            compatible with use and aesthetic considerations; employ efficient irrigation systems,
            including the use of reclaimed water where technically and economically feasible and
            expand the use of environmentally sustainable maintenance practices such as the City
            of San Mateo’s adopted Integrated Pest Management policy. Expand efforts to improve
            recycling opportunities in all parks and implement trash reduction measures, especially
            during large community events.
            Lead: Parks and Recreation Department.
            (Ongoing)
14.      CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS
C/OS 14.1:          Acreage Standards. Acquire or accept for dedication parkland acreage in
                    accordance with the Park and Recreation Facility Standards.
C/OS 14.2:          Acquisition. Consider the location of potential parkland in determining whether
                    to acquire or accept a particular site. Consider locations which are centrally
                    located, easily accessible, adjacent to existing park sites or located in
                    neighborhoods that are in greatest need of quality of life improvements.
C/OS 14.3:          Active Use Facilities: Provide sufficient active use facilities to support current
                    needs and future trends including at least three new multi-use athletic turf areas;
                    an evaluation of existing turf fields for possible conversion to synthetic turf; a
                    tennis complex that optimizes revenue generation; and a system of pedestrian and
                    bike trails that will provide interconnectivity between parks.
C/OS 14.4:          Community Recreation. Implement a vision for community recreation spaces
                    that include the development of a multi-use leisure lifestyle center, including a
                    year-round aquatics facility and the reconfiguration of existing recreation
                    facilities to better support the stated Service Outcomes.
Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010    VI-39                           Resolution No. 134-2010

C/OS 14.5:          Central Park. Enhance Central Park’s character as the city’s signature park and
                    community gathering pace.
Central Park’s unique character and it’s proximity to downtown necessitate that future
improvements preserve it’s historical nature, improve its visual image and sense of open space,
enhance it’s value in support of downtown vitality and extend it’s utilization as a venue for
community special events.
C/OS 14.6:          Regional Facilities. Explore the feasibility of developing regional recreational
                    and sports complexes with neighboring cities.
A comparison of available facilities and reasonable community standards uncovers a number of
deficits which are identified in Policies 14.2, 14.3, and 14.4. In attempting to address those
deficits, it must be recognized that available open space with park and recreation potential is very
limited. Creative ways of meeting our unmet needs such as partnering with neighboring cities to
provide regional sports complexes will need to be employed. When acquisition opportunities do
become available, it will be critical to ensure that the properties meet the acreage standard as
directed by Policy 14.1. (Standards Section following Policies)
Implementation: C/OS 14.2 Acquisition, 14.3 Active Use Facilities, C/OS 14.4 Community
Recreation Facilities, C/OS 14.5 Central Park, and C/OS 14.6 Regional Facilities
            With the exception of new development at Shoreline Park, all recent efforts have been
            directed towards improving existing infrastructure. The master planning for the 12 acre
            community park at Bay Meadows will lead to the creation of new parks and recreation
            facilities that may address one or more of the identified deficiencies.
            The series of images created through the Central Park design charrette process should
            continue to serve as guiding principles when re-master planning the park and
            prioritizing future capital improvements.
            Lead: Parks and Recreation Department
            (Ongoing)
C/OS 14.7:          Area Studies and Specific Plans. Include direction in Area Studies and Specific
                    Plans, prepared for new development or redevelopment of portions of the City,
                    that adverse impacts on existing park sites and recreation services will be avoided
                    or mitigated.
Policy 14.7 intends that in-progress and future planning efforts for specific portions of the City
take a comprehensive view of impacts on recreation facilities and services resulting from
increased worker or resident population pursuant to the plans and that the plans provide for the
prevention or mitigation of such impacts.
Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010 VI-40                            Resolution No. 134-2010

Implementation: C/OS 14.7 Area Studies and Specific Plans
            The Downtown, Bay Meadows, Hillsdale Station Area, Rail Corridor, Sugarloaf,
            Mariner’s Island, and Shoreline Specific plans include policies both calling for the
            provision of adequate open space in new developments and protection of existing open
            space areas, such as Central Park. Individual projects and area-wide master or specific
            plans are reviewed on a case-by-case basis as to impacts on recreation facilities and
            services.
            Lead: Planning Division, Parks and Recreation Department.
            (Ongoing)
C/OS 14.8:          Master Planning. Adopt a master plan for all undeveloped parks and for those
                    parks over 2 acres in size prior to development or major redevelopment. Consult
                    with residents and users prior to initiating improvements that impact major use
                    areas, i.e. playgrounds, ballfields; interim uses may be conducted if such uses will
                    not adversely impact or limit potential permanent uses.
Prior to permanent redevelopment of parklands over 2 acres in size and the development of new
parks, a master plan incorporating community input should be developed and adopted to
maximize the value of the improvements and ensure that they meet community needs. On
smaller parks less than 2 acres, the key to providing needed services for the immediate
community is to interact with the neighbors surrounding the parks, rather than prepare a full park
master plan.
Implementation: C/OS 14.8 Master Planning
            Resident input will be solicited for all park improvements in accordance with this
            policy.

C/OS 14.9:          Design Principles. Establish design principles for all new or renovated parks to
                    maximize productivity, efficiency and community value.
Establishing design principles that reflect the interests of stakeholders and the financial capacity
of the organization will result in more efficiently designed projects and reduced long-term
maintenance costs.
C/OS 14.10: Park Image. When master planning or significantly redeveloping existing
                    facilities, develop an image plan that includes the effective use of signage, color
                    schemes, lighting and plant material which meets both aesthetic and maintenance
                    needs.
Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010  VI-41                           Resolution No. 134-2010
Amended by the City Council on April 18, 2011                                     Resolution No. 42 (2011)

Providing consistent signs, lighting, plant material and other visual amenities within facilities
improves the visitor experience, provides higher public recognition value and may ultimately
lessen vandalism incidents.
15.      SCHOOL FACILITIES AS RECREATION RESOURCES
C/OS 15.1:          Shared Use. Encourage schools to make their facilities available for City and
                    community-sponsored activities to the greatest extent possible.
C/OS 15.2:          Cooperative Agreements. Where possible, enter into joint use agreements or
                    any other appropriate agreements that will encourage the schools to provide
                    reasonable access and fees for use of school facilities by community
                    organizations.
C/OS 15.3:          Rehabilitation or Purchase of School Sites. Consider contributions towards
                    rehabilitation or the purchase of surplus school sites based upon an evaluation of
                    their value as community recreation resources and consistency with policies 14.1
                    through 14.5. (Note: Related Land Use Policy LU-4.15.)
School facilities are heavily relied-upon to meet community recreation needs; however, their
maximum community benefits are not being realized. Schools provide perhaps the best
opportunities to address deficits in facilities and a multi-faceted strategy for increasing their use
and maintaining their usability should be employed. Policies 15.1 - 15.3 direct methods of
making use of these opportunities.
16.      REVENUE AND RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT
C/OS 16.1:          Program Fees and Cost Recovery. Establish and maintain program fees
                    consistent with the City Council adopted Cost Recovery and Pricing Policy.
C/OS 16.2:          Recreation Fee Assistance. Provide program fee assistance to qualifying low
                    income families consistent with the Park and Recreation Commission endorsed
                    administrative policy for fee assistance.
C/OS 16.3:          Accessible Facilities. Continue to provide general park facilities that are free and
                    open to the public, except for reservations of specific facilities by groups or
                    individuals, or for facilities that traditionally charge fees (e.g., Golf Course,
                    Marina Lagoon).
The Cost Recovery and Pricing Policy noted in Policy 16.1 provides a balance between service
values and cost recovery expectations, providing lower cost recovery expectations for core and
youth services, and higher cost recovery expectations for adult and specialty activities. Access
for All is a core principle of the Parks and Recreation Department mission, and Policy 16.2
addresses access for those with financial barriers to participation. In addition, informal use of

park facilities should continue to be free to the public as directed by Policy 16.3.
C/OS 16.4:          Maintenance and Operating Costs. Consider long-term maintenance and
                    operating costs in acquisition, development, and redevelopment decisions.
Consideration of installation costs is only part of the Capital Improvements decision process. In
some cases, high future maintenance costs may diminish the desirability of certain
improvements. In others, particularly rehabilitation of infrastructure, a particular capital
expenditure may be very cost effective by reducing costly continued repairs or inefficient
maintenance processes.
Implementation: C/OS 16.4 Maintenance and Operating Costs
            Require that maintenance and operating costs be included within the development of a
            park master plan or major facility upgrade and evaluated prior to the recommendation
            for contract award for any major park or facility rehabilitation or improvement project.
            Lead: Parks and Recreation Department
            (Ongoing)
C/OS 16.5:          Development Fees. Assess appropriate fees and taxes to ensure that new
                    development contributes adequate funding to compensate for its impacts on
                    recreation facilities and services.
The citizens of San Mateo have contributed significant tax dollars to provide their park system.
New developments increase the demands upon these facilities and the need for additional
services. Policy 16.5 directs that appropriate development fees be assessed to ensure that new
populations contribute to and maintain the service level of this system.
C/OS 16.6:          Cooperative Service Delivery. Utilize opportunities for cooperative acquisition,
                    development, operation, and programming with private organizations or other
                    public agencies that will provide more effective or efficient service delivery.
The City is continuously seeking to establish partnerships for the provision of services and
programs. Recent examples include the San Mateo Marlins for the provision of masters
swimming; Mills Peninsula Health Services as a partner for promoting fitness and healthy
lifestyles; and partnering with the Police Department to provide programs and activities through
the Police Activities League.
C/OS 16.7:          Non-Profit Community Support Organization. Encourage the establishment of
                    a non-profit community support organization, e.g. Parks and Recreation
                    Foundation that will expand non-city resource opportunities, i.e. money and
                    volunteers.
Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010   VI-43                           Resolution No. 134-2010
Amended by the City Council on April 18, 2011                                      Resolution No. 42 (2011)

Non-profit community support organizations have been successful in raising public awareness on
behalf of park and recreation programs and services as well as lead successful campaigns to
increase both volunteers and support dollars.
Implementation: C/OS 16.7 Non-Profit Community Support Organization
            The City’s role is to support and encourage the creation of a non-profit community
            support organization by providing the proper framework for establishing goals,
            objectives and priorities in order to insure its success.
            Lead: Parks and Recreation Department
            (Ongoing)
C/OS 16.8:          Redevelopment Areas. Utilize Redevelopment Agency funding for parkland
                    capital improvements that promote the goals of the redevelopment areas, as
                    appropriate in relation to other priorities and the availability of funds within the
                    redevelopment area.
Park facilities are among the public improvements that may contribute to the goals of a
Redevelopment Area. The implementation of the initial phases of the Shoreline Parks Master
Plan was funded through Redevelopment Agency funding and grants. Central Park has also
received such funding. Policy 16.8 directs continued consideration of park capital improvements
located within the Redevelopment Area for such funds.
Implementation: C/OS 16.8 Redevelopment Areas.
            Implementation of the remaining portions of the Shoreline Parks Master Plan.

17.      COMMUNITY ADVOCACY AND AWARENESS
C/OS 17.1:          Public Information. Communicate the benefits and value park and recreation
                    services bring in making San Mateo a more livable, economically viable, and
                    socially responsible community. Maximize publicity in programs and services
                    that promote public knowledge of the services available.
C/OS 17.2:          Customer Service. Adopt policies and practices that create satisfied customers
                    and develop life-long relationships with our users.
C/OS 17.3:          Strategic Community Partnerships. Develop and maintain positive partnership
                    relations with schools, businesses, community groups and civic organizations in
                    order to maximize resources, eliminate duplication of effort and reach common
                    goals.

The value and benefits derived from park and recreation programs and facilities are apparent to
users but may not be as obvious to the general public. The goals contained within C/OS 17.1
Public Information, C/OS 17.2 Customer Service and C/OS 17.3 Strategic Community
Partnerships attempt to enhance the value of parks and recreation as an essential community
service and highlight its role in maintaining the quality of life in the community by taking a
customer driven, outcome oriented and collaborative approach to service delivery.
PARK AND RECREATION FACILITY STANDARDS
A.       Facility Classifications
Mini-Parks: These are the smallest of the City’s neighborhood parks. They are generally
limited in facilities to essentially a single use. Any park that is less than one acre is categorized
as a mini-park. The general service radius of such parks is 1/4 mile.
Neighborhood Parks: These parks are generally less than five acres in size and frequented by
neighboring patrons. There may be some City-wide usage that takes place at neighborhood
parks; however, the main focus is to serve nearby residents. Neighborhood parks generally serve
multiple uses. The optimum neighborhood park should be at least four acres in size and include
a multi-purpose turf area, a children's play area that includes pre-school and youth apparatus,
seating areas, preferably including picnic tables, the opportunity for passive enjoyment of a
landscaped space, and a multi-use court. The general service radius of a neighborhood park is 1/3
mile, aside from any usage on a City-wide basis.
Community Parks: These are major, multi-use facilities that focus on providing for City-wide
needs. Community parks also serve neighborhood needs and should include all of the desirable
elements of a neighborhood park. Their primary function, however, is to accommodate City-
wide needs and serve a much broader patronage. Uses that might be found in a community park
include athletic game facilities, community centers, large group picnic areas, swimming pools;
large children's play areas, outdoor performing facilities, and tennis or other game court areas.
Community parks are generally greater than five acres in size, though small facilities that include
a major City-wide function, or multiple City-wide facilities, may be included. Sizes of
community parks may vary widely, from approximately 5 acres to 25+ acres. The service radius
of a community park ranges from one mile to the entire City. Some regional use may also take
place in the community parks.
Regional Parks: These are major facilities that provide for City-wide community needs, and
also draw significant patronage from non-resident users.
Open Space: The park areas described in the four preceding definitions are generally
characterized by usable space. Though some undeveloped or inaccessible areas may exist in
them, they are generally highly developed urban parks with mostly usable space.
Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010 VI-45                          Resolution No. 134-2010
Amended by the City Council on April 18, 2011                                  Resolution No. 42 (2011)

                                                              Conservation and Open Space Element
Open Space areas, on the other hand, are parklands whose scenic, environmental, and open space
values predominate. These are areas that are generally left in a natural state without facilities for
intensive urban recreational activities. Where public access is provided, activity is compatible
with the natural state of the area, and significant areas may be inaccessible due to terrain or
environmental sensitivity.
B.       Facility and Acreage Standards
1.       Citywide Acreage Standards: Government Code Section 66477 (Quimby Act) establishes
         specific standards for determining the proportion of a subdivision to be dedicated, or fees
         paid in lieu of dedication, for “community or neighborhood” park or recreational
         purposes. The standards pertain to the population of the City (based on the latest census
         data) and the amount of existing neighborhood and community recreation facilities. The
         standards allow a minimum of 3 acres per 1,000 population for dedication/in-lieu fee
         purposes. A higher standard is also allowable up to a maximum of 5 acres per 1,000
         population as long as it does not exceed the City’s inventory of “community or
         neighborhood” parkland. The City requires 2 acres per 1000 population from residential
         development projects. Although this is lower than our current inventory, the City’s
         concern regarding the impact on the cost of housing has limited this requirement from
         increasing. As of 2009 (based on a population of 95,500), the ratio of existing
         neighborhood and community (including mini, regional and Coyote Point County Park)
         park and recreational facilities to population is 4.90 acres per 1,000 population. With a
         population projected at 119,800 if no additional neighborhood or community parklands
         are acquired, the City would have 3.88 acres per 1,000 persons by the year 2030.
    Facility and acreage goal:
                     Neighborhood                     1.50 acres/1,000 people
                     Community/Regional               4.5 acres/1,000 people
                     Total for Neighborhood and       6.0 acres/1,000 people
                     Community Purposes
2.       Well designed communities should provide accessible public park and recreational
         opportunities that are within reasonable walking distance (approximately 1/3 miles) of
         residents without travel over significant barriers (e.g., highways, railroad tracks, etc.).
         When characterizing accessibility, parks, schools, open spaces and landscaped spaces
         should all be considered. Ideally, one or more of the following amenities should be
         available: multi-purpose turf area, children's play area with pre-school and youth
         apparatus, seating areas, picnic areas, a multi-use court, and an opportunity for passive
         enjoyment of an aesthetic landscaped space.
3.       The optimal neighborhood park, discounting consideration of other nearby facilities
         (schools, private facilities, etc.) should be at least 4 acres in size, include those items

            Golf Courses                             Each          See Narrative Below
Athletic Fields: The 2004 Strategic Plan Needs Analysis by Younger and Pros determined the
market populations for the community sports that take place on 22 fields within our parks and
schools, most of which are multi-purpose fields. Based on the market populations, the analysis
determined a needs ratio of the number of field types to population (see above table) and
concluded that 3 unlighted or 2 lighted rectangular fields and 2 youth baseball fields were needed
over and above the current field inventory.
Using the same field to population needs ratio, it is determined that with a projected population
of 119,800 there will be a need for 12 to 14 fields over and above the City’s current inventory (4
lighted or 6 unlighted rectangular, 1 softball, 2 fast pitch softball, and 5 youth baseball fields,
with at least 1 and preferably 2 of the 3 additional softball and fast pitch softball fields lighted).
Tennis Courts: Based on a recently conducted tennis usage analysis there is a sufficient supply of
tennis courts in the City (including all city and school sites) that are available for play. Projecting
the current ratio of courts to population (1/2000) to 2030, an additional 13 courts would be
needed with at least 4 of the additional available for night play.
Community and Aquatic Centers: A study conducted in 2005 by Sports Management Group to
determine appropriate sizes, configurations and locations for community and aquatic centers
concluded that a total of 175,000 gross square feet of community center and aquatics space, in a
combination of multi-use and specialized-use spaces, would be needed to meet current and future
need. Gross square feet includes interior floor space and outdoor areas within the confines of the
facility & excludes parking lot and other external areas.
Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010 VI-47                           Resolution No. 134-2010
Amended by the City Council on April 18, 2011                                    Resolution No. 42 (2011)

                                                                   Conservation and Open Space Element
Reservable Group Picnic Facilities: Based on current supply (102 reservable picnic tables) and
demand for group picnic areas the current ratio of 1 table per 900 people should be maintained
into the future. An additional 31 reservable picnic tables will therefore be needed by 2030. It
should be noted that City policy requires that there be at least 25% of the total picnic tables with
each park to be non-reservable for drop-in use.
Golf Course: The Poplar Creek Municipal Golf course draws from a much greater area than the
City; however it adequately supplies the demand for public golf within the City.
5. Other Specialized Standards:
Community Gardens: When there is a need and interest from the public for community gardens,
it is an appropriate use of City public lands, however, the priority assigned community gardens is
lower than that of other Park and Recreation uses. Consequently, it is appropriate to use suitable
park areas for community gardens when not required for other park purposes.
Restrooms: Restrooms should be provided in all community parks and in neighborhood parks
with a children’s play area and where the facilities provided encourage usage by the public that is
long-term in nature. Examples of facilities that encourage long duration usage are athletic game
facilities and picnic areas that may be reserved.
Specialized Facilities: The use of City Park and Recreation lands to provide for special interests,
such as croquet, racquetball, bocce ball courts, mini-skate parks and dog parks, is appropriate
when sufficient community-wide interest is evident.
6. Acquisition and Dedication:
Generally, acquired or dedicated parkland should be a minimum of four acres in size, be
accessible, and have a demonstrated potential for meeting identified community recreation needs
and standards. A site of less than four acres may be acceptable if it meets one or more of the
following criteria:
                    a.       Adjacent sites are or may become available for purchase which would
                             increase the total size of the parkland.
                    b.       The site can be assimilated into an existing adjacent parkland.
                    c.       The site can accommodate demonstrated needs and the value of the site in
                             meeting these needs outweighs any maintenance requirements that will be
                             greater due to the limited size of the site.
                    d.       The site is environmentally or culturally sensitive or significant.

Chapter IV – Housing
A.      INTRODUCTION
The Housing Element serves to identify significant problems and resources associated
with the provision of housing in the City of San Mateo. It provides policy direction in
meeting the housing needs of the City, both in terms of preservation of existing
housing stock and in establishing priorities for new construction.
B.      SAN MATEO’S HOUSING OBJECTIVES

There should be a variety of housing types
and sizes, a mixture of rental and ownership housing, and a full range of housing
costs. This variety of housing opportunities will accommodate a diverse population,
leading to a variety of household sizes, all age groups and a wide range of income
levels.
Third, San Mateo will need to increase its housing supply to meet the housing demand
caused by future job growth.           The types of new housing created should
accommodate the income levels associated with new employment in the City.

Racial/Ethnic Composition
Increasing racial and ethnic integration has occurred since the 1960s, with the
percentage of minorities increasing from 6% in 1960, 17% in 1980, and 32% in 1990.
By 2000, the percentage had increased to almost 44%. In 2010, the percentage of
population identified as Hispanic or Latino increased to 26.6%, versus 20.5% in 2000.
In addition, Asians represented 18.9% of the population in 2010, whereas this figure

Although Whites still make up the majority of the population (about 58%), the
proportion of minorities is increasing, with Asians and Pacific Islanders together now
accounting for approximately 21% of the population.
Households
Significant changes have occurred in household composition during the past four
decades. Household size declined from 3.20 to 2.41 persons per household from
1960 to 1990. Census data from 2000 showed this figure rising to 2.48 persons per
household, whereas in 2010 the State Department of Finance shows this figure
increasing to 2.51. The 2010 Census shows that there are 38,233 households, an
increase of 2.3% since 2000.
Income
Typical incomes in San Mateo are higher than the rest of the Bay Area. In 1970 the
mean household income was $14,703. This nearly doubled to $30,108 in 1980, and
increased to $58,934 in 1995. According to the California Department of Community
Development, the median family income (MFI) for the San Mateo County Metropolitan
Statistical Area for 2013 is $103,000 for a family of four. This income figure is lower
than the Santa Clara median income of $105,500, but is the same as San Francisco’s.
Although San Mateo is considered an affluent community, the City has its share of low-
and moderate-income households. The State and federal governments define "lower-
income" households as those earning less than 80% of the countywide median
income level, and "moderate-income" as earning between 80% and 120% of the
county median. These definitions are used to determine eligibility for housing subsidies
and to measure the extent of housing affordability problems. The table below
illustrates the number of households in each income category.

The following table shows that the percentage of extremely low- and very-low income
households has increased nearly 24% since 2000, whereas the percentage of
households with low incomes and greater has declined. Although these are
significant changes, overall the representation of lower-income households within the
community as a whole has changed little since 2000.

Poverty Level
In 2010 the number of persons below the poverty level, as defined by the US Census
Bureau 1 made up 3.6% of the total population – a drop of about three percentage
points since 2006. Children appear to be disproportionately impacted by poverty; the
poverty rate for children under the age of 18 is 6.1%. Families with a female
householder are even more at risk; in 2010, 16.3% of those families were below the
poverty level. Nationally, poverty rate is 10.5% for all persons.
            1
              The US census established the poverty level by poverty thresholds, which are reviewed annually according to changes
in the cost of living. The average poverty threshold for a family of four persons was $22,314 in 2010, and is adjusted based on the
number of persons in a family. Poverty thresholds are applied on a national basis and are not adjusted for regional, state or local
variation in the cost of living.

Employment and Jobs per Employed Person Ratio
The level of employment in a community, and on a subregional level such as the San
Francisco Peninsula, has a significant effect on housing demand. Although many
factors affect the choice of housing location, it is desirable to have a balance between
the number of jobs and the number of employed residents, particularly on a
subregional level.
In 2000, ABAG reported that well
more than half of the jobs within
San Mateo and its sphere of
influence were in the health,                    Other                         Financial/ Prof.

In the City of San Mateo, the
jobs/employed person ratio in 2010
was nearly balanced, with an
employment level of 46,960 jobs and a labor force of employed residents, representing
1.03 jobs per employed resident, as indicated by ABAG. From this information, one
can infer that the jobs-housing ratio is relatively in balance.

D.        HOUSING SUPPLY AND NEEDS
HOUSING SUPPLY AND TYPE
The City of San Mateo's housing stock has been increasing, but at a declining rate since
the 1960s due to the lack of vacant land. During the period 1980 to 1990, the total
number of housing units in the City of San Mateo rose from 37,010 to 37,719,
representing only a 1.9% change. By 2000, the number of units had increased just
1.4% in ten years, to 38,249 units. The State Department of Finance estimates that the
housing stock has increased an additional 860 units (2007), to 39,109 units.

Source: CA Department of Finance, 2010                                 development has become
very limited, and redevelopment of sites for multi-family housing at higher densities has
increased. The trend towards multi-family housing also reflects the increasing need for
housing at all levels of affordability, as well as the high costs of single-family homes.
The proportion of single-family versus multi-family housing has decreased from 78% in
1960 to about 56% in 2010, according to DOF.
San Mateo changed from an owner-dominated housing market in the 1960s (two-
thirds owner occupied) to a renter-dominated market in the 1970s due to increases in
apartment construction. During the 1980s, condominium construction and the
conversion of apartments to condominiums reversed this trend, with the proportion of
homeowners and renters now at approximately 52% and 48%, respectively.
Vacancy rates provide a quantifiable measurement of housing supply and demand. A
vacancy rate of 5 or 6% is considered to reflect a well-balanced housing market, where
those seeking housing have adequate choices and building owners have sufficient
demand. Vacancy rates in San Mateo have increased since 2000 to 5.6% in 2010.
DOF estimates that vacancy rates in January 2013 at 4.5%.

HOUSING AFFORDABILITY
The cost of housing in the Bay Area has risen dramatically in the past years, making it
difficult for lower income people to find housing that is affordable to them. The
National Association of Homebuilders reports that California cities have the lowest
homeowner affordability rates in the country, defined as the percentage of homes
affordable to the median income family. Despite the high median incomes, especially
in the Bay Area, few can afford the cost to purchase a home. The San Francisco MSA,
of which San Mateo is a part, was the least affordable area nationally in the first quarter
of 2013, ranking 222nd of 222 MSAs studied. The following table illustrates these
rankings for selected MSAs in California. In this region, only 16.6% of homes are
affordable to families earning the median income. However, this is an improvement
over the last quarter of 2007, when only 7.9% of homes in the region were affordable

Ownership Housing
Since 1960, property values have risen astronomically, with median prices increasing
from $19,200 in 1960 to $344,300 in 1990 to almost $540,000 in 2000. Beginning in
2007, however, the City saw significant declines in housing prices, consistent with the
national mortgage crisis. This trend is just now beginning to reverse. The following
table illustrates the current status of the ownership market.

Note: Adjusted for inflation to 2013 dollars
The difference in the inflation of home values and household income levels has
resulted in a critical housing affordability gap in for sales housing. The affordability gap
is expected to continue as employment in the lower paying service sectors of the
economy becomes more dominant. The following table shows that only moderate-
income households of four persons would have enough income to afford the median-
priced condo. All other households will find a significant affordability gap.

  Rental Housing
  The high demand for housing has also affected the rental market over the last few
  years such that there is a growing affordability gap for rental housing as well.
  According to RealFacts, a data provider for housing statistics, for the quarter ending
  March 2013, the average market rent in the County for a one-bedroom was $2,005
  and $2,398 for a two bedroom. This reflected a 24% and 31% increase since 2010,
  respectively.

Fair Market Rents (FMRs) are estimates, prepared by the US Department of Housing
and Urban Development, of the rent plus utilities that would be required to rent
privately owned, decent, safe, and sanitary rental housing of a modest nature with
suitable amenities. The calculation of FMRs is based on information from the 2010
Census, housing surveys, and the CPI for housing. The rent figures do not necessarily
reflect current asking rents, but rather the upper limits of rents that can be used in the
negotiations for Section 8 contracts and other similar rent subsidy programs. The
difference between FMRs and market rents illustrates the ongoing problem of the
need for increased housing subsidies. In addition, FMRs tend to lag behind actual
market trends by a year or sometimes more. As the gap between HUD FMRs and
rents in the County widen, there are fewer and fewer landlords who will accept
Section 8 vouchers and certificates.
Actual market rents are often significantly higher than HUD’s Fair Market Rents.
RealFacts tracks the rental prices in various communities based on surveys of apartment
buildings with 50 or more units. The following table illustrates the gap between actual
rents, “Fair Market Rents” and with rents defined as "affordable." Affordability, for the
purposes of this report, is generally defined as housing where an occupant pays no
more than 30% of gross income for rent, including utility costs. The following table
shows that the only one category of lower-income households can afford actual
market rate rents (shaded yellow in the table below). All other household types would
require some assistance to afford market-rate housing in San Mateo.

HOUSING CONDITION
In determining the condition of the existing housing stock and the need for its
preservation and improvement, the 2010 Census information is not sufficient, because
the Census defines unsound buildings as those without plumbing or without kitchens.
The Census therefore does not provide the level of specificity needed to accurately
gauge the housing rehabilitation needs of the community.
                                                                                        11

  City of San Mateo 2014 Housing Element
ABAG notes that the number of substandard units can be estimated from a field survey
or sampling, from knowledgeable builders, from nonprofit housing organizations or
redevelopment agencies. An estimate of the maximum number of units needing
rehabilitation can also be derived from other Census measures such as percentage of
units built before 1940.
Approximately 90% of the housing units in San Mateo are over twenty years old, and
more than 50% were built before 1960. Similar to the rise in property values, the cost
of housing maintenance also increased in the 1980s and onward. As housing
structures grow older so does the demand for regular maintenance. Property
maintenance, however, is often deferred as residents are frequently unable to afford
the rising cost.

Most units in the City are in good condition and are not considered to be in
substandard condition. The city defines a “Substandard Housing Condition” as any
dwelling unit which includes but is not limited to the following conditions: Lacks
structurally sound foundations, walls, roofs or porches, in need of a new roof or
exterior paint, and in need of dry-rot repairs. Those considered to be in substandard
condition are located primarily in Central, North Central, Central Business District,
Shoreview, and North Shoreview neighborhoods. A “drive-by” survey of the North
Central and Shoreview neighborhoods conducted by Housing staff in the Spring of
2014 indicated approximately 900 homes may be in need of rehabilitation.

UNITS AT RISK OF CONVERSION TO MARKET RATE
State law requires that each city provide analysis and programs for preserving existing
affordable multi-family rental housing units that were developed with public subsidies.
Units at risk of conversion are those units in which the restrictions, agreements or
contracts to maintain the affordability of the units expire or are otherwise terminated.
At expiration, units may revert to market rate, rendering them no longer affordable to
the people living in them. Loss of affordability can occur at the termination of bond
funding, the expiration of density bonuses, and other similar local programs.
The potential loss of existing affordable housing units is an important issue to the City
due to displacement of lower-income tenants and the limited alternative housing for
such persons. It is typically less expensive to preserve the affordability of these units
than to subsidize construction of new affordable units due to the inflation of land and
construction costs which has occurred since the original development of the
affordable housing projects.
Project-Based Section 8
Flores Gardens has 72 one-bedroom senior units. The project was built with federal
221(d)(4) financing and affordability is maintained through Section 8 project based
assistance. The building was constructed over a City owned parking lot via a lease of
the “air rights” of the property. The owner of this building had the right to prepay its
loan and opt of out of the Section 8 program in 2003. However the owner elected to
refinance with HUD to preserve the affordability of this building in 2005. The City
amended its lease agreement to coincide with the refinance and therefore new
affordability restrictions are now in place until the year 2035. . Of particular note is
that while there are 72 one-bedroom units, the actual total number of residents vary as
each unit may house up to two individuals. Staff verified that a total of 89 residents
occupied the property in 2014,
The Belmont Building – Opened in 1994, offers six one-bedroom apartments for single
persons in Downtown San Mateo. The units were converted from underutilized office
space to housing using CDBG and Redevelopment Agency Housing Set-Aside funds.
Affordability will be maintained through a forty-year rent-regulatory agreement and
Section 8 assistance through the year 2032.
Edgewater Isle Senior Apartments – Completed in 1986 and refinanced in 1997, this
92-unit rental development is occupied exclusively by very low- and low-income
seniors. The development is the recipient of loans from the San Mateo Redevelopment
Agency and the California Housing Finance Agency (CHFA) with affordability
restrictions in place until 2048, with an option to renew for an additional 50 years after
that. All the low-income tenants in this complex receive Section 8 assistance. This
assistance both provides lower rents for the tenants, and helps provide funds for the
maintenance of the apartment units.
                                                                              13

 City of San Mateo 2014 Housing Element
200 S. Delaware – In November 1999, the City entered into an agreement with the
nonprofit organization Human Investment Project (HIP Housing) to acquire and
conduct minor rehabilitation on the 16-unit apartment building at 200 S. Delaware.
The City contributed $391,600 in RDA Housing Set-Aside funds and $774,000 in
HOME funds to ensure the affordability of all 16 units until 2049. HIP Housing has
secured Section 8 assistance for all 16 of the units in the project.
Tenant-Based Section 8
As of May 2014, the City of San Mateo had the second highest number of households
using Section 8 vouchers with 709 disbursed throughout the City, or 16% of the total
4,394 households receiving rental subsidy in San Mateo County.
Assisted Rental Housing
The following table contains an inventory of assisted rental projects and other rental
units that are affordable and the expiration dates of their affordability. The following
table contains an inventory of assisted rental projects and other rental units that are
affordable and the expiration dates of their affordability. There are two projects with
affordability restriction due to expire in the next Housing Element cycle.
Park Towers. Now known as Lesley Towers, it was built in 1963 with a HUD Section
202 loan for low income seniors. The loan will be paid in full and the rent restrictions
will expire in 2015. The property is owned and operating by Lesley Senior
Communities (LSC), a non-profit whose mission is providing affordable senior rentals. In
December 2013 LSC was awarded a HUD Senior Project Rental Assistance Contract
which will provide Section 8 rental assistance to the project that will ensure ongoing
affordability. It will also provide increased cash flow to the building that will be utilized
for extensive capital improvements, which are scheduled to begin in 2014.
Humboldt House. This is an apartment building that provides 9 units of supportive
housing for the mentally ill owned and operated by Mateo Lodge, a nonprofit
corporation. In 2000 Mateo Lodge purchased and renovated the building with
funding assistance from both the County and City of San Mateo. The City provided
$500,000 which has been accruing 3% interest annually. The loan and regulatory
agreements expire in 2020, but both documents have provisions to extend the loan
repayment and rental restrictions for an additional 20 years at the City’s discretion. The
property owner has a very good track record in operating and maintaining the
building and it is expected that both parties will want to extend the agreements.

Assisted Ownership Housing
The following table summarizes the City’s supply of assisted ownership housing. On the list
are three City sponsored developments and five developer sponsored projects, which have
set aside affordable ownership units in compliance with the City’s Below Market Rate
Ordinance. These ownership units make up one component of the City’s First Time
Homebuyer Program. In order to be eligible for these properties, residents need to be on
the City’s First Time Buyer waiting list, which is currently quite long due to the tight rental
market; as of May 2014, there are approximately 300 households on the list. Units in the
Meadow Court and Gateway Commons projects could potentially lose their affordability if
sold to the open market, but the City has the first right of refusal when homeowners sell
and works to maintain the units in the First Time Buyer Program.

HOUSING NEEDS
The purpose of this section is to discuss the needs for housing assistance separately for
various income groups by tenure type (renter/owner) and for different family categories
(large/small families, seniors). This section also discusses the extent to which housing
problems affect very low-, low- and moderate-income renters and owners when compared
to the jurisdiction as a whole; and to what extent any racial or ethnic group has
disproportionately a greater need for housing assistance based on income category, family
type, or tenure type when compared to housing needs for the jurisdiction as a whole.
Data for this section has been provided by HUD and is generally based on the 2000 and
2010 US Census. For the purposes of this report, the definitions listed in the side bar shall
apply.
The 2010 Census records San Mateo as having 38,233 total occupied households; 19,969
(52%) owner occupied housing units and 18,264 (48%) renter occupied units. American
Community Survey data (2009-2011) indicate that 2,849 (7.5%) of all housing units in San
Mateo were overcrowded with greater than 1.01 persons per room, of which 916 (2.4%)
have greater than 1.51 persons per room. Renters tend to have higher rates of

                                   As defined by US Census Bureau or HUD
Cost Burden: The extent to which gross housing costs, including utility costs, exceed 30% of gross income,
based on data published by the US Census Bureau. Severe cost burden is the extent to which gross
housing costs including utility costs, exceed 50% of gross income.
Overcrowding: Housing units are considered "overcrowded" when there is more than one person per
room, discounting bathrooms, porches, utility rooms, unfinished attics, basements etc.
Housing Problem: A household having one or more of the following housing problems: (1) housing units
with physical defects such as lacking a complete kitchen or bathroom; (2) overcrowded conditions; (3)
housing cost burden (exceeding 30% of gross income), or severe housing cost burden (exceeding 50% of
gross income).
Small Related Households: A household of 2 to 4 persons that includes at least one person related to the
householder by birth marriage, or adoption. Single parent households are included in small related
households.
Large Related Households: A household of 5 or more persons that includes at least one person related to
the householder.
Other Households: Other households include single persons living alone, as well as small and large
households where there are no related persons.
Elderly/Senior Household: For HUD rental programs, a one or two person household in which the head of
the household or spouse is at least 62 years of age.

      Note: 0-1 people per room is not overcrowded, 1-1.5 people per room is overcrowded, more

    Large Related Households: Large related households, particularly those that rent, may
    require housing assistance due to increased household expenses and the need for larger
    living quarters that typically carry higher rents. Since most of these families must compete
    for the limited amount of larger units (3 + bedrooms) many, especially those with small
    children, may experience overcrowding by occupying households with fewer rooms. Data
    from the Comprehensive Housing Affordability survey (2006-2010), indicate that about 9%
    of all households were large related households; 1,610 are renter households, with 1,385
    (86%) of these reporting problems.

Small Related Households: Data suggests that small related households experience housing
problem at a slightly less, but proportionally significant level. Small related renter
households headed by single parents may also require housing assistance. According to
the American Community Survey (2007-2011), about 16% of female-headed households
with children live below the poverty line and who likely pay more than 30% of their income
on housing costs, or have some other kind of housing problem.
Senior Households: Senior households, particularly renters, may require special housing
assistance when compared to other family, age and tenure groups in the City. Many of
these renters live on limited incomes and in substandard rental housing. According to the
2011 American Community Survey, 7% of all senior households are living below the
poverty level, and an additional 25% earn less than $30,000 per year.
Disabled Households: The only data available for these households is number of
households within each category. Considering other available data, it would be expected
that cost burden represents a large portion of the type of housing problems, but lacking
such data, the specific types of housing problems will not be discussed for this report.
There are an estimated 7,892 persons with some kind of disability in San Mateo,
representing about 8% of the population.
Housing Needs for Extremely Low and Very Low-Income Households
Extremely Low Income (ELI) households earn 30 percent of the area median income or
less. In San Mateo County this amounts to an annual income of $33,950 or below for a
family of four. Many ELI households live in rental housing and most likely facing
overpayment, overcrowding or substandard housing conditions. Some ELI households are
recipients of public assistance such as social security insurance or disability insurance.
Housing types available and suitable for ELI households include affordable rentals,
secondary dwelling units, emergency shelters, supportive housing and transitional housing.
In 2010, there were 4,330 ELI households in San Mateo according to 2010 CHAS data.
More than half of these households live in rental units, representing a much higher
percentage of renters than in San Mateo’s general population. Most of San Mateo’s ELI
households face some kind of housing problem — 90 percent of all ELI renter households
and 77 percent of ELI owner households face problems with either overcrowding,
overpayment, and/or lack complete kitchen or plumbing facilities.

In contrast to ELI, very low-income households (VLI) are defined by HUD as those
households whose incomes do not exceed 50% of the median income. Data on both
these groups will be combined because the needs of these groups are virtually the same.
In addition, much of the data available on lower-income housing groups is provided in
aggregation. However, this Housing Element does include a section specifically addressing
data on the ELI income group in compliance with State law.
Renters
ELI/VLI renters are usually subject to the worst housing conditions and have the greatest
need for rental assistance. High rents in San Mateo not only place a severe housing cost
burden on families in this income category but create a situation which leads to
overcrowding as families double up to pay higher rents. ELI/VLI renters typically occupy
substandard units which are often small and subject to overcrowding. These units are
placed under a particular burden and most are in need of housing rehabilitation.
Housing Problem: Data provided by HUD indicates that an estimated 81% of all ELI
households, reported a housing problem. The most severe housing problem associated
with this group includes having a severe cost burden.
Cost Burden: In San Mateo, 90% of VLI renters pay over 50% of their gross income toward
rent. Households with high cost burden demonstrate the greatest need for rental
assistance or rental subsidies. Elderly, small, large and other household types all
demonstrate a great need for rent subsidies and as such cannot be separated or classified
as a priority group for rental assistance.
Overcrowding: Based on field experience of City housing and code enforcement staff, it is
likely that the number of overcrowded living situations is under reported by the Census.
Although it is not possible to quantify, code enforcement officers routinely encounter living
situations where people sleep 2-3 persons per room as well as garages, sheds, basements
and campers. These living situations consist of large extended families, or large groups of
single persons, usually male, who share the rent. With the high cost of housing in this
                                                                                           21
  City of San Mateo 2014 Housing Element
area, dangerous overcrowding remains a significant problem and is a priority for code
enforcement cases.
Owners
As a group, ELI/VLI owners have fewer housing problems than renters, yet they have
significantly higher percentage of housing problems as whole, which is almost entirely due
to housing costs. Since it is nearly impossible for an extremely low or very low-income
household to purchase a lower priced home in San Mateo's market, it is safe to assume
most VLI owners have owned their property for some time. Past studies have shown that
78% of owners with incomes below poverty level live in homes over 35 years old, and 46%
with homes older than 50 years. Home repair and maintenance costs are a significant
burden for this income group. According to CHAS data (2006-2010), there are
approximately 4,570 ELI/VLI homeowners.
Housing Problem: HUD data indicates that 61% of all ELI/VLI homeowners reported a
housing problem in San Mateo. This percentage is higher than the general owner
population, 55% of which reported a housing problem.
Cost Burden: Of the ELI/VLI homeowners reporting housing problems, 17% had a cost
burden between 30% and 50%, whereas 61% of those households reported a housing
cost burden of over 50% of income. This is significantly higher than owners reporting
housing problems as a whole.
Specific Housing Needs for Extremely Low-Income Households
Of the 4,055 ELI households, more than 54% of them are seniors. Of all ELI owners, 73%
are seniors. This clearly illustrates the income problem that seniors often have. And, as
could be expected, ELI senior households have high rates of housing problems, especially
cost burdens. Additionally, although precise statistics are not available, anecdotal
information suggests that large ELI households also experience a significant amount of
overcrowding, as families try to double up to save costs.
Housing Needs for Low-Income Households
Low-income households (LI) are defined by HUD as those households whose incomes fall
between 51 to 80% of the median income. Approximately 18% or 6,745 of all households
in San Mateo are considered to be low-income. Renters constituted 3,507 (52%) and
owners constitute 3,238 (48%) of all LI households.
Renters
The greatest housing need identified for moderate-income household renters is for those
suffering from a cost burden, especially when one considers the limited number of
affordable housing units available to this income group.
        22
                                               City of San Mateo 2014 Housing Element
Housing Problem: HUD data indicates about 70% of all LI renters reported a housing
problem. Cost burden data for LI renters seems to indicate that most housing problems for
this group are due primarily to the high price of housing that requires a greater portion of
household income to be devoted to rent.
Cost Burden: Cost burden data provided by HUD indicates that 56% of all LI renters
reported a cost burden.. Elderly, small, large and other households types do not
demonstrate a greater cost burden when compared to LI households as a whole and
therefore do not warrant specific targeting for subsides or rental assistance.
Owners
Housing rehabilitation appears to be an important need for those LI owners reporting a
housing problem and cost burden. In many instances minor repairs can lower energy bills
and other maintenance costs for homeowners reporting a cost burden.
Housing Problem: Out of the all LI homeowners, more than 50% reported a housing
problem. This is somewhat higher than the 34% reported for all City homeowners.
Cost Burden: For LI homeowners the cost burden greater than 30% for is not significantly
different than that for LI renters with 56% of all LI homeowners reporting as having a cost
burden.
Housing Needs for Moderate Income Households
Moderate-income households (MOD) are defined as those whose incomes are 80% to
120% of HUD's adjusted median family income. Renters and owners consisted about 50%
each of the total number of households, or 2,125 households in each category.
Renters
Housing needs identified for middle-income renters are primarily due to cost and
affordability of rental units. As with lower income renters cost burden is an issue but to a
lesser degree when considering the flexibility and price ranges available to this income
group.
Housing Problem: Housing problems were reported for 24% of all MOD renters. However
housing problems reported for this income group is 54-67% lower when compared to VLI
and LI renters and is most likely associated with cost burden as opposed to overcrowding
or substandard housing, with one exception for large family households.
Cost Burden: Cost burden was reported for 11% of all MOD renters with only 1% reporting
a severe cost burden. When compared to VLI and LI renter households reporting a cost
and severe cost burden this group fared far better than both.
                                                                               23
  City of San Mateo 2014 Housing Element
Owners
As with LI households, housing rehabilitation assistance can be an effective way to lower
the cost of housing maintenance and utilities and somewhat improve the cost burden for
many middle-income homeowners reporting overpaying for housing costs and utilities.
Housing Problem: Housing problems were reported for 25% of all MOD homeowners.
Housing problems reported for this income group are not significantly different for all
households reporting a housing problem and is not a specific housing issue for this income
group.
Cost Burden: The majority, 22%, of these homeowners reporting a housing problem also
reported a cost burden with only 4% percent reporting a severe cost burden. Cost burden
does not appear to be as significant of a problem for owners in this income group as it
does for VLI and LI homeowners.

Homeless Population
In support of the HOPE Plan strategy to develop new methodologies to gather data
relating to homelessness, in 2007 San Mateo County implemented a new methodology for
the requisite bi-annual one-day homeless census. This methodology provided for a more
thorough one-day street enumeration process and a survey of homeless individuals
documenting various demographic data, characteristics and needs of homeless individuals
        24

                                                  City of San Mateo 2014 Housing Element
and families. This process, combined with a refinement of the Homeless Management and
Information Strategies (HMIS) System that collects data from service providers serving
homeless populations, provides a more detailed set of collected data that will provide
important information for all stakeholders to continue to develop and implement strategies
to better meet the needs of the community. Even with these improved methodologies, the
HOPE Plan acknowledges the difficulty in collecting accurate data in that the counts often
overlook those in hidden places, such as those who living in cars or are doubled up with
friends or family, and those who are “situationally” homeless as a result of financial or other
crisis.

12.5% of the total homeless
population countywide – less than the 15.4% the City experienced in 2007. This number
includes 103 unsheltered homeless, or 7.9% of the total percentage of unsheltered
homeless population countywide.
Although detailed data were not provided for the City alone (because of the small survey
response rate), Countywide data from 2013 gives a helpful glimpse at the issues facing
homeless people. The results of the 2013 unsheltered homeless survey indicated that the
typical unsheltered homeless person in San Mateo County is a single man with at least one
disability. Of those surveyed, 94% were single adults or adults living with other adults, 71%
were men, and 80% had at least one disability. The most commonly cited disabilities were
alcohol or drug problems (72%), physical disability (52%), chronic health problems (47%),
and mental illness (37%). This data was consistent with the results from the 2011 survey,
though all categories of disability showed small increases.
The population of sheltered homeless people looks somewhat different than the
unsheltered population. While this population is still predominantly single and male, there is
a greater representation of families. Of the homeless adults living in shelters, transitional
housing and institutional settings, 21% are in families with children, compared to only 6%
of the unsheltered adults. Sheltered adults were 60% male and 40% female. Levels of
disability are also somewhat lower among the sheltered population compared to the
                                                                                     25

  City of San Mateo 2014 Housing Element
unsheltered population: only 10% reported having a mental illness and 8% chronic
substance use.
The racial and ethnic composition of the unsheltered homeless population was 60% White,
19% Latino, 13% Black or African-American, and 10% other races and ethnicities. This data
reveals that some groups are over- or under-represented among homeless people in San
Mateo County. African Americans represent only 3% of the total County population, yet are
13% of the homeless population. Many of the African Americans in San Mateo County live
in the south county communities of East Palo Alto and Redwood City, which, as noted
earlier, have a disproportional number of homeless people. Latinos are 25% of the total
population but only 19% of the homeless people surveyed.
Of the unsheltered homeless people counted, 11% were Veterans (having either served in
the US Armed Forces and/or in the National Guard or as Reservists). This represented a
decrease from 2011 when 13% of unsheltered homeless people were veterans, and may
reflect increases in the availability of housing resources for this population since ending
veteran homelessness has been made a key priority both locally and at the federal level.
Among the sheltered people counted in the HMIS system, 24% were veterans, compared
to only 10% in 2011. This reflects the addition of a number of shelter and transitional
housing beds funded by the VA to the sheltered count, rather than an expansion in the
number of sheltered homeless veterans.
A very high proportion of unsheltered homeless people in San Mateo County have been
homeless repeatedly and/or for long periods of time. The survey found that 65% were
“chronically” homeless, meaning that they were disabled and had been homeless for
longer than 12 months or for 4 times in the past 3 years. This represented an increase from
2011, when only 46% were chronically homeless. The rise in chronic homeless is likely due
to the same factors that have contributed to the overall increase in homelessness: high
unemployment, rising rents and lack of affordable housing.
The typical homeless person has strong connections to San Mateo County. Of those who
responded to the survey, 87% reported that that they were living in San Mateo County at
the time they became homeless and 69% indicated that their hometown was in San Mateo
County. The following table summarizes demographic characteristics of the County’s
homeless population in 2013.

Needs of Homeless Subpopulations
The following information in this section for homeless sub-populations are derived from the
San Mateo County HOPE Plan, the San Mateo County Human Service Agency Continuum
of Care, Healthy Community Collaborative of San Mateo County 2008 Community
Assessment, as well as other resources as noted. It should be noted that most data
provided are based on a surveys of homeless persons and service providers in San Mateo
County as well as goals and achievements noted by the Continuum of Care and other
organizations. While it is unlikely San Mateo County Human Service Agency’s statistical
profile accurately represents the City's, it does give a general description of the likely
characteristics of the City's homeless population which can be used for discussion and
comparative purposes.
According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition’s “Out of Reach 2013”, San
Mateo County has risen from the nation’s fourth least affordable counties to third,; tied with
San Francisco and behind Honolulu and Nantucket County, MA. The report indicates that
the hourly wage needed for housing for a two bedroom rental would be $34.52, or about
$72,000 annually. However, with the California State minimum wage at $8.00 (just 23%
needed to rent two bedrooms), there persists a substantial income gap for many of our
City’s most needy families.
Need for Transitional Shelter Space for Families
In many homeless families the head of the family may lack job skills necessary to qualify for
a job that pays enough to support the family, especially given the high cost of housing in
San Mateo County. Longer-term transitional housing and job training are needed by many
                                                                                         27

  City of San Mateo 2014 Housing Element
of these homeless parents. Those who do not have satisfactory job skills or work
experience often suffer from medical conditions or other problems that limit their ability to
work and require special medical care or counseling. Children of these families also need
an array of services, including proper nutrition, health care, education, counseling and a
stable living environment.
As in prior years, the enumerators counted very few unsheltered homeless families with
children. Of the 180 family households counted in 2013, 115 (64%) were living in shelters,
64 (36%) were in cars or RVs, and only 1 (<1%) was observed on the street. The very low
numbers of unsheltered homeless families on the street reflects the County’s ongoing
commitment to preventing family homelessness and its investment in programs targeting
families with children, such as the Motel Voucher Program, Inclement Weather Voucher
Program, and homeless prevention programs operated by the Core Service Agency
Network.
The 2013 data on homeless families is consistent with the experience of San Mateo County
service providers who observe that homeless families with children rarely live on the streets
and are much more likely to reside in shelters or cars. Many families with children also live in
places that do not meet the HUD standard of homelessness (i.e. they are living temporarily
with friends or families) yet they are very precariously housed. See the section on “Hidden
Homelessness,” below for more details.
The relative percentages of homeless households with children versus those without
children increased slightly from 2011 to 2013. In 2011, 8% of all homeless households
counted (both sheltered and unsheltered) were families with children compared to 10% in
2009.
According to the Healthy Community Collaborative of San Mateo County 2008 Community
Assessment the community perception of the availability of local homeless programs and
shelters was 64.3% as “Fair/Poor”, 26.3% as “Good” and 9.4% as “Excellent/Very Good,” all
reflecting a significant improvement from both 2001 and 2004. The primary provider of
shelter for homeless families in this area is InnVision Shelter Network (IVSN), which serves
both San Mateo and Santa Clara Counties. IVSN operates First Step for Families in San
Mateo which provides interim shelter and services for 39 families. This provides both short-
term housing for up to 60 days and one-bedroom transitional housing apartments for an
additional 4 months. In addition to providing shelter, there is free on-site day care for
resident children as well as other job development and case management resources. . First
Step has helped 610 families move to permanent housing since opening its doors 10 years
ago. IVSN operates 11 interim shelters in both counties and assists an average of 240
families each year.
Although the resources available to these families have increased, there still remains a need
for more. According to respondents to the Healthy Community Collaborative of San Mateo
County 2008 Community Assessment survey, 6.4% of adults had to live with friends or
family due to housing emergencies. There were 22 families counted that were housed
through emergency shelters and voucher programs in locations other than Shelter
        28

                                                City of San Mateo 2014 Housing Element
Network’s facilities. According to the Sustainable San Mateo County 2008 Indicators Report,
in fiscal year 2006-07, Shelter Network served 850 homeless families and 638 homeless
adults totaling 3,506 individuals, 1,571 of which were children. The number of shelter
beds nights provided increased 16% from 2005-06. In fall 2008, the need was exacerbated
with the foreclosure and economic crisis. Shelter Network reported that their waiting list at
First Step for Families increased to over 100 families waiting for emergency and transitional
shelter as a result, this more than doubled the number of families on the waitlist in
November 2007. This reflects the continued need for more transitional housing for families.
Need of Homeless Who Are Mentally Ill
The passage of the Mental Health Services Act, Proposition 63, in November 2004 has
created a much needed ongoing revenue resource for a wide variety of mental health
services. As a requisite to the receipt of these State funds, San Mateo County is primarily
completed with an extensive community planning procedure that developed an MHSA
Plan for use of these funds they are calling “Transforming the System.”
One of the core visions of the process included housing in this statement: “The Mental
Health Partnerships with county and community based agencies to address the
psychological, spiritual, health, social, and housing needs of people with serious emotional
disturbances/mental illness.” This effort will include an extensive network of other County
departments such as those in various aspects of health, ageing, disabilities, and criminal
justice, as well as nonprofit service providers, community organizations, consumers and
their families and business and labor organizations.
For the unsheltered population, it is noted above that the commonly cited disabilities
included alcohol or drug problems (72%) and mental illness (37%). This data was consistent
with the results from the 2011 survey. It is clear that the homeless mentally ill need medical
care, mental health, and drug and alcohol counseling services in addition to emergency,
transitional, and permanent housing. Affordable apartments and single room occupancy
hotel type housing are important elements to retaining stable long-term housing.
Providing onsite services at a housing location has been proven to be a more efficient and
effective way of providing services to this population. The Mental Health Association of San
Mateo County continues to be a leader in providing supportive housing for those with
mental illness with their 25 unit supportive housing units at Belmont Apartments. . The first
MHSA Housing project in partnership with MHA for the 15-unit Cedar Streets Apartments
in Redwood City, has recently made the units available for application.
Needs of Homeless with Substance Abuse
Substance abuse is one of the major causes of homeless, and it is also a major factor that
keeps homeless persons in a condition of homelessness. In the 2013 Census and Survey,
72% of the unsheltered indicated alcohol or drug use as being a disabling condition. High
unemployment levels among those with alcohol and drug issues make it clear that these
persons would have a hard time obtaining and retaining housing without assistance.
                                                                               29

 City of San Mateo 2014 Housing Element
Substance abuse presents a complex problem for service providers because most services
and available housing are not designed to address drug and/or alcohol addiction. The
need for increased treatment programs and sober housing is critical to meet these person's
housing needs. The Safe Harbor Shelter, operated by Samaritan House, provides 90 beds of
emergency shelter for adult individuals with substance abuse counseling available onsite.
Need of Homeless Fleeing from Domestic Violence
Many studies document domestic violence as a major cause for homelessness. Those
suffering from domestic violence are in need of longer-term transitional housing that can
provide the safe, specialized and essential support services needed to help those overcome
their battering experiences and move on to permanent housing. Transitional housing
should also provide childcare, job training and development, counseling and other support
services to rebuild client's lives. CORA, Community Overcoming Relationship Abuse, is the
only domestic violence provider within San Mateo County and operates an emergency
shelter in San Mateo.
According to in 2008 Community Assessment, there were 2,704 domestic violence-related
calls for assistance in San Mateo County in 2005. This reflected a decline of 14% in the
number of calls since 1998, with 2005 being the lowest year. A total of 555 arrests were
made in 2005, down 27% from the record high of 759 in 1997. The 2013 survey data on
domestic violence was consistent with 2011: in both years 16% of respondents indicated
they had been victims of domestic or partner violence.
Needs of Homeless Youth
According to Youth and Family Enrichment Services, a service provider group serving
youth and families, there is an ever growing number of homeless youth ages 16-21, who
have no means of support and are not wards of the State or on probation. The group
points out that more than 400 teens each night in San Mateo County are generally lost in
the County’s system of services. According to the 2013 Homeless Survey, there were nine
households counted, consisting of only unaccompanied homeless youth under the age of
18.
Without early intervention many of them will encounter the underground of economies of
drugs and prostitution. There are currently three shelters in the County specifically for these
homeless youth. The County has increased its focus on providing housing for emancipated
foster youth and other transition age homeless youth. The City and County should
continue to stay informed of this growing trend and encouraged to provide emergency
and transitional housing assistance and specialized counseling for youth.
Needs of Homeless with AIDS
The National Commission on AIDS reported in 2007 that roughly 1/3 of all people infected
with AIDS is either homeless or in eminent danger of becoming homeless. According to
        30

                                                City of San Mateo 2014 Housing Element
the National Coalition for the Homeless, up to 50% of person living with HIV/AIDS are
expected to need housing assistance of some kind during their lifetimes.
The 2013 Homeless Survey indicated about 2% of the survey respondents had HIV or AIDS.
Overall Countywide HIV statistics show that total reported cases of infection increased in
2011 (the most recent year for which data are available), compared to the previous 4 years.
However, these numbers are still relatively small – only 83 people were reported as newly
infected in 2011, compared to 222 in 1992. Of the 83 cases in 2011, 90% were in men. It is
                                       not known if this increase represents an increase in
                                       transmission. An increase was seen in Asian/Pacific
                                       Islander cases, comprising 28% of the 83 newly
                                       identified HIV cases in 2011 in the county.
                                       Approximately one third of newly identified HIV cases
                                       in 2011 reported an unspecified means of
                                       transmission. The highest rates are seen in zip codes
                                       94005, 94401, and 94063. The high rate seen in
                                       Pescadero (zip code 94074) is due to low population
                                       in that zip code.
                                       ELLIPSE is a service group located in San Mateo which
                                       provides emotional, financial and basic needs support
                                       for people with AIDS and HIV. With advanced drug
                                       treatments, persons with HIV/AIDS have shown a
                                       growth in those living longer with the disease at a
cumulative 900+ persons in San Mateo County in 2011. This points to the long term need
for housing for those living with this disease.
Needs of Persons Threatened with Homelessness
In San Mateo there is an extensive sub-population which is threatened by homelessness.
One of the groups most at risk of becoming homeless is very low-income households
(<50% AMI) whose housing cost burden is greater than 50 percent of gross income. To a
lesser extent, low-income households (<80% AMI) who also pay more than 50 percent of
income towards housing are at risk of becoming homeless. Emergency rent assistance and
transitional programs are important resources for keeping persons in their homes, especially
since the cost of getting back into housing is much higher than the cost of preventing
homelessness.
Others who are at risk of becoming homeless are persons in overcrowded housing
situations, victims of domestic violence and persons in tenuous employment situations. The
needs of overcrowded households are extensive and include the risk homelessness. The
housing need of victims of domestic violence is for additional shelters, or increased
occupancy capacity for those in operation in order to accommodate all persons desiring to
leave dangerous living situations.
                                                                               31

Below is a table which roughly estimates the number of persons in the City of San Mateo
who are at risk of becoming homeless based primarily on census data, data tables provided
by HUD, and nonprofit agency estimates:

Addressing Homelessness Issues
Combining data from 2013, 2011 and 2009, planners, policymakers and service providers
have a wealth of data available as they work to expand and improve the system of housing
and services for homeless people. The following are some strategies and approaches that
have been and will continue to be the highest priorities.
Continuing Areas of Focus
The following strategies are already being implemented and will continue in the coming
year:
 Addressing the lack of housing affordability by continuing to create supportive and affordable housing
    for homeless people and those at-risk of homelessness;
 Continuing to develop specialized outreach to homeless veterans and linking them to available housing
    resources, particularly the VASH permanent housing program;
 Working with the systems of care whose clients have very high levels of homelessness, particularly the
    alcohol and drug treatment system, mental health system, and the criminal justice system, to develop
    strategies for meeting the housing and service needs of these populations;
 Coordinating with the health systems on the implementation of the MediCaid expansion authorized
    through the Affordable Care Act, which should result in many currently uninsured homeless people
    becoming eligible for health care;
 Recognizing that the majority of homeless people are long-time residents of San Mateo County and
    embracing joint planning between the County and local jurisdictions to meet their housing and service
    needs.
New Areas of Focus:
 Expansion of the highly successful Homeless Outreach Team (HOT) to cover the entire County. The
    existing HOT teams conduct intensive outreach to and engagement with chronically homeless people
    and help connect them to permanent supportive housing. Teams in San Mateo and South County have
    assisted hundreds of clients over the past several years. Increasing the capacity of this program will help
    reduce the incidence of chronic homelessness.
        32

                                                      City of San Mateo 2014 Housing Element
 Expanding shelter system capacity in the South County in response to the high levels of homelessness in
     those communities. New emergency shelter capacity should be strongly linked to permanent supportive
     housing options to ensure there are ways for people to exit the shelter system.
 Addressing the high rate of unemployment among homeless people by exploring strategies to engage
     and secure employment. In particular, there is a need for specialized employment and training services
     that are tailored to meet the needs of chronically homeless people with disabilities. This population
     requires support in the areas of employment readiness, as well as approaches like supported employment
     and wage subsidies in order to successfully enter the workforce.
 Over the next year, the Cities, in partnership with the County, should explore additional methodologies
     for identifying people who are vehicularly housed (particularly those living in RVs) and assessing their
     need for housing and services. This project may include outreach, engagement and needs assessment
     surveys.
Other Special Needs
In addition to the homeless, there are other groups of persons who require supportive
housing, including the elderly, frail elderly, persons with disabilities (mental, physical,
developmental), persons with alcohol or other drug addictions, and persons diagnosed
with AIDS and related diseases.
Needs of Persons Living With AIDS
With advanced drug treatments, persons with HIV/AIDS have shown a growth in those
living longer with the disease at more than 900 persons in San Mateo County in 2011.
Additionally, since 1992 there has been a declining number of newly diagnosed cases.
In a presentation made in 2003 to the HIV Health Services Planning Council, the Director
for San Mateo County’s Public Health AIDS Program indicated that for those living with or
newly diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, the lack of affordable housing was a significant barrier to
creating stable permanent housing for this population.
The National Commission of AIDS published the report "Housing and the HIV/AIDS
Epidemic; Recommendations for Action" which indicates that roughly 1/3 of all people
infected with AIDS are either homeless or are in eminent danger of becoming homeless
and are in greatest need for supportive housing and housing assistance. Therefore,
utilizing the number of persons living with AIDS in San Mateo County in 2011,
approximately 300 persons and/or households require some type of supportive housing.
Needs of the Disabled
To be considered disabled, a person must have an illness or impairment that impedes
his/her ability to function independently. This number may include those with
developmental disabilities, those who are mentally ill, those who are elderly, and/or frail
elderly (these subgroups are specifically discussed later in this report), and those with
physical disabilities.
                                                                                           33

  City of San Mateo 2014 Housing Element
Unfortunately, much of the data provided by the Census and HUD on persons with
disabilities tend to aggregate certain types of disabled persons together. For example, data
provided by HUD indicate that the number of persons reporting some type of a disability
was 7,892 in 2010, or about 8.2% of the population. The following table provides some
information on disability types within San Mateo in 2010.

The housing needs of the disabled population are as diverse as the population itself. The
current approach to providing housing for disabled persons is based on a goal of offering
the highest level of independence possible and increased accessible marketing of available
publicly sponsored housing opportunities. Information on specific disabled populations is
provided below.
Developmentally Disabled
A “developmental disability” as a condition that originates before an individual reaches age
18; continues, or can be expected to continue indefinitely; and constitutes a substantial
impairment in three or more areas of major life activity. Developmental disabilities include
mental retardation, epilepsy, cerebral palsy, autism, and disabling conditions closely related
to mental retardation or requiring treatment similar to that required by people with mental
retardation, but does not include other handicapping conditions that are solely physical in
nature.
Many developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently within a
conventional housing environment. More severely disabled individuals require a group
living environment where supervision is provided. The most severely affected individuals
may require an institutional environment where medical attention and physical therapy are
provided. Because developmental disabilities exist before adulthood, the first issue in
supportive housing for the developmentally disabled is the transition from the person’s
living situation as a child to an appropriate level of independence as an adult.

The State Department of Developmental Services (DDS) currently provides community
based services to approximately 243,000 persons with developmental disabilities and their
families through a statewide system of 21 regional centers, four developmental centers,
and two community-based facilities. The Golden Gate Regional Center (GGRC) is one of 21
regional centers in the State of California that provides point of entry to services for people
with developmental disabilities. The center is a private, non-profit community agency that
contracts with local businesses to offer a wide range of services to individuals with
developmental disabilities and their families.
According the Developmental Disabilities Board, Area 5 (an advocacy organization), a total
of 746 persons with developmental disabilities are consumers of the Golden Gate Regional
Center’s services within San Mateo zip codes. The following highlights the living
arrangements of these individuals in both San Mateo and the County.

Some percentage of these individuals will need different living arrangements based on
individual needs; for example, as parents age, they may be unable to care for their aging
children, who will eventually need a different kind of housing situation. The types of
housing opportunities appropriate for people living with a developmental disability include:
    •    Rent-subsidized affordable housing, with services, accessibility modifications, and proximity
         to transit and the community;
    •    Licensed and unlicensed group homes;
    •    Inclusion within larger housing developments serving the general populations and/or
         affordable housing;
    •    Section 8 housing choice vouchers or project-based Section 8;
    •    Home purchases through special programs like first-time homebuyers;
    •    HUD Section 811/MHP/SHP developments for disabled populations; and
    •    Housing especially modified for the Medically Fragile (SB 962 homes)
The needs of this population for supportive housing vary depending on the severity of the
disability. Some developmentally disabled persons participate outside of supportive housing
in different programs offered by service providers to help them live independently and
                                                                                               35

successfully in the community. For example, Community Gatepath is a nonprofit
organization that provides opportunities of greater independence for children, youth and
adults special needs and disabilities. The organization serves individuals and families by
providing education and support services. A significant number of this population lives
independently in supportive housing, with support levels based on the need. Estimates are
that approximately 1 to 3% of persons and/or households who report developmental
disabilities also require housing assistance. Utilizing that percentage, the housing need
would range from approximately 30 to 87 households in San Mateo – less than that
estimated by the Developmental Disabilities Board, but still significant.
Mentally Disabled
Although basic information on persons in the City with a mental disability is provided in the
Census, detailed information is generally only available at the County level. The Mental
Health Services Act plan (2005) provides statistics on the needs of the mentally ill
throughout San Mateo County. Of those served with mental health services, the plan
found the following in 2003-2004:
    Most people (10,085) were served in the outpatient system, including psychiatric emergency
     and Access Team contacts.
    Over 2,000 adult clients (or 59% of all adult clients) were served with less than 15 hours of
     service per year. Of these, 17% received only medication related services.
    About 2,500 people also used San Mateo Medical Center Psychiatric Emergency Services (PES)
     for crisis services. Of these, most were adults, followed by children/youth and then older adults.
     Between 20% (older adults) and 35% (children/youth) had received services from the mental
     health system prior to the first PES visit. Post the PES visit, 76% of children/youth received
     services compared with only 37% of adults and 36% of older adults.
    Just over 700 people had inpatient episodes, most of them adults. There were 89 transition age
     youth and 70 older adults. The number of consumers with five or more inpatient episodes
     dropped from 23 in FY 02/03 to 11 in FY 03/04. A review of these 11 cases indicated the
     investment of a minimum of 47 hours of outpatient services to a top of 312 hours of outpatient
     service in addition to the inpatient stays.
    Over 500 adults received residential services in addition to outpatient services; 109 people were
     served in skilled nursing facilities/locked facilities; 12 of these individuals were older adults.
    Slightly over half of the people served by San Mateo County were MediCal beneficiaries
     (56.5%), although this varied by age group. About 7% of the people served were on and off of
     MediCal during the year of service.
    There is a range in the percentage of MediCal consumers served by sub-region (countywide
     average, 12.13%, ranging from 8.63% in East Palo Alto to 14.48% in Central). Sub-regions also
     show variance in the percentages by ethnicity of the MediCal population served.
    The diagnostic mix of San Mateo County consumers was:
          • ADHD 2%
          • Anxiety 6%
          • Bipolar 5%
          • Conduct Disorder 1%
         36

                                                City of San Mateo 2014 Housing Element
        •   Deferred 26%
        •   Depression / Mood Disorder 20%
        •   Other 14%
        •   Schizophrenia / Psychotic 25%
The mix of diagnoses is representative of most public mental health systems. The number of
deferred diagnoses may reflect capacity issues, in terms of time and availability of staff to
develop more detailed diagnostic analyses, but is a serious barrier to adequate treatment
planning.
As can be expected, many of the people with mental illness served by the County come
from the homeless population. The 2005 plan found that the populations identified as
most at-risk of becoming homeless are Latinos and African Americans. The Federal Task
Force on Homelessness and Severe Mental Illness estimates that 33% of those that are
homeless have a serious mental illness (SMI), and of these, 40-60% have a co-occurring
substance abuse (SA) disorder. In San Mateo County, this would result in almost 1,500
homeless individuals per year that require mental health/co-occurring disorder services.
While this population is mostly adult, there are also transition age youth and older adults in
the homeless population. In San Mateo County, the Transitions (AB 2034) program has
been focusing on the homeless population, serving 71 adults and 11 older adults in FY
03/04. We conclude that a substantial proportion of the homeless population is unserved.
Needs of Frail and Non-Frail Elderly
As Census data has shown, the number of senior population has increased dramatically
from the city to county, state and national levels. According to the Administration on
Aging A Profile of Older America: 2003, there were 31.2 million persons in America ages
65+ in 1990. In 2000 there were 35 million and in 2010 there were 40.3 million, a growth
of 9 million in 20 years.
In 2000, there were 13,932 persons age 65 and over in San Mateo with 5,445 males and
8,487 females. Of those persons, 3,320 of the males and only 2,975 of the females
reported having a disability. In 2010, there were a total estimated 4,352 seniors over 65
with a disability. A substantial percentage of senior households pay more than 50% of their
household income on housing – many are on fixed incomes. CHAS data from 2006-2011
indicate that there are more than 1,200 senior households who are considered extremely
low income.
Housing needs of the elderly are varied. Some households have substantial retirement
incomes and own their own homes, while others live on limited incomes in substandard
rental housing. Some elderly have unique housing needs because of poor health, mobility
problems and income. Of the elderly requiring supportive housing, there are two
sub-populations which need to be discussed in the Consolidated Plan including: frail and
non-frail elderly. The following is a description of the general supportive housing needs for
these groups:
                                                                              37

  City of San Mateo 2014 Housing Element
Frail Elderly: The frail elderly share many of the same housing needs as the disabled. In
order to remain dependent and in their own homes, they may require accessible housing
with special design features. Typically frail elderly categorized as low-income are ones
which are in most need of supportive housing assistance. According to the American
Community Survey (2008-2012), there are about 4,406 persons over the age of 65 with a
disability, broken down as follows:

                 Source: ACS 2008-2013
Non-Frail Elderly: Non-frail elderly households can also have severe cost burden problems
and may lack adequate resources to deal with the continuing increase in costs for housing.
Where the effects of aging are combined with low-income, the risk of homelessness is
greatest. Non-frail elderly persons may be in need of tenant-based rental assistance, shared
housing opportunities, housing rehabilitation, and other supportive services, such as low-
cost food and health care services. HUD data indicates 2,909 elderly households have
reported housing problems and are in need of some form of supportive housing or other
housing assistance.
Supportive Housing Available for Frail and Non Frail Elderly: The State Department of
Social Services' Inventory of Community Care Facilities indicates that as of March 30, 2005,
there were 70 residential care facilities providing supportive housing for persons over age
of 60 with a combined capacity and population of 1,211 persons. San Mateo has been
very proactive in supporting senior housing development within the City.
Persons with Alcohol/Other Drug Addictions
Alcohol and other drug abuse is defined as excessive and impairing use of alcohol or other
drugs, including addiction. The San Mateo County Human Service Agency (SMCHSA)
which administers various alcohol and drug abuse recovery services in San Mateo County
indicates that approximately 9-10 percent of the total County population suffers from some
form of alcohol or other drug addiction. It is estimated that out of this population,
approximately 25 percent require supportive housing.
In the SMCHSA Alcohol and Drug Services June 2003 report “Alcohol and Drug Issues: An
Overview of In-Treatment Data and Community Needs Indicators”, there were 6,529
treatment episodes reported for 2001-02. Treatment episodes were defined as “one client
        38

                                                      City of San Mateo 2014 Housing Element
enrollment in an alcohol/drug treatment program” and may occur more than once during
the year. These treatment episodes were for 4,939 unduplicated clients, of which 680
were adolescent clients. During that program year additional funds were committed to
specifically increase juvenile services. Considering the percentages previously noted, it
could be estimated that approximately 1,235 persons would require some form of
supportive housing.
Farmworkers
There is no agriculture and no housing for farmworkers within the City of San Mateo or in
eastern San Mateo County in general. High housing costs and a long commute to the
coast make farmworker housing impractical in the eastern County.
Female-Headed Households
According to the 2011 American Community Survey, there are about 3,580 female-headed
households in San Mateo, which represents about 9.2% of the total number of households.
While 1,473 of those households include children under 18 years of age, a greater
proportion (58%) have no children under 18.
Children living in female headed households are more likely than other children to live
below the poverty line. Single mothers have a greater risk of falling into poverty than single
fathers due to such factors as the wage gap between men and women, limited training
and education for higher-wage jobs, and inadequate child support. According to recent
studies, single mothers on welfare rarely find full-time, permanent jobs at adequate wages.

EMPLOYMENT TRENDS
A total of 20,410 new jobs are anticipated to be created in San Mateo between 2010 and
2040, as shown in the table below. This represents a growth rate of 38.9%. The County as
a whole is expected to experience a growth rate of 28.9%. However, this follows a period
of decline, with both the county and the City losing about 10% of their respective jobs
between 2000 and 2010. While the City anticipates a reduction in the jobs-per-employed-
person ratio, the County will continue to see more jobs per person than the City.

The Association of Bay Area Governments provides statistics on population and
employment growth between 2010 and 2040. Although there are expected to be
approximately 20,500 new jobs added over the next three decades, some jobs sectors will
be impacted positively or negatively. For example, while jobs within the professional sector
are expected to grow by more than 70%, manufacturing and wholesale jobs will
experience a further decline.

In addition, although a significant number of new jobs are expected to be created in the
San Francisco/San Mateo/Redwood City region, a large portion of them will be in low-
wage service occupations. As shown in the following table, 65% of the job classifications
projected to have the highest number of openings in the Metropolitan region from 2010
to 2020 have mean hourly wages that represent extremely low or very low incomes. With
the exception of openings for certain types of managers and computer professionals, the
vast majority of job openings will afford the earner far below median income. In fact, 72%
of the jobs in the top 20 would not provide the funds needed to rent an apartment
according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition’s “Out of Reach 2013”, In
addition, more than 68% of these jobs will not require any more than on-the-job training; in
other words, these jobs require little skill. This trend indicates that job growth in the region
is likely to increase the demand for affordable housing and that the housing affordability
situation for those currently housed is not likely to improve due to market forces during this
period.

POPULATION TRENDS
According to ABAG’s Projections 2013, the City’s population is expected to grow 29.6%
(28,800 people) by 2040. As shown in the following table, the population growth of the
County is projected to be slower, with a rate of 25.9% for the same period.

ABAG projects that, although the number of households is expected to grow 22.2% for the
County as a whole through 2040, the household growth rate for the City of San Mateo will
                                                            increase by 27.2% for the same time

COMMUTING TRENDS
As housing prices escalate, families often move further and further away from central cities
to find housing that is more affordable. This trend can be reflected in commuting patterns,
not only in terms of the time it takes to travel between two locations, but also in the sheer
number of commuters moving into and out of a region. According to the following table,
nearly 33,000 people commuted into the City in 2010.

The Regional Housing Needs allocation process is a State mandate, devised to address the
need for and planning of housing across a range of affordability and in all communities
throughout the State. Each jurisdiction in the Bay Area (101 cities, 9 counties) is given a
share of the anticipated regional housing need. The Bay Area's regional housing need is
allocated by the California State Department of Housing and Community Development
(HCD), and finalized though negotiations with ABAG.
According to ABAG, the regional housing need is determined by estimating both the
existing need and the projected need for housing. Existing need is the amount of housing
needed to address existing overcrowding or low vacancy rates. Projected need relates to
providing housing for the growing population. Using slightly different methods, both the
State, through the State Department of Finance (DOF), and the region, via ABAG, estimate
projected household growth. Since these numbers may differ, the State and the region
work closely together to arrive at an agreed upon estimate of future population growth;
therefore, housing need through 2022.
On July 19, 2013, the ABAG Executive Board adopted the final Regional Housing Need
Allocation (RHNA) methodology for the period between 2014 and 2022. The RHNA
methodology consists of two major steps: determining a jurisdiction's total RHNA and
identifying the share of the jurisdiction's total RHNA in each income category. The
following describes the components of the adopted RHNA Methodology.
Sustainability Component
This component advances the goals of SB 375; this factor is based on the Jobs-Housing
Connection Strategy, which allocates new housing development into Priority Development
Areas (PDAs) and non-PDA areas. By concentrating new development in PDAs, the
Strategy helps protect the region’s natural resources by reducing development pressure on
open space, rural areas, and small towns. This allows the region to consume less energy,
thus reducing household costs and the emission of greenhouse gases. Following the land
use distribution specified in the Jobs-Housing Connection Strategy, 70% of the region’s
housing need as determined by the California Department of Housing and Community
Development (HCD) will be allocated based on growth in PDAs and the remaining 30%
will be allocated based on growth in non-PDA locations.
HCD determined that the housing need for the Bay Area region for 2014 to 2022 is
187,990 units. The sustainability framework of the PDAs is the basis for the Sustainable
Communities Strategy (SCS) and the inclusion of this framework in the RHNA methodology
promotes consistency between the two.

                                                                                             As
of July 19, 2012, the Jobs-Housing Connection Strategy was modified to include a feasible
growth concentration scenario that was applied to the 2014-2022 RHNA cycle. This new
distribution shifts approximately 3,500 units (1.5 percent of the total regional allocation)
from Oakland, Newark, San Jose, and the North Bay primarily to medium sized cities with
high job growth and transit access.
Fair Share Component
This component achieves the requirement that all cities and counties in California work to
provide a fair share proportion of the region’s total and affordable housing need. In
particular, cities with strong transit networks, a high number of jobs, and that permitted a
low number of very low- and low-income units during the 1999-2006 RHNA cycle received
higher allocations. The Fair Share Component includes the factors listed below:
•    Upper Housing Threshold: If growth projected by the Jobs-Housing Connection
     Strategy in a jurisdiction’s PDAs meets or exceeds 110 percent of the jurisdiction’s
     household formation growth, that jurisdiction is not assigned additional units. This
     ensures that cities with large PDAs are not overburdened. In addition, the total
     allocation to a jurisdiction cannot exceed 150 percent of its 2007-2014 RHNA.
•    Minimum Housing Floor: Jurisdictions are assigned a minimum of 40 percent of their
     household formation growth. Setting this minimum threshold ensures that each
     jurisdiction is planning for housing to accommodate at least a portion of the housing
     need generated by the population within that jurisdiction.
•    Fair Share Factors: The following three factors were applied to a jurisdiction’s non- PDA
     growth:
         Past RHNA Performance: Cities that permitted a high number of housing units for
          very low- and low-income households during the 1999-2006 RHNA cycle received
          a lower allocation.
         Employment: Jurisdictions with a higher number of existing jobs in non-PDA areas
          (based on 2010 data) received a higher allocation.
         Transit: Jurisdictions with higher transit frequency and coverage received a higher
          allocation.
Income allocation
The income allocation method gives jurisdictions that have a relatively higher proportion of
households in a certain income category a smaller allocation of housing units in that same
category. For example, jurisdictions that already supply a large amount of affordable
housing receive lower affordable housing allocations. This also promotes the state objective
for reducing concentrations of poverty and increasing the mix of housing types among
cities and counties equitably. The income allocation requirement is designed to ensure that
each jurisdiction in the Bay Area plans for housing people of every income.
                                                                                45

  City of San Mateo 2014 Housing Element
The income distribution of a jurisdiction’s housing need allocation is determined by the
difference between the regional proportion of households in an income category and the
jurisdiction’s proportion for that same category. Once determined, this difference is then
multiplied by 175 percent. The result becomes that jurisdiction’s “adjustment factor.” The
jurisdiction’s adjustment factor is added to the jurisdiction’s initial proportion of households
in each income category. The result is the total share of the jurisdiction’s housing unit
allocation for each income category.
Sphere of Influence Adjustments
Every city in the Bay Area has a Sphere of Influence (SOI) which can be either contiguous
with or go beyond the city’s boundary. The SOI is considered the probable future
boundary of a city and that city is responsible for planning within its SOI. The SOI boundary
is designated by the county’s Local Area Formation Commission (LAFCO). The LAFCO
influences how government responsibilities are divided among jurisdictions and service
districts in these areas.
The method for allocating housing need for jurisdictions where there is projected growth
within the SOI varies by county. In Napa, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano, and Sonoma
counties, the allocation of housing need generated by the unincorporated SOI is assigned
to the cities. In Alameda and Contra Costa counties, the allocation of housing need
generated by the unincorporated SOI is assigned to the county. In Marin County, 62.5
percent of the allocation of housing need generated by the unincorporated SOI is assigned
to the city and 37.5 percent is assigned to the county.
SUBREGIONAL SHARES
As part of the RHNA process, local jurisdictions have the opportunity to form a subregion to
conduct an allocation process that parallels, but is separate from, the regional process. For
the 2014‐2022 RHNA, three subregions were formed by the respective jurisdictions in
Napa, San Mateo, and Solano counties.
The first step in the subregions’ RHNA process was for ABAG to determine each
subregion’s share of the total regional housing need determination from HCD. Housing
Element law states that the subregion’s share “shall be in a proportion consistent with the
distribution of households assumed for the comparable time period of the applicable
regional transportation plan.” The household distribution is based upon the county’s
distribution in 2022 from the Jobs‐Housing Connection Strategy of the SCS. Napa
received 0.8%, San Mateo received 8.7%, and Solano received 3.7% of the region’s total
housing need.
Subregion Allocation Method
The San Mateo subregion was responsible for completing its own RHNA process. Their
process paralleled, but was separate from, the Bay Area’s RHNA process. The San Mateo
subregion created its own methodology, issued draft allocations, and handled the revision
and appeal processes. They also issued final allocations to members of the subregion.

                                               City of San Mateo 2014 Housing Element
Although the subregion worked independently of the regional RHNA process, ABAG is
ultimately responsible for ensuring that all of the region’s housing need is allocated. Thus, if
the subregion were to fail at any point in its attempt to develop a final RHNA allocation for
the subregion, ABAG would have had to complete the allocation process for the members
of the subregion.
The San Mateo subregion housing allocation method mirrored ABAG’s final method. The
same factors and weights were used as described above. Once units were allocated, using
the ABAG formula, several cities in the San Mateo subregion agreed to transfer units,
including the City of San Mateo. The following table shows the final ABAG housing
allocation, as adjusted, for the City of San Mateo for the 2014-2022 planning period.
REGIONAL HOUSING NEED ALLOCATION, 2014-2022
     Total Projected Need   Very Low       Low     Mod     Above Mod     Average Yearly Need
              3,100            859         469     530        1,242              388

In addition, State Housing Element Law requires that jurisdictions provide for the needs of
residents considered to be extremely low-income, defined as households earning less than
30% of median income. Accordingly, the need allocation is further disaggregated as
follows:
                           Extremely     Very                       Above     Average Yearly

CLIMATE CHANGE
With the passage of AB 32 and SB 375, the City of San Mateo has taken extensive steps to
address climate change. In 2007, a Carbon Footprint study was conducted to determine
the City’s greenhouse gas emissions which helped the City focus its sustainability efforts. In
addition to the Carbon Footprint, the City initiated a Sustainability Advisory Committee
which created and submitted to the City Council a Sustainable Initiatives Plan, which
provided recommendations on how the City should address climate change and reduce
the City’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions generated by the community.
Following the Sustainable Initiatives Plan, a Climate Action Plan (CAP) for City’s Operations
and Facilities was created. This Plan focused on City agency efforts and included specific
actions to reduce the energy and fuel use in City facilities and operations.
In 2014, the City of San Mateo developed a community-wide CAP, which will serve as a
comprehensive strategy to reduce emissions of GHGs. This CAP integrates and consolidates
the City’s previous plans and efforts to address climate change, creating an updated
                                                                                47

  City of San Mateo 2014 Housing Element
framework for addressing GHG emissions in the community. The CAP identifies the City’s
preferred strategies for new development to address climate change.
This CAP serves as a Qualified GHG Reduction Strategy, consistent with California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Guidelines Section 15183.5 and the Bay Area Air
Quality Management District (BAAQMD) GHG Plan Level Guidance. As part of the
requirements for a Qualified GHG Reduction Strategy, the CAP includes an inventory and
forecast of San Mateo’s current and future GHG emissions, a target to reduce community-
wide GHG emissions, specific strategies to achieve these reductions, and an
implementation and monitoring program to track progress toward the target and the
status of the reduction strategies.
The following are excerpts of the City’s Climate Action Plan as it relates to the Housing
Element Update.
Community-Wide Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory
The CAP presents emissions for activities that take place within the City limits of San Mateo,
even if the emissions are physically emitted in another community, such as a community
member using electricity generated by a power plant in another part of California.
Emissions are calculated using reported activity data (for example, the amount of electricity
used in the community) and factors that reflect the local conditions. All GHG emissions in
the inventory are shown in a common unit: metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents, or
MTCO2e, which allows the varying potencies of different GHGs to be represented in one
number. The GHG emissions inventory included nine sources of emissions, or sectors, for
San Mateo in 2005. By understanding where these emissions come from, CAP measures
can be targeted to address the largest sources in San Mateo. The community’s total
emissions in 2005 were 804,290 MTCO2e. More than half of these emissions (58%) came
from on-road transportation, and an additional 35% came from energy use in residential,
commercial, and industrial buildings. Community-wide GHG emissions in 2005 are shown
in the Figure below.
        48

                                              City of San Mateo 2014 Housing Element
Using the baseline inventory, the CAP estimates the long-term impact of San Mateo’s efforts
to reduce GHG emissions. The CAP presents the City’s ongoing commitment to achieve
long-term, post-2020 targets consistent with State guidance. Full implementation of all
strategies in the CAP can result in a reduction of emissions by approximately 18% below
2005 baseline levels by 2020, exceeding both the 2020 goal in San Mateo’s adopted
General Plan and State guidance for a 15% reduction.
The strategies in the CAP consist of measures and actions, identifying the steps the City will
take to support reductions in GHG emissions. San Mateo will achieve these reductions in
GHG emissions through a mix of voluntary programs and new strategic standards. All
recommended standards presented in the CAP respond to the needs of development,
avoiding unnecessary regulation, streamlining new development, and achieving more
efficient use of resources.
Energy Conservation Strategies for the Built Environment
Residential energy use in the community of San Mateo comprised approximately 17% of
baseline GHG emissions in 2005.Strategies in the CAP to reduce emissions from the
residential sector seek to improve the existing housing stock, encourage green building in
new homes, encourage energy efficiency, and expand the use of renewable energy to
meet residential energy needs.
The following measures from the CAP include key actions in the CAP that address
residential energy efficiency:
RE 3: Renewable energy systems for new residences
Recommended Actions:
• Provide educational materials to developers about existing federal, State, and regional
     programs that support and/or subsidize small-scale or distributed-generation renewable
     energy systems for local use.
• Develop incentives for developers who install renewable energy systems on their
     developments, including solar photovoltaics and solar water heating. An incentive
     program could include reduced or waived fees, rebates, or low/no interest loans,
     among other mechanisms. The City should explore a revolving loan program or
     dedicated funding source(s) for the incentives. Funding sources could include the City
     and/or a combination of public and private resources, such as rebates, grants, and
     loans. Incentive programs should apply to solar photovoltaics and solar water heating
     though other feasible options could be supported.
• Partner with PG&E, San Mateo Energy Watch, a CCA, or others to provide rebates and
     energy buy-back programs for on-site renewable electricity systems.
• Reduce or eliminate existing solar permit fees.
• Require new houses and multi-family developments to be solar ready as defined by the
     California Building Standards Code to support the installation of a rooftop solar energy
     array at a later date.
                                                                                49

  City of San Mateo 2014 Housing Element
•    Revise the San Mateo urban design guidelines to allow for nontraditional building
     design elements if necessary to support on-site renewable energy systems.
RE 4: Renewable energy systems for existing residences
Recommended Actions:
• Provide information to homeowners about existing funding programs for renewable
     energy systems.
• Offer incentives for applicants who install renewable energy systems on their homes as
     feasible, including same-day permit approval and participation in revolving loan
     programs.
• Promote existing financing programs, such as Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE)
     programs, allow homeowners to incrementally pay for renewable energy systems, and
     explore creating or joining additional programs.
• Reduce or eliminate solar permit fees for existing buildings beyond the minimum
     standards required by Assembly Bill 2188
EE 1: Residential energy efficiency owner-occupied retrofits
Recommended Actions:
• Educate homeowners, property managers, and real estate agents about the benefits of
     residential energy retrofits, the availability of financing options, and how to participate.
• Provide energy retrofit information to project applicants seeking permits for renovation
     or expansion work on existing houses.
• Host residential energy outreach events such as evening workshops and local learn-at-
     lunch sessions, provide energy retrofit information at community events, and distribute
     information on residential energy retrofit online and in public buildings.
• Publicize the available options and financial benefits of PACE programs.
EE 2: Residential energy efficiency renter-occupied retrofits
Recommended Actions:
• Educate property owners about available financing mechanisms to improve energy
     efficiency in rental units, such as shared savings programs.
• Support efforts by property owners to make improvements to rental units through
     PACE programs.
• Encourage property owners to participate in energy benchmarking efforts.
• Work with tenant groups and property management companies to identify actions
     tenants can take within the bounds of their lease to improve energy efficiency.
• Offer low- or no-cost energy audits to property owners who agree to disclose a unit’s
     energy efficiency results to tenants.
     Provide incentives such as direct subsidies, participation in revolving loan programs, and
     expedited permitting to property owners who make energy efficiency improvements to
     their units beyond any minimum actions required by the adopted energy code.

EE 5: Residential energy education and low-cost retrofits
Recommended Actions:
• Conduct outreach to homeowners, renters, real estate agents, and property managers
     about low-cost retrofits and energy-efficient behaviors.
ENERGY CONSERVATION
Home energy efficiency have become an increasingly significant factor in housing
construction, particularly in the past few years with the increasing demand to build energy
efficient and sustainable buildings in California. Energy costs related to housing include not
only the energy required for home heating, cooling and the operation of appliances, but
the energy required for transportation to and from home.
State Title 24 Part 6 is the California Energy Code, first enacted in the 1980s, permits
builders of new residential units to achieve compliance either by calculating energy
performance in a prescribed manner or by performance based on computer modeling.
The energy code is updated every three years by the Energy Commission to advance the
energy efficiency standards for building construction. The city has adopted the 2013
California Energy Code which is effective July 1, 2014. This code edition is the latest version
of the energy code ensuring the most up-to-date standards are applied to newly
constructed buildings and existing buildings with alteration work. In addition to the energy
code, the state also adopted the 2013 Green Building code to further heighten the overall
sustainable building construction standards. The Green Building code addresses the use of
sustainable materials, methods of construction, interior and recycling of construction waste.
These measures contribute to the overall building energy efficiency and have an added
ongoing benefit throughout the useful life of a building.
In order to save natural resources and to make utilities more affordable, the City's HOME
Repair programs provide both funding and information referral for participants to include
weatherization improvements and utilize energy and water efficient appliances and fixtures.
Program participants are encouraged to use the energy conservation programs provided
by Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E).
In new affordable housing construction where the City provides financing, the City
encourages the design of new units that are sensitive to energy consumption. In 2013, the
City adopted the California Green Building Code to provide further energy conservation
measures including solar ready, plumbing insulation, efficient lighting and heating systems,
as examples.
The City’s energy efficiency efforts have already supported improved energy efficiency in
San Mateo since 2005. The Climate Action Plan presents the impact of such efforts,
highlighting the sustained community-wide reductions in energy use documented since
2005. The City’s ongoing plans for fostering ongoing energy efficiency in the residential
sector are presented in the Climate Action Plan, as summarized above.
                                                                               51

ONGOING PROGRAMS
A number of housing programs and policies have been ongoing to further the main goals
of preserving the character and qualify of residential neighborhoods, to provide a range of
housing types to accommodate a diverse population, and to meet the demands created by
new job growth. The City continues to seek a variety of funding sources to preserve,
rehabilitate, and use code enforcement to improve existing properties and neighborhoods.
It also uses those resources to work in partnership with private and nonprofit developers to
provide housing for all the community, including those with special needs and the
homeless. An appendix to this Housing Element outlines each of the actions to be
implemented in the prior Element, and what actual progress was made.

G.       INVENTORY OF LAND FOR RESIDENTIAL
         DEVELOPMENT
A key component of the Housing Element is a projection of a jurisdiction’s housing supply.
State law requires that the element identify adequate sites for housing, including rental
housing, factory-built housing, and mobile homes, and make adequate provision for the
existing and projected needs of all economic segments of the community. This includes an
inventory of land suitable for residential development, including vacant sites and sites
having potential for redevelopment, and an analysis of the relationship of zoning and
public facilities and services to these sites.
ADJUSTED HOUSING NEED FIGURES
The State allows local jurisdictions to deduct units built or in the pipeline between January
1, 2014 and January 31, 2015 from the total need figures established by ABAG. The
resulting number includes those units that ultimately must be accommodated through
adequate sites. The City of San Mateo has developed the following figures for reducing the
need that must be accommodated in adequate sites:

ADEQUATE SITES INVENTORY
City staff inventoried vacant and underutilized parcels in San Mateo to determine what land
is available for development at various levels of density. These density levels were then
equated to the ABAG affordability levels and the number of units which might be able to
be developed at each affordability level is estimated, e.g. available land zoned at higher
densities can be counted toward the very low- and low-income level needs, and land
zoned at lower densities are counted toward the moderate and above moderate-income
housing need. The analysis was also completed using the actual average built densities for
developments built on land with various zoning designations; the State has determined
that it is not sufficient to simply calculate it at the zoned densities, especially if there are
significant differences between zoned and built densities.
The City of San Mateo's land inventory for future housing includes property zoned for
multifamily use that is currently vacant as well as land that is underutilized. The adequate
sites analysis demonstrates that there is enough land to meet the ABAG Regional Housing
Needs Allocation. The analysis for affordable housing units for extremely low, very low, low
and moderate income households is based on three assumptions: (1) that any property
        54

                                                 City of San Mateo 2014 Housing Element
zoned multifamily that can accommodate 11 or more units will produce 10% affordable
units through the Below Market Rate (BMR) program (15% starting January 1, 2010); (2)
that land zoned at densities higher than 30 units to the acre can facilitate affordable
housing development; and (3) that government subsidies can be applied on any
multifamily site to provide further affordability.
The ability to provide affordable units citywide is more dependent on available financial
resources than zoning density. An example of this can be demonstrated with a
comparison of two similarly sized projects approved in 1999. The Santa Inez Apartments is
a .74 acre site zoned R-5 which was approved for 44 units. With a combination of federal
tax credits and funding from the San Mateo Redevelopment Agency, 42 of the units are
affordable for very low-income households and 2 are affordable to low income
households. Another project, the Baer Apartments got approved for 53 units on an .89-
acre site utilizing the Density Bonus Program. This site is zoned R5-D. This project did not
receive any government subsidy, but was required to provide 5 very low-income units.
The following table summarizes the various zoning classifications, the maximum
mathematical capacity and the realistic capacity. The realistic capacity is based on two
factors: for land where the actual development potential is already known (for example, in
the Bay Meadows Specific Plan), the approved unit capacity was used. For land where the
development potential is not known, historical averages were used. Based on research
derived from the Housing and Land Use Study, the City has been approving projects for
development at a rate of approximately 77% of maximum zoned capacity. On those sites
where the development potential is not known, therefore, the maximum capacity was
multiplied by 77% to arrive at the realistic capacity.
While the 77% was applied to all of the sites listed in Appendix A regardless of Zoning
District, residential uses are not the only use allowed on each of the inventoried sites.
Commercial uses are permitted on all sites not designated for high density residential. To
evaluate the extent on how much residential was constructed on non-residentially zoned
parcels, including but not limited to, C1-C3, E1, E2 and TOD zones, an evaluation on
historic averages was also conducted. Using the same Housing and Land Use Study
referenced above, non-residentially zoned sites were isolated and then evaluated on the
rate the city approves residential on these sites. The analysis shows that the City approves
residential on nonresidential sites at a higher rate than the 77% of maximum listed above.
The actual maximum approval rate is approximately 85% of the maximum zoned capacity.
This percentage is based on the evaluation of 20 residential projects since 2001.
Furthermore, 10 of the 20 projects reached the maximum residential density as a mixed-use
development with some non-residential use; therefore, maximum residential density can be
reached on non-residentially zoned properties with or without non-residential uses.
While residential was the primary use of the approved projects many of them were
approved as mixed uses and incorporated some commercial on the ground floor. Even
though the 85 % approval rate could be figured into the realistic capacity for Appendix A,
77% was used for a more conservative analysis.
                                                                              55

The narrative below further describes a few of the various programs to address the
housing sites issue through land use activities.
SENIOR CITIZEN OVERLAY DISTRICT
Another technique used in San Mateo to increase the housing supply and to meet the
housing needs of a growing sector of the community is the Senior Citizen (SC) Overlay
district, adopted in 1978. The SC zoning classification allows a developer to increase the
number of units and reduce parking requirements for housing built expressly for senior
citizens. These provisions recognize the smaller sized units and reduced traffic generation
and parking needs of senior housing.

SECONDARY UNITS
In 1983, the City adopted a Secondary Unit Ordinance, which allows for the creation of
ancillary rental units (commonly referred to as "granny" or "in-law" units) on single-family
properties. The ordinance requires that the units be small (maximum 640 square feet of
living area), that they provide adequate parking and that the property owner reside on-site.
In 2003, the ordinance was revised to comply with State regulations allowing secondary
units as permitted uses in all residential zoning districts.
MOBILEHOMES AND MANUFACTURED HOUSING
Manufactured housing and mobile homes provide opportunities for lower cost
housing. Manufactured homes, which are fabricated off-site and assembled on residential
properties, are permitted in all residential districts in San Mateo. Mobile homes, which are
certified under the California Health and Safety Code, are also permitted in San Mateo,
subject to a design review process. There are no mobile home parks in San Mateo.
EMERGENCY SHELTERS
In compliance with SB2, the Zoning Code was amended in 2009 to allow emergency
shelters as a permitted use within C2 and C3 Zoning Districts (Regional/Community
Commercial Land Use Designations).
The C2 and C3 commercial zones were specifically chosen to meet the potential needs for
emergency shelters due to its commercial zoning and proximity to transit and other core
social services. In the C2 and C3 commercial zones, there are a total of 228 parcels with an
average parcel size of 0.79 acres that would allow emergency shelters as a permitted use.
The commercial buildings on these parcels have an average square footage of 15,746
square feet and since 2008 the commercial vacancy rate for the City of San Mateo has
been between 15-21%. Using a ratio of 200 square feet per homeless person, an average
vacant commercial building converted to an emergency shelter would house
approximately 78 homeless people. This converted average commercial vacant building
would exceed the identified need of 103 unsheltered homeless people identified in the City
of San Mateo in 2013.
Additionally, to meet City Council concerns regarding potential impacts to existing
neighborhoods, the City further implemented a 300 foot buffer limitation around single
family neighborhoods (Single Family Zoning Districts. This allows emergency shelters to be
located on 228 of the 378 C2 and C3 zoned parcels. This 300 foot limitation is consistent
with limitations currently applied to new Community Care facilities per California Health
and Safety Code Section 1520.5(b). The following map illustrates the eligible parcels
throughout the City.

H.      CONSTRAINTS ON HOUSING DEVELOPMENT
GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
There has been much discussion as to the extent to which governmental regulation affects
the cost of housing development by the private sector. The points at which the City
becomes involved in the housing development process include the zoning code,
subdivision regulation, building codes, improvement fees, and permit processing
procedures, as well as at the financing stage as with the development of affordable
housing. These forms of regulation are considered necessary to protect the health, safety
and general welfare of both existing and future citizens of San Mateo. To a certain extent,
all forms of regulation are a constraint on the ability of the private market to produce
housing. However, the City has been very aggressive in examining its codes and
procedures, and revising its regulatory role to encourage housing development.
Zoning
The zoning code regulates the use of land and structures, the density of development and
population, the bulk of structures, parking provisions, open space requirements,
landscaping standards and other design requirements. The San Mateo zoning code has
been written to be as accommodating as possible for new residential development, while
attempting to provide for quality living environments. The amount of multi-family zoned
land within the City is substantial, and there are significant areas zoned to allow for mixed-
use residential and commercial development. Most commercial and office districts also
permit housing development.
Multi-family densities permitted under the General Plan reach 50 units per acre, and the
zoning code has been amended to conform to this maximum, although it will continue to
be subject to state statutes mandating density bonuses under certain conditions.
The City allows for a wide range of housing types from single-family dwellings (approx. 4 –
9 units/acre) to high density residential (50 dwelling units per acre - and up to 75 dwelling
units per acre with public benefit). In addition, the City allows for secondary units on
residentially zoned properties. There are also special standards to allow increased density
for senior citizen housing units. The City also adopted provisions to allow emergency
shelters within existing churches. This was done to accommodate a program coordinated
by local churches. Emergency shelters are also permitted uses in Regional/ Community
Commercial land use areas.
Specific plans for larger areas have also allowed for a broadening of housing types. The Bay
Meadows Specific Plan, adopted in 1997 allows for live-work units, standard lot single-family
dwellings units, small lot single-family dwellings, townhouse units, multi-family residential
units and secondary units. Bay Meadows Phase 2, adopted in 2005, allows for the
                                                                               59

  City of San Mateo 2014 Housing Element
development of up to 1,500 residential units in a transit oriented mixed use environment
that includes various housing types.
The San Mateo Rail Corridor Transit-Oriented Development Plan includes transit supportive
land use and housing policies. These policies include the establishment of two TOD zones
located within the larger plan area in the vicinity of the Hayward Park and Hillsdale CalTrain
Stations. The Plan provides for mixed use development at the highest residential densities
and building heights near the train stations to encourage lively, transit oriented, and
pedestrian friendly places.
In addition, the City of San Mateo is participating in the Grand Boulevard Initiative which is
a collaboration of cities and other agencies in San Mateo and Santa Clara counties to
improve El Camino Real. The Guiding Principles for the Grand Boulevard Initiative direct
cities to target housing and job growth in strategic areas along the corridor and
encourage mixed-use development. In 2008, the City Council adopted Resolution No. 18
(2008) endorsing the Guiding Principles of the Grand Boulevard Initiative, and
incorporating them into future plans involving El Camino Real.
To further build upon these efforts, the city also adopted the Hillsdale Station Area Plan in
2011 which provides established TOD zones west of the Hillsdale Caltrain station. The Plan
provides for transit supportive land uses including multi-family housing with densities that
may range between 25 to 50 units per acre, and allows for mixed-use buildings, with retail
combined with residential or office uses. This Plan compliments the Bay Meadows Phase II
development plan on the east side of the Hillsdale station, and balances the concentration
of density on both sides of the station.
Parking requirements for residential development were comprehensively reviewed in 1989
and 1990 and are tailored to match vehicle ownership patterns of residents of new
projects in San Mateo. These standards require 1.5 spaces for a studio, 1.8 for a one-
bedroom unit, 2.0 for a two-bedroom unit, and 2.2 for three bedrooms; one space per unit
must be covered. These requirements are generally consistent with parking rates published
by the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE) publication “Parking Generation”. In addition, field
studies are done to verify the appropriateness of City parking requirements for specialized
types of housing, such as senior residential care. The San Mateo Rail Corridor Transit-
Oriented Development Plan requires reduced parking requirements in conjunction with
the development of transit-oriented development.
The subdivision regulations affect the manner in which property can be divided into
individual lots for development. Since there is so little land left to subdivide in San Mateo,
these regulations have little effect on the housing supply.
A summary of zoning requirements for all zoning districts follows. As indicated below, the
setbacks for multifamily are not onerous when compared with the requirements of single
family dwelling zoning districts. In addition, density and floor area ratio both increase for
multi-family dwelling zoning districts.

                                                     City of San Mateo 2014 Housing Element
     Open space requirements apply only to R3, R4-D, R5-D and R6-D zoning districts. However,
     this open space requirement can be met by either private open space, such as patios and
     deck area, or by public open space, such as common plaza and garden areas, or by a
     combination of both. This allows maximum flexibility in meeting these requirements.
     Additionally, landscaped areas that are part of the required building setbacks can be
     counted towards meeting the open space requirement.

on-site and off-site improvements is not dictated by the type of land use, but by the extent
of impact generated by the project. For example, transportation impacts fees are
determined by the number of vehicle trips that will be generated by the development.
Codes
The City has adopted the California Building Code, which is common to all California cities.
There is little distinction between San Mateo's code standards and those faced by builders
in other communities, with the exception of some minor local amendments and security
standards that regulate protection of building openings and exterior illumination levels.
The financial impacts of the security standards are minimal in most cases. The City
participates in the Joint Venture Silicon Valley Program (JVSV), which was established to
streamline the building permit process and to promote consistency on building code
language, interpretations, and administrative procedures among local and regional
agencies.
The City's code enforcement program is an important tool in maintaining its housing stock
and protecting residents from unsafe conditions. Local enforcement is based on the State's
Uniform Housing Code that sets minimum health and safety standards for buildings. To
minimize displacement and to encourage the rehabilitation of substandard dwellings, code
violations are reported to the City's housing rehabilitation specialists, who contact property
owners and encourage application for rehabilitation funding programs. The City
implemented the Apartment Inspection Program in 1994 which is coordinated by the Fire
Department through its Fire Prevention Division. The purpose of the program is to ensure
that the living standards of tenants are maintained and dangerous and unsanitary
conditions are avoided through enforcement of the Municipal and Housing codes.
Below Market Rate (BMR) Program
Inclusionary zoning programs – of which the City’s local BMR program is one variant – are
sometimes perceived as adding to the cost of housing by requiring the market-rate units to
subsidize the affordable units. This is an area of much dispute, both in the Bay Area and
nationally. There are as many positive aspects of inclusionary programs as there are
negative aspects. For example, a study conducted by the National Housing Conference’s
(NHC) Center for Housing Policy (2000) highlighted several important contributions to
inclusionary zoning to communities, not the least of which is the creation of income-
integrated communities without sprawl. 3
Within the last three years, several studies have been published that specifically address the
issue of who pays for inclusionary zoning. Some of these studies assert that the costs
associated with inclusionary programs are passed on to the market priced homes, while
other studies assert that in fact the cost is not borne by the end users at all. For example,
the “Reason Foundation” study entitled “Housing Supply and Affordability: Do Affordable
        3
          Inclusionary Zoning: A Viable Solution to the Affordable Housing Crisis?” (Washington, DC: The Center for
Housing Policy, National Housing Conference, October 2000).
                                                                                                     63

  City of San Mateo 2014 Housing Element
Housing Mandates Work?” (April 2004) argues that housing consumers and some
landowners pay for inclusionary requirements, not developers. The authors assert that
market-rate buyers (and to some extent, renters) will be forced to pay higher amounts than
they otherwise would for their units because of inclusionary zoning’s implicit tax on other
units.
In an article published in the Hastings School of Law Review in 2002 which provided one
of the first comprehensive reviews of inclusionary zoning and its cost implications for
jurisdictions in California, Barbara Kautz, former Director of Community Development for
the City of San Mateo and now a lawyer with Goldfarb and Lipman, noted that:
Most cities that have conducted economic analyses have concluded that, in the long run,
most of the costs are borne by landowners [rather than market rate renters or buyers.]
Initially, before land prices have had time to adjust, either the market-rate buyers or the
developer pays, depending on whether the market allows the developer to increase his
prices. If the developer cannot raise the market price for the non-inclusionary units or
lower his total costs, or some combination, his profits will decline. To put this another way,
builders will pay less for land because inclusionary zoning lowers their profits. 4
Kautz asserts that developers will sell at the highest level they are able to sell at, meaning
they will set prices according to what the market will bear. If a unit’s market value is
$500,000, it will be sold for $500,000. Developers would not “add” more to the price to
pay for the affordable units that are required; if they could sell it at $550,000, for example,
they would have sold it for that price in the first place. Furthermore, if the market value of a
unit is $500,000, a buyer would not pay $550,000. And, if all a buyer can afford is
$500,000, then the buyer will not spend $550,000. Ultimately, the price for a unit is
dependent on what the market will bear; it is not directly affected by the affordability
requirement.
The requirement to add inclusionary units results in substantial costs to a project compared
to being allowed to build all market rate units. These costs cannot be passed on to other
purchasers because buyers will not pay more because the development costs more; buyers
pay what the market will bear relative to the desirability of the unit, the location and the
community. Nor will the developer build for a lesser profit (unless the developer is unlucky
enough to have purchased land and planned a project under one set of conditions and
must sell units under a different set of conditions as a result of an unanticipated City policy.)
The land price is the variable that adjusts, over time, to absorb the increased costs of
development within the community.
If the cost of inclusionary zoning is not borne by the buyers or renters, but rather the
developers (in terms of less profit) or the original landowners (also in terms of less profit),
the question then becomes whether or not inclusionary zoning unfairly reduces the profit
one can realize through the development of property. As the courts have repeatedly
shown, zoning laws do not constitute a “taking” unless an owner is deprived of most, if not

all, of the economic benefit of a property. Land is a limited community resource, and as
such courts have given jurisdictions broad discretion in implementing a variety of land use
mechanisms that tend to restrict both the value and the particular use of property in order
to achieve objectives that meet the greatest public good.
In most instances – certainly within the State of California – local jurisdictions with
inclusionary programs have analyzed them as potential constraints to development. This
has been the directive of State HCD: while it pronounces “housing element law neutral
relative to enactment of mandatory local inclusionary provisions,” the State also notes that
there may be tradeoffs that must be discussed in the Housing Element’s constraints section.
However, jurisdictions almost always have implemented a number of incentives and cost
benefits to mitigate these impacts, so that whatever constraint has been identified there is
an offset offered to mitigate it.
In 2006 the City formed a Technical Advisory Committee to study a number of housing
and density issues that specifically included a review of the City’s Below Market Rate
Program and how it compared to other cities in San Mateo County. The resulting Housing
and Land Use Study Report (2008) identified a number of findings on this issue. The
economist report in the Housing and Land Use Study Report concluded that depending
on the flexibility of land prices, the cost of the inclusionary units is generally passed on to
the property owner selling his land for housing rather than to the price or rental rate of the
housing units. In other words, the price that the property owner is offered for his land is
already lower because of the developer's additional costs for the BMR program. A survey of
residential building permit activity of local jurisdictions in San Mateo County showed no
nexus between the number of building permits issued after the adoption of an inclusionary
program as compared to before adoption of such a policy. Finally, the City surveyed its
inclusionary requirements compared to the rest of the cities in San Mateo County. In
November 2008 the City Council approved an increase in its affordable housing
requirement from 10% to 15% for projects that include 11 of more residential units. This
was found to be very comparable to neighboring cities. A survey revealed that 3 cities in
addition to San Mateo had a 10% requirement option, 7 cities had 15%, and six jurisdictions
had 20%.
Developers are given the option of utilizing the Density Bonus program that provides up to
a 35% increase in units in exchange for additional affordable units in the BMR program plus
1 to 3 development concessions depending on the level of affordability of the housing
units provided. The City also revised its BMR requirements to include more flexibility in the
size and amenities of the affordable units in order to help offset some of the costs to the
developer.
The City does not believe that the BMR program has increased housing costs to the
consumer. Ultimately the developer will charge market rate rents and sales prices on the
unrestricted units regardless of the development costs. Although the BMR program does
impact the developer’s profit, it is difficult to determine at what point those impacts are
great enough to discourage moving forward or decreasing the number of units on a site.
Generally the cost of land has the most impact on those decisions.
                                                                                 65

  City of San Mateo 2014 Housing Element
In summary, the City has considered the pros and cons of providing affordable housing
through the City’s BMR program and has determined that the benefits far outweigh the
costs, especially since developers are afforded incentives to mitigate the costs.
Processing, Permits, and Fees
The development application and environmental review process necessary to obtain a
building permit can significantly affect the cost of a project, both in processing fees and
time. The review process in San Mateo has been structured to minimize delay, while
providing opportunities for public input. The City adopted a pre-application planning
process for applicants to hold meetings with neighborhood residents and the Planning
Commission (large developments over 21 units) to allow for early input into the design of a
project before submitting a formal planning application for public review. While this
process adds additional time in the early stages of a development, the applicant obtains
public comments and direction from the Planning Commission which helps expedite the
formal planning approval process. The City of San Mateo has established timing goals for
the processing of formal planning application development projects. When a developer
has submitted all materials and a project is determined to be complete, the following
processing goals have been established: 24 calendar days for Zoning Administrator
decisions: 40 calendar days for Planning Commission decisions for projects that are exempt
from CEQA; 60 calendar days for projects requiring Negative Declarations; and 90 calendar
days for projects requiring approval by the City Council. Since 2006, City staff has met these
processing goals 100 percent of the time for Planning Commission and City Council
hearings, and an average of 90 percent for Zoning Administrator decisions. In addition,
multifamily developments less than 6 units can be approved by the Zoning Administrator
without the need for a Planning Commission public hearing.

During the discretionary review process, the final approval body determines the action on
development proposals by making the appropriate findings. These findings are based
primarily on conformance to the City’s General Plan and Municipal Code, and
environmental review is based on the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Typical
City of San Mateo findings by permit type for residential uses are listed below. If a
development proposal meets the required findings for approval, the City’s Municipal Code
directs that the project shall be approved. It should be noted that all projects need to meet
the outlined findings below. Projects that include affordable units, whether the project has
just one unit or is a 100% affordable units, are treated the same as projects that have no
affordable units.
Single Family Dwelling Design Review (SFDDR)
Applies to all new single family dwelling applications:
1. The structures, site plan, and landscaping are consistent with the adopted R1 Single
    Family Dwelling Design Guidelines;
2. The development will not be detrimental to the harmonious and orderly growth of the
    City;
3. The development will not impair the desirability of investment or occupation in the
    vicinity, and otherwise is in the best interest of the public health, safety, or welfare;
4. The development meets all applicable standards as adopted by the Planning
    Commission and City Council, conforms with the General Plan, and will correct any
    violations of the zoning ordinance, building code, or other municipal codes that exist
    on the site; and,
5. The development will not adversely affect matters regarding police protection, crime
    prevention, and security.
Site Plan and Architectural Review (SPAR)
Applies to any new building or subdivision including multiple buildings except for single
family dwellings:
1. The structures, site plan, and landscaping are in scale and harmonious with the
    character of the neighborhood;
2. The development will not be detrimental to the harmonious and orderly growth of the
    City;
3. The development will not impair the desirability of investment or occupation in the
    vicinity, and otherwise is in the best interest of the public health, safety, or welfare;
4. The development meets all applicable standards as adopted by the Planning
    Commission and City Council, conforms with the General Plan, and will correct any
    violations of the zoning ordinance, building code, or other municipal codes that exist
    on the site; and
5. The development will not adversely affect matters regarding police protection, crime
    prevention, and security.

Tentative Subdivision and Parcel Maps
Applies to all residential projects with a required tentative map:
1. That the proposed map is consistent with applicable general and specific plans;
2. That the design or improvement of the proposed subdivision is consistent with
     applicable general and specific plans;
3. That the site is physically suitable for the type of development;
4. That the site is physically suitable for the proposed density of development;
5. That the design of the subdivision or the proposed improvements are not likely to cause
     substantial environmental damage or substantially and avoidably injure fish or wildlife
     or their habitat;
6. That the design of the subdivision or type of improvements is not likely to cause serious
     public health problems;
7. That the design of the subdivision or the type of improvements will not conflict with
     easements, acquired by the public at large, for access through or use of, property
     within the proposed subdivision.
Planned Development (Special Permit)
Applies to residential projects to allow reduced setbacks, reduced parking standards, and
increased floor area:
1. The granting of the permit will not adversely affect the general health, safety, and/or
     welfare of the community, and that the use will not cause injury or disturbance to
     adjacent property by traffic or by excessive noise, smoke, dust, odor or noxious gas,
     glare, heat or fumes, or industrial waste.
The City has also adopted design guidelines for single family, duplex, and multifamily
dwellings. These guidelines provide criteria for key building components, characteristics,
scale, and neighborhood character for applicants to consider when submitting plans.
Compliance to the guidelines increases a projects chance of receiving approval, and may
decrease the amount of overall application processing time.
Permit processing fees are established by City Council resolution and are intended to
reimburse the City for actual administrative costs. Fees are imposed by the Planning,
Building and Public Works Departments. Also, the Developers Contribution Policy, adopted
in 1979, requires a builder to pay for all infrastructure and public improvements directly
associated with the proposed development and a proportionate share of all citywide
programs affected by the development. San Mateo has adopted fees to carry out this
policy. The most common development fees in San Mateo are for expansion of the
wastewater treatment plant, transportation improvement fees, and the park in-lieu fee.
In 2013, The 21 Elements group’s consultant surveyed the 21 jurisdictions of San Mateo
County to learn more about the fees involved in a multi-family subdivision development
        68

                                                 City of San Mateo 2014 Housing Element
application. 21 Elements compared the development and impact fees of four comparable
cities within the county (specifically, Burlingame, Daly City, San Mateo and Redwood City)
for a hypothetical 96-unit building that would require a zoning change, Planned
Development Permit, and Tentative Map. In San Mateo, a typical 96-unit multi-family
project pays approximately $1,042 per unit in Entitlement & CEQA fees and approximately
$8,766 per unit in Construction Plan Check and Building Permit fees for a total of $9,808
per unit. This compares to a range of $9,808 to $30,386, with an average of $18,380.
The Development Impact fees for the hypothetical project include $868 per unit for
expansion of the wastewater treatment plan, $2,184 for Sewer Capacity fee, $2,101 for
transportation improvement fees, and $10,076 for park in lieu fees for a total of $16,409 per
unit. This compares to a range of $5,074 to $16,017 in the four compared cities with an
average of $10,339 per unit.
San Mateo’s total fees are in line with the neighboring cities, which typically represents 2-
4% of the total development costs of new residential development. Although these
represent cost to construct housing, they are in line with other local communities and are
not considered such magnitude to inhibit development based on other development costs.
Single Family and Multi-family Development
The City of San Mateo is a mostly built out community. The majority of new development
will consist primarily of infill, reuse, or redevelopment. Available land to construct a large
scale single family development is scarce. Planning application and permit processing for
single family and multi-family developments are somewhat comparable in the City of San
Mateo. As previously stated, planning application processing charges are intended to
reimburse the City for actual administrative costs and applicants are billed for staff time and
resources regardless of the type of application submitted to the City. In addition, the City
processes all requested development approvals (subdivision maps, site plan and
architectural review, environmental documents, etc.) concurrently, which provides for
consistency among different application types and reduces the overall public review
processing time.
If there was enough land for a large single family development, it is estimated that a 100-
unit multi-family development could cost less in City charges and fees, but may take longer
to process than a 100-unit single-family subdivision. Many City fees are based on building
valuation and/or land value. Given minimum lot sizes for residential development, it is
anticipated that land value would be higher per square foot for a single-family dwelling
than a comparable multi-family unit. In addition, the single family structures would tend to
be larger in size and therefore have higher building valuation costs that increase City fees.
Traffic impact fees are higher for single family dwellings, and the larger land area
requirements would increase the potential for grading and tree removal processing fees. A
multi-family development may take longer to complete the planning and building permit
process due to design review issues related to larger building forms, and impacts on
adjacent neighborhoods. In addition, the plan checking process for code compliance may
be more extensive and time consuming with a large multi-family development.
                                                                               69

  City of San Mateo 2014 Housing Element
The City has compiled a series of responses to the constraints questionnaire posed by the
Association of Bay Area Governments. This questionnaire provides guidance to local
jurisdictions on what issues should be addressed in the constraints analysis.
 Do the land use designations allow for a range of housing types?
     The City allows for a wide range of housing types from single family dwellings (approx.
     4 – 8.7 units/acre) single family dwellings to high density residential (50 – 75 dwelling
     units per acre.) In addition, the City allows for secondary units on lots zoned residential
     as a permitted use. There are also special standards to allow increased density for senior
     citizen housing units.
     The City also adopted provisions to allow emergency shelters within existing churches.
     This was done to accommodate a program coordinated by local churches. Emergency
     shelters are also permitted uses in Regional/ Community Commercial land use areas.
     Specific plans for larger areas have also allowed for a broadening of housing types. The
     Bay Meadows Specific Plans, adopted in 1997 and 2005, allow for live-work units,
     standard lot single-family dwelling units, small lot single-family dwellings, townhouse
     units, multi-family residential units and secondary units.
 Are there enough land use and density categories and do they match well with the
     local need for housing?
     The range of housing types, from single-family detached dwellings to high-density
     multi-family allows for a wide range of housing types. San Mateo's housing stock has
     historically been dominated by single-family dwellings, but this is changing. Vacant
     land for new single-family development has become very limited, and redevelopment
     of sites for multi-family housing at higher densities has increased. The trend towards
     multi-family housing also reflects the declining size of households and the high costs of
     single-family homes. Special provisions for emergency shelters, senior citizen housing
     and secondary units broaden the types of housing permitted in the City.
 Do growth limitations unduly restrict housing development?
     There are no adopted growth management policies in the City of San Mateo.
 Do zoning and subdivision requirements match the best possible use of particular sites
     or areas?
     There are areas around CalTrain stations have potential for mixed use development.
     The San Mateo Rail Corridor Transit-Oriented Development Plan established TOD zones
     in the vicinity of the Hayward Park and Hillsdale CalTrain Stations. The Plan provides for
     mixed use development at the highest residential densities and building heights near
     the train stations to encourage lively, transit oriented, and pedestrian friendly places.
 Have local constraints on the supply of new housing forced up prices on existing
     housing?
     The local constraints on the supply of housing have added marginally to the price
     increases on existing housing. The main difficulty has been the staggering demand for
         70

                                              City of San Mateo 2014 Housing Element
  housing, far beyond what jurisdictions can produce or encourage in development.
  Large influxes of workers in the high tech industries – with significant available capital –
  have “bid up” the cost of housing so that many people cannot afford to live here.
 Do project mitigations result in housing being built at less than the allowed site
  capacity?
  San Mateo does not include mitigation measures that reduce the achievable density of
  residential projects. Mitigation measures normally are associated with design details of
  a project, construction activities and the design of public improvements. It should be
  noted that the densities for multifamily zoning districts are expressed as a range; it is
  more likely that site capacity will be maximized with larger sites, and through requests
  by developers for density bonuses.
 Do high fees or other exactions result in high-end, rather than lower-cost, housing
  being constructed?
  Local fees and exactions have added marginally to the cost of housing. The primary
  problem is the cost of land and construction. See the discussion on non-governmental
  constraints below.
 Are open space requirements compatible with standards used in other communities?
  The City of San Mateo Zoning Code does not include open space requirements in all of
  its residential zoning districts. The sole citywide district, R3 (Medium Density), which
  requires the provision of open space, allows for both private and common open space
  to be used in the fulfillment of this requirement. This allows for a great deal of flexibility
  on the part of the design team in the design of open space areas. Both passive and
  active open space areas are also counted towards this requirement. Downtown
  residential zoning districts also require the provision of open space. However, similar to
  the R3 district, this requirement can be met through the provision of both private and
  common open space. The provision of adequate open space is insured by
  implementation of the City’s multi family dwelling design guidelines, which includes a
  guideline calling for the provision of open space to “…accommodate the needs of the
  residents.” This allows for flexibility on the part of the designer to provide open space
  while at the same time meeting other project goals, such as the provision of housing
  units.
 Do zoning and land use laws pose illegal barriers to any of the populations protected
  by the fair housing laws, such as families with children, minority groups, low- and very
  low-income families, or individuals with disabilities?
  Cities can assist in the housing of the disabled by permitting residential care facilities.
  San Mateo allows care facilities serving six or fewer persons in all residential districts and
  permits facilities serving seven or more persons in multi-family and commercial districts.
  For the disabled, the City's Building Inspection Division enforces state and federal
  disabled housing requirements. The City funds a disabled accessibility program to
  enable newly disabled persons to remain in their homes. Most senior units are also
  specifically designed to serve the disabled.
                                                                              71

  City of San Mateo 2014 Housing Element
 Do the parking requirements accurately reflect the parking need? For example, the
     demand for parking in multifamily housing may be lower due to income, or proximity
     to transit, shopping or work.
     San Mateo’s residential parking requirements are generally consistent with rates
     published by the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE) publication “Parking Generation”. In
     addition, field studies are done to verify the appropriateness of City parking
     requirements for specialized types of housing, such as senior residential care. Reduced
     parking requirements in conjunction with the development of transit-oriented
     development have been approved in the San Mateo Rail Corridor Transit-Oriented
     Development Plan.
 Does parking have to be enclosed? Covered? Decked?
     Single-family dwellings require provision of a two car enclosed garage, although
     nonconforming dwellings may be added to without providing an additional parking
     space. In multi-family developments, at least one parking space per unit must be
     covered.
 Do parking standards for mixed-use impose an impediment or incentive for housing?
     Generally, the parking requirement for mixed-use projects must be met for each
     individual use, which may contribute to a development impediment based on the high
     cost of providing parking. However, within the Rail Corridor, the parking requirements
     are more flexible in that reduced and shared parking standards are allowed which may
     provide an incentive for housing. In 2008, the Planning Commission approved mixed-
     use residential and commercial projects within the Rail Corridor with either reduced or
     shared parking standards.
Constraints on the Development, Maintenance and Improvement of Housing
On January 1, 2002, a new law became effective that requires local jurisdictions to include,
in the analysis of governmental constraints, a discussion of the potential and actual
constraints upon the development, maintenance and improvement of housing for persons
with disabilities, and demonstrate local efforts to remove governmental constraints that
hinder the locality from meeting the need for persons with disabilities (Section 65583(a)(4)).
In addition, the jurisdiction must include programs that remove constraints or provide
reasonable accommodations for housing designed for persons with disabilities (Section
65583(c)(3)).
The State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) prepared a report
highlighting some of the many implementation issues associated with the passage of this
law, SB 520. In addition to clarifying the State’s intent on reasonable accommodation, SB
520 requires that jurisdictions who find such constraints must include programs to remove
them, or provide reasonable accommodations for housing designed for occupancy by
persons with disabilities (as opposed to persons with disabilities themselves). According to
this report:
        72

                                                         City of San Mateo 2014 Housing Element
     Housing designed for occupancy by, or with supportive services for persons with disabilities includes
     a wide range of housing types. For example, housing that is physically accessible to people with
     mobility impairments, residential care facilities for individuals with disabilities or for the elderly, group
     homes, housing for individuals with Alzheimer’s, housing for persons with AIDS/HIV, housing with
     support services and transitional housing that serve homeless with disabilities are within the
     meaning of “housing designed for occupancy by, or with supportive services for, persons with
     disabilities.”
If constraints are found, the rule of thumb is that the jurisdiction must remove them.
However, in some cases the greater public good, as deemed by the jurisdiction, may
warrant not removing the constraint. In these instances, the jurisdiction must provide a
reasonable accommodation process for the housing for persons with disabilities, as defined
above. In other words, the jurisdiction must create a process to allow developers or
operators of housing for people with disabilities to make a claim for relief from whatever
constraints exist.
As part of the Countywide Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing Choice, the City
conducted an analysis of constraints to housing for persons with disabilities that bears
relevance to this Housing Element. The AI examines policies and practices that may limit
residents’ ability to choose housing in an environment free from discrimination. San Mateo
County, together with Daly City, Redwood City, San Mateo, and South San Francisco
funded the AI.
The US Department of Housing and Urban Development requires entitlement jurisdictions
to develop action plans to overcome the effects of identified impediments to fair housing
choice. Therefore, the Analysis of Impediments is the necessary first step in the Fair Housing
Planning process. HUD wants entitlement jurisdictions to become fully aware of the
existence, nature, extent, and causes of all fair housing problems and resources available to
solve them.
City strategies and policies to preserve and develop affordable housing were reviewed to
assess the extent to which they address affordability issues in the community, mitigate the
housing problems of major groups in need, and meet the RHNA housing development
targets. According to the AI, of affordable housing has most direct impact on low-income
residents disproportionately represented by ethnic minorities, persons with disabilities, large
families with children, and other groups protected by fair housing laws.
According to the AI, one of the most powerful tools available to increase the supply of
affordable housing is inclusionary zoning policy. Within the county, some cities have
effective inclusionary zoning ordinances that apply citywide with a wide scope of
application. The City has an effective inclusionary zoning ordinance that generates
significant numbers of BMR units each year. However, the AI found that new housing
construction has been unbalanced. While the 1999-2006 RHNA targets for above
moderate income housing were surpassed, lower income housing production was less
successful. The AI found that the City could reduce the shortfall by increasing the
percentage of BMR units required under its inclusionary zoning ordinance or by requiring
an in-lieu fee for smaller projects. The City increased the BMR requirement so that a greater
                                                                                                    73

  City of San Mateo 2014 Housing Element
balance may be achieved in the future. The current BMR requirement applies to
developments consisting of 11 or more units:
     • 15% of ownership units will be affordable to moderate income families, or
     • 10% of ownership units will be affordable to low income families.
     • 15% of rental units will be affordable to low income families, or
     • 10% of rental units will be affordable to very low income families.
Land Use and Zoning
Public policy is a major factor driving the City’s housing environment. Often employed as a
tool to prevent change and maintain a majority population’s concept of “neighborhood
value,” restrictive practices can pose significant impediments to fair housing choice,
sometimes in violation of federal or state law. On the other hand, used constructively,
elements of zoning and land use policy can be major tools in efforts to provide affordable
housing and remove impediments to fair housing choice for lower income residents,
groups protected under Federal and State Fair Housing laws, and others.
The City’s definition of family in the zoning code is consistent with fair housing laws.
Specifically, the code states in 27.04.195, “Family" means a person or a group of persons
living together and maintaining a common household. (Ord. 1981-27 § 10, 1981; Ord.
1978-18 § 24 (part), 1978: prior code § 142.01(65)). In other words, persons living
together, regardless of marital or blood affiliation, are, for the purposes of City laws and
regulations, considered a “family” and therefore are not discriminated against. For
example, this means that residential care facilities (sometimes referred to as “group homes”)
with six or fewer persons are treated as a family, regardless of actual affiliation.
Consistent with State requirements, the City has established standards for the location of
residential care facilities. These are essentially divided into two categories: those serving six
or fewer residents, and those with more than six. For those with six or fewer residents, the
City complies with State law pertaining to group homes, treating such facilities as traditional
single family residences. The State allows a 300’ limit between such facilities to ensure there
is no overconcentration of such developments within the community.
When the proposed use meets the requirements of the City’s residential use criteria,
residential care facilities serving 7 or more residents in addition to the caregiver may be
permitted by approval of a special use permit and a site plan and architectural review by
the Planning Commission in any zoning district that permits multiple family dwellings.
There cannot be other residential care facilities of any size within 500 radial feet of the
perimeter of the proposed facility, such as licensing and density requirements.
Reasonable Accommodation Policy and Ancillary Accessibility Issues
San Mateo codified a formal reasonable accommodation process in June 2014, which
further supports the City’s effort to provide assistance to housing for people with disabilities.
The City currently does this in a number of significant ways. Through both the Community
Funding and Housing Repair programs, grants are provided to assist in home
        74

                                                City of San Mateo 2014 Housing Element
modifications, such as installation of ramps, grab bars, assistive devices in bathrooms, etc.,
enabling disabled residents to live independently at home. The City also provides
Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funding for ongoing sidewalk infrastructure
improvements, such as curb cuts and expansion that allow full accessibility for all residents
in their neighborhood. The City completed ADA accessibility upgrades to all City owned
facilities in addition to providing rehabilitation and other capital improvement loans and
grants to nonprofit organizations for the purpose of making accessibility upgrades to their
affordable housing, emergency shelters, and other residential programs.
NON-GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
Nongovernmental constraints include a variety of factors that negatively impact "the
maintenance, improvement, or development of housing for all income levels, including the
availability of financing, the price of land, and the cost of construction" {65583(a)(5)}.
Clearly, the potential list of all constraints on the development could be quite long, and
might include information on national economic conditions and regional geology.
However, this analysis this Housing Element will focus on non-governmental constraints
that the City may be able to positively impact.
Financing Availability
The availability of financing can sometimes constrain the development or conservation of
housing. Until the end of 2008, home mortgage credit has was readily available at
attractive rates throughout the US The beneficial effects of lower mortgage interest rates on
homeownership affordability are profound. For example, with mortgage interest rates at
10%, and assuming a 15% down payment, a family with an annual income of $60,000 can
qualify to purchase a $166,000 home. With interest rates at 8%, the same household with
the same $60,000 income qualifies to purchase a $198,000 home. Were interest rates to
fall to 6%, the same household could qualify for a $242,000 home.
Mortgage interest rates clearly have an influence on homebuyers, especially at the lower
incomes. Despite recent substantial cuts in the prime lending rate by the Federal Reserve
Board, mortgage rates have generally not seen a concomitant drop. Nonetheless,
mortgage rates have general declined since the early 1990s, during which time the rates
were as high as 10% to 12%.
A related issue is the financing available for the construction of new housing development.
According to the Statewide Housing Plan, land developers purchase raw land, entitle and
subdivide it, and, sometimes, depending on the developer and market, install on-site
services (e.g., streets, sewers, drainage) and pay for off-site improvements. These activities
are generally carried out two to five years ahead of unit construction. The long lead times
and high costs associated with these activities create a considerable risk for the developer.
The State notes that the high levels of risk associated with land development make it
difficult for land developers to find investors and financing. As a result, potential land
                                                                                75
  City of San Mateo 2014 Housing Element
investors typically require large premiums over and above other types of real estate
investments. Lenders who make land development loans impose lower loan-to-value-ratios,
charge higher rates, and/or require the loan to be a recourse loan. If other, lower-risk
lending opportunities are available, lenders may eschew land development loans
altogether.
Construction loans for new housing are difficult to secure in the current market. In past
years, lenders would provide up to 80 percent of the cost of new construction (loan to
value ratio). In recent years, due to market conditions and government regulations, banks
require larger investments by the builder.
Due to Federal and state budget cuts, affordable housing developers have had a much
harder time securing funding. Since 2009, the Federal Government has cut programs such
as Community Development Block Grants, HOME, and HOPE VI funding by 27-50 percent
(ABAG). Traditionally, these programs have been a large source of affordable housing
funds. In addition to Federal cuts, the State dissolved Redevelopment agencies in 2012,
leaving San Mateo County with a loss of $25.5 million in funds for affordable housing.
However, Low Income Housing Tax Credits still provide an important source of funding, so
it is important for jurisdictions to consider which sites are eligible for affordable housing
development. MidPen Housing has agreed to help jurisdictions identify appropriate sites.
Today, the economic condition in the country is still difficult, and financing for any
development is challenging. The foreclosure crisis has also hit the Bay Area, some areas
more than others. At the end of 2008, there were about 60 units in pre-foreclosure,
foreclosure, or in auctions in the City of San Mateo, out of a total 39,168 units, or 0.1 %. In
contrast, in the City of Antioch in Contra Costa County – with a total of 33,936 units –
almost 870 were somewhere in the foreclosure process (2.5%). Although home
affordability has been improving as a result of the increasing numbers of foreclosures on
the market, building permits, starts and sales continue to decline because prospective
homebuyers either lack access to credit or the confidence to buy. According to industry
experts, the recent drop in 30-year fixed mortgage rates to near 5% will cushion the decline
in housing but is not enough to stop it. That will take an end to declining home prices and
much improved confidence about income security. Neither is likely in the next few months.
The data in the table below is from the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) and
represents loan applications in 2012 for of one- to four-unit properties, as well as
manufactured homes. More than 65 percent of the loan applications were filed by
households earning above a moderate income (greater than 120 percent of AMI).
Moderate income households (80-120 percent of AMI) represented 18 percent of loan
applicants, low income households (50-80 percent of AMI) represent 12 percent, and very
low income households (less than 50 percent of AMI) only 4 percent. Almost 75 percent of
all loans were approved and accepted by the applicants, and 10 percent were denied.
Above moderate-income households had the highest rates of approval of any group.
Loan approval rates have improved since the subprime crisis.

Construction and Land Costs
Land costs in San Mateo County are high, due in part to the desirability of housing in the
county, and because available land is in short supply. These costs vary both between and
within jurisdictions based on factors like the desirability of the location and the permitted
density.
The following land costs are approximate, and derived from conversations with local
developers. For a typical multi-family construction in San Mateo County, land costs add
approximately $90,000 per unit. Land for a single-family home often costs $400,000 or
more per lot.
Construction costs include both hard costs, such as labor and materials, and soft costs, such
as architectural and engineering services, development fees and insurance. For multi-family
homes in San Mateo County, hard costs account of 60-65 percent of the building cost and
soft costs average around 15-20 percent (the remaining 15-20 percent is land costs). For
single family homes, hard costs often are roughly 40 percent of the total cost, soft costs are
20 percent, and land is 40 percent.
According to housing developers in San Mateo County, construction costs for multi-unit
buildings vary based on the form of parking (structured vs. surface) in addition to other
environmental factors such as topography, pre-existing structures etc. For a larger, multi-
unit building, costs can vary from $185,000/unit to as high as $316,000/unit. The cost per
square foot ranges from $172-$200.
For the least expensive production single-family homes, the cost of preparing the vacant
land is around $100,000/lot, and the cost of construction is approximately $145/sf. For
more expensive, custom homes, however, the construction costs can be higher than
$435/sf. In general, soft costs add another approximate third to the subtotal.
An affordable housing project recently completed in the City of San Mateo illustrates the
actual construction costs that are typical in San Mateo. The 60 unit apartment building is 4
stories wood frame construction over an at-grade parking podium. The development costs
including land totaled $26.5 million. This includes $275,000 per unit for hard construction
costs, $115,000 per unit for soft costs, and $51,000 for land for a total of $441,000 per unit.
In square footage terms this equates to about $365 per square foot for total development
                                                                                               77

costs.
Other Non-Governmental Constraints
NIMBYism
An additional significant constraint to the development of housing is created by the “Not In
My Backyard” or NIMBY syndrome in which individual and community-wide fears surface
regarding perceived decreases in property values, deterioration of service levels, fiscal
impacts, environmental degradation, or public health and safety issues. Although has been
generally true of affordable housing developments, there are also increasing concerns with
market rate housing as well. As neighborhoods become built out, any new or increased
density housing may be a perceived threat to the existing residents’ quality of life in terms of
traffic patterns, level of services provided, and community amenities. However, city officials
and developers can work to assuage these concerns by requiring design review,
emphasizing management of new developments, and engaging in public education to
address myths about high density/low-income/supportive housing (HCD). Some cities,
such as Redwood City, have had success by developing clear, explicit requirements during
a thorough public planning process and then providing more certainty to developers.
Construction Defect Litigation
The threat of lawsuits over real or imagined construction defects deters the building of
condominiums and townhouses because they are managed by homeowners associations
that may be more willing to sue developers than individual homeowners typically are. Thus,
according to this argument, California is deprived of badly needed owner-occupied,
affordable, high-density and in-fill housing. 5
Downpayment/Move-In Costs
The ability to accumulate enough funds for a downpayment remains a significant obstacle
to many potential homebuyers. Lower-income homebuyers may have a difficult time
transitioning from the rental housing market to homeownership because of the difficulty in
accumulating the required downpayment, which can be as much as 20-25% -- or more --
of the sales price. Prior to the subprime mortgage market and credit meltdowns, it was
possible for prospective homeowners to buy houses and condos with no money down, in
many cases In the same way, lower-income households may not be able to find
appropriate housing because they cannot accrue the security deposits as well as first and
last month’s rent.
Voter Initiative – Measure P
Measure P, a reauthorization of Measure H which was originally approved by the voters in
1991, was approved by voter initiative in 2004 with the expressed purpose of maintaining
“the San Mateo General Plan so as to preserve the livability and suburban character of the
         5

November 1999.

City of San Mateo by essentially maintaining height limits and densities established by San
Mateo voters in 1991, while providing for the level of economic growth projected in the
San Mateo General Plan and increasing the city’s commitment to providing its fair share of
affordable housing.” The Measure P language is included in the city’s General Plan, and
cannot be modified, revised or updated without voter approval. In general, Measure P
permits residential development at a range of densities from 9 to 50 units net per acre, with
the higher end of the density range to be used only for projects which provide substantial
public benefits. Residential development is also allowed in commercial districts. Measure P
also includes a requirement for inclusionary housing which are administered by the city’s
Below Market Rate housing program.
While Measure P serves to maintain building height limits, floor area ratios, and density
ranges in San Mateo, it has not precluded residential development. Since 2004, the
majority of development in San Mateo continues to focus along the San Mateo Rail
Corridor as evidenced with the 18-block Bay Meadows Phase II development that will
include over 1,000 residential units at total full build out, a 60-unit affordable housing
development at 1990 S. Delaware Street (former Police Station site), and a 68-unit
affordable Transit Oriented Development project at 2901 S. El Camino Real called
“Peninsula Station”. Measure P allows for flexibility in development design while providing
opportunity for developers to provide additional affordable units or the ability to provide
housing affordable to those in the very, low-income economic group.
Anecdotally, developers believe Measure P inhibits their ability to provide more housing.
There are a variety of conditions which may affect the production of housing, as such it is
unclear to what degree Measure P has, or has not, impacted the development of housing,
especially affordable housing. However, the city continues to experience a high level of
entitlement requests for residential development.

I.       PRESERVATION OF UNITS AT RISK OF CONVERSION
         TO MARKET RATE
INVENTORY
There are two projects at risk of conversion to market rate within the new planning period.
The earliest project that will see affordability restrictions expire is the Lesley Towers Project,
owned by Lesley Senior Communities and built in 1965. The 200-unit development is in
nonprofit ownership, and was financed under the HUD Section 202 Program for seniors.
Its restrictions will expire in 2015, however the owner is in the process of refinancing the
project with HUD and the assistance of Section 8 rental assistance which will renew the
affordability covenants for another 40 years.
The other project is Humboldt House, consisting of 9 units of supportive housing and
owned by Mateo Lodge. The rent restriction expires in 2020 but has provisions to renew
for an additional 20 years at the City’s discretion.
COST ANALYSIS OF PRESERVING “AT-RISK” PROJECTS
Given the housing market in San Mateo County, recent significant increases in rental rates,
and owners foreclosed throughout the Bay Area looking for rental housing, conversion to
market rates is likely to be an attractive option for owners of at-risk properties.
The cost of producing an affordable unit to replace a lost unit is extremely high.
Development costs are estimated at $350,000 to $450,000 a unit, depending on land costs.
Typically, the City’s cost to subsidize existing affordable units is $60,000 - $100,000 per unit.
Preservation of at risk units can be accomplished in several ways, including acquisition of
the property by qualified nonprofit housing corporations, local housing authorities, or other
organizations that are committed to long-term affordable housing. As part of the financing
of this type of acquisition, long-term regulatory restrictions are recorded against the
property, removing the risk of conversion.
AVAILABLE RESOURCES FOR PRESERVATION
The City will actively work with HUD, the owner, and other interested parties to extend
affordability restrictions to preserve the affordability, utilizing state or federal programs for
any units that are at risk of conversion to market rate in the future. If the project requires
financial assistance from the City, resources include Redevelopment Agency Housing
Successor funds, and HOME funds. Priority of City resources will be given to preserve at risk
units if need be.

QUANTIFIED OBJECTIVES FOR AFFORDABLE “AT-RISK” UNITS
Over the next 10 years the Quantified Objectives to preserve existing affordable units is 209
very low income units.
Both of the projects with potential expiring affordability restrictions are owned and
operated by non-profit organizations who are highly motivated to keep the rents
affordable for their clients. Based on the particular situations it is extremely likely that the
affordability restrictions will be extended. City staff will track these projects over the next
few years, and offer assistance should the agencies require refinancing in order to preserve
the units. In the unlikely event the Lesley Senior Communities would sell the complex, they
are required to send Notices of Intent to Prepay to the City and other qualified entities in
the area who are skilled and motivated to acquire properties to ensure ongoing
affordability. A number of qualified agencies are listed below..

J.       DESCRIPTION OF HOUSING PROGRAMS
For this section, the State is looking for a description of the myriad ways a jurisdiction can
address housing concerns in the community, both from a land use and from a
programmatic standpoint. Many of these programs are designed primarily to address
affordability issues, as the cost of housing is a significant impediment to homeowners and
renters alike.
Many of these programs have already been mentioned, including in the inventory of land
for housing (section F). Other programs are found in the section on new goals, policies
and programs below (section I). This section will discuss some of the ways the City assists in
the development of housing, especially that which is affordable, through financial and
other kinds of assistance
There are a number of resources available to the City to implement its housing and
community development objectives. Housing projects, in particular, typically require a
combination of resources and partnerships.
FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)
The City of San Mateo has been an active participant in the CDBG program for over 35
years. HUD awards this flexible grant program to jurisdictions through a statutory formula
that uses measurements of need. CDBG funds can be used to assist low and moderate
income persons in the form of social services activities, housing rehabilitation, economic
development, neighborhood revitalization, improvement of public facilities, and prevention
and elimination of slums and blight. The City’s entitlement grant has decreased an average
of about 16% over the last five years. It is anticipated that the CDBG grant will continue to
remain the same or decrease further; therefore, the City is budgeting a conservative 2%
decrease annually over the next five years.
HOME Investment Partnership Program
The HOME program is a federal grant to participating jurisdictions determined by formula
allocations. HOME funds are directed toward the housing programs that assist persons
60% of the median income including acquisition, rehabilitation, new construction, tenant
based assistance, homebuyer assistance, planning and supportive services. The City of San
Mateo participates in the program as an individual jurisdiction. A portion of each year's
grant (15%) is set aside for use by non-profit Community Housing Development
Organizations (CHDO). Currently there is one certified CHDO in San Mateo, HIP Housing
Development Corporation (HHDC). The City’s HOME allocation has decreased 50% from
five years ago and it is it is unclear if funding levels will be maintained for this program in
the future..

Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC)
The LIHTC is an incentive for investors to provide equity to develop rental units for
households at 30 - 60% of median income. The program is not a direct federal subsidy, but
rather a tax incentive administered by the Internal Revenue Service. Tax credits were used
to help finance Peninsula Station in 2009 and Delaware Pacific in 2012..
Section 8 Rental Assistance Program
This program is administered by the San Mateo County Housing Authority with multiple
eligibility criteria; a family or a single person who is 62 years or older, disabled or pregnant,
household annual gross income equal to or below the HUD published income limits.
Households who qualify for Federal Preference are considered first and are defined as
persons who are involuntarily displaced, or persons who are paying more than 50% of
household income towards rent.
OTHER PUBLIC FUNDS
State Programs
Over the past five years The City of San Mateo obtained funding from several State
programs such as CalHome Program, the Infill Infrastructure Grant program and
Proposition 1C Housing Related Parks Program funds. Staff keeps a close eye on funding
cycles and new funding opportunities from the State as they are released. Also, housing
developers and housing organizations are eligible to apply for State funds, such as
programs sponsored by California Housing Finance Agency (CalHFA), on a project by
project basis. There are also State Low Income Tax Credits available, which can be used to
assist housing projects.
Participants in First Time Homebuyer Programs often utilized the CalHFA mortgage and
down payment assistance programs as they are available.
Housing Successor Agency for the Redevelopment Agency
As mandated by the state legislature, the Redevelopment Agency (RDA) of the City of San
Mateo was dissolved as of February 1, 2012. As the Housing Successor Agency, the City of
San Mateo is responsible for the management of properties and funds formerly belonging
to the Redevelopment Agency. The City elected to retain the housing assets and housing
functions previously performed by the Agency upon dissolution. A portfolio of loans
previously financed by RDA funds provides some program income to support future
affordable housing. At the time of dissolution the City’s RDA fund balance of approximately
$1.9M was returned to the local taxing agencies. The City elected to retain its portion of the
returned funds in the amount of $706,000 to be reserved for affordable housing. It has also
set a policy to contribute 20% of the annual increase in property tax revenues to be
retained for affordable housing on an ongoing basis.
                                                                                   83

Below Market Rate Program (BMR)
In 1992 an inclusionary zoning ordinance was passed that requires a portion of affordable
units be provided in all complexes sized 11 or more units, both rental and ownership
developments. The program was amended January 1, 2010 to revise the affordability
requirements and provide some flexibility in unit design and location.. For rental projects,
developers have the choice of providing either 10% of units to be affordable to households
up to 50% AMI or provide 15% of the units affordable to households up to 80% AMI. In for-
sale developments, developers can either provided 10% of the units affordable to
households up to 80% AMI or 15% of the units affordable to households up to 120% AMI.
PRIVATE FOR-PROFIT AND NONPROFIT SOURCES
Community Reinvestment Act (CRA)
Several opportunities exist for partnership with local lenders via the Community
Reinvestment Act. This law requires local lenders to analyze the lending needs of the
community in which they do business, particularly the needs of low and moderate-income
persons, and develop programs to address those needs. To date several lenders have
offered favorable terms on first mortgages for the First Time Home Buyer program which
has provided tremendous support to the program. Other lenders have assisted new
construction projects in the form of construction loans and permanent financing. The City
considers this a beneficial resource for future partnerships as well.
Private Developers
In any housing project the City undertakes with private developers, the City attempts to
leverage its resources as much as possible. The City attempts to provide the "gap" financing
that is needed to make a project feasible. Private developers are very interested in
developing housing because of the current high demand and the City continues to work
with them to find ways to include affordability within their projects. With the current
demand for housing, the City sees good opportunities to work with the private sector in
the area of new housing construction over the next eight years.
Non-Profit Agencies
There are several partnership opportunities with non-profit organizations. Foundations and
lender consortiums provide means of financial assistance. Community service organizations
provide housing services and manage housing programs. Non-profit developers produce
new affordable units. To date the majority of new affordable units have been sponsored
by non-profit developers. This trend will most likely continue since the federal programs
strongly encourage the use of non-profit agencies for housing programs.

HEART
The Housing Endowment And Regional Trust (HEART) of San Mateo County is a regional
trust fund for affordable housing in San Mateo County. It has a revolving loan fund to
provide financing for affordable housing developments usually in the form of short term
gap or predevelopment financing. HEART provided short term interim financing for
Peninsula Station in 2009.
Its “Opening Doors” Program provides below market rate second loans as down payment
assistance for home buyers who make up to $150,000 per year. The program is also
structured to eliminate private mortgage insurance which results in lowering the total
monthly housing payment for homebuyers.
As new federal, state and local sources of funds appear, the City will integrate them into its
programs and look for new solutions to meeting the affordable housing needs. It also
continues to aggressively seek other potential financing sources and partnership
opportunities.
INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE
There are several institutions that coordinate to implement the City of San Mateo's
Consolidated Plan:
City of San Mateo
The Neighborhood Improvement and Housing (NIH) Division is the lead public agency for
the development, preservation and improvement of housing in San Mateo. NIH
administers the federal funds received by the City and the Housing Successor Agency's
housing activities. NIH is responsible for many activities and programs such as Minor Home
Repair Program,, the First Time Homebuyer Program, the development of new housing
through developer assistance, site acquisition and rehabilitation, Code Enforcement and
the Community Funding program.
Other City Departments are also involved with the CDBG program because other
Departments typically manage the larger capital projects. For instance, the Public Works
Department manages street and sidewalk repairs and the Parks and Recreation
Department manages improvements to neighborhood parks and recreation centers.
As a leader in the provision of housing, the City of San Mateo is well suited to continue
implementing and expanding the housing and community development programs
identified in this report. The City's housing programs have the support of the City Council
and management staff, as well as the experience to carry out housing plans. Expertise in
ongoing programs such as housing rehabilitation and working with community nonprofits
will result in continuing success for these programs. Staff also has experience in the
intricacies of housing development, from negotiating purchases and selecting and working
                                                                              85

  City of San Mateo 2014 Housing Element
with a developer, to securing short and long term financing. The City is well versed in
taking steps necessary to alleviate neighborhood concerns with development, and in
winning support from the community for its projects. Some limitations the City faces
include the restrictive nature of the uses of federal funds and City budget constraints which
impact the City’s ability to meet the identified needs.
County of San Mateo
The County plays a smaller role in San Mateo than it does in other cities on the Peninsula
because of the City’s eligibility to receive funds directly from the federal government.
However, the City does find it beneficial to collaborate with the County on the more
regional issues such as homelessness and housing. The County contributes to housing
efforts in the City through such programs as its first time homebuyer program and the
financing of nonprofit agencies that provide housing. In addition, the County coordinates
the Continuum of Care Plan, which the City supports with its programming for the
homeless. In certain situations the City and County will both provide funds for a project.
The San Mateo County Housing Authority, a division of the Department of Housing, is
responsible for implementing the federally funded Section 8 Program throughout the
County of San Mateo. A portion of the Housing Authority's rent assistance vouchers and
certificates are placed in the City of San Mateo. There are no public housing facilities in San
Mateo that are operated by the Housing Authority. The Housing Authority operates an
ongoing program in which it has extensive experience, and is therefore very capable of
delivering its housing programs to those in need. Limitations of the Housing Authority
include the lack of development experience and the lack of resources needed to assist all
those who seek its help.
Nonprofit Organizations
Nonprofit organizations play an important role in the provision of affordable housing and
other basic human services to low and moderate income San Mateo residents. The
agencies provide a variety of services in order to meet the changing needs of the diverse
San Mateo population. On a two year funding cycle, the City sets aside funds to provide
grants for housing and other public services.             Nonprofit and other community
organizations submit proposals on both a competitive and invitational basis to obtain these
funds so the number and names of providers change each cycle. The working relationship
established between the City, County and nonprofit agencies ensure the continuation of
valuable housing and other services to low-income residents. The City provides financial
support to these nonprofits through its community funding program.
The majority of nonprofit agencies working in the City of San Mateo can be described as
experts in their field. They are adept fundraisers and project managers and they know the
diverse needs of their clients and the most efficient ways to meet them. They are also very
experienced in working with each other and with other public and private organizations.
There exist grassroots, or community-based organizations, who work within the City that
do not have as extensive experience as nonprofit service providers. The City remains
        86

                                                City of San Mateo 2014 Housing Element
committed to providing as much technical assistance as possible in their efforts to develop
capacity and grow into strong community organizations.
There are several agencies the City works with that have experience developing new
housing. InnVision Shelter Network of San Mateo County has several facilities that house
homeless adults and families throughout the County with First Step for Families and the
Vendome Hotel in the City of San Mateo. Human Investment Project and the Mental
Health Association of San Mateo County have experience with acquisition and
rehabilitation of housing properties as well as strong property management. Many of the
new construction and larger projects in the County are developed by Mid-Peninsula
Housing Corporation, Mercy Housing, as well as other qualified nonprofit developers in the
region.
Private Sector
Private sector organizations involved in providing housing and community development
services include realtors, lenders, architects, developers and contractors. These groups
rarely take a lead role in providing affordable housing, but are crucial in its provision and
development. The private sector's role in the delivery of affordable housing is the same as
for any other client. Banks know what is required to make projects work and how to help
move them forward. Contractors and developers are equally adept in their fields, as are
other members of the business community. Their shortcoming is that they are often
unfamiliar with the needs of lower income persons, or with the limitations of those trying to
provide services for them. Private developers are also involved with building affordable
housing through the requirements of the City’s Redevelopment Agency and Below Market
Rate ordinance.
As illustrated in the identification and description of the City’s institutional structure, the City
of San Mateo is a strong leader and participant in the development and ongoing support
of various programs and initiatives constituting the delivery system. The strengths include
extensive efforts to involve the community in identifying needs and trends, collaborative
efforts with other jurisdictions to address regional issues, and the close working
relationships with and support of the nonprofit sector in their important role in the overall
health and strength of the San Mateo community. Overcoming the experience gaps of
each group requires only cooperation with other agencies or groups who have the
necessary experience. The urban metropolitan statistical area of which San Mateo is a part,
with its multitude of agencies and organizations, is a tremendous asset brimming with
resources for those who need them. It is common for an agency to contact another to
learn how to approach problems they may be facing. Public and private agencies in San
Mateo County have and continue to work well together to combine experience and
resources in order to bring a project to fruition.
Regardless of the strength of the public, private, and nonprofit community collaboration,
the most critical gap beyond each agency’s capability to overcome is the lack of sufficient
funding resources to address the vast needs of all low-income persons.
                                                                                    87

  City of San Mateo 2014 Housing Element
The City of San Mateo has no public housing facilities within its jurisdiction, nor is it involved
in the provision of any public housing.
HOUSING-RELATED PROGRAMS
Minor Home Repair and Paint
The Minor Home Repair and Paint program provides these services free of charge to low-
income homeowners. Owners are entitled to a free exterior paint job and/or minor
exterior repairs or minor, urgent interior repairs. Repairs also include accessibility
modifications and simple energy efficiency improvements. The overwhelming majority of
participants in this program are senior citizens.
Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction
The City developed and implements lead-based paint regulations in accordance with HUD
Guidelines.
First Time Home Buyers Program
The City has two primary strategies to address the need for affordable homeownership in
San Mateo. The first strategy continues to be the City’s project based first time buyer
program.      This program provides first time buyers the opportunity to purchase
condominiums as they become available for resale at two City sponsored complexes. This
project-based approach is also augmented by new ownership units that either the City
builds or private developers build in compliance with the City’s Below Market Rate Program.
Section 8 Rental Assistance
The San Mateo Housing Authority manages the Section 8 rental assistance program.
Nearly 700 San Mateo residents are assisted annually through individual vouchers and
selected housing that distributes assistance more confidentially throughout neighborhoods.
Acquisition of Land
The City is always looking for opportunities to purchase land to assist the development of
housing. This includes land banking for the development of owner and rental housing,
senior and family housing, transit-oriented housing and mixed-use developments.
Acquisition and Rehabilitation of Existing Housing
The City also partners with nonprofit organizations to purchase and rehabilitate existing
housing and make it more affordable. As funds are available, the City will consider
purchasing multi-family complexes and/or single-family homes to make available for rental
housing. This helps preserve the existing housing stock by ensuring adequate property
management standards and adds to the City’s affordable housing stock. The City typically
funds these types of projects with HOME and RDA Housing Successor funds.

addition, the City will consider purchase of individual condominium units in private
developments, as funds are available. These units would be included in the existing First
Time Homebuyer Program and sold to moderate-income households with the same loan
terms and resale price restrictions.
Below Market Rate Program
Created by City ordinance, this program requires developers of new housing projects with
more than 10 units to develop 10%-15% of units with housing price restrictions. These
units, either rental or ownership, will have deed restrictions that make them permanently
affordable. Ownership units are required to be affordable to households at or below 120%
median income and rentals are required to be affordable to households at or below 80%
median income. The City does not provide any financing to the buyers. NIH coordinates
the marketing, sales, and program monitoring of the units through its First Time Buyer
program.
Community Housing Development Organizations (CHDO)
The City will coordinate with HIP Housing Development Corp. (HHDC) or any other
qualified CHDO to apply the annual increment of HOME funds that are channeled directly
to CHDOs. The HOME funds will be used to assist persons who make less than 60% of the
median income. For the last several years, the City was granted a specific request to waive
the requirement for CHDO set-aside, based on the high percentage of completed CHDO
projects in prior years.
New Construction
Although the financial crisis starting in 2008 has had significant impact on available funding
sources, the City sees the potential for more partnership opportunities to develop new
housing with both for-profit and nonprofit developers, mostly due to the wide array of
financing tools currently available. Developers have become far more knowledgeable
about how to apply for and combine the various government program funds and
available private funding to build affordable housing.
Secondary Units
The City's secondary unit ordinance allows the construction of modest units sometimes
referred to as "granny units" in residentially zoned neighborhoods. These units are relatively
inexpensive to rent due to their size and are often occupied by family members as a way to
live together yet maintain an element of privacy.
                                                                               89
  City of San Mateo 2014 Housing Element
Homeless Programs
Although the City does not directly manage any homeless prevention or assistance
programs, it collaborates and financially supports a variety of programs countywide. The
sources of funds for homeless programs in the City of San Mateo are CDBG, Affordable
Housing Funds, and City Housing funds. County level funding that helps to benefit San
Mateo residents in need include McKinney-Vento, HPRP, and Section 8 programs. All
homeless outreach, assistance and prevention programs are conducted by local nonprofit
organizations in coordination with various local government agencies. The City works with
several groups to provide emergency shelters, transitional housing and support services for
the homeless as described in the 2010-15 Consolidated Plan.
Safe Harbor Emergency Shelter
The City will provide $15,000 from City Housing for the operation of Safe Harbor, the
regional emergency shelter for adult individuals located in South San Francisco and
operated by Samaritan House. After the basic human needs have been met and shelter
clients have been stabilized, Safe Harbor provides case management for financial
counseling including job search and employment services as well as budgeting to help
achieve financial self-sufficiency. The program also provides housing search assistance,
including assistance to find subsidized housing when possible. One example is access to
the San Mateo County Housing Readiness Voucher program which includes 3 years of
continuous case management and rental housing vouchers. Safe Harbor’s overall goal is
to ensure stabilized housing for three years.
Regional Collaborations
City staff members are active members of the following regional collaboratives to address a
wide variety of issues associated with homelessness and homeless prevention.
Inter-Agency Council (IAC)
The IAC is a countywide consortium of housing stakeholders to develop and support the
San Mateo County HOPE: 10-year Plan to End Homelessness. This plan focusses on the
provision of new affordable housing opportunities rather than development of new
shelters.
Continuum of Care
The Continuum of Care committee for San Mateo County implements its plan to serve
homeless persons and families. Through this collaboration of service providers and local
government agencies, efforts are coordinated for outreach, needs assessment, provision of
services for the homeless. The consortium also determines the priorities and allocation of
Countywide Emergency Shelter Grant funds.
HIP Housing Self Sufficiency Program
Although the City does not anticipate providing financial assistance to this program in 2014-
15, staff does serve on the selections committee for entry into this program that provides
support services and rent assistance for a one to two year term for candidates with
        90

                                                City of San Mateo 2014 Housing Element
educational and/or vocational training plans to find employment at a level to get off of
government assistance payments. The program provides deep supportive services to the
clients to move toward self-sufficiency within a 2 year time period.
Chronic Homelessness
The Housing Outreach Team (HOT) is a multi-disciplinary team, including City staff, formed
through the HOPE initiative that addresses chronic homelessness by outreach and
engagement. This program helps to provide housing and bring medical, mental health
and substance abuse support services to those who might not otherwise seek such
services. The outreach and case management of this team supports the residents of The
Vendome, a permanent supportive housing SRO in Downtown San Mateo. The Vendome
was acquired and renovated by the City with various housing financial resources in 2009.
The Vendome will continue to serve HOT identified clients and other very low income
residents this program year. City staff also supports the efforts of IVSN to bring additional
financial resources for services and rent assistance to the operation.
Homeless Prevention
As detailed under “Special Needs Housing” and “Homelessness” above, in order to help
prevent further homelessness the City will provide $15,000 in an assistance grant to
Human Investment Project. Please refer to the prior sections mentioned for specific agency
details. Also Samaritan House, as well as other local agencies, provides services for the
extremely low income residents that include homeless prevention through a variety of
programs funded by others such as Rapid ReHousing, and emergency housing vouchers.
In addition to these agencies, the Legal Aid Society will receive an additional $15,000.
Legal Aid Society, HomeSavers Program
Legal Aid assists tenant litigants with unlawful detainers and related matters to help people
stay in their homes. They conduct weekly clinics at community centers and at the County
Court House advising and representing applicants as necessary in court proceedings. Their
goal is to keep people in their homes and prevent homelessness through their advocacy.
They negotiate with landlords on tenant’s behalf regarding other issues that threaten their
ability to live in safe, decent, affordable housing. Their goal is to council 480 individuals in
160 households.
Discharge Policy
The City does not directly fund any institutions requiring discharge. These institutions are
within the jurisdiction of the County of San Mateo. Discharge policies are a component of
the County’s HOPE 10-Year Plan to End Homelessness.
                                                                                91

K.      HOUSING GOALS, POLICIES, AND PROGRAMS
GOAL 1:         Maintain the character and physical quality of residential neighborhoods.
GOAL 2:         Provide a diversity of housing types, responsive to household size, income
                and age needs.
GOAL 3:         Ensure that all new housing is developed or remodeled in a sustainable
                manner.
GOAL 4:         Encourage conservation improvements and measures to existing housing
                stock to make them more energy and water efficient.
POLICIES:
1. Protecting And Conserving Existing Housing
H 1.1: Residential Protection.
Protect established single-family and multi-family residential areas by the following actions:
1.      Prevent the intrusion of incompatible uses not indicated in the Land Use Element as
        allowed in residential districts;
2.      Avoid the overconcentration on individual blocks of non-residential uses defined by
        the Land Use Element as being "potentially compatible" in residential areas;
3.      Assure that adequate buffers are provided between residential and non-residential
        uses to provide design compatibility, protect privacy, and protect residences from
        impacts such as noise and traffic; and
4.      Review development proposals for conformance to the City's multi-family design
        guidelines for sites located in areas that contain substantial numbers of single-family
        homes to achieve projects more in keeping with the design character of single-
        family dwellings.
        Program H 1.1: Residential Protection.
        1. Consider policy during the Special Use Permit process with respect to the
            intrusion of incompatible uses.
            Lead: Planning Division
            (Ongoing)

            overconcentration of non-residential uses.
            Lead: Planning Division
            (Ongoing)
        3. Consider policy during the Site Plan and Architectural Review process with
            respect to assuring adequate buffers.
            Lead: Planning Division

           (Ongoing)
       4. Consider policy during the design review process with respect to the review of
           development proposals for conformance with design guidelines.
           Lead: Planning Division
           (Ongoing)
       Serious conflict can arise between residential and adjacent non-residential activities.
       Commercial and industrial developments which abut residential uses should be
       designed to minimize the potentially noisy and bothersome effects of parking lots,
       loading docks, air conditioning and heating equipment and refuse containers by
       locating them away from residences or by buffering them with adequate sound-
       reducing walls and landscaping.
       Some non-residential uses such as churches, day care centers and private schools
       are defined by the Land Use Element as being potentially compatible with
       residential uses. These types of facilities generally are located in and serve residential
       neighborhoods. However, special use permits are required to consider the
       operational characteristics of such uses and to tailor them, where feasible, to a
       particular site. Overconcentration of non-residential uses should be avoided in
       residential neighborhoods so that individual blocks do not lose their residential
       character.
       Due to the need for additional housing and the lack of vacant land, new multi-
       family development will replace older homes in certain areas of the city zoned for
       multi-family use. To minimize the changes in neighborhood character created by
       this redevelopment, new multi-family projects in areas having a predominance of
       single-family residences should be of a scale and include design features which are
       compatible with surrounding single-family homes, while maintaining housing
       affordability as a major goal.
H 1.2: Single-Family Preservation.
Preserve existing single-family neighborhoods through the following actions:
1.     Maintain intact single-family neighborhoods as shown on the Land Use Map; and
2.     Require on-site buffering in the design of new multi-family developments that abut
       single-family districts to assure privacy and reduce noise impacts.
                                                                                 93
 City of San Mateo 2014 Housing Element
        Program H 1.2: Single-Family Preservation
        1. Consider potential impacts on intact single family neighborhoods during the
            review of land use changes and special use permits for proposed development
            other than single family dwellings.
            Lead: Planning Division
            (Ongoing)
        2. Consider additional buffering provisions such as landscape buffers, minimum
            fence heights, location of recreational facilities, underground garage exhausts,
            etc. during the design review process.
            Lead: Planning Division
            (Ongoing)
        Single-family zoning districts constitute the largest proportion of land in San Mateo.
        Past policies have designated some predominately single-family areas for
        redevelopment as multi-family housing. The retention of these intact single-family
        neighborhoods is a major policy direction of this Plan, to encourage home
        ownership and improvement of existing dwellings, reduce absentee ownership and
        land speculation, and create greater social stability. Portions of the Central, North
        Central, San Mateo Heights and Hayward Park areas were re-designated for single-
        family and/or duplex uses in 1990.
        In many instances throughout the City multi-family zoning districts are directly
        adjacent to single-family districts. The difference in height and scale between the
        two uses can be dramatic and detrimental to the character of the single-family
        neighborhood. For example, the difference in allowable density may be as great as
        6 units per acre for single family and up to 50 units per acre for a larger R-5 zoned
        parcel. The design of new multi-family projects that abut single-family districts
        should include design features that provide privacy, natural light and protection
        from noise and traffic impacts for the adjoining single-family homes.
H 1.3: Housing Rehabilitation.
Provide funding as available for the conservation and rehabilitation of viable deteriorating
housing in the City to preserve existing housing stock, neighborhood character and, where
possible, to retain low- and moderate-income units.

       The great majority of homes in San Mateo are well maintained and contribute to
       neighborhood quality and desirability. However, there are properties that have
       begun to deteriorate and require attention to preserve the safety of occupants and
       maintain neighborhood appearance. The City provides code enforcement as a
       service to residents and as a deterrent to neighborhood deterioration. These efforts
       should continue and increase to maintain neighborhood standards.
       The City also provides financial assistance to low-income households using CDBG
       and other funds to assist in housing rehabilitation and provide minor repairs.
H 1.5: Building Bulk.
Limit the sizes of new and expanded single-family dwellings and duplexes, retaining
neighborhood scale and character.
       Program H 1.5: Building Bulk.
       1. Through plan check review of single-family dwellings and duplex buildings,
           ensure compliance with both the single family and duplex regulations and
           design guidelines that control the bulk of and height of buildings.

H 1.6: Variances and Lot Divisions.
Consider existing neighborhood character in terms of dwelling size, height, setbacks and
lot size and configuration in reviewing variances and lot division proposals.
         Program H 1.6: Variances and Lot Divisions.
         1 Consider during variance and subdivision review.
             Lead: Planning Division
             (Ongoing)
         The scarcity of vacant land and changing lifestyles has resulted in existing, smaller
         single-family homes being greatly expanded or, in some instances, demolished and
         replaced by new dwellings which are developed up to the maximum limits allowed
         by the zoning code. Another problem has been the expansion of single-family
         homes or duplexes to include numerous bedrooms and bathrooms in designs that
         allow for future illegal conversion to boarding homes or multiple units.
         To minimize these impacts on single family neighborhoods, the R-1 section of the
         zoning code was amended in 1992 to reduce the amount of allowable floor area,
         require increased second story setbacks, and provide a daylight plane for side yard
         setbacks to reduce building bulk.
         In 2001, the City Council adopted the Single-Family Design Guidelines, and required
         planning applications and public review for substantial removal of existing homes
         and construction of new single family dwellings, and for second story additions to
         existing single family dwellings. The Design Guidelines were revised in 2006 to
         address additional issues that arose during the public review process for single
         family dwellings. The Guidelines address how a building’s size, architectural
         character, and relationship to the street and nearby structures contribute to
         successful neighborhoods.
         In addition to the Single-Family Dwelling Design Guidelines, the City Council
         adopted Duplex Design Guidelines in 2004, revised floor area ratio standards, and
         created a daylight plane for duplex dwellings. Duplex zoned areas are typically
         located near single family neighborhoods and provide a transition to higher density
         neighborhoods. Many of the issues and guidelines are similar to those contained in
         the Single-Family Dwelling Design Guidelines.
         Decisions on variances and lot divisions in established residential neighborhoods
         should take into account the impacts of the proposal on surrounding properties
         and the overall neighborhood character.
H 1.7: Retention of Existing Lower-Income Units.
Seek to retain existing subsidized very low-, low- and moderate-income housing units,
especially those that will be available for conversion to market rate housing. Retention of
such units should have high priority for available funds. Also evaluate impacts of new
construction when it involves the loss of non-subsidized private market housing units and
other market conditions that impact existing housing affordability.

H 1.8: Condominium Conversion.
Continue the existing policy of protecting existing residents by offering purchase
opportunities, long-term leases and relocation assistance.
        Program H 1.8: Condominium Conversion.
        1. Continue to implement tenant notification, purchase opportunities, long-term
            leases, and relocation assistance provisions of the subdivision code.
            Lead: Planning Division
            (Ongoing)
        Prior to 1980, San Mateo has ranked very high among Bay Area suburbs in
        permitting apartment units to convert to condominium ownership (3,300 rental
        units had been converted). In 1981, the City amended its condominium conversion
        ordinance to provide existing tenants with the first right to purchase, require tenant
        relocation benefits, and lifetime leases for elderly and disabled tenants.
H 1.9: Demolitions.
Prohibit demolition of existing residences until a building permit for new construction has
been issued, unless health and safety problems exist. Prevent housing stock from
becoming health and safety problems through code enforcement efforts.

            Lead: Building Inspection Division and Code Enforcement
            (Ongoing)
        The demolition of existing housing eliminates needed units and creates an
        unattractive gap in the pattern of development. Vacant lots may become
        neighborhood liabilities due to weed growth and illegal dumping. Continued
        upkeep of older homes, with code enforcement efforts if needed, is a better
        approach to maintaining habitable housing units. The City presently prohibits
        demolition of housing until a building permit for new development has been
        issued, unless health and safety problems demand more drastic actions.

        In some cases needed public improvements, such as road widening, may remove
        housing units. The relative benefits of these public works should be considered
        against the impact of losing dwellings.

H 2.4: Private Development of Affordable Housing.
Encourage the provision of affordable housing by the private sector through:
1.      Requiring that a percentage of the units, excluding bonus units, in specified
        residential projects be affordable.
2.      Requiring construction or subsidy of new affordable housing as a condition for
        approval of any commercial development which affects the demand for housing in
        the City.
3.      Providing density bonuses and priority processing for projects which qualify for
        density bonuses under State law.
        Program H 2.4: Private Development of Affordable Housing.
        1. Maintain an inclusionary housing ordinance to implement Policy H 2.4 The
            ordinance shall include:
            a) At a minimum, require all projects which include more than 10 residential
                units, including mixed-use projects, shall be required to include10% of the
                residential units for exclusive use as affordable housing units.
            b) The project proponent shall build the unit(s) on site, either in partnership
                with a public or nonprofit housing agency, or on its own. Off-site building
                shall be allowed only if the proponent demonstrates that on-site
                construction is infeasible; and in any event, any off-site units must be built
                within the City of San Mateo.
                No in-lieu fees shall be allowed except for:
                i. Projects which include 10 units or less; or
                ii. Fractional affordable housing unit requirements of less than .5.

                                       City of San Mateo 2014 Housing Element
   c) The affordable units shall be as similar in exterior design and appearance as
        possible to the remaining units in the project.
   d) Affordable rental units shall carry deed restrictions which guarantee their
        affordability.
   e) Affordable for sale units shall have deed restrictions which allow for first right
        of refusal to the local government, upon the sale of the unit. The City local
        government should only refuse the option of purchase if it has already
        expended all of its financial resources available for housing, including
        Community Development Block Grant funds, local housing trust fund
        monies, and any other federal, state or local funds typically available for
        affordable housing purposes.
        Lead: Neighborhood Improvement and Housing Division
        (Ongoing)
2. Evaluate and study the impacts on development costs to housing by increasing
   the inclusionary housing production requirements. Areas for consideration
   include increasing the percentage of units required, lowering the affordability
   pricing, lowering the project size that triggers the requirement, and including an
   in lieu payment for small projects.
   Lead: Neighborhood Improvement and Housing Division
   Implementation Goal: Ongoing for existing program; bring proposal on new
   requirements to Council by 2002
   This was completed and the revision to increase the BMR percentage
   requirements was implemented on January 1, 2010. The current program
   provides developer options of 10-15% affordability requirements depending on
   affordability targets and whether the units are for sale or for rent. The program
   also includes some flexibility in unit design and location and a fractional fee for
   small projects 5-10 units in size.
3. Develop, hold public hearings on, and if possible, adopt a commercial/housing
   linkage program, based on empirical data applicable to the City of San Mateo.
   The program should match the housing constructed and/or subsidized to the
   demand created by commercial development, in terms of affordability levels,
   type of tenancy, number of bedrooms, and other relevant factors.
   Lead:         Neighborhood Improvement and Housing Division
   Implementation Goal: Bring to the Council by 2002
   The City elected to participate in a countywide nexus study to evaluate both
   affordable housing impacts fees and commercial linkage fees. The study began
   in 2014 and is expected to be completed by the end of 2014: Review results of
   nexus study with City Council and get direction on pursuing a commercial
   linkage fee.
4. Develop a density bonus program consistent with State law.

 City of San Mateo 2014 Housing Element
            A revised Density Bonus Ordinance was adopted by the City Council in January
            2009 in conformance with recent legislative changes.
        5. Provide information to developers on density bonus provisions for affordable
            housing. Give processing priority to applications which include substantial
            proportions of affordable housing.
            Lead:       Planning Division
            (Ongoing)
H 2.5: Distribution of Low- and Moderate-Income Housing.
Attempt to distribute low- and moderate-income housing developments throughout the
City. Encourage the mixing of market-rate and low/moderate-income units where feasible.
        Program H 2.5: Distribution of Low- and Moderate-Income Housing.
        1. Consider during review of applications for funding of affordable housing
            projects.
            Lead: Neighborhood Improvement and Housing Division
            (Ongoing)
            The inclusionary provisions of H2.4 assist in distributing affordable housing units
            citywide. When the City provides financial assistance for additional affordable
            housing units, care will be taken to ensure distribution of these units to avoid
            over-concentration in any given neighborhood.
H 2.6: Rental Housing.
Encourage development of rental housing for households unable to afford ownership
housing.
        Program H 2.6: Rental Housing
        1. Consider during review of applications for multi-family housing.
            Lead: Planning Division
            (Ongoing)
            Rental housing provides opportunities for those who wish to live in San Mateo
            but cannot afford the down payment and mortgage expenses of ownership
            housing. Well-designed rental housing, using quality materials and providing a
            pleasant living environment, can be as great an asset the community as for-sale
            projects.
H 2.7: Secondary Units.
Allow creation of secondary units on residentially zoned properties to provide opportunities
for affordable rental units or to allow for the housing of extended families. Require that the
design of secondary units be compatible with the main residence and neighborhood,
provide adequate on-site usable open space and parking, and not infringe upon the
privacy of adjoining properties.
      102
                                                City of San Mateo 2014 Housing Element
       Program H 2.7: Secondary Units.
       1. Through plan check review of secondary unit applications, ensure compliance
           with regulations, architectural standards, and design guidelines that promote
           design compatibility with the principle residence and the neighborhood,
           provide required parking on-site, and minimize privacy impacts on adjoining
           properties.
           Lead: Planning Division
           (Ongoing)
           Another means of creating more affordable housing is through the building of
           secondary units, commonly called "granny flats", on single-family properties.
           Small second units can assist the property owner by generating income, making
           the home mortgage more affordable, and may also provide lower-priced rental
           units. The secondary unit can be used to house aged or younger family
           members at a reasonable cost and in close proximity to the family.
           The State requires that local agencies adopt ordinances allowing secondary
           units in residential districts. In 2003, the City revised the Zoning Code to
           designate secondary units as permitted uses in residential areas, provide
           architectural standards, and require compliance to regulations contained in the
           zoning district where the secondary unit will be constructed, including
           requirements for design review. San Mateo's ordinances require that the
           property owner reside on-site, providing the stability of home-ownership. The
           secondary units are allowed to be a maximum of 640 square feet (typically a
           studio or one-bedroom unit) and provide one off-street parking space.
H 2.8: Single Room Occupancy.
Provide for the development of single room occupancy (SRO) units to provide small
affordable units in areas close to transportation services.
       Program H 2.8: Single Room Occupancy.
       1. Adopt a Single Room Occupancy ordinance to allow the development of new
           SRO projects.
           Lead: Planning and Building Divisions
           Implementation Goal: 2018
           Single Room Occupancy projects can provide efficient and affordable units for
           those who desire minimal housing. Since SRO units may or may not include
           cooking facilities and are often sized below 400 square feet, they do not meet
           current planning and building code requirements. Special standards must be
           developed to take into consideration the unique nature of this type of housing.
           A cost effective and efficient way of creating SRO standards is to develop
           standards at the time an applicant submits a planning application to construct
           an SRO project. The developer should have the experience and available
           resources to assist the City in the creation of the ordinance.
                                                                             103
 City of San Mateo 2014 Housing Element
            Often the establishment of single room occupancy units is combined with
            supportive services and serves extremely low income individuals. The City priority

H 2.9: Multi-Family Location.
Provide for the development of multi-family housing to create a diversity of available
housing types as follows:
        1. Maintain the identified sites on the Inventory of Sites Available for New Housing
            Development (Appendix A of the Housing Element).
        2. Permit reclassification to multi-family zoning of other properties that meet the
            following criteria:
            a. Have adequate size to allow for a self-contained housing development and
                 include adequate on-site parking and usable open space;
            b. Have good access to arterial streets and transit nodes;
            c. Maintain a reasonable buffer to single-family districts; and
            d. Constitute a logical extension of existing multi-family development at
                 compatible and appropriate densities or are zoned for commercial use.
        Program H 2.9: Multi-Family Location.
        1. Maintain multi-family zoning on specified sites consistent with the Land Use Map
            or Land Use Element policies.

        increased open space, public recreational facilities, or off-site infrastructure
        improvements, or location adjacent or near (generally within a half-mile walking
        distance) transit nodes; (Note: Related Land Use Element Policy LU 1.4)

           If San Mateo is to meet its housing needs, it will need to encourage multi-family
           housing on vacant sites and through redevelopment. However, to create high-
           quality living environments and protect existing neighborhoods, certain
           standards must be followed in the location of new multi-family developments.
           Sites must be large enough to provide adequate parking and still leave area
           available for recreation and open space. Multi-family sites must be close to
           arterial streets to handle traffic generation and discourage traffic through single-
           family neighborhoods. Specific commercial sites may be developed for multi-
           family use.
           One means of increasing housing potential is through redesignation of
           commercially zoned and lower density residential properties to multi- family land
           use. The redesignations approved in Policy H-2.-9 will increase the potential for
           construction of new units.
           San Mateo's multi-family zoning districts allow relatively high densities in an effort
           to encourage the production of housing. In 1989, the R-3 District (the lowest
           density multi-family zoning district) allowed up to 43 units per acre. Prior to the
           amendments necessary to make them conform to the initiative adopted by the
           voters in November 1991, the R-4 District allowed up to 58 units per acre and
           the R-5 District allowed up to 124 units per acre. However, very few projects
           were built up to the maximum allowable densities. On average, most
           developments achieved between one-third and one-half the allowable densities
           in these zoning districts, due to other constraints such as parking, open space
           requirements and the costs of high-rise building construction or multiple floors
           of underground parking.
           The high range of allowable densities permitted by the zoning districts can result
           in property owners over-valuing their properties based on unrealistic
           development expectations. This in turn results in properties remaining
           undeveloped or reduces the affordability of units constructed with inflated land
           prices. It can also render density bonuses for affordable housing production
           useless.
           In 1979 the allowable densities of multi-family districts were studied and revised,
           with the intent of limiting allowable densities on smaller parcels and providing
           density incentives for lot assemblage. The increase in lot size provided better
           opportunities for incorporating parking and open space in a more livable project
           design. The R-3 District, for example, now allows just two units to be
           constructed on a parcel of 6,000 square feet. If two such parcels are merged,
           creating a 12,000 square foot lot, a project of eight units is allowed.
H 2.11: Senior Project Location.
Permit senior housing projects on multi-family or non-residentially zoned properties within
walking distance of services and transit routes. Continue to provide allowances for density
bonuses for senior projects.
                                                                                105

            The elderly population of San Mateo is increasing. San Mateo's senior citizens
            should be provided with housing opportunities within the community to avoid
            the necessity of relocating to other areas and to free up underutilized single-
            family homes for younger families. Senior housing has different characteristics
            than typical family-oriented housing. Seniors typically drive less, thereby
            reducing traffic impacts and the need for extensive parking. Many senior
            projects also provide on-site communal facilities for dining and recreation, which
            further reduce the need for driving. Senior housing should be located within
            three-quarters of a mile of commercial services and transit routes to adequately
            provide for the needs of elderly residents.
H 2.12: Mixed Use.
Continue the policy of encouraging residential uses in existing commercial areas, or in
locating adjacent or near transit nodes, where the residences can be buffered from noise
and safety concerns and can provide adequate on-site parking and usable open space.
Provide floor area and/or height bonuses for residential development in selected areas of
the City.
         Program H 2.12: Mixed Use.
         1. Permit the construction of housing or mixed-use projects in commercial areas.
            Encourage mixed use in specific area plans, the El Camino Real Master Plan, and
            the San Mateo Rail Corridor Transit-Oriented Development Plan. Consider
            designation in future plans for 42 Avenue.
            Lead: Planning Division
            (Ongoing)
         2. Publicize the advantages of constructing housing or mixed-use projects in
            commercial areas. Publicize the ability to locate residences in commercial areas.
            Lead: Planning Division
            (Ongoing)
            The mixing of residential units in commercial developments is not a new idea.
            The City of San Mateo as well as many older American cities have examples of
            apartment units over shops. This concept is very applicable to today's needs to
            provide lower-priced housing and reduce the need for commuting to work.
            The mixing of housing and commercial uses also would improve the urban
            design qualities of commercial areas by adding variety and activity to shopping
            streets.
            The City currently allows the mixing of housing and commercial uses in various
            locations, including properties along El Camino Real (SR 82) south of the
      106
                                                 City of San Mateo 2014 Housing Element
           Downtown, office sites along 20th Avenue, the KMART site at Delaware and
           Concar, the Parkside Shopping Center at Norfolk, and the Fashion Island
           Shopping Center. In addition, once adopted, the programs called for in
           Program H 2.4 should encourage the construction of affordable housing in the
           redevelopment of commercial areas.
           The City’s El Camino Real Master Plan and Land San Mateo Rail Corridor Transit-
           Oriented Development Plan both include policies promoting mixed-use
           development. Future specific plan efforts, including the 42nd Avenue Specific
           Plan will also consider the designation of these areas for mixed-use
           development.
H 2.13: Transportation Oriented Development (TOD).
Encourage well-planned compact development with a range of land uses, including
housing, commercial, recreation and open space, in proximity to train stations and other
transit nodes. Encourage the maximization of housing density where possible.
        Program H 2.13: Transportation Oriented Development (TOD).
        1. Encourage transit-oriented development in locations adjacent or near train
           stations and other transit nodes.
           Lead: Planning Division
           (Ongoing)
        2. Ensure that development proposals conform to the Transit Oriented
           Development Ordinance and the San Mateo Rail Corridor Transportation
           Oriented Development Plan.
           Lead: Planning Division
           (Ongoing)
           As with the concept of mixed-use development, transit-oriented development is
           not a new idea. The location of housing within proximity to transit stations has
           been shown to increase the use of transit ridership and reduce the use of single-
           occupancy vehicles. The concept of transit-oriented development has the
           potential to positively affect local circulation, jobs/housing balance, and the
           evolving fabric of the City’s transit corridors.
           In 2007, the City adopted the Transit Oriented Development Ordinance which
           implements the San Mateo Rail Corridor Transit Oriented Development Plan
           (adopted 2005). The Plan encourages and provides guidance for transit
           oriented development centered on the Hillsdale and Hayward Park Caltrain
           station areas. Land uses, development densities, and parking and transportation
           demand management are important components in the Plan. In addition, the
           Plan includes goals and policies to improve the street system and pedestrian and
           bicycle friendliness within the planning area. Development within the TOD area
           will be required to conform to the policies and guidelines contained in the San
           Mateo Rail Corridor Transit Oriented Development Plan.

Continue existing support for organizations that seek to prevent homelessness. Assist
Countywide efforts to address homelessness through participation in the HOPE Program.
Although the HOPE program focuses efforts on providing permanent supportive housing
rather than emergency shelters, the City must also comply with SB 2 which requires
ensuring there are appropriate zones where emergency housing is located as a permitted
use. Accordingly, transitional housing is currently permitted to be located in residential
districts and commercial districts, while emergency shelters may be located in
Regional/Community Commercial districts.
         Program H 2.14: The Homeless.

             Commercial land use categories consistent with the provisions of SB2, which
             requires emergency shelters as permitted uses without conditional use permits
             or other discretionary action. Emergency shelters shall be subject to the same
             development and management standards that apply to other allowed uses in
             the designated land use and zoning districts.

                     legislation. Amend code if needed by 2015.
        3. Continue existing support, where feasible, for programs to assist and support

            Implementation Goal: (Ongoing)
             In 2005-2006, a county-wide group of diverse stakeholders undertook an
             intensive community-based planning process to develop a plan to end
             homelessness in San Mateo County. The end result – entitled “Housing Our
             People Effectively (HOPE): Ending Homelessness in San Mateo County (“the
             HOPE Plan”) – lays out concrete strategies designed to end homelessness in our
             community within 10 years. Completed in March 2006, the report incorporates
             the experiences and expertise of over 200 stakeholders, including members of
             the business, nonprofit and government sectors. Many of these stakeholders
             were elected officials and staff from the 21 jurisdictions that are members of the
             San Mateo County Countywide Housing Element Update project. The final plan
             has been formally adopted by several of San Mateo County’s 21 jurisdictions.
             The HOPE Plan is the community’s comprehensive policy and planning
             document relating to homelessness and therefore provides the local policy
       108

                                                 City of San Mateo 2014 Housing Element
            framework for developing the strategies and activities required by SB2 relating to
            emergency shelter, and transitional and supportive housing.
            The HOPE Plan is a call to action to prevent and end homelessness in San Mateo
            County. The Plan is outcome-driven and as such has two overarching desired
            results:
            • Creating 7,900 units of affordable and supportive housing for households
                which are homeless or at imminent risk of homelessness; and
            • Providing 4,300 households with short-term assistance to secure or maintain
                housing.
            The HOPE Plan intentionally made no recommendation to expand the supply of
            emergency or transitional housing (except for a small pilot motel voucher
            program to provide assistance to single individuals). Although the HOPE
            planners recognized that there is a lack of needed resources throughout the
            housing continuum, including emergency and transitional housing, the greatest
            need and the most effective use of new and/or redirected resources is for
            creating and sustaining quality affordable housing (accessible to households
            with incomes ≤30% AMI) and, where needed, supportive housing. Since the
            HOPE Plan was adopted by the County, many cities, and other community
            groups, there have been no plans for new emergency shelter or transitional
            housing put forth in San Mateo County (with the exception of transitional
            housing or permanent housing with transitional services for emancipating foster
            and/or homeless transition-age youth).
            Within the specific strategies identified to increase affordable housing
            opportunities, the Plan recommends removing barriers to and/or creating
            incentives for the development of extremely low-income affordable and
            supportive housing by:
            • Establishing innovative land use and zoning policies and recommendations;
            • Creating clearer, more streamlined building and development processes to
                shorten the time and decrease the cost of affordable and supportive housing
                development; and
            • Identifying more suitable, appropriately zoned land and multi-unit buildings
                appropriate for affordable and supportive housing.
H 2.15: Open Choice.
Continue efforts towards the elimination of discrimination based on race, religion, sex,
nationality, age or physical disability that prevent free choice in housing.
                                                                              109

         Program H 2.15: Open Choice.
         1. Continue implementation of the Fair Housing Resolution, affirmative marketing
            of city-subsidized housing projects, and provision of available funding for private
            nonprofit organizations that monitor and provide assistance to those
            experiencing discrimination in housing choice.
            Lead: Neighborhood Improvement and Housing Division
            (Ongoing)
            San Mateo's efforts to provide a diversity of housing would be meaningless if
            that housing were not available in an atmosphere of open and free choice for
            all prospective residents. The City seeks to eliminate discriminatory rental and
            sales practices which act as barriers to free choice in housing, and in 1970
            passed a Fair Housing Resolution governing all City departments and housing
            initiatives. The City's Community Relations Commission is responsible for
            ensuring compliance with the Fair Housing Resolution. City sponsored housing
            programs and projects built with City subsidies include affirmative marketing
            plans to reach all segments of the community. The City also contributes funding
            to fair housing programs that provide counseling services, investigation of
            alleged abuses, and legal assistance. These programs also include outreach
            efforts by conducting workshops for landlords and tenants, public service
            announcements, newspaper columns, and use of social media posted in several
            languages.
H 2.16: Special Needs Groups.
Continue existing support for programs that assist special needs groups (the elderly, large
families, female heads of households, and the disabled, including the developmentally
disabled).
         Program H 2.16: Special Needs Groups.
         1. Continue to support programs particularly designed to accommodate special
            needs groups. In the past, typical programs have included rehabilitation loans,
            minor home repair, purchase of land for new housing, Section 8 rental
            assistance, shared housing, and first- and last-month’s rent program.
            Lead: Neighborhood Improvement and Housing Division
            (Ongoing)
            State law requires that residential care facilities serving six or fewer persons that
            assist special needs groups be treated the same as single-family dwellings. To
            avoid overconcentration, the City will continue to request that facilities be
            separated by 300 feet, as permitted by State law.
         2. Consider requests for Reasonable Accommodations to City zoning code to
            relieve housing constraints in accordance with City Reasonable Accommodation

          On June 16, 2014 the City adopted its Reasonable Accommodation Ordinance
          which established a process for considering requests for reasonable
          accommodation in the application of the city’s land use and zoning ordinance
          for residential property used by persons with disabilities. With this ordinance,
          persons with disability may make a request for reasonable accommodation
          instead of applying for a formal planning application for a variance that may
          take several months to process.
3. Incorporate Sustainability Into Housing Development
H 3.1: Sustainable Housing Development.
Incorporate Sustainability into existing and future single family and multifamily housing:

          State Green Building Code in January 2014. Staff will continue to encourage
          that new residential projects assisted with City funds maximize sustainability
          features beyond the minimum code requirements whenever feasible..

          Implementation Goal: Coordinate countywide marketing efforts to promote
          PACE financing to San Mateo property owners. July 2015.
          In January 2010 the City of San Mateo joined a consortium of other California
          cities called California FIRST in order to issue bonds to finance residential energy
          and water efficiency improvements. Implementation of the program was
          delayed due to legal issues with the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). If
          the State of California and FHFA work out a solution, the City will participate in
          marketing the program to prospective property owners.
                                                                                111

L.       QUANTIFIED OBJECTIVES
According to the State Department of Housing and Community Development, the sum of
the quantified objectives for the programs should ideally be equal to or surpass the
community's identified housing needs. However, State law recognizes that the total
housing needs identified may exceed available resources and the community's ability to
satisfy this need within the content of the general plan. Under these circumstances, the
quantified objectives need not match the identified existing housing needs but should
establish the maximum number of housing units that can be constructed, rehabilitated,
and conserved over a five-year time frame.
With respect to affordable units, the City has estimated the potential subsidies available
during the planning period and has calculated the potential number of units that could be
assisted with these funds. In addition, staff has compiled a list of known or expected
development projects in the next few years, including preservation projects anticipated to
come on line between 2014 and 2022.
Based on residential building permits issued in the last year and residential projects that
have been initially reviewed by the Planning department that have not been built, the
quantified objective for non-subsidized units developed in the market is 2,475 units. The
total quantified objectives for the next eight years are as follows:

M. CONSISTENCY WITH OTHER ELEMENTS OF THE
        GENERAL PLAN
The Housing Element is consistent with all other elements of the current General Plan, and
as updates of the General Plan occur, the city will ensure internal consistency with the
Housing Element. The City’s Land Use Element implements specific policies of the housing
element such as encouraging mixed use development and multi-family residential
development, and also includes the following overall policy:
        LU 1.6: Residential Development. Facilitate housing production by carrying out the
        goals and policies in the Housing Element.
The Circulation Element includes an analysis of future traffic and planned improvements.
These traffic projections are based in part on projected housing units consistent with the
Housing Element goals.

N.       PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
According to State law, local jurisdictions must "make a diligent effort to achieve public
participation of all economic segments of the community in the development of the
housing element, and the element shall describe this effort" {65583(c)). This will make the
housing element, and subsequent action on it, serious, effective, politically supported, and
truly representative of the widest set of housing needs.
This Housing Element represents the culmination of many months of staff development
and community review. The following highlights the public process undertaken to
produce this document:

                                               II. Land Use
  A. INTRODUCTION
The Land Use Element establishes a comprehensive set of explicit goals, policies and
implementation actions which will guide the future use and development of land within the City
of San Mateo and the unincorporated area within its sphere of influence to the year 2030. More
than any other element, it seeks to establish policies which will achieve the City's vision of the
future, one of managed growth.
   B. BACKGROUND
AREA DESCRIPTION
The San Mateo Planning Area encompasses 15.7 square miles (3.2 square miles of which are bay
waters). The City of San Mateo is divided into ten specific planning areas as delineated on the
San Mateo Planning Area, Figure LU-1.
HISTORY
Development of the City of San Mateo began in earnest with establishment of a stagecoach stop
along the Old County Road, [El Camino Real] in the 1850's. The center of City activity shifted
to the area along Third Avenue and B Street with the advent of the railroad in the 1860's.
The City was incorporated on September 4, 1894 and remained a relatively small community
with a very rural character until the 1940's. World War II and the following years were a period
of significant growth and development. In 1940 the population was 19,405 persons. By 1960
the population had reached 69,870 persons and the economic base was shifting to office and
retail sectors. Significant concentrations of these uses were in the Downtown, Hillsdale
Shopping Center and along El Camino Real and amounted to 2.8 million square feet of retail
space and 1.2 million square feet of office space.
Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010, Resolution No. 134-2010                       II-1
Amended by the City Council on April 18, 2011, Resolution No. 42 (2011)
Amended by the City Council on April 6, 2015, Resolution No. 36 (2015)
Land Use
During the 1970's and 1980's, population growth slowed, while both retail space and office space
increased significantly to 5.6 million square feet and 7 million square feet, respectively. Retail
uses were largely concentrated at Hillsdale Shopping Center, along El Camino Real, and the
Downtown. Office uses were concentrated in office parks along the SR 92 corridor and to a
lesser extent in the Downtown. These changes altered both the physical shape and the image of
San Mateo from a "bedroom community" to a community that is a place wherein people can both
live and work establishing it as an important subregional office and retail center.
ABAG POPULATION PROJECTIONS 2000-2030
The Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG), as the Bay Area’s land use planning
agency, is responsible for making annual long-term forecasts of population, households, and
employment. The forecast is designed to be a realistic assessment of growth. Chart LU-1 and
Table LU-2 include population, household, income, and employment projections until 2030.
The ABAG population projections indicate a continued gradual increase in total population.
Persons per household data which includes the unincorporated areas in the City’s Sphere of
Influence remains largely stable at 2.74. Total jobs, employment and income figures reflect a
healthy “dot.com” economy at the turn of the millennium, however, these figures decline after
9/11. Projections show a steady increase in jobs, employment, and income from 2005-2030.
II-2                                       Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010, Resolution No. 134-2010

ECONOMIC PROFILE
1.      ECONOMIC BASE.
Since 1960 San Mateo's economic base has been comprised of office, retail and medical services.
Over the next 15 years, this economic base is not expected to change. San Mateo will continue
to be attractive to office and retail development because of its unique location between the
technology industry in "Silicon Valley" and downtown San Francisco, proximity to San
Francisco Airport, accessibility to the East Bay, and the capacity of local infrastructure and
regional circulation system (including the Caltrain railway, SR 92, US 101 and I-280) to
accommodate additional growth.
According to ABAG 2007 Projections and city staff analysis, both office and retail business
sectors declined from 2000 to 2005; however, steady increases in these sectors are expected from
2005 through 2030. Similarly, medical services also declined from 2000 to 2005 but are
projected to increase steadily through 2030. Industrial uses will continue to slowly decline and
be converted to other uses due to the limited supply of suitable sites and the high price of local
land.
2.      EMPLOYMENT LOCATION.
The majority of the City's jobs are projected through 2030 to remain in the same general
locations as indicated on Chart LU-3, Employment Locations. Employment intensification is
expected in the Downtown, at Hillsdale Shopping Center, at Mariner's Island, Bay Meadows,
near Hillsdale Boulevard and US 101, and along the SR 92 corridor, particularly in the vicinity
of the SR 92/US 101 interchange. The SR 92 corridor will contain the largest number of jobs,
the Downtown the second highest number of jobs, and South El Camino Real and the Hillsdale
Shopping Center the third highest number.

3.       FISCAL CONSIDERATIONS.
While the City has a variety of revenue sources, its primary source of revenue is the property tax,
with retail sales a close second. Property tax revenues reflect city-wide land and improvement
values and tend not to be concentrated. However, land use policies which support new
construction and which enhance land values (such as by ensuring property maintenance and high
design quality) help support a strong property tax base. The projected increases in office and
retail spaces will maintain and improve the City's property tax. Sales tax revenues, on the other
hand, tend to be concentrated among fewer properties. Land uses which generate large sales
volumes include regional shopping centers, volume discount stores, leasing and sales offices, and
auto sales. In San Mateo, major sales tax sources in 2008 included Hillsdale Shopping Center,
Bridgepointe Shopping Center, and Downtown. Hotels, motels and auto dealerships can also
generate major revenues, but in 2008 the City was comprised of relatively few hotels and auto
dealerships.
LAND USE
1.       EXISTING.
Residential uses designated on the Land Use Plan (Figure LU-3) are the most predominant land
use in the City of San Mateo totaling almost half of the City’s land area. Single family residential
designations account for approximately 34% of the land area. Multi-family designations which
range from low to high density and include duplexes account for 14% of land area. Mixed use
designations which include both commercial and residential uses total 2% of the City’s area.
Land that is within walking distance of transit stations and designated as Transit Oriented
Development totals 2% of the City’s land area. All of the Commercial designations combined
total 4.5%. Service Commercial accounts for .83% of the total commercial. Executive Office is
3.5%. Less than one percent of the land area is vacant within the City limits; however, within
the unincorporated area, 265 acres remain undeveloped.
In the unincorporated area, which totals 2.2 square miles, residential uses are the dominant land
use. Single-family dwellings constitute over 95% of the dwellings, resulting in a low overall
area density. No commercial space exists in the unincorporated area.
2.       DEVELOPMENT POTENTIAL.
         a.         Estimated Development. Estimated development is the likely development
         given ABAG Projections, detailed assessment of vacant and underutilized lands, current
         and projected market trends, application of the General Plan Building Intensity and
         Density standards, and typical experience with local development.
         San Mateo is expected to continue to develop and grow through the year 2030, as
         delineated in Table LU-4 San Mateo Planning Area Development. The majority of new
         development will consist primarily of infill, reuse, or redevelopment. The community

Land Use
          will continue to diversify with major increases in office and retail space and a substantial
          number of additional dwellings.
          In 2005, commercial development accounted for approximately 20 million square feet.
          In 2030, commercial development is estimated to be a total of 30 million square feet.
          Residential development in 2030 is expected to add 8,330 dwellings for a total of 48,360
          dwellings in 2030.
          Major development is anticipated to occur in the Downtown, Bay Meadows Phase II, and
          the Rail Corridor area. Downtown revitalization is expected to continue to include new
          residential, office, retail and mixed use development as the availability of goods and
          services, walkability, and public transportation services continue to improve and expand.
          The Bay Meadows Specific Plan Amendment and Phase II Development Agreement
          permit a base program of 1.25 million square feet of office space, 150,000 square feet of
          retail space, and 1,250 residential housing units; however, office uses could be
          maximized to 1.5 million, and housing units to 1,500 units. The Rail Corridor area,
          which is located within a half-mile radius of the Hillsdale and Hayward Park Caltrain
          stations, is expected to develop with multi-family housing and employment centers.
          Neighborhood and commute serving businesses such as small shops and restaurants are
          also anticipated and would contribute to the area’s vitality. Development around the
          Hillsdale Caltrain Station is also guided by the Hillsdale Station Area Plan, which
          provides more detail for a relocated intermodal transit center connected to neighborhoods
          to the east and west of the station as well as 25th Avenue via walking and bicycling.
          Vacant land which may develop is generally constrained by topographic, geologic, and
          biologic features as well as infrastructure requirements which will limit the intensity and
          density and will make development difficult and challenging.
          Underutilized land will constitute the major source of future development opportunities.
          Land is considered to be underutilized if the existing floor space is less than 25% of the
          maximum permitted floor area, or if a large portion of a site area is utilized for open
          parking. The more prominent of these sites includes 42nd Avenue Shopping Center, San
          Mateo County Hospital, and the frontage along the northern portion of US 101.

         b.         Development Buildout. Development Buildout -- the theoretical maximum
         development allowed by the General Plan's Building Intensity and Density standards
         prior to its amendment by initiative in November 1991 -- would have allowed for the
         addition of up to 16.9 million square feet of commercial development, or a 100%
         increase over the existing floor space, for an overall FAR of .77. The largest
         concentrations of commercial space would have been in the Downtown, Hillsdale
         Shopping Center, and at Mariner's Island. The neighborhood shopping centers would
         have been able to almost double their existing floor space. Office space would have been
         able to more than triple, making it the largest concentration of commercial space. The
         SR 92 corridor would have contained the largest single concentration of office space.
         Maximum theoretical residential buildout would have resulted in a total of 48,700
         dwellings with multi-family accounting for over 59% of all units. The number of
         dwellings could have been significantly higher depending on the number of
         commercial/residential mixed-use developments. Residential densities would have
         increased to a city average of 17 units/net acre, the equivalent of an R-2 (two-family
         dwellings) District.
         The November 1991 initiative General Plan amendments reduced the maximum
         theoretical buildout to bring it more into conformity with estimated (anticipated)
         development during the General Plan timeframe. The distribution of land uses remained
         similar to maximum theoretical buildout under the General Plan prior to the initiative,
         but the amount of development was reduced. Maximum theoretical residential
         development under the initiative is 1,815 units on vacant land, and 16,465 units in areas
         that are currently zoned to permit residential uses, for a total of 56,880 potential units.
         (See Appendices F and H) Maximum redevelopment for this amount of housing reduced
         the amount of commercial development.
3.       LAND USE STANDARDS.
State Planning Law requires that the Land Use Element incorporate standards for population
density and building intensity to provide a clear guide as to the appropriate use and maximum
development potential for all sites in the City of San Mateo. The Land Use Plan (Figure LU-3),
the Building Height Plan (Figure LU-4), the Building Intensity Plan (Figure LU-5), and the Land
Use Categories contained in Appendix B provide these standards by which all developments in
the City of San Mateo will be reviewed.

POLICIES
LU 1.1:             Planning Area Growth and Development to 2030. Plan for land uses,
                    population density, and land use intensity as shown on the Land Use, Height and
                    Building Intensity and City Image Plans for the entire planning area. Design the
                    circulation system and infrastructure to provide capacity for the total development
                    expected in 2030. Review projections annually and adjust infrastructure and
                    circulation requirements as required if actual growth varies significantly from that
                    projected.
The policies included in this plan support a wide variety of land uses and substantial growth of
both the commercial and residential sectors. The building intensity and density standards will
permit greater development in a more favorable market.
LU 1.2:             Land Use Plan. Adopt and maintain the Land Use Plan which graphically
                    displays the intended uses and development intensity/density for all land within
                    the planning area.
LU 1.3:             Land Use Standards. Adopt and maintain the land use categories included in
                    Appendix B defining the range of intended uses and linked to development
                    intensity/density limits.
LU 1.4:             Development Intensity/Density.                      Adopt and maintain the development
                    intensity/density limits as identified on the Land Use Map and Building Intensity
                    Plan, and as specified in Policy LU 6A.2. Development intensity/density shall
                    recognize natural environmental constraints, such as flood plains, earthquake
                    faults, debris flow areas, hazards, traffic and access, necessary services, and
                    general community and neighborhood design. Maintain a density and building
                    intensity range, with densities/intensities at the higher end of the range to be
                    considered based on provision of public benefits such as affordable housing,
                    increased open space, public plazas or recreational facilities, or off-site
                    infrastructure improvements.
In addition to criteria such as community design, protection of single-family neighborhoods,
avoidance of population overcrowding and traffic congestion, the determination of appropriate
intensity and density limitations has taken into account natural environmental constraints such as
topography and geotechnical hazards. Hazards such as landslide, flooding, and wildfire are
discussed in detail in the Safety Element.
Density of residential development is generally thought of as the number of dwelling units per
acre. However, State Planning Law requires that density also be expressed as population
density: the number of persons in a given land area. Density is displayed in both forms in the
Land Use Plan, Figure LU-3 and in the Land Use Categories, Appendix B.

Land Use
      The following language in italics was adopted by voter initiative in 2004 and cannot be
                       modified, revised or updated without voter approval.
The plan permits new multi-family residential development at a range of densities from 9 to 50
units net per acre, with the higher end of the density range to be used only for projects which
provide substantial public benefits or amenities. Residential development is also allowed in
commercial districts. If expected development takes place, the city-wide average density is
expected to increase from 10 to at least 12 units per net acre.
Building intensity is a measurement of the amount of physical development allowed on a parcel.
The Land Use Element utilizes a combination of building height and floor area ratio (FAR) (the
gross floor area of a building divided by the net lot area to measure building intensity.
The plan anticipates a range of new non-residential development by providing an FAR range of
0.5 up to a theoretical maximum of 3.0, and by establishing a range of permitted building heights
from 25 feet to 90 feet. Higher height limits and the higher end of the FAR range are available
only for projects which provide public benefits or amenities substantially greater than code
requirements.
The city-wide average FAR is expected to increase from .59, but to stay below .70, while average
height will remain less than 45 feet.
LU 1.5:         Building Height. Maintain maximum building height limits contained in
                Appendix C, and as specified in Policy LU 6A.2, closely matched with the Land
               Use categories and Building Intensity standards.
Requests for height changes consistent with the height ranges for specific land uses as
designated in Appendix C, entitled “Building Height”, may be considered by the City Council
only when accompanied by a request for change in land use designation. Such requests may be
approved only if the following findings are made:
        1.     The building has high design quality, which is enhanced by additional building
               height;
        2.     Increased building heights are visually related to surrounding building heights
               and promote the creation of a coherent City image;
        3.     Increased building heights will still provide for a variety of building heights in the
               vicinity of the project and the surrounding areas;
        4.     Increased building heights are compatible with surrounding land uses, and will
               not create adverse shadow or visual impacts on surrounding residential uses; and
        5.     The City’s infrastructure is adequate to accommodate the proposed development
Maximum height limits are intended to permit development which will not overburden the City's
infrastructure or circulation system, which is consistent with the plan's intensity/density

standards and is compatible with surrounding land uses, and which will preserve, to the extent
feasible, the City's existing character. Height limits range from 25 feet to 90 feet and are
contained in Appendices B and C.
Generally, the residential areas are restricted to low maximum heights (32 feet) to protect
established neighborhoods, although medium- and high-density multi-family areas have height
limits up to 55 feet, to accommodate increased density.
Non-residential maximum heights range from 25 feet (nearest low-density residential areas) to
90 feet (manufacturing, public facilities, and major institutions). Generally, the maximum height
is 55 feet.

                    single-family areas by limiting new development in such areas to single-family
                    uses, and protect predominantly duplex areas by limiting new development to
                    low-density residential uses as delineated on the Land Use Map. Consider
                    redesignating multi-family areas to single-family and low-density residential uses
                    where such uses predominant and where the creation of additional legal non-

It is the City's intent to provide ample housing and job opportunities for all its citizens by
encouraging a balance of commercial and residential growth.

Land Use
To meet the need for more housing, the City encourages multi-family residential development in
multi-family areas, on vacant land, and on non-residential sites appropriate for housing. At the
same time, San Mateo's pleasant single-family and low-density neighborhoods are prominent
community assets that merit conservation. In order to protect these neighborhoods from the
impacts of higher density redevelopment, it is intended that future development in these areas be
restricted to either single-family or low-density development, as designated.
      The following language in italics was adopted by voter initiative in 2004 and cannot be
                         modified, revised or updated without voter approval.
Maximum permitted density ranges for development are established to promote the increase of housing
stock consistent with the desired character of development. Residential density ranges are:
                 DENSITY                                  UNITS/                          POPULATION/

  Low-Density Multi-Family                                   9-17                                21-39
  Medium-Density Multi-Family                               18-35                                40-80
  High-Density Multi-Family                                 36-50                               81-115
The low-density category is intended for duplex and townhouse development which is generally
in close proximity to single-family areas, and often provides a buffer from higher density
residential or non-residential uses.
The medium-density category generally consists of apartment and condominium buildings
developed at two to four stories in height. The high density category includes multi-unit
buildings of up to 55 feet and three to five stories in height, generally located on or near major
streets ,in non-residential areas, surrounding the Downtown, and near train stations.
LU 1.10:         Commercial Development. Encourage industrial, service, retail, and office
                 development which is compatible with the desired character of the area and with
                 adjacent residential areas in terms of intensity of use, height, bulk and design as
                 delineated on the Land Use Plan, Building Height Plan and Building Intensity
                 Plan. Commercial development adjacent to residential areas shall address
                 concerns pertaining to traffic, truck loading, trash/recycling activities, noise,
                 visual impacts, and public safety including hazardous material storage, fire safety,
                 air pollutant emissions and odors.
Factors such as building height, bulk, design and intensity of use help to achieve high quality
urban design, to regulate traffic, and to minimize impact on neighboring uses.
II-12                                          Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010, Resolution No. 134-2010
                                                Amended by the City Council on April 18, 2011, Resolution No. 42 (2011)

Permissible land uses, heights, and floor area ratios have been determined taking into account
existing uses, traffic conditions, urban design, and desired character of the area.
All categories of residential development are allowed in all non-residential land use categories
other than the service and industrial categories and those listed as categories 7-11 in part B of
Appendix B; except that the maximum density residential category allowed in areas designated
as neighborhood commercial is medium-density multi-family.
Residential development in these commercial zones would be consistent with the descriptions in
the discussion of Policy LU-1.9.
To ensure that future commercial development is compatible with the desired future character,
projects shall meet the criteria established on the Land Use, Heights, and Building Intensities
Plans. Commercial development adjacent to residential areas shall address concerns pertaining
to traffic, truck loading, trash/recycling activities, noise, visual impacts, and public safety.
LU 1.11:            Commercial Focal Areas. Concentrate the most intense office and retail uses at
                    locations delineated on the Land Use Plan. Discourage such uses outside the
                    commercial nodes delineated on the Land Use Plan.
By concentrating major commercial development in nodal areas such as the Downtown,
Mariner's Island, and along SR 92, the City achieves comparatively efficient design of its
infrastructure and greater opportunities for transit usage. The viability and value of commercial
areas are also enhanced by concentrating high quality development in compatible areas.
Additionally, a more distinctive city image is established, and neighborhood impacts caused by
regional traffic are minimized.
LU 1.12:            Neighborhood Shopping Centers. Retain neighborhood shopping centers, with
                    retail being the predominant use, at low to medium intensities and locations
                    delineated on the Land Use Plan and Building Intensity Plan.
Neighborhood shopping centers provide convenient and accessible goods and services for
residents. They help to reduce traffic because they are typically within walking or short driving
distances from residences. Neighborhood shopping centers also provide a unifying element and
more distinctive community image to neighborhoods. It is the intent of the Plan that existing
neighborhood shopping centers be retained with neighborhood serving retail uses. These centers
are indicated on the Land Use Plan with a Neighborhood Commercial land use designation.
Maximum development potential is limited so that their neighborhood scale is maintained and
that potential impacts of larger regional centers on neighborhoods are avoided.
LU 1.13:            Prohibit Residential Uses in Service Commercial/Manufacturing Areas. To
                    promote the retention of service commercial areas which provide convenient, vital
                    community services and a balanced local economy; prohibit new residential
                    development in service commercial/manufacturing areas delineated on the Land
                    Use Plan. Require businesses locating adjacent to residential areas to minimize

Land Use
                nuisance impacts such as noise, odors, lighting glare, litter, intrusion of overflow
                parking and traffic.
Service commercial uses, including auto and truck repair, building material yards, and animal
hospitals, are recognized as important components of the overall land use mix. They provide
convenient access to needed services, generate tax revenues, and contribute to a diverse
employment base. However, given the nature of these uses, provisions are needed to minimize
nuisance impacts such as noise, odors, litter and blight, especially near residential
neighborhoods. This may include limitations on outdoor storage, screening, and upgrade of
buildings. Major service commercial strips include: Amphlett Boulevard, Claremont/Railroad
Avenue and Palm Avenue.
LU 1.14:        Special Use Permit for Residential Uses. To ensure a balanced mix of land use
                categories and to minimize nuisance impacts between conflicting uses a special
                use permit shall be required for residential uses in areas designated as
                neighborhood commercial, regional community commercial, and executive office
                on the Land Use Plan. However, mixed use land use designations are exempt
                from this requirement, as is development on the Hillsdale Shopping Center
                Property subject to the Q5 Qualified Overlay District, so long as such
                development is consistent with a Master Development Plan prepared consistent
                with the policies of this General Plan.
The City must strike a careful balance between the need and demand for housing and eroding its
office and commercial bases. Requiring a special use permit for residential uses in neighborhood
commercial, regional community commercial, and executive office areas will allow for a change
in land use from commercial or office to residential on case-by-case basis when appropriate.
LU 1.15:        Mixed Use. Encourage developments which mix commercial retail and office
                uses with residential uses at locations and intensities/densities as delineated on the
                Land Use Plan and Building Intensity Plan.
Mixed use development joins two different land uses on one parcel, or a combination of uses on
different parcels. Typical mixed use development combines retail or office use with residences.
Mixed use can benefit the community by providing a diversity of services and activities,
providing greater proximity between jobs and housing, promoting more pedestrian activity, and
reducing traffic congestion.
These areas are typically served by heavily traveled roadways, and include properties along El
Camino Real, 20th Avenue, the Downtown, and San Mateo Drive. Areas of the City where
mixed use is especially encouraged are indicated on the Land Use Plan. To encourage residential
development, building intensity bonuses are provided, as delineated on the Building Intensity
Plan.
II-14                                       Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010, Resolution No. 134-2010

LU 1.16:            Hotels. Encourage development of hotels in commercial areas and allow small
                    "bed and breakfast" hotels in multiple family areas where they are consistent with
                    the density of adjacent uses.
Development of hotels is allowed in all commercial areas unless specifically prohibited by a
Planning Area policy. Hotel development has both a regional and local benefit. San Mateo is a
prominent business center on the Peninsula, is close to San Francisco International Airport, and
has a major events center at the County Fairgrounds. Hotels are high tax generators for the City;
help support tourism, the office sector, and convention/exhibition space; and provide local
employment opportunities for less skilled workers.
LU 1.17:            Transportation Corridors. Maintain adequate transportation corridors to
                    accommodate highway and rail transit. Consider redesignation of portions of the
                    railway corridor not required for transportation purposes for development which
                    is compatible with adjacent uses and does not generate significant adverse
                    impacts.
The primary intended use of “Transportation Corridors” is circulation. These corridors include
US 101, SR 92 and the rail line. It is intended that these corridors be protected from encroaching
development which might interfere with the transportation use or create a hazardous condition.
However, the City recognizes the potential opportunity for development on portions of the
transportation corridors which could benefit the intended transportation use. The General Plan
therefore allows for potential redesignation of portions of the corridor. An example of a project
would be a train station in conjunction with an office and retail development which would serve
and attract commuters. This policy also addresses possible air rights development over the rail
line.
LU 1.18:            Major Institutions/Special Facilities. Encourage the retention of major
                    institutions and special facilities such as the San Mateo County Events Center,
                    College of San Mateo, San Mateo County Hospital, Mills Health Center, and
                    Peninsula Golf and Country Club. Allow reuse or redevelopment of institutions
                    and special facilities subject to the approval of a Specific Plan and/or Master Plan.
A number of major institutions provide recreational, educational, or medical services that are
important to the community. It is the City's intent to retain these facilities by encouraging
development consistent with the primary goal of the institution and which supports its long-term
viability. Housing on Lower Lot 17 at the College of San Mateo for faculty and staff of the San
Mateo County Community College District, the San Mateo Union High School District and the
San Mateo-Foster City Elementary School District is found to be consistent with this policy.
It is recognized; however, that over time, there is the potential for these institutions to redevelop
to other uses. Given the size of these properties and relationship to adjacent neighborhoods, an
appropriate intensity of use and sensitive site design would be necessary to avoid adverse
community impacts. In order to ensure that any future redevelopment occurs in a

comprehensively planned manner, it is the City's policy that a Specific Plan and/or Master Plan
be prepared for the entire property, prior to redevelopment or reuse.
LU 1.19:         Legal Non-conforming Developments.                     Allow legally established non-
                 conforming uses and buildings to be maintained and to be reconstructed if
                 destroyed by fire or natural disaster; allow minor expansion of legal non-
                 conforming developments. Encourage reconstruction and/or minor expansion to
                 have a design which is visually compatible with surrounding development.
This policy continues the 1989 policy which provides that when a building or use is more than
50% destroyed by fire or natural disaster, the building may be rebuilt or the use re-established if
it is located in a district which generally allows the same type of use. The policy also allows for
minor expansion of legal non-conforming uses, as long as the design of the expanded portion is
visually compatible with adjacent development, the intensity and density limits are not exceeded
and it complies with the City's development standards.
LU 1.20:         Code Enforcement. As a high priority support code enforcement to ensure that
                 all uses are in compliance with City codes and conditions of development
                 approval.
Code enforcement is provided as a service to city residents and businesses to ensure compliance
with the City's codes and conditions of development approval. Code enforcement actions
include administering the nuisance ordinance, coordinating health and safety inspections,
following through on citizen complaints and insuring compliance with the conditions of
development approval. Strong code enforcement creates a more safe and livable environment.

GOAL 2a:         Promote economic vitality which provides jobs for existing and future residents
                 and maintains the City's ability to finance public improvements and human
                 services.
GOAL 2b:         Develop and implement a long-term economic development plan and take actions
                 to create financial stability for the City and high-value-added jobs for its
                 residents.
GOAL 2c:         Promote an intensity of commercial activity that enhances the business climate in
                 the City to increase the level of business types which will benefit existing
                 commercial uses.
GOAL 2d:         Encourage the development and redevelopment of major sites delineated in the
                 City's economic development plan.
GOAL 2e:         Maintain streamlined Development Review and Building Permit processes.

POLICIES
LU 2.1:             Economic Development. Attract new businesses and encourage the retention
                    and expansion of existing businesses which enhance the City's economic base.
LU 2.2:             High City Revenue Generators. Retain existing businesses and attract new
                    businesses which are high City revenue generators.
LU 2.3:             Local Employment.                  Encourage uses which provide opportunities for
                    employment of all the City's residents, with emphasis placed on major employers
                    that provide high value-added jobs.
It is the City's intent to promote continued economic growth and to expand job opportunities for
San Mateo residents. To accomplish these goals, the City will continue to encourage the
retention and expansion of existing businesses and attract new ones. A modern state of the art
telecommunications infrastructure is vital to support this effort. The City should particularly
encourage businesses which pay salaries high enough to permit employees to live in San Mateo.
Uses such as auto dealerships, hotels, or major retail centers are high revenue producers,
generating income for the General Fund. This income ensures adequate resources to pay for
infrastructure improvements and to finance needed City services such as police, fire, parks and
recreation and libraries. The City also desires to retain existing businesses and attract new ones
that emphasize high value-added jobs. These jobs are typically created and required in the areas
of high-technology, software, and financial industries.
LU 2.4:             Downtown Plan. Establish downtown San Mateo as the social, cultural, and
                    economic center of the City with a wide range of office, medical, residential,
                    entertainment, and retail uses at high intensities and densities while encouraging
                    pedestrian activity and bicycle connectivity to adjacent neighborhoods.
A major goal of the General Plan and the Downtown Plan is to establish the City’s downtown as
the social, cultural, and economic center of the City. The plan envisions a downtown core that
includes a strong retail and office center, high-density housing, public uses, and utilizes the
transit center as a major transportation hub. At the same time, it is important to retain the
character of San Mateo. The downtown will also benefit by an increase in patrons from nearby
neighborhoods traveling by foot and bicycle. This activity enlivens the sidewalks and streets,
while encouraging active, healthy lifestyles.

Land Use
This policy recognizes the responsibility of the City to work with local businesses, economic
development organizations, residents, the Chamber of Commerce, and the Downtown San Mateo
Association in maintaining the Economic Development Strategy plan for the City. The elements
of the plan outline the City's current economic situation, strengths and weaknesses; state goals
and objectives to achieve a desired level of economic certainty; improve linkages with existing
businesses; provide strategies for business retention and attraction; identify targeted sites and
businesses; and include implementation measures such as a marketing program.
LU 2.6:         Development Review Process. Review development proposals and building
                permit applications in an efficient and timely manner while maintaining quality
                standards in accordance with City codes, policies, and regulations.
The development review process is provided by the City to ensure compliance with City codes,
policies, and regulations, while striving for high quality development that is compatible with its
surroundings and provides tangible community benefits including the creation of good jobs,
increased revenue for the City, and affordable housing. It is the responsibility of the City to:
ensure that the review process is performed in an efficient and timely manner; take time to
understand the applicant's goals and use knowledge and experience to help applicant's achieve
these goals; look for solutions to problems and be responsive to community concerns; promote
positive communication at all levels of review; and provide analysis and advice to decision-
makers on an ongoing basis.
LU 2.7:         Visitor Economy. Support the continued development of the City's visitor
                economy including lodging, entertainment, recreation, retail, and a lively local
                character.
San Mateo has a wide variety of uses and activities that attract and support visitors from outside
the community. Uses and activities such as shopping centers, restaurants, theaters, recreational
facilities, San Mateo County events center, and the downtown area bring Bay Area as well as
world wide visitors to the City, while the various lodging facilities provide living
accommodations. The various uses and facilities that attract and support these visitors shall be
encouraged to locate or be retained in the City.
LU 2.8:         Convenience Retail. Encourage and preserve convenience retail uses located
                adjacent to residential neighborhoods.
LU 2.9:         Support Service Uses. Encourage a variety of support service uses such as
                restaurants, day care facilities, and markets in locations that are appropriate to
                provide services to residential neighborhoods and commercial uses.
A significant portion of the City's economy is based on uses that support local neighborhoods
and business areas. These uses provide goods and services to residents and workers who find
convenience in the close proximity of local retailers, food markets, day care facilities, and other
uses to serve their immediate needs. These types of services and uses are encouraged to locate in
areas where their business benefits the neighborhood economy.
II-18                                       Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010, Resolution No. 134-2010

LU 2.10:            Optimize Development Opportunities. Ensure that developments optimize the
                    development potential of property in major commercial areas such as the
                    Downtown Retail Core and along South El Camino Real.
Since San Mateo is a "built-out" community, large sites with the potential for significant
development are limited. In order to enhance and strengthen the City's major commercial areas,
such as the Downtown Retail Core and along El Camino Real, the City should encourage
development in these areas which seek to optimize use of the site and represents a substantial
economic development opportunity.
3.       AREAS OF SPECIAL CONCERN.
a.       Downtown.
GOAL 3a:            Maintain downtown San Mateo as an economic, cultural, and social center of the
                    community.
POLICIES
LU 3.1:             Downtown Plan. As the social, cultural and economic center of the City, the
                    downtown shall maintain a wide range of office, medical, residential,
                    entertainment, and retail uses at high intensities and densities.
San Mateo’s downtown has historically been viewed as the center of the City. A vibrant retail,
office and residential environment has been created over the past several years, as recent
developments including the Downtown Cinema, Downtown Train Station, new Main Street
garage and other public and private development have taken place. The pedestrian nature of the
downtown and its proximity to Central Park have also helped to enhance the quality of the
downtown experience.
The vision for downtown San Mateo is to provide a pedestrian-friendly environment that adds
charm to what has traditionally served as the center of the community. In the next ten years, the
mix of historic buildings and new development will provide for retail, entertainment and housing
opportunities. Central Park will provide a unique opportunity as an open space, recreational and
cultural resource for the downtown, as well as the entire community. Downtown will remain a
focal point of the community, both as a reminder of its historic heritage, and as a harbinger of
San Mateo’s role as the pre-eminent City in San Mateo County.
LU 3.2:             Significant Historic Structures. Protect key landmarks, historic structures, and
                    the historic character that exists in parts of downtown as defined in the
                    Conservation/Open Space Element.
Downtown is of particular importance with respect to historic resources. The areas along Third
Avenue and B Street contain the largest concentration of historic structures, adding to the unique
sense of place. However, there is the need to balance historic preservation with the need for new

development. Encourage development which creates a diverse urban form but at the same time
ensure that new buildings are in scale and compatible with the existing downtown buildings.
The Land Use, Height, and Building Intensity Plans show the basic policies adopted for
Downtown San Mateo. These are further elaborated in the Downtown Plan, which implements
the policies of the General Plan.
b.      El Camino Real.
GOAL 3b:        Promote residential land uses and the visual improvement of El Camino Real.
POLICY
LU 3.3:         El Camino Real. Retain the general residential and landscaped character of El
                Camino Real north of Tilton Avenue. Promote the visual upgrading of El Camino
                Real south of Ninth Avenue through increased landscaping, coordination of
                public improvements, property maintenance, and sign control, through
                conformance with the El Camino Real Master Plan. Residential uses shall be
                encouraged to provide diversity to the existing commercial character, and
                building setbacks from adjoining residences used to reduce perceived building
                mass from El Camino Real. Pedestrian activity and safety should be encouraged.
El Camino Real is the dominant commercial boulevard and heavily traveled local corridor in the
City. Its long linear form and strip commercial development help mold strong visual images,
portions of which may be judged to be unpleasant. More than most other local corridors the
street image strongly affects the overall City image. El Camino Real's image should be
improved through coordinated comprehensive public and private improvements which follow the
guidelines and standards in the El Camino Real Master Plan. Economic development strategies
should also be considered as part of any improvement effort along El Camino Real.
In 2001, the City Council adopted the El Camino Real Master Plan which provides a vision for
enhancements to El Camino Real from SR 92 to the Belmont City Limits border. The Master
Plan provides infrastructure and guidelines to create a vibrant mixed-use community that
encourages pedestrian and bicycle activity and safety. The Master Plan includes a streetscape
plan for public improvements such as landscaping medians, creating theme intersections with
landscaping and street furniture, and recommendations for parking enhancements. Design
guidelines address the character of private development along the El Camino Real corridor.
Topics such as building facades, setbacks, building form, location of parking, and signage are
discussed in the guidelines. The Master Plan identifies a range of land uses for El Camino Real
from infill development to larger scale transit-oriented development around the Hillsdale and
Hayward Park Caltrain stations.
Through the Grand Boulevard Initiative Plan, which is a collaboration of cities and other
agencies in San Mateo and Santa Clara counties, the City will continue planning efforts to

improve multimodal access along the El Camino Real corridor including housing and economic
development opportunities.
c.       Caltrain Station Transit-Oriented Development Areas
GOAL 3c:            Promote transit-oriented development in designated areas adjacent to Caltrain
stations.
POLICIES
LU 3.4:             Rail Corridor Transit-Oriented Development Plan (Corridor Plan).
                    Implement the Corridor Plan to allow, encourage, and provide guidance for the
                    creation of world class transit-oriented development (TOD) within a half-mile
                    radius of the Hillsdale and Hayward Park Caltrain station areas, while maintaining
                    and improving the quality of life for those who already live and work in the area.
                    Development within the plan area shall comply with the policies of the Plan.
LU 3.5:             Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) Land Use Designation. Maintain TOD
                    land use designations for areas in direct proximity to the Hillsdale and Hayward
                    Park Caltrain stations.
LU 3.6:             Hillsdale Station Area Plan. Implement the Hillsdale Station Area Plan to
                    develop a relocated Hillsdale Caltrain Station around an intermodal transit center
                    surrounded by mixed-use development and other transit-oriented forms of
                    development that is connect to neighborhoods to the east and west as well as the
                    25th Avenue business district.
The San Mateo Rail Corridor Transit-Oriented Development Plan (Corridor Plan) includes
transit supportive policies, land uses, development densities, height standards, and design
guidelines. These policies include the establishment of two TOD zones located within the larger
plan area in the vicinity of the Hayward Park and Hillsdale Stations. The Corridor Plan will
minimize the impacts from growth that would otherwise occur with the more dispersed
development pattern that would otherwise occur with existing land use standards.
Contributing to the realization of transit-oriented development are potential benefits resulting
from the Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board’s increasing investment in its Caltrain
commuter rail line, including the redesign of both stations, and more frequent service from the
Baby Bullet express service commuter train. These improvements will add to the desirability of
living and working near the stations.
The City also values the importance of providing multimodal access improvements, which could
include transit feeder service and bike pedestrian facilities linked with appropriate land use
decisions, outside of the quarter mile radius of bus stops to compliment transit services.

GOAL 4a:        Facilities. Seek to provide a safe and predictable supply of water, and provide
                storm drainage, sewer and flood control facilities adequate to serve existing
                needs, the projected population and employment growth and to reduce the
                associated life safety and health risks to acceptable levels.
GOAL 4b:        Public Facilities. Support the provision and maintenance of adequate sites and
                public facilities owned and/or operated by the City or other government agencies
                to meet existing needs and the projected 2030 population and employment
                including, schools, post office facilities, recreation facilities, libraries, art centers,
                museums, and offices. Encourage joint use and public-private partnerships where
                feasible.
GOAL 4c:        Health and Safety. Protect the community's health, safety, and welfare by
                maintaining adequate fire and life safety protection, providing a safe environment
                with a minimum of crime, reducing unreasonable risk to life and property caused
                by flooding, earthquakes or other natural disasters, and managing the use, storage,
                transport and disposal of hazardous materials.
POLICIES
LU 4.1:         Fiscal Evaluation and Priorities. All policies herein which seek to: 1) establish
                levels of service provided by the City or 2) address the construction of City
                buildings, shall be guiding principles only and shall be subject to the governing
                fiscal policies and priorities established by the City Council in the budget.
This policy recognizes the responsibility and authority of the City Council to establish fiscal
policies and service levels during the budget process. This policy ensures that the City Council's
fiscal policies act to govern the policies subsequently set forth in this Plan. Policies setting
levels of service for police, fire, and other services as well as policies addressing new services
and City building and facilities, are to be interpreted pursuant to this policy.
LU 4.2:     Developer's Contribution Policy. Require new development to pay on an equitable
            basis for new or expanded public improvements needed to support the new or
            changed land use or development.
New development should pay in full the public improvements needed to support the land use,
and share on a proportional basis the costs of current City programs which the proposed land use
will impact.
LU 4.3:     Location of Critical Facilities. Encourage active, healthy lifestyles, by promoting
            pedestrian and bicycle connectivity between civic facilities. Avoid locating critical
            facilities, such as hospitals, schools, fire, police, emergency service facilities and

               utilities in areas subject to slope failure, flooding and other hazards as identified in
               the Safety Element, where feasible.
The City values active, healthy lifestyles by promoting walking and bicycling to public facilities,
as well as, encouraging pedestrian and bicycle access between civic facilities.
Critical public and private facilities should not be located in hazardous areas because these
facilities provide vital basic services without which the community cannot adequately function
especially during emergencies such as flooding and earthquakes.
Because some facilities are already located in hazardous areas the City should take steps to
reduce the hazard threat especially from flooding, fire and building collapse during an
earthquake. Expansion of facilities in hazardous locations is allowed where risk to life can be
reduced to an acceptable level.
a.       Water Supply/Storm Drainage/Waste Water/Street Maintenance.
LU 4.4:             Water Supply. Seek to ensure a safe and predictable water system for existing
                    and future development by taking the following actions:
                    1.       As a high priority, work with California Water Company and Estero
                             Municipal Improvement District and adjacent jurisdictions to develop
                             supplemental water sources and conservation efforts.
                    2.       Strongly encourage water conservation by implementing pro-active water
                             conservation methods, including requiring all new development to install
                             low volume flush toilets, low-flow shower heads, and utilize drip
                             irrigation while promoting high-efficiency washing machines and
                             establishing an education program to improve water conservation
                             practices.
                    3.       Investigate the feasibility of developing capacity to use recycled
                             wastewater, stormwater runoff, graywater and ground water that will
                             enable reuse of water for irrigation purposes, freeing comparable potable
                             water supplies for other uses.
The City of San Mateo is supplied with water by the California Water Service Company and the
Estero Municipal Improvement District. Suburban communities on the Peninsula, including San
Mateo, obtain water via contractual agreement with the San Francisco Public Utilities
Commission (SFPUC). The contract provides 184 million gallon a day (mgd) for all water
service agencies.
Programs outlined by local water agencies such as public information, plumbing retrofit,
residential and commercial water audits, and low flow toilet regulations have led to a reduction
in water usage over the last several years.

Land Use
San Mateo County has sponsored the "Comprehensive Water Resources Management Plan"
which involves participation by local water agencies. As part of this plan, California Water
Service Company has developed their "Urban Water Management Plan" which allocates
approximately 35.35 MGD for all of its districts. As a part of the Mid-Peninsula District, 13.25
MGD could be considered for use by the City of San Mateo, which is an increase over the 10.2
MGD allotment established in 1989.
The countywide "Comprehensive Water Resources Management Plan" has confirmed that
SFWD will be the sole provider of water to the City. The plan includes provisions for emergency
supply and discusses alternative water sources such as reclaimed water.
Water sources for the District may be limited due to climate changes in addition to unforeseen
failures or forces of nature, such as earthquakes or regional power failures. During such events,
significant shortages in water supply may occur. As such, a contingency plan which includes
voluntary and mandatory consumption reduction methods are outlined in detail in the Urban
Water Management Plan. The Urban Water Management Plan also includes detailed
information pertaining to water sources, water use provisions, supply demand comparisons,
water supply interruptions, and water demand management.
LU 4.4.5: Stormwater Treatment. Continue to implement the San Mateo Countywide
             Stormwater Pollution Prevention Program to ensure compliance with the National
             Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit.
             1.   Prevent water pollution from point and non-point sources.
             2.   Minimize stormwater runoff and pollution by encouraging low-impact design
                  features, such as pervious parking surfaces, bioswales and filter strips in new
                  development.
             3.   Encourage the use of drought-tolerant and native vegetation in landscaping.
The City of San Mateo is required under the countywide stormwater pollution prevention
program to prevent stormwater pollution. The principal goal is to minimize erosion, sediment,
and other waste runoff from active construction sites and to implement effective post-
construction permanent treatment measures. The City has implemented design and permit
requirements based on the current NPDES permit. With the requirements set forth under the
permit, the City has managed to prevent further erosion of our natural creeks, increase the
amount of natural vegetation, and decrease the amount of stormwater runoff from in-fill
development projects with the use of specific guidelines, pamphlets, and project conditions of
approval.
LU 4.5:         Wastewater Treatment Plant Expansion. Provide adequate waste water
                treatment for the projected 2030 service area population, employment and
                development. Require that any future expansion of the Waste Water Treatment
                Plant (WWTP) be designed to be compatible with the adjacent parks, school, and
                low-density residential areas by screening views of the WWTP with extensive and
                tall landscaping and reducing the height of all new structures to the maximum

                    practicably feasible. Any future expansion of the WWTP shall take into account
                    the possible rise in sea level.
The City's underground collection system is comprised of 260 miles of sanitary sewer lines and
75 miles of storm drains. Storm drains, or "outdoor drainage" typically flow to the nearest creek
or watercourse. Indoor waste drains are connected to a network of sewer lines that flow into the
wastewater treatment plant where the waste is treated before is discharged into the San Francisco
Bay.
The City's Wastewater Treatment Plant has been in operation since 1935 and treats an average of
12.1 million gallons per day (mgd.) An average of 7.5 dry tons of biosolids (sludge) are
removed from the plant process each day. A 1996 expansion increased hydraulic capacity from
13.6 mgd to 15.7 mgd.
Since its initial construction in the 1930's, the plant has been surrounded by residential uses. If
additional expansion of the WWTP becomes necessary, the new structures should be compatible
with the adjacent residential areas in terms of height, bulk and design. Where it is not
technologically feasible to achieve design compatibility, then extensive landscaping screening is
necessary.
LU 4.6:             Inter-Agency Coordination. Coordinate future expansion or modification of the
                    Wastewater Treatment Plant with the other users of the plant including the Estero
                    Municipal Improvement District (Foster City), the Crystal Springs County
                    Sanitation District, Hillsborough and Belmont.
The Wastewater Treatment Plant provides wastewater treatment for the cities and agencies
referred to in Policy 4.6, through agreements with those agencies. As such, future decisions
regarding plant operations should be coordinated with representatives of these agencies.
LU 4.7:             Sewer System. Provide a sewer system which safely and efficiently conveys

                    1.       Comprehensive Sewer System Study. As a high priority maintain the
                             comprehensive sewer system study to assess the efficiency and integrity of
                             the sewer lines and facilities, and develop a Capital Improvement Program
                             to make any necessary improvements.
                    2.       Sewer Requirements for New Development. Require new major multi-
                             family and commercial developments to evaluate the main sewer lines in
                             the project vicinity which will be utilized by the new development and
                             make any improvements necessary to convey the additional sewage flows.

The purpose of the City of San Mateo’s Sewer System Management Plan is to document
activities that the City utilizes to manage its wastewater collection system effectively. Effective
management of a collection system includes minimizing the number and impact of sanitary
sewer overflows, providing adequate sewer capacity to convey peak flows, and maintaining and
improving the condition of the collection system infrastructure in order to provide reliable
service in to the future. The SSMP is intended to meet the requirements of both the Regional
Water Quality Control Board and the Statewide General Waste Discharge Requirements.
Eliminating sewer system overflows to protect water quality and the City’s shores is a high
priority.
b.       Public Buildings.
LU 4.8:          Library Resources and Services.                 Continue to maintain a comprehensive
                 collection of resources and services to help the community discover, enjoy,
                 connect and learn in an ever-changing world while offering quality library
                 services and programs to a diverse community promoting literacy and ongoing
                 learning.
San Mateo’s first library was established in 1885 by volunteers who recognized the importance
of a shared community resource for literacy and culture. The City of San Mateo took over the
property and operations in 1899. Two neighborhood branches were added in 1956 (Hillsdale)
and 1966 (Marina).
In the 1990s the library had outgrown its facility; therefore, a library committee was formed to
search for a site for a new main library and to develop a funding plan. Also, the San Mateo
Public Library Foundation was created to raise funds to support library services. In 1999, a $30
million bond measure for a new main library was passed and planning for the new main library
began. Construction of the new main library was complete and opened in downtown San Mateo
in 2006.
The new San Mateo Main Library received the U.S. Green Building Council’s Gold LEED
(Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) standards for environmentally sustainable
design. The San Mateo Main Library was designed and built as a green facility in response to
strong sentiments from the San Mateo community that the new library be a sustainable building.
The Hillsdale and Marina branch libraries also underwent a year long remodeling project
reopening in 2004.
LU 4.9:          Cultural and Entertainment Facilities. Encourage the establishment of cultural
                 and entertainment facilities in the downtown core and allow these types of uses to
                 fulfill retail frontage requirements.
Theaters, cinemas, restaurants, and other activities make downtown more attractive at night.
These types of facilities will promote the night time use of downtown, as opposed to uses that are
primarily active during the working day; and will be encouraged by allowing them to fulfill
II-26                                          Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010, Resolution No. 134-2010

ground floor retail frontage requirements. These types of uses will also contribute to the night
time environment which has been spurred by the development of the Downtown Century
Cinema.
LU 4.10:            Police Station. Provide Police Station facilities to meet the facility requirements
                    through 2030.
Completed in 2009, the new San Mateo Police Station facility consists of a two-story 45,000
square foot main building and includes various functional ancillary and service areas and
parking. The new station houses the City’s Emergency Operation Center and Dispatch Center.
The new Police Station utilizes sustainable or "green" technology, incorporating many energy
saving features that will save the City in energy costs compared to conventional buildings.
LU 4.11:            Fire Stations. Maintain a high level of service by modernizing Fire Stations.
                    Provide new stations and improvements to existing stations and training facilities
                    to meet equipment, staffing, and training requirements, as well as, Essential
                    Services Building Requirements.
The provision and maintenance of adequate and modern fire control, advanced life support,
hazard mitigation and emergency response is important in safeguarding life and property. In
1995, the average age of the city’s fire stations was 42 years which has led to a station
modernization program. This program allows for the remodeling and relocation of facilities to
ensure that minimal response times are guaranteed in accordance with industry standards.
Fire Station seismic upgrades and improvements are scheduled to be completed by 2012 to
accomplish the duties expected by the public. In early 2000, Fire Station No. 21, located in a
historic building downtown, was renovated and the brand new Fire Station No. 26 (Lakeshore
Park) was relocated from the old station No. 26 on Norfolk. Fire Station No. 23 (designated as
the training facility) and No. 24 are still in need of improvements. A new training facility is also
necessary because the present site is inadequate in size and incompatible with the adjacent
residential uses. A Self-Assessment of the Organization has been completed in accordance with a
nationally accredited format to guide the Department in determining its facility needs and the
option for a joint training facility with the College of San Mateo is being reviewed.
LU 4.12:            Corporation Yard. Provide for such corporation yard functions as new vehicle
                    repair facilities, administrative office space, and other facilities needed through
                    2030. Consider co-locating public works facilities and operations where feasible.
The corporation yard provides for storage of materials, supplies and equipment necessary to
support City offices, parks, road and sewer repair, and vehicle maintenance. Relocation or
expansion of the yard is necessary to provide adequate administration space, storage, and repair
facilities for the City vehicles and equipment. Assuming adequate room for facilities to operate,
consider consolidating public works facilities for ease of functions and maintenance operations.

LU 4.13:       City Hall. Provide City Hall office space, and consider construction of a
               Downtown facility to meet City staffing needs through the year 2030.
City Hall should provide its functions essential to the community, including engineering, finance,
public works, community development, city clerk, city manager, city attorney, and council offices,
in a single-convenient location. Locating City Hall in the Downtown would reinforce the image of
Downtown as the center of the City and would contribute to its economic vitality.
c.      Schools.
LU 4.14:       School Assistance. As a high priority, support quality public education.
LU 4.15:       School Site Reuse or Redevelopment. Ensure that reuse or redevelopment of
               surplus public school sites is compatible with surrounding land uses. At the time
               any school sites are declared surplus, establish residential densities consistent with
               surrounding densities. Give first priority and consideration to community
               recreation needs for reuse of school sites in accordance with the priorities in the
               Open Space\Conservation Element. Where it is in the community's interests to
               retain public recreation facilities, consider allowing density transfers from the
               portion of the site retained in public recreation use, as a means of reducing the cost
               of retaining the recreation facilities and achieving the maximum amount of housing.
Five public school districts and a number of private schools serve the student population in San
Mateo. Most of San Mateo is located within the San Mateo-Foster City Elementary School
District (SMFCSD), and the San Mateo Union High School District. Portions of Sugarloaf and the
southern part of San Mateo are within the Belmont-Redwood Shores Elementary School District
and Sequoia Union High School District. The San Mateo Community College District covers the
entire planning area. Private schools are operated by a number of independent agencies, with the
largest the Archdiocese of San Francisco.
School enrollment trends and capacity levels are reviewed annually by the School District. Based
on enrollment data for the 2007/2008 school year, with the exception of Baywood Elementary, all
of the elementary schools in the City of San Mateo are operating under capacity. Both Abbot and
Borel Middle Schools are operating over capacity; however, Abbot Middle School has seen a
decrease in enrollment from 829 in 2002/2003 to 768 in 2007/2008.
To offset school operating costs, reuse or redevelopment of former school sites to other uses can
provide needed revenue. It is important that reuse or redevelopment be compatible with adjacent
uses in terms of height, density and design, and that public recreation facilities be provided.
Appropriate densities for reuse, consistent with surrounding properties, will be established at the
time any sites are declared surplus. School properties provide valuable community recreation
resources, and first priority and consideration in the reuse of school facilities should be given to
retaining the open space for recreational uses. The City may permit on-site density transfers to
maximize development opportunities, retain recreation facilities, and provide adequate income to
the schools.

d.       Communications.
LU 4.16:            Service Improvement and Expansion. Seek to ensure adequate gas, electric and
                    communication systems to serve existing and future needs while minimizing
                    impacts on existing and future residents by taking the following actions:
                    1.       Underground electrical and communication transmission and distribution
                             lines in residential and commercial areas as funds permit.
                    2.       Require all new developments to underground lines and provide
                             underground connections when feasible.
                    3.       Balance the need for cellular coverage with the desire to minimize visual
                             impacts of cellular facilities, antennas, and equipment shelters.
New development proposals should underground all gas, electric and communication lines and
screen facilities (including but not limited to transformers, satellite dishes and cellular facilities)
when feasible, to improve the public safety and the City's appearance.
e.       Library Services.
LU 4.17:            Library Service. Maintain a materials budget, staffing, and service hours for the
                    City's library system that are adequate to meet the community needs, provide
                    current and adequate materials, and meet the continuing changes in information
                    technology.
The library performs an essential and heavily utilized information service. Community demand
for library services is rapidly changing and growing, and that information is rapidly changing
and expanding. To keep pace with community demand for library services and to maintain high
quality library customer service adequate City resources need to be devoted to the libraries and
their staffing.
f. Hospital and Medical Services.
LU 4.18:            San Mateo County Hospital. Encourage the County to maintain County
                    Hospital services in the City to provide access to medical care for all the City's
                    residents.
LU 4.19:            Mills Health Center. Support the Mills Health Center remaining in San Mateo,
                    and encourage the continued provision and expansion of high-quality medical
                    care services.
A significant sector of San Mateo's economic base is medical services. San Mateo is fortunate to
have Mills Health Center and the County General Hospital because they provide access to a
range of medical service and cost options. The City's policy is to encourage the retention of both

medical facilities. The Mills facility is converting from an in-patient hospital to an out-patient
medical facility and has constructed an arthritis center building. San Mateo County Hospital has
renovated its facilities to reflect current patient and administrative needs.
As the population ages the provision of emergency services may become more important.
LU 4.20:        Medical Services. Maintain the highest level of medical emergency readiness
                and response capabilities possible by encouraging inter-agency medical drills and
                exercises where hospital personnel work with emergency responders in the field
                and with Emergency Operation Centers and by encouraging citizens to become
                trained in basic medical triage and first aid through the Community Emergency
                Response Team (CERT).
To provide a high level of emergency medical response throughout San Mateo the Fire
Department is partnered with San Mateo County Emergency Medical Services and American
Medical Response in a public-private partnership (joint powers agreement). This has resulted in
a boundary drop for emergency response throughout San Mateo County and the ability to ensure
that residence receive the highest level of care in the shortest amount of time.
With the conversion of Mills Hospital to an out-patient treatment facility, urgent care, and
rehabilitation center and the remodeling of the San Mateo County General Hospital, the City will
continue to encourage the County, Mills Health Center and emergency services to coordinate
their actions to maintain a high level of service for the citizens of San Mateo.
The San Mateo Office of Emergency Services will continue to prepare residents by providing
disaster education and first aid training so that Community Emergency Response Team of
citizens will augment the response of public safety personnel in a major disaster.
g.      Child Care.
LU 4.21:        Child Care. Support the provision of child care programs and facilities to meet
                current needs and the needs through 2030 by taking the following actions:
                1.       Encourage public and private agencies and employers to provide child
                         care services and facilities. Retain existing centers and support programs
                         at school sites and other quasi-institutional facilities, because of their
                         suitability for such uses and convenient locations in residential
                         neighborhoods.
                2.       Encourage the location of child care facilities which are consistent with
                         State standards. Continue to allow child care centers in residential
                         neighborhoods where they meet City standards, and encourage them at
                         work centers.

The participation of women in the work force and the high proportion of single-parent
households have generated an unprecedented demand for affordable child care. The provision of
affordable child care to help meet this demand is important to the social and economic well being
of families, the community and businesses.
Encouragement of both public and private efforts to assist meeting child care demand is
necessary to meet the needs of all San Mateo families. The City has addressed this issue by
revising the zoning code to permit child care facilities in all commercial and office zoning
districts; allow child care centers in residential zones subject to approval of a special use permit;
and the exclusion of day care centers from floor area calculations when they are accessory to the
principal use on a site.
As the City of San Mateo plans for new housing, businesses and transportation the City
recognizes that high quality childcare is a critical support for the economic growth of our
families, and the intellectual and social development of our children. The City is committed to
enhancing the supply of childcare spaces for children of all ages.
LU 4.22:            Child Care and New Construction. Encourage inclusion of space for child care
                    in new residential and non-residential developments by taking the following
                    actions:
                    1.       Provide incentives for inclusion of space for a child care center in a new
                             development.
                    2.       Promote child care to developers as an amenity favored by the City.
                    3.       Include child care in appropriate redevelopment projects and for
                             redevelopment funds.
                    4.       Continue to implement the developer impact fee for funding child care
                             facilities.
h.       Social Services.
LU 4.23:            Social Services. Support the provision of the City's fair share of social services.
                    Avoid the concentration of social services in any one neighborhood, and seek
                    dispersal throughout the City. Encourage other cities to provide their fair share of
                    social service facilities.
The community's population growth and diversification, changes in the structure of families,
changes in the nature of and the work place, the increased participation of women in the work
force, and other societal changes have increased the demand for a broad range of public and
private services. While there is a need for these facilities, they may change the character of
residential neighborhoods when there is an overconcentration in an area. In addition, these
facilities tend to be concentrated in only a few cities in the County.
The City will explore options to encourage fair distribution of these uses including the possibility
of requiring minimum distances between social service uses in residential zoning districts.

j.      Fire Services.
LU 4.24:        Fire Inspections. Maintain fire inspection staffing levels to meet existing needs
                and the projected 2030 population, employment and development, and inspections
                mandated by other governmental agencies.
LU 4.25:        Maintenance and Replacement. Continue fire apparatus replacement and
                maintenance programs to provide a high state of readiness.
LU 4.26:        Public Education. Provide public education programs targeted to segments of
                the community posing the greatest concern for fire and life safety.
The Fire Department's high level of service is dependent on an adequate water supply, personnel,
equipment and facilities. Facilities are in need of major improvements. The number of
firefighters is adequate to 2030. To maintain a high state of readiness fire fighting apparatus
needs to be replaced on a systematic basis. The continuance of existing fire safety programs
such as training, equipment replacement, and regular update of fire safety regulations will enable
the City to maintain its adequate level of fire service.
The Fire Department will continue to explore cost effective methods of maintaining its fleet of
aging engines and aerial ladder vehicles to maintain a high state of readiness. The current
contract for vehicle maintenance and repair services with the Burlingame Fire Department will
be monitored to ensure cost effectiveness. With the increasing number of emergency responses
and new demands being placed upon Fire Apparatus the Fire Department will seek to replace
vehicles in a timely manner while seeking to minimize financial impacts to the city through the
use of an amortized fund accrual system.
LU 4.27:        Automatic and Mutual Aid Agreements. Maintain automatic and mutual aid
                agreements with all jurisdictions within San Mateo County.
As part of the Advanced Life Support program with San Mateo County Emergency Medical
Services, American Medical Response (AMR) and the fire services of San Mateo County,
jurisdictional boundaries have been dropped to provide a seamless emergency response network.
This allows the closest Fire Units to respond to the point of an emergency regardless of
jurisdiction. Additionally, this requires many of the emergency operations used by the fire
services to become standardized within the County. This model also allows for better response to
unusual events such as Wildland fire, Hazardous Materials, Terrorism and Specialized Rescue
incidents through the utilization of pre-arranged responses dispatched from a central
dispatch/communications center in Redwood City. The City is entered into an Automatic Aid

LU 4.28:            Peakload Water Supply. Seek to ensure that the California Water Service
                    Company and the Estero Municipal Improvement District provide and maintain a
                    water supply and distribution system which provides an adequate static pressure
                    to deliver a minimum fire hydrant flow of 2,500 gallons per minute to all areas of
                    the City, except where a lesser flow is acceptable as determined by the Fire Chief.
                    Ensure that new development does not demand a fire flow in excess of that
                    available.
"Fire flow" is the amount of water required to suppress fire in a structure, expressed in gallons
per minute (gpm). The City requires that fire flow in all structures exceed 2,500 gpm.
Mitigation measures are commonly included in the construction of buildings to meet this
requirement, including fire-retardant roofing, fire-rated walls, alternate construction types and
automatic fire sprinkler systems.
k.       Police Services.
LU 4.29:            Effective Police Services. Maintain facilities, equipment, and personnel to
                    provide an effective police force to serve existing and future population and
                    employment as identified in the Land Use Element.
The City of San Mateo's protection services are provided by the San Mateo Police Department.
Mutual and automatic aid agreements with the San Mateo County Sheriff's Department, and the
police departments of Foster City, Belmont and Hillsborough augment the City's ability to
respond to calls in the jurisdictional boundary areas and emergency events. In San Mateo, crime
statistics from 2001 to 2006 were reported as follows:
           CRIMES                          2001        2002        2003  2004 2005   2006

Land Use
In 2006 crime decreased in all of the categories above with the exception of vehicle theft which
increased 34%. Many factors are contributing to the demands on police activities, including
increasing population, ethnic diversity, daytime population from job growth, high-density
development, traffic congestion, legislative mandates and crime awareness.
The size of City's police force is not adequate to accommodate the anticipated needs of the City
through the year 2030. The extent of expansion necessary is somewhat dependent on the
influence and increased involvement in requiring new development to include security, safety,
and traffic provisions to provide a safe secure environment for all users on a site. This can be
accomplished through active involvement in all aspects of development and the City’s land use
process including application of the security ordinance and enhancement/creation of ordinances
specific to certain land uses (i.e. adult entertainment, massage, fortune tellers, arcades, etc). This
process would allow mitigation through procedural and physical security measures to reduce
crime against persons and property in the community. Effective mitigation conditions could
reduce the impact of development and offset the need to hire additional personnel to respond for
services. Major new developments or concentrations of special population groups, such as
senior citizen residential care facilities in the downtown, may also necessitate augmentation of
personnel and/or equipment.
LU 4.30:        Defensible Design. Require all developments including parks and public places
                to incorporate physical security, personal safety, and traffic measures to provide a
                safe environment through application of crime prevention through design
                principles consistent with the City’s Security Ordinance.
The susceptibility of structures or outdoor areas to criminal activities against persons and
property can be greatly reduced through incorporation of certain design and procedural features
and encouraging neighborhood watch programs. The City has adopted security provisions which
specify locking devices on doors and windows to reduce the potential for illegal entry, require
minimum exterior lighting levels, and require garage security devices in multi-family
developments. The Police Department should review proposals for all development to
incorporate crime prevention design procedural and physical measures.
l.      Solid Waste and Recycling.
LU 4.31:        Solid Waste Disposal. Continue to support programs to reduce solid waste
                materials in landfill areas in accordance with State requirements.
LU 4.32:        Recycling and Composting. Support programs to recycle solid waste in
                compliance with State requirements. Require provisions for onsite recycling for
                all new development and expand composting of green waste and food scraps, as
                directed by the City’s Climate Action Plan which is an appendix of the General
                Plan.
The City’s construction recycling program implements procedures for best planning practices
related to recycling and trash facilities by ensuring all new projects appropriately address
II-34                                        Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010, Resolution No. 134-2010
                                               Amended by the City Council on April 18, 2011, Resolution No. 42 (2011)

                                                                                   Land Use Element
recyclables and trash removal issues including serviceability and enclosure/space allotment in
the early stages of new construction. Inspections and site visits are conducted frequently to
large-generator projects, businesses and multi-family complexes to ensure recycling is
maximized. Additionally, the recycling program implements a range of programs and activities
that provide the community with solid waste and recycling services; reduce the City's waste
disposal at landfills and conduct public outreach activities to promote community awareness
about the “3R’s” (reduce, reuse, recycle), and environmental stewardship.
Composting programs have also successfully reduced landfill waste. San Mateo instituted a
voluntary composting program in 2011 as a service provided by the community’s waste hauler.
This program allows food scraps to be composted and turned into fertilizer, rather than being
thrown in a landfill. As of 2014, approximately 19,430 single-family homes (97% of all single-
family homes with waste collection services) and 250 businesses are enrolled in the composting
program. The City is expanding this composting program to serve additional waste customers
throughout the City as identified in the Climate Action Plan, including multi-family
developments and additional businesses.
Under a franchise agreement, solid waste collection, transportation, and disposal services are
provided to the City of San Mateo. In addition to serving the City of San Mateo, the franchise
provider serves the communities of Atherton, Belmont, Burlingame, East Palo Alto, Foster City,
Half Moon Bay, Hillsborough, Menlo Park, Redwood City, San Carlos, North Fair Oaks, and La
Honda. The franchise provider collects solid waste from the City and hauls it to the San Carlos
Transfer Station, where readily visible recyclable materials are separated from gross refuse. This
facility has a permitted daily capacity of 3,000 tons and currently receives 1,500 to 1,900 tons
per day.
After solid waste is collected and sorted at the San Carlos Transfer Station, it is transported to the
Los Trancos Canyon (Ox Mountain) landfill, located in Half Moon Bay. The Ox Mountain
landfill is permitted by the California Integrated Waste Management Board to receive 3,598 tons
per day or 1.3 million tons per year. The landfill’s remaining capacity is 44.6 million cubic
yards, which translates to a 12-year life through 2018. The owner of the landfill has a permit for
expansion of the landfill. When the permit expires in 2016, either Los Trancos Canyon will be
expanded further or nearby Apanolio Canyon will be opened for fill.
m.       Hazardous Waste.
LU 4.33:            Waste Management. Manage toxic and hazardous wastes by following the goals
                    and policies contained in the Safety Element.
Toxic materials and hazardous wastes are utilized by households and businesses and transported
through the community on a daily basis. To protect life safety and ensure the natural
environment the State has mandated that local governments adopt goals, policies and programs
consistent with State requirements to manage the local handling, transport, treatment and storage
of hazardous wastes. The City's plan is included in the Safety Element.

5.      COOPERATION WITH OTHER AGENCIES.
GOAL 5:         Promote cooperative interaction with other public agencies regarding regional
                issues.
POLICIES
LU 5.1:         Inter-Agency Cooperation. Promote and participate in cooperative planning
                with other public agencies and adjacent jurisdictions, especially regarding
                regional issues such as water supply, traffic congestion, rail transportation, air
                pollution, waste management, fire services, emergency medical services and
                climate change
Important issues affecting the City and the Bay Area cannot be adequately addressed by the City
alone. Examples include traffic congestion, air quality, water supply, waste management, and
jobs-housing balance. Regional and subregional planning must occur in order to find effective
solutions to these issues. The City is a member of the City/County Association of Governments
(C/CAG), which was established to prepare, adopt, monitor, and enforce county-wide state
mandated plans including: Congestion Management Plan, Integrated Solid Waste Management
Plan, Airport Land Use Plan, Hazardous Waste Management Plan, Hazardous Materials
Response Plan, Water Distribution Plan, Emergency Medical Response Plan, Fire Response
Plan, Energy Emergency Plan and the Terrorism Response Plan.
LU 5.2:         Public Agency Developments. Require developments constructed by other
                governmental agencies to conform to the City's General Plan, Zoning Ordinance,
                and other development regulations to the extent legally possible.
When a County, State, or Federal agency decides to develop within the City, it is not required to
comply with the City's codes. To the extent feasible, the City should insist that these projects
conform with the long-range desires of the City by conforming to its general plan and other
development regulations.
6.      GENERAL PLAN MAINTENANCE.
GOAL 6:         Ensure that the City's General Plan is consistent with State Law, legally adequate,
                and up-to-date.
POLICIES
      The following language in italics was adopted by voter initiative in 2004 and cannot be
                        modified, revised or updated without voter approval.
LU 6.1:         Periodic General Plan Review. Report to the City Council yearly on the status of
                the implementation of the General Plan and on the need to update the plan.
II-36                                      Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010, Resolution No. 134-2010
                                             Amended by the City Council on April 18, 2011, Resolution No. 42 (2011)

                    Review annually projections made in the General Plan for housing, population,
                    commercial growth, economic growth, public service and safety levels that are
                    not considered as part of the budget review; review projections on the fair share
                    housing allocation and update the General Plan at least every five years,
                    consistent with the maximum building heights and densities as originally adopted
                    by the voters in November 1991 and again adopted in November 2004.
 Policy LU-6.1 requires that an annual review of the General Plan occur to determine if the plan
 is currently up-to-date, and in compliance with State Law. It also requires that the plan be
 updated at least every five years.
LU 6.2:             General Plan Amendments. Amendments to the General Plan shall be
                    considered a maximum of three times per year to ensure that Elements remain
                    consistent and that the overall effect of Plan amendments is considered.
State Planning law allows charter cities such as San Mateo to consider general plan amendments
at any time. Amendments to the plan made on a piecemeal basis do not provide the opportunity
to review the cumulative effect of these amendments and creates the potential for inconsistency
among various elements and policies.
GOAL 6A:            Ensure that all development in the City is consistent with and implements the
                    General Plan.
POLICIES
LU 6A.1:            Specific Plan, Zoning, Permit and Subdivision Review. The City shall not
                    approve any specific plan, rezoning, permit, subdivision, variance, or other land
                    use permit which is not consistent with and does not implement the General Plan.
                    Specific Plan and zoning ordinances were amended so as to conform to the
                    General Plan by the end of 1992.
LU 6A.2:            Building Height and Building Intensity Maps/Plans. Maintain Building Height
                    and Building Intensity maps/plans which delineate development intensity in the
                    form of building heights and FARs in a manner which implements the height,
                    intensity, density and design standards in the General Plan, consistent with the
                    Building Heights and Intensities maps/plans as amended by initiative in
                    November 1991 and November 2004., General Plan standards for building
                    heights and intensities are specifically set forth in the Building Height Plan and
                    the Building Intensity Plan that were formerly included in the General Plan, and
                    designated respectively as figure LU-4 in the table of contents (marked as figure
                    LU-5), and figure LU-5 in the table of contents (marked as figure LU-6).

7.      SPHERE OF INFLUENCE.
GOAL 7:         Permit the annexation to the City of adjacent unincorporated lands, when in the
                City's interest.
LU 7.1:         Annexation. Annex urbanized areas of the unincorporated land adjacent to the
                City limits in those areas where landowners petition the City to be annexed
                subject to the following conditions:
                1.      The annexation is comprehensive, rather than piecemeal; and
                2.      Landowners will pay the full cost of City services, will assume a
                        proportionate share of existing City debts and will contribute, either in
                        cash or in kind, to the existing capital improvements of the City which will
                        benefit the area to be annexed.
To provide comprehensive, adequate services to those unincorporated areas adjacent to the City
limits, it is the City's intent to promote annexation of those properties where landowners so
request.
To be equitable to existing City residents who have contributed through tax payments to
services, landowners within the areas to be annexed would be required to provide payment for
their proportionate share of the City's debt and for existing capital improvements.
LU 7.2:         New Development within the Sphere of Influence. Seek to require new
                developments and related infrastructure to be consistent with and to be designed to
                the City's General Plan goals and policies, zoning code requirements, development
                standards and the City's municipal code.
Given their proximity to the City, potential effect on City services, and the potential for future
annexation, the City is concerned about the development of unincorporated parcels within the
sphere of influence. The City will seek to influence County decisions so that these developments
are built in compliance with the City's General Plan, Zoning Code and development standards.
8.      CLIMATE CHANGE AND SUSTAINABILITY
With the passage of AB 32 and SB 375, the City of San Mateo has taken extensive steps to
address Climate Change. The City prepared a Climate Action Plan (CAP) as a comprehensive
strategy to respond to the challenge of climate change. The CAP addresses climate change by
providing strategies that reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and streamline the
environmental review of GHG emissions of future development projects in the City of San
Mateo.
The City of San Mateo’s CAP is based on the City’s long-standing commitment to
environmental stewardship and sustainability. Strategies in the CAP implement General Plan
II-38                                        Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010, Resolution No. 134-2010

                                                                                 Land Use Element
goals for climate change and GHG emissions. The CAP also builds on previous plans that
address climate change, including the Sustainable Initiatives Plan (adopted in 2007), Greenhouse
Gas Emissions Reduction Program (adopted in 2010) and the Climate Action Plan for Operations
and Facilities (adopted in 2008). By integrating these previous efforts, the CAP provides an
updated framework for addressing GHG emissions in the community. New development will
benefit from a consolidated framework for the review and analysis of GHG emissions.
Information in the CAP allows City decision-makers and the community to understand the
sources and magnitude of local GHG emissions and the City’s strategies to reduce them and
achieve emissions reduction targets. Strategies in the CAP address GHG emissions from the
energy, water, transportation, solid waste and off-road equipment sectors. An implementation
program and a framework in the CAP also equip the City to monitor and report progress.
The City of San Mateo is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and has developed
strategies to meet its reduction targets. The City has set emissions reduction targets for 2020 and
2050. The CAP demonstrates the City’s commitment to exceeding AB 32 targets by 2020 and
meeting the state targets for 2050 consistent with regional and State guidance. The City’s CAP is
consistent with the criteria of the Bay Area Air Quality Management District’s CEQA Air
Quality Guidelines for a Qualified Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Strategy as defined by
the district and as outlined below. The City’s CAP is incorporated as General Plan Appendix J.
A Qualified Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Strategy adopted by a local jurisdiction
includes the following elements, as described in the State CEQA Guidelines Section 15183.5,
and is further elaborated on in the Bay Area Air Quality Management District’s CEQA Air
Quality Guidelines. The discussion below further outlines how the City’s CAP complies with
each of the individual criteria listed in the guidelines through the City’s Greenhouse Gas
Reduction Program.
    A. Quantify greenhouse gas emissions, both existing and projected over a specified time
         period, resulting from activities within a defined geographic area.
         The City of San Mateo has quantified existing and proposed greenhouse gas emissions
         throughout the community, including regional and state programs as appropriate. The
         CAP presents an inventory of community-wide GHG emissions for the baseline year of
         2005. To account for future conditions, the CAP presents a forecast of GHG emissions in
         2020 and 2030 in a business as usual (BAU) scenario. State programs will reduce these
         future emissions by achieving cleaner sources of transportation and energy. The forecast
         and State programs serve as a foundation for the CAP. Quantifications in the CAP use
         standard industry methods and are consistent with the approach of the San Mateo County
         climate action planning effort, the Regionally Integrated Climate Action Planning Suite.
         Consistency with these methods serves to where available, to support the conclusion in
         this of the CAP that the City of San Mateo can meet proposed reduction targets.
    B. Establish a level, based on substantial evidence, below which the contribution to
         greenhouse gas emissions from activities covered by the plan would not be cumulatively
         considerable.

Land Use
                 The Climate Action Plan presents the City’s reduction targets for emissions
                 reductions consistent with the AB 32 Scoping Plan, the guidance by CEQA
                 Guidelines Section 15183.5(b), and the direction provided by Governor’s
                 Executive Order S-03-05.
                 1.     Reduce emissions to 15 percent below 2005 levels by 2020.
                 2.     Reduce emissions by 35 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.
                 3.     Reduce emissions to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.
        Long-term reduction targets are presented in the CAP to commit the City to ongoing
        progress, consistent with State guidance. Due to the nature of the rapidly evolving field
        of GHG reduction science and policy, emissions forecasts for 2050 are not included in
        the CAP. Yet the CAP identifies that by 2018, the City will review and consider post-
        2020 reduction targets consistent with long-term State GHG reduction goals and evolving
        State guidance
     C. Identify and analyze the greenhouse gas emissions resulting from specific actions or
        categories of actions anticipated within the geographic area.
        The CAP analyzes GHG emissions from the City of San Mateo’s community-wide activities,
        consistent with standard industry protocol at the time of its development and guided by the
        recommendations of the State of California and the Bay Area Air Quality Management
        District. To determine total progress toward reduction targets, the CAP quantifies and
        analyzes the impact of existing accomplishments since the 2005 baseline, planned local
        programs and new measures proposed in the CAP. Total GHG reductions are quantified for
        both 2020 and 2030.
     D. Specify measures or a group of measures, including performance standards that
        substantial evidence demonstrates, if implemented on a project-by-project basis, would
        collectively achieve the specified emissions level.
        Measures proposed in the CAP include those that are anticipated to significantly reduce
        emissions from the community. All measures were quantified using standard industry
        practice at the time of CAP development, where available, to ensure that the stated
        reductions are supported by substantial evidence. Minor emissions reduction measures,
        including the City operational measures that do not significantly reduce GHG emissions,
        were not included. Reduction measures come from four primary sources:
                 1.     City of San Mateo General Plan policies;
                 2.     City of San Mateo programs and actions currently being implemented;

                        participates;
II-40                                       Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010, Resolution No. 134-2010
                                             Amended by the City Council on April 18, 2011, Resolution No. 42 (2011)

                                                                                     Land Use Element
                    4.       Applicable California State policies and programs.
    E. Establish a mechanism to monitor the plan’s progress toward achieving the level and to
         require amendment if the plan is not achieving specified levels.
         The CAP provides an implementation work plan for City staff and a framework to
         monitor and demonstrate progress. The work plan contained in the CAP identifies the
         responsibility of key departments, time frames and processes to complete annual updates.
         The CAP will function as a dynamic tool, equipping City staff to undertake near-term
         steps toward long-term General Plan objectives. To support implementation, the City has
         also developed a Microsoft Excel-based monitoring and implementation tool to allow the
         City to track emissions over time and modify or replace emissions reduction measures
         that are not performing as anticipated.
    F. Be adopted in a public process following environmental review.
    G. The CAP was developed and adopted with an Addendum to the General Plan
         Environmental Impact Report (EIR) and is fully included in the analysis associated with
         the City’s General Plan EIR.
Through completion of the above criteria, the City has demonstrated that the CAP is consistent
with the guidance set forth by State CEQA Guidelines Section 15183.5 and the Bay Area Air
Quality Management District’s criteria for a Qualified Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction
Strategy.
Climate Change
GOAL 8a:            Reduce greenhouse gas emissions each year consistent with the Climate Action
                    Plan.
GOAL 8b:            Recognize potential climate change consequences such as increased sea level rise,
                    changing weather events, less snow melt in the Sierras - therefore less drinking
                    water availability, hotter temperatures, changing air quality and more heat related
                    health issues.
POLICIES
LU 8.1:             Carbon Footprint. The City shall prepare an updated greenhouse gas emissions
                    inventory consistent with the Climate Action Plan.
The CAP identifies the sources of GHG emissions from community-wide activities in the City
limits of San Mateo for the baseline year of 2005. The GHG emissions inventory included nine
sources of emissions for San Mateo in 2005. By understanding where these emissions come
from, CAP measures target the largest opportunities for reductions. Completing a new inventory
for a recent year allows the City to identify the highest opportunities for reductions as they

change over time. Recent year inventories also allow the City to track progress implementing
the CAP as the City seeks to reduce overall GHG emissions consistent with CAP targets.
LU 8.2:        Effects of Climate Change. Incorporate consideration of the effects of climate
               change in development of General Plan updates, disaster planning, City projects,
               infrastructure planning, future policies and long-term strategies. Explore
               voluntary adjustments of base flood elevation.
The City has established a foundation for reducing the community’s impact on climate change
with the CAP. Strategies in the CAP serve to reduce GHG emissions generated in the City of
San Mateo, thereby reducing the City of San Mateo’s contribution to global GHG emissions
levels. The City is also committed to an adaptive approach that responds to the anticipated
impacts of climate change The Climate Change goals and the CAP provide the City’s proactive
approach to reduce local GHG emissions, while the framework for adapting to climate change
impacts is mainly addressed in the General Plan’s Safety Element.
LU 8.3:        Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emission Reductions. Monitor and report progress
               toward the City’s GHG emissions reduction target on an annual basis and
               regularly review emission reduction measures and new opportunities consistent
               with guidance of the City’s Climate Action Plan.
Consistent with the CAP work plan, the City will complete an annual progress report to review
and analyze progress toward GHG reduction targets. The City will monitor progress consistent
with industry protocol. Annual monitoring also demonstrates consistency with guidance from
State CEQA Guidelines Section 15183.5 and the Bay Area Air Quality Management District.
Establishing a monitoring mechanism is a criterion for a Qualified Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Reduction Strategy. As directed by the CAP, the City will also prepare an update to the CAP to
review and analyze the established targets for GHG emissions reductions and respond to
information from annual reporting. New technologies and State legislation may create additional
opportunities that would support achievement of the City’s reduction target.
Built Environment
GOAL 8c:       Ensure that all improvements to existing structures are developed or remodeled in
               a sustainable manner.
GOAL 8d:       Increase new annual installations of solar or renewable energy systems consistent
               with the Climate Action Plan.
POLICIES
LU 8.4         Sustainable Development. Incorporate Sustainability into existing single family
               and multifamily housing. Require sustainable features and techniques to address
               energy and water efficiency in remodels of existing structures.
II-42                                     Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010, Resolution No. 134-2010
                                           Amended by the City Council on April 18, 2011, Resolution No. 42 (2011)
                                             Amended by the City Council on April 6, 2015, Resolution No. 36 (2015)

                                                                                    Land Use Element
Energy use in the Built Environment contributed 35% of the City’s GHG emissions in 2005,
therefore, a concerted effort is required to reduce greenhouse gases. Every remodel or addition
to existing structures should incorporate some sustainability and energy efficiency with the goal
of reducing that individual structure’s carbon footprint. Furthermore, efforts to address single
family homes not undergoing a remodel or addition should be taken. This may be done using the
results of the Community Development Department’s housing efficiency survey. CAP measures
also identify strategies to foster energy-efficiency retrofits to existing buildings through incentive
programs and rebates. Previously, the City’s Green Building Ordinance energy-efficiency
measures for new construction exceeded State requirements. While the new 2013 California
Green Building Code supersedes the adopted Green Building Ordinance for energy efficiency,
the City continues to promote sustainability and energy efficiency in new construction. CAP
measures also identify the City’s commitment to expand electric vehicle infrastructure locally by
exceeding requirements for the California Green Building Code.
LU 8.5              Solar Energy. Promote or join local partnerships and opportunities that offer
                    renewable energy options to the residents and/or help inform them of rebates and
                    options while ensuring that the permit process is quick and inexpensive.
The City of San Mateo has promoted the widespread use of rooftop solar panels through a
simplified permitting process and reduced solar permitting fees. From 2005 to 2010, the City
has processed permits for more than 200 rooftop solar panels, with a total generating capacity of
approximately 1.9 megawatts. Through outreach, education and other incentives identified in the
CAP, the City will continue to expand options for residents to access and install renewable
energy facilities, such as solar photovoltaics.
Waste and Recycling
LU 8.6:             Waste Reduction. Reduce waste sent to landfills by San Mateo’s residents,
                    businesses and visitors by a minimum of 75% from 2005 levels by 2020by
                    mandating recycling, setting aggressive waste reduction goals for all
                    development, implementing composting programs, and increasing costs for
                    residential and commercial waste collection then using increased waste collection
                    revenue to provide waste reduction incentives. Supportive actions for waste
                    reduction are detailed in the Climate Action Plan.
The City of San Mateo has achieved notable reductions in solid waste, with a 45% reduction in
community-wide solid waste generation from 2005 to 2010. Nonetheless, the City continues to
implement numerous waste programs that will further reduce the waste stream. In 2011, the City
instituted a voluntary composting program as a service provided by the community’s waste
hauler. This program allows food scraps to be composted and turned into fertilizer, rather than
being thrown in a landfill. As of 2014, approximately 19,430 single-family homes (97% of all
single-family homes with waste collection services) and 250 businesses are enrolled in the
composting program. As identified in the CAP, the City will seek to expand the composting
program to additional residential and nonresidential waste customers throughout the community.
The City will explore alternative forms of waste collection to support composting in multi-family

and commercial properties. Ongoing collaboration with food service utilities and Recology of
San Mateo will allow the City to monitor other opportunities for waste reduction.
Water Supply
GOAL 8e:        Reduce citywide gross water consumption per capita to 102 gallons/day. Reduce
                the residential per capita to 70 gallons/day.
POLICIES
LU 8.7:         Water Reduction Strategies. Establish a partnership with California Water
                Service (CWS), Bay Area Water Supply Conservation Agency and other mid
                peninsula cities to promote the water reduction strategies that are offered and to
                create an outreach program that will help inform residence and businesses of
                increase costs and the need for conservation efforts.
LU 8.8:         Water Rates. Actively support a strategy to decouple water utility revenues from
                water consumption and any other regulatory changes that will offer incentives to
                CWS to actively pursue conservation while working with CWS to implement
                progressive water rates.
The CWS establishes a 2020 gross water consumption target of 124 gallons per capita per day
(gpcpd) for the Bayshore/Mid-Peninsula District, which includes the City of San Mateo. As of
2013, the collective Bayshore/Mid-Peninsula District exceeded the district-wide target and
achieved gross water consumption of 110 gpcpd.
Several external factors will help the City of San Mateo reach its local water goals. The price of
water will triple in the next few years as the upgrades to the Hetch-Hetchy water supply system
are completed. Dry years that instigate programs to conserve will give greater publicity and
awareness regarding water issues. A reduction in water consumption also takes pressure off the
wastewater treatment plant to meet new volume requirements. The CWS and the City of San
Mateo are committed to exploring and identifying cost-effective programs to further reduce
water use locally. Water efficiency and conservation strategies are also included in the City’s
CAP, Appendix J of the General Plan. The City will continue to identify creative programs to
achieve the local citywide goal of 102 gpcpd and the residential goal of 70 gpcpd.
Air Quality
LU 8.9:         Air Quality Construction Impacts. The City shall mitigate air quality impacts
                generated during construction activities by requiring the following measures:
                1.      Use of appropriate dust control measures, based on project size and latest
                        Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) guidance, shall
                        be applied to all construction activities within San Mateo.
II-44                                        Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010, Resolution No. 134-2010
                                               Amended by the City Council on April 18, 2011, Resolution No. 42 (2011)
                                                Amended by the City Council on April 6, 2015, Resolution No. 36 (2015)

                                                                                       Land Use Element
                    2.       Applicants seeking demolition permits shall demonstrate compliance with
                             applicable BAAQMD requirements involving lead paint and asbestos
                             containing materials (ACM’s) designed to mitigate exposure to lead paint
                             and asbestos.
                    3.       Utilization of construction emission control measures recommended by
                             BAAQMD as appropriate for the specifics of the project (e.g., length of
                             time of construction and distance from sensitive receptors). This may
                             include the utilization of low emission construction equipment, restrictions
                             on the length of time of use of certain heavy-duty construction equipment,
                             and utilization of methods to reduce emissions from construction
                             equipment (alternative fuels, particulate matter traps and diesel particulate
                             filters).
Construction activities associated with individual developments and infrastructure improvements
in San Mateo would generate pollutants intermittently. Generally, the most substantial air
pollutant emissions would be dust generated from site grading. Wind erosion and disturbance to
exposed areas would also be sources of dust emissions. If uncontrolled, these emissions could
lead to both health and nuisance impacts. These construction activities would also temporarily
create emissions of fumes, equipment exhaust, and other air contaminants. Adherence to the
measures noted above will reduce the air impacts generated by construction activities.
LU 8.10:            Odors. When proposed development generating odors is proposed near
                    residences or sensitive receptors, either adequate buffer distances shall be
                    provided (based on recommendations and requirements of the California Air
                    Resources Control Board and BAAQMD), or filters or other equipment/solutions
                    shall be provided to reduce the potential exposure to acceptable levels. Potential
                    mitigation associated with this policy requirement will be coordinated with any
                    required permit conditions from BAAQMD.
                    When new residential or other sensitive receptors are proposed near existing
                    sources of odors, either adequate buffer distances shall be provided (based on
                    recommendations and requirements of the California Air Resources Control
                    Board and BAAQMD), or filters or other equipment/solutions shall be provided to
                    reduce the potential exposure to acceptable levels.
The BAAQMD CEQA Guidelines classify a project that could create objectionable odors as any
of the following: wastewater treatment plant, sanitary landfill, transfer stations, composting
facilities, petroleum refineries, asphalt batch plants, chemical manufacturing, fiberglass
manufacturing, auto body shops, rendering plants, and coffee roasters. Impacts resulting from
odors can result when sensitive receptors (e.g., new residences) are located near the odor sources
listed above.
LU 8.11             Toxic Air Contaminants. The City shall require that when new development that
                    would be a source of toxic air contaminants (TAC’s) is proposed near residences
                    or sensitive receptors, either adequate buffer distances shall be provided (based on

                reduce the potential exposure to acceptable levels.
                When new residential or other sensitive receptors are proposed near existing
                sources of TAC’s, either adequate buffer distances shall be provided (based on
                recommendations and requirements of the California Air Resources Control
                Board and BAAQMD), or filters or other equipment/solutions shall be provided to
                the source to reduce the potential exposure to acceptable levels.
Toxic air contaminants (TAC’s) are another group of pollutants of concern. However, unlike
criteria pollutants, no criteria acceptable levels of TAC’s have been established. There are many
different types of TACs, with varying degrees of toxicity. Sources of TAC’s include industrial
processes such as petroleum refining and chrome plating operations, commercial operations such
as gasoline stations and dry cleaners, and motor vehicle exhaust.
Diesel exhaust is a TAC of growing concern in California. The California Air Resources Board
in 1998 identified diesel engine particulate matter as a TAC. The exhaust from diesel engines
contains hundreds of different gaseous and particulate components, many of which are toxic.
Studies show that diesel particulate matter concentrations are much higher near heavily traveled
highways and intersections. In the cases noted above, this policy will be implemented by a site
specific air quality analysis.
Public Outreach
LU 8.12:        Engaging the Public. Create a multi-phased information campaign to educate
                residents and businesses on the Climate Action Plan and to spark behavioral
                changes in individual energy and water consumption, transportation mode
                choices, and recycling.
Educating the public will be critical in achieving the goals of the CAP. Numerous outreach and
educational measures are identified in the CAP. These initiatives will encourage greater
efficiency in San Mateo’s buildings, support integrated land use patterns and provide residents
and business owners with more information and resources to benefit from CAP programs.
AREA SPECIFIC POLICIES
The Land Use Element divides the community into 10 planning areas, as delineated on Figure
LU-1 San Mateo Planning Area, for the primary purpose of tailoring policies to the unique
characteristics of each area. These area specific policies indicate major policies within each
planning area.

1.       NORTHWEST HEIGHTS
PA 1.1:             North El Camino Real. Retain the high density residential character of the area
                    between Peninsula and Tilton avenues. Commercial sites in the area should
                    redevelop where appropriate to medium scale office uses, as delineated on the
                    Building Height and Intensity Plans, or high density residential. Commercial
                    redevelopment shall be designed to reflect the residential design and character of
                    the area.
North El Camino Real is characterized by multi-family developments two to three stories in
height with some small scattered non-residential sites. Redevelopment of the non-residential
sites to multi-family residential is appropriate to create more neighborhood uniformity and less
nuisances for neighbors such as visual blight, glare, noise, traffic and parking congestion.
PA 1.2:             North San Mateo Drive. Plan for redevelopment on North San Mateo Drive
                    between Peninsula and Tilton avenues as follows:
                    1.       North of State Street.                    Encourage more intensive commercial
                             development, particularly automotive sales.
                    2.       South of State Street. Allow more intensive commercial development,
                             particularly automotive sales for 150 feet south of State Street on the west
                             side of San Mateo Drive, and limit redevelopment of the remainder to
                             medium scale office uses, as delineated on the Building Height and
                             Intensity Maps, and high density, multi-family residential.
Auto sales and service uses are the predominant uses north and immediately south of State Street
and extend into Burlingame. These uses are encouraged due to the high sales tax revenues they
generate. Because residential neighborhoods are immediately adjacent to these uses, new
developments or additions shall be required to reduce nuisances such as noise, glare, odors, litter,
noise, traffic and parking congestion.
Two- to three-story, multi-family and low-scale commercial uses are the dominant land uses
south of State Street. Redevelopment shall be consistent with the existing high density
residential and compatible with the existing low-scale office uses. Building heights are limited
to protect the established residential character of the area. Furthermore, for the redevelopment of
the southern part of North San Mateo Drive, consider its close proximity to the Caltrain station.
Encouraging transit use in the redevelopment of these sites will help the City meet its
Sustainability goals.
PA 1.3:             East Santa Inez Avenue/Tilton Avenue Neighborhood. Provide for high-
                    density multi-family uses between East Santa Inez and Tilton avenues, with the
                    exception of the single-family residences on Chesterton Court, to support
                    downtown commercial development.
Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010, Resolution No. 134-2010                               II-47
Amended by the City Council on April 18, 2011, Resolution No. 42 (2011)
Amended by the City Council on April 6, 2015, Resolution No. 36 (2015)
Land Use
                 The area is characterized by high-density residential buildings three stories in
                 height, with the exception of Chesterton Court, which is lined by single-family
                 dwellings. High-density redevelopment is appropriate because the neighborhood
                 is within walking distance of the Downtown retail core.
PA 1.4:          Single-Family and Duplex Preservation. Limit development of established
                 predominantly single-family areas to single-family uses, and predominantly
                 duplex areas to low-density residential as indicated on the Land Use Plan.
                 Consider redesignating multi-family areas to single-family and low-density
                 residential uses where such uses predominant and where the creation of additional
                 legal non-conforming uses would be minimized.
This policy is consistent with Policy LU-1.9, which encourages the protection of established
single-family and duplex neighborhoods. Neighborhood impacts such as traffic, loss of parking,
and deterioration of community character have resulted from past redevelopment of single-
family residences to substantially higher densities in San Mateo Heights. The policy pertains to
a major portion of the area, particularly sections of Ramona Street, Ellsworth Court, and
Highland Avenue.
2.      NORTH CENTRAL.
PA 2.1:          Woodside Way. Redevelop the area along Woodside Way to low-scale executive
                 office nearest Peninsula Avenue and medium-density housing towards Villa
                 Terrace as delineated on the Land Use Plan.
This area has been identified for high-density multi-family housing. The existing low-scale low-
rise executive office development is compatible with the existing high-density multi-family
developments adjacent to Peninsula Avenue. Medium density, multi-family housing is an
appropriate density transition to the lower density areas south of Villa Terrace. This transition
will ensure compatibility with the low-density and single-family areas south of Villa Terrace.
PA 2.2:          Amphlett Boulevard. Retain the residential and commercial service uses.
                 Require new buildings and additions to be compatible with adjoining residential
                 areas including adequate screening and landscaping.
Multi-family developments adjacent to US 101 are generally more affordable than elsewhere in
the community. Retention of more affordably priced housing is necessary to provide a balanced
housing supply and support economic growth.
Service commercial uses have a higher potential to generate nuisances such as visual blight,
noise, glare, litter, odors, loss of parking and traffic congestion. To protect adjacent residential
neighbors, new or remodeled service commercial uses are required to reduce potential nuisances
through site design, and conformance with codes.
II-48                                        Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010, Resolution No. 134-2010
                                              Amended by the City Council on April 18, 2011, Resolution No. 42 (2011)

PA 2.3:             Public Facilities. Should reuse or redevelopment of public facilities, including
                    the County Courthouse, National Guard Armory, and Department of Motor
                    Vehicles occur, medium-density residential use is appropriate.           Should
                    redevelopment of a portion or all of San Mateo High School occur, medium-
                    density residential with retention of necessary school turf areas for public
                    recreation is appropriate.
Reuse or redevelopment of these public facilities is not anticipated. However, should
redevelopment occur, multi-family development is considered appropriate because the adjacent
uses are predominantly multi-family, and the sites are large enough to provide adequate buffers.
Recreational use of the High School site is to be retained to serve the recreational needs of the
area. Sites must not be owned and/or operated by the City, other government agencies, and/or the
public school districts to be redeveloped as housing.
PA 2.4:             Single-Family and Duplex Preservation. Limit development of established
                    predominantly single-family areas to single-family uses, and predominantly
                    duplex areas to low-density residential as indicated on the Land Use Plan.
                    Consider redesignating multi-family areas to single-family and low-density
                    residential uses where such uses predominant and where the creation of additional
                    legal non-conforming uses would be minimized.
This policy is consistent with Policy LU-1.9, which encourages the protection of established
single-family and duplex neighborhoods. Neighborhood impacts such as traffic, loss of parking,
and deterioration of community character have resulted from past redevelopment of single-
family residences to higher densities in North Central. The policy pertains to a very large
portion of the area, roughly bounded by Idaho Street, San Mateo Creek, Rail Corridor, and
Indian Avenue, and along Idaho Street north of Poplar Avenue.
PA 2.5:             Railroad Avenue. Maintain low and medium residential densities on the
                    property along Railroad Avenue which is on the east side of the Rail Corridor
                    north of San Mateo Creek, to be consistent with the residential densities of the
                    adjacent neighborhood.
This small area, between Tilton Avenue and San Mateo Creek, was the only commercially zoned
property in North Central prior to rezoning in 1990, and contains a mix of commercial and
residential uses. The warehouse and service commercial use has resulted in nuisance problems
for neighbors and is inconsistent with the neighborhood character. The area is to be retained as
low-density nearest San Mateo Creek and to medium-density residential use between Cypress
and Tilton avenues to achieve uniformity and reduce nuisance potential. Considering this area is
within two blocks of the revitalized downtown train station, all redevelopment of this area should
address increasing transit use.

3.     DOWNTOWN.
The goals, policies, and objectives for downtown San Mateo are located in the Downtown Plan.
A general discussion of the downtown also occurs in Section 3 of this Land Use Element.
Provisions of the voter-approved Measure H and Measure P, which reduced building heights,
floor area ratios and residential densities, were also incorporated, including the provisions
following below (the Measure H and P provisions are in italics).
       a.      A Specific Plan for the Downtown was adopted by the City Council in July 1985,
               and amended in 1993 consistent with the provisions of Measure H as adopted by
               the voters in November 1991. This Specific Plan also constituted an amendment
               to the previous General Plan.
       b.      Densities up to 75 units per acre, heights up to 75’ and appropriate FARs may be
               allowed in the following areas of the Downtown, for projects which provide
               public benefits or amenities substantially greater than code requirements:
               1.      the area designated on the Land Use Plan (LU-3) as Downtown which is
                       bounded by El Camino Real (SR 82), East Fourth and East Fifth avenues
                       and the SPRR railroad tracks;
               2.      the area designated on the Land Use Plan (LU-3) as Downtown which is
                       bounded by El Camino Real (SR 82) and Ellsworth, Baldwin and Second
                       avenues;
               3.      the area designated on the Land Use Plan (LU-3) as Mixed-Use
                       (Executive Office) which is bounded by El Camino Real (SR 82), San
                       Mateo Drive, St. Matthews Avenue, and Baldwin Avenue; and
               4.      those properties in the area designated on the Land Use Plan (LU-3) as
                       Mixed Use (Neighborhood Commercial) which are between San Mateo
                       Drive and Ellsworth Avenue, and which have frontage on the north side of
                       Baldwin Avenue as of 1 January 1992.
       c.      Densities up to 75 units per acre, heights up to 75 feet, and appropriate FARs
               may be allowed in the following areas of the Downtown for projects which to the
               greatest extent feasible protect and preserve key historic resources in accordance
               with the following conditions:
                       1.      the area designated on the Land Use Plan (LU-3) as Downtown
                               which is bounded by B Street, Ellsworth Avenue, First Avenue and

                             2.         all buildings on the site with frontage along Second Avenue or B
                                        Street which are identified as Individually Eligible for the National

                                        Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation);
                             3.         FARs and residential densities may be calculated based on the
                                        total site square footage; however the FARs and densities for
                                        buildings protected in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)
                                        immediately preceding may be excluded from the allowable FARs
                                        and densities for new construction permitted on the site.
4.       SHOREVIEW.
PA 4.1:             North Bayshore Boulevard/Kingston Street. Commercial uses along Bayshore
                    Boulevard or Kingston Street may be redeveloped for high density multi-family
                    or hotel uses.
Certain non-residential uses along Bayshore Boulevard and Kingston Street have generated
nuisances for neighbors and are generally unsightly and highly visible from the Bayshore
Freeway. Redevelopment of these uses to multi-family development is encouraged to eliminate
nuisances and to provide opportunities for more affordable housing. To encourage improvement
of the existing motel uses, such uses will continue to be allowed with special use permits.
PA 4.2:             Shoreview Shopping Center. Promote retention and continue enhancement of
                    the neighborhood shopping center through design treatment, façade changes, and
                    implementation of the signage program.
This policy is consistent with Policy LU-1.12, which encourages the retention and enhancement
of neighborhood shopping centers. The Shoreview Shopping Center is one of the oldest in the
community and is in need of a major upgrade. The City has provided financial assistance for the
restriping and landscaping of the parking lot. The center's appearance has been somewhat
improved through a sign program and facade changes to the northern portion of the center.
PA 4.3:             East Third Avenue Commercial Uses. Allow intensification of the commercial
                    uses along East Third Avenue contingent on significant improvement of access
                    and traffic circulation. Development shall enhance and not diminish existing
                    public access to the trail along San Mateo Creek.
Access to the commercial uses is poor and conflicts with the high speed traffic exiting US 101.
While commercial improvements are encouraged, intensification is contingent on reducing the

existing poor access and traffic conflicts. Due to the poor appearance of the area, site
improvements should also include adequate building step back from the creek, and landscaping
and screening of storage and parking lots.
PA 4.4:         US 101 Frontage. Encourage upgrading of the appearance of US 101 and
                properties adjacent to the freeway through design treatment, screening and right-
                of-way landscaping.
Development adjacent to US 101 is highly visible to motorists and substantially contributes to
the visitor's image of San Mateo. The visual appearance of the corridor is inconsistent and in
some locations unattractive. Improvements should be made by requiring new or changed
developments to provide attractive buildings, improved signage and landscaping.
In 2008, construction improvements along Route 101 from Third Avenue to the north City
Limits included the Monte Diablo pedestrian overcrossing, the construction of auxiliary lanes,
and 10,000 linear feet of new sounds walls for noise abatement. The sound walls range in height
from approximately 14 feet to 17 feet.
PA 4.5:         Norfolk/SR 92 Vicinity. Encourage redevelopment of the area along South
                Norfolk Avenue between Susan Court and SR 92 as follows:
                1.     For properties between Norfolk Avenue and Marina Lagoon, encourage
                       medium scale public-serving commercial uses, as delineated on the
                       Building Height and Intensity Plans, such as retail and restaurants.
                       Redevelopment shall maximize public access to and along the lagoon.
Intensification or redevelopment of the land abutting Marina Lagoon is encouraged contingent
on provision of continuous landscaped public access along the Lagoon from Susan Court to SR
92, and on achieving a building design that is oriented to and sensitive to the waterway.
                2.     Retain the Parkside Shopping Center, allowing limited expansion of low-
                       scale commercial uses. Any redevelopment shall be contingent on
                       retaining neighborhood retail uses and on finding no appreciable increase
                       in through traffic in residential neighborhoods or significant impacts on
                       Norfolk Street service levels.             Provide development incentives to
                       encourage mixed retail and high density housing, should redevelopment
                       occur. Permit heights greater than 35 feet, but to a maximum of 55 feet,
                       for projects which meet the following criteria and are approved by the
                       City Council.
                       a.      The project provides amenities, such as affordable housing,
                               landscaped plazas, and public improvements, substantially in
                               excess of those required by City standards;

                             c.         Increased building heights are visually related to surrounding
                                        building heights and promote the creation of a coherent City
                                        image;
                             d.         Increased building heights are compatible with surrounding land
                                        uses, and will not create adverse shadow or visual impacts on
                                        surrounding residential uses; and
                             e.         The City's infrastructure is adequate to accommodate the proposed
                                        development.
Parkside Shopping Center's location adjacent to US 101/SR 92 interchange makes it highly
susceptible to redevelopment. However, traffic from northbound US 101 must travel through
residential neighborhoods to reach the Center. Redevelopment to other uses is allowed
contingent on the retention of neighborhood retail uses. Mixed use development which includes
high density multi-family is preferred and should be encouraged with development intensity
bonuses.
PA 4.6:             J. Hart Clinton Drive/Detroit Drive Vicinity.
                    1.       Development of private parcels having frontage on Marina Lagoon should
                             retain public access, providing a connection between Shoreline Park and
                             Bayside/Joinville Park.
                    2.       Properties bounded by Detroit Drive should be developed with low-scale,
                             low occupancy commercial uses as delineated on the Building Height and
                             Intensity Plans. The Shoreline Park Specific Plan allows mini-warehouse
                             or light industry with ancillary offices and precludes hotel and restaurant
                             uses. Building design should be of high quality, reflective of the
                             prominence of the site from J. Hart Clinton Drive and the future
                             development of Shoreline Park.
Land adjacent to Detroit Drive is highly visible from J. Hart Clinton Drive, Shoreline Park and
Marina Lagoon. To be compatible with the surrounding areas, development will be required to
be sensitively designed with ample landscaping to enhance the project appearance from J. Hart
Clinton Drive, and limited to low occupancy uses due to the adjacent sewage treatment plant.
PA 4.7:             Wastewater Treatment Plant. Maintain the Wastewater Treatment Plant as

               owned surplus parcel at the northeast corner of the SR 92 and US 101
               Interchange.
The US 101/SR 92 interchange is of sufficient size that additional uses in the area adjacent to
and under the overpasses can be accommodated. Open parking is a permitted use on these lands.
Recreational vehicle storage is considered compatible with parking lots and is an appropriate
land use contingent on adequate screening being provided.
5.     HAYWARD PARK.
PA 5.1:        Mid-El Camino Real.
               1.     Allow commercial and high density residential use of the area between
                      Ninth Avenue and SR 92, as delineated on the Building Height and
                      Intensity Plans. For all buildings over two stories high, provide a
                      minimum setback of ten feet adjacent to El Camino Real. Additionally,
                      provide a minimum setback adjacent to residential parcels of one-half the
                      maximum building height subject to the El Camino Real Master Plan.
               2.     For lots 100 feet deep and less, maximum building height is 40 feet. For
                      lots more than 100 feet deep, permit heights up to 55 feet for projects
                      which meet the following criteria and are approved by the City Council:
                      a.      The project provides amenities, such as landscaped plazas, covered
                              parking, setbacks from the street, stepbacks of upper stories, and
                              public improvements substantially in excess of City requirements;
                      b.      The building has high design quality, which is enhanced by
                              additional building height;
                      c.      Increased building heights are visually related to surrounding
                              building heights and promote the creation of a coherent City
                              image;
                      d.      Increased building heights are compatible with surrounding land
                              uses, and will not create adverse shadow or visual impacts on
                              surrounding residential uses; and
                      e.      The City's infrastructure is adequate to accommodate the proposed
                              development.
Prepare design criteria to implement this policy prior to approval of any building over 40 feet
high.
II-54                                     Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010, Resolution No. 134-2010
                                           Amended by the City Council on April 18, 2011, Resolution No. 42 (2011)
                                             Amended by the City Council on April 6, 2015, Resolution No. 36 (2015)
                                                                                       Land Use Element
In this area, El Camino Real (SR 82) is characterized by a mixture of commercial uses ranging
from single-story to high rise. It is expected that most new development will be medium scale
commercial or high-density residential or mixed-use due to the limited depth lots and potential
impact on adjacent residential sites.
PA 5.2:             SR 92/Grant Street/Concar Drive/Delaware Street Vicinity. For properties
                    within the focal area:
                    1.       Allow a concentration of large scale retail, office and hotel uses, as
                             delineated on the Building Height and Intensity Maps.
                    2.       Require building setbacks from the street, freeway and adjoining
                             residential neighborhoods to reduce visual impacts, with greater setbacks
                             required for greater heights.
                    3.       Permit densities up to 75 units per acre, and heights greater than 40 feet
                             but up to a maximum of 75 feet for projects in the area designated in the
                             Land Use Plan (LU-3) as Regional/Community Commercial which is
                             bounded by South Grant Street, US 101, SR 92 and the north property line
                             of the Dunfey Hotel, which meet the following criteria and are approved
                             by the City Council:
                             a.         The project provides amenities, such as landscaped plazas, and
                                        public improvements, substantially in excess of those required by
                                        City standards;
                             b.         The building has high design quality, which is enhanced by
                                        additional building height;
                             c.         Increased building heights are visually related to surrounding
                                        building heights and promote the creation of a coherent City
                                        image;
                             d.         Increased building heights are compatible with surrounding land
                                        uses, and will not create adverse shadow or visual impacts on
                                        surrounding residential uses; and
                             e.         The City's infrastructure is adequate to accommodate the proposed
                                        development.
                    4.       Provide development incentives for high density residential development
                             adjacent to the railway.
                    5.       Require that any redevelopment of the Marriot Hotel property address
                             major citizen concerns pertaining to traffic, truck loading, trash/recycling
Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010, Resolution No. 134-2010                             II-55
Amended by the City Council on April 18, 2011, Resolution No. 42 (2011)
Amended by the City Council on April 6, 2015, Resolution No. 36 (2015)
Land Use
                        activities, noise, appearance, and public safety as part of the site plan and
                        design of a development proposal.
                6.      Allow transit-oriented development within the Transit-Oriented
                        Development (TOD) area in the vicinity of the Hayward Park station
                        according to the provisions of the San Mateo Rail Corridor Transit-
                        Oriented Development Plan.
The excellent freeway access and visibility, large lots, and area's relative isolation from
residential neighborhoods make portions of this area favorable for large scale regional office and
retail growth. The anticipated improvements to the Hayward Park train station at Concar Drive
would add to the area's transit access and make it especially suitable for high-density residential
development.
PA 5.3:         Borel Avenue/Bovet Road Vicinity. Allow expansion of the commercial office
                and retail uses based on capacity of the street system, particularly the
                17th Avenue/El Camino Real intersection and on restricting potential generation
                of through traffic on local streets affecting adjacent residential neighborhoods.
                Redevelopment of commercial sites adjacent to Borel Avenue should provide
                substantial setbacks, landscape buffers, and stepped building heights to minimize
                impacts on adjacent single-family uses.
The Borel Avenue/Bovet Road area is a large scale commercial node with good access to SR 92.
The major constraint for commercial expansion is existing and anticipated future traffic
congestion at El Camino Real and Bovet Road/17th Avenue, the primary intersection serving the
business center. Commercial growth is contingent on mitigating this condition to an acceptable
intersection Level of Service as defined in the Circulation Element. Due to its proximity to the
adjacent residential neighborhood, it is intended that any redevelopment includes sensitive
design transition to minimize impacts on neighbors.
PA 5.4:         Service Commercial Uses. Retain the service commercial uses along South
                Amphlett Boulevard, South Claremont Street, Railroad Avenue and Leslie Street.
                Retain Leslie Street as service commercial and light industrial due to its proximity
                to residential uses. Redevelopment of sites should provide substantial setbacks,
                landscape buffers, and stepped building heights to minimize impacts on adjacent
                residential uses. Redevelopment of this area shall address its close proximity to
                the Hayward Park train station and the City’s Sustainability goals.
This policy is consistent with Policies LU-1.13, which encourages the retention of service
commercial businesses. The heavy industrial uses along Leslie Street and 17th Avenue have
created nuisances for neighbors. Redevelopment to lighter manufacturing or service commercial
uses with increased transit use is preferred.
PA 5.5          Former San Mateo Times Site. Mixed use development may be considered on
                this site located off Amphlett Boulevard in the Sunnybrae neighborhood.
II-56                                        Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010, Resolution No. 134-2010
                                              Amended by the City Council on April 18, 2011, Resolution No. 42 (2011)
                                               Amended by the City Council on April 6, 2015, Resolution No. 36 (2015)

                                                                                    Land Use Element
                    Commercial uses should be concentrated along the Amphlett Boulevard frontage
                    for continuity of existing commercial uses and to provide a buffer from the
                    freeway. Any development on the former San Mateo Times site should be
                    compatible with the existing residential scale, height, density and development
                    pattern of the Sunnybrae neighborhood. Any redevelopment of the San Mateo
                    Times property shall minimize potential nuisances on the surrounding residential
                    neighborhood related to traffic, parking, trucks, garbage, recycling, noise, air
                    pollutant emissions and odors.
Mixed use development is encouraged on this site due to the unique nature of this large 3.5 acre
parcel which shares frontage with both the commercial areas on Amphlett Boulevard and the
residential areas of the Sunnybrae neighborhood including Idaho Street, 10th Avenue, and
Sunnybrae Boulevard.
PA 5.6:             Single-Family and Duplex Preservation. Limit development of established
                    predominantly single-family areas to single-family uses, and predominantly
                    duplex areas to low-density residential as delineated on the Land Use Plan.
                    Consider redesignating multi-family areas to single-family and low-density
                    residential where those uses predominant and where creation of additional legal
                    non-conforming uses would be minimized.
This policy is consistent with Policy LU-1.9, which encourages the protection of established
single-family and duplex neighborhoods. Neighborhood impacts such as traffic, loss of parking,
and deterioration of community character have resulted from past redevelopment of single-
family residences to higher densities. The policy pertains to enclaves of single-family homes in
the area around Palm Avenue between Hayward Avenue and SR 92, and generally in the area
between Fifth and Ninth, Amphlett, and Delaware streets, and areas predominantly duplex but in
the past have been zoned for higher density use such as Jasmine Street between Barneson and
Borel Avenue.
PA 5.7:             Recreational Vehicle Storage. Allow recreational vehicle storage on the Cal
                    Trans surplus parcel at the Northwest corner of the SR 92 and US 101
                    Interchange.
This policy is the same as Policy PA-4.8 but pertains to a different site under the US 101/SR 92
interchange.
6.       MARINA LAGOON.
PA 6.1:        SR 92/ South Norfolk Office Center.
                    1.       Allow minor expansion of the office uses west of South Norfolk Street and
                             adjacent to US 101/SR 92 interchange, as delineated on the Building
                             Height and Intensity Plan. Limit heights nearest the adjacent low-density

Land Use
                        residential areas to three stories; allow heights nearest SR 92 up to four
                        stories.
This site is designated for limited low-scale development due to a lack of direct access from
northbound US 101 to Norfolk Street, requiring employees to travel through residential
neighborhoods. Adequate site area exists for minor additional development.
PA 6.2:        Marina Plaza Center. Retain the Marina Plaza neighborhood retail center and
               allow limited expansion of low scale commercial uses, as delineated on the
               Building Height and Intensity Plan.
               This neighborhood shopping center provides goods and services to the Los Prados
               neighborhood. The 1989 and 1995 expansions and beautification of the center
               created a more economically viable and visually pleasing addition to the
               neighborhood. This policy is consistent with Policy LU-1.12, which encourages
               the retention and enhancement of neighborhood shopping centers.
PA 6.3:        Mariner's Island Specific Plan. Allow development that includes low to high-
               density multi-family residential uses and small to large scale commercial retail
               and office uses, as delineated on the Building Height and Intensity Plans.
               Consider increasing the building intensity standards to include structured parking
               in the floor area ratio calculations.
               1.       Bridgepointe Retail and Office/Residential Site. Allow expansion
                        and/or redevelopment of the Bridgepointe retail and office/residential area,
                        formerly known as "The Island" Shopping Center, for any of the following
                        uses, as delineated in the Bridgepointe Master Plan: high-rise, high-
                        density residential; retail, offices, and hotel. Limit redevelopment
                        potential based on traffic generation which is equal to, or less than, that
                        anticipated from a retail mall of 0.62 floor area ratio (FAR).
               2.       Ancillary Commercial Sites, Area I. Expand the list of allowable uses to
                        include churches, subject to a special use permit.
               3.       Height Limits. Maximum densities of up to 75 units per acre and
                        maximum heights of up to 75’ and appropriate FARs may be allowed in
                        the following areas of Mariner's Island, for projects which provide public
                        benefits or amenities substantially greater than code requirements:
                                 a)     the area designated on the Land Use Plan (LU-3) as
                                        Mixed-Use Incentive (Regional/Community Commercial)
                                        which is commonly described as Fashion Island Shopping

                                        b)       the area designated Executive Office on the Land Use Plan
                                                 (LU-3) which is north of SR 92 and bounded by Fashion
                                                 Island Boulevard, Mariner's Island Boulevard, and
                                                 Fashion Island Shopping Center.
The Bridgepointe retail and office/residential area is a very large site with excellent freeway
access and visibility, and relative isolation from single-family neighborhoods. The site provides
revenue for the City, creation of jobs, and needed housing. Covered parking for office use shall
not be counted as floor area.
The Mariners Island Specific Plan limited floor area ratio (FAR) for this and other commercial
sites in the area based on anticipated traffic capacity. For the Bridgepointe and adjacent
office/residential property, a range of FAR’s is provided, based on traffic generation.
PA 6.4:             J. Hart Clinton Drive/Mariner's Island Boulevard. Allow development of the
                    private property at the northwest corner of East Third Avenue/Mariner's Island
                    Boulevard for medium scale commercial use, if not developed as a park, as
                    delineated on the Building Height and Intensity Plans. Permitted uses include
                    restaurant, hotel, office, and retail, or medium-density residential. Building
                    design shall be compatible with the adjacent park. Building height adjacent to the
                    park should be low and may step up towards the street intersection.
The Shoreline Park Master Plan designates the site for future parkland. In the event the property
is not purchased as a park, this policy amends the site's "Shoreline" designation to allow more
flexibility in its development, provided that development is of a type and design which is
compatible with the adjacent park use.
PA 6.5:             Recreational Vehicle Storage. Allow recreational vehicle storage on the State-
                    owned surplus parcel between Norfolk and Marina Lagoon.
This policy is the same as Policy PA-4.8 and PA-5.7 but pertains to a different State-owned
surplus parcel site.
7.       HILLSDALE.
PA 7.1:             San Mateo County Events Center. Promote the physical and aesthetic
                    improvement of the San Mateo County Events Center. Allow net expansion of
                    permanent exhibition facilities to a maximum of 100,000 square feet and allow up
                    to an additional 5,000 square feet for support and mechanical space. Protect
                    established single-family residential areas by assuring: 1) that adequate buffers
                    and screening are developed and maintained, 2) that the design of development is
                    compatible with surrounding land uses, and 3) that the County's fair share of
                    traffic and parking improvements are provided.

Land Use
The Events Center is considered an asset to San Mateo, but is in need of improvement. An
expansion of 100,000 square feet of usable exhibition space will permit a center large enough to
accommodate most trade shows, yet will control impacts such as traffic congestion, loss of
parking, and visual intrusion. Expansion of the Events Center must include significant aesthetic
improvements, mitigation of traffic and parking impacts, and a Master Plan. This Master Plan
shall include the promotion of increased transit use to meet the City’s Sustainability Goals.
Furthermore, to encourage economic vitality of the area any redevelopment or implementation of
a Master Plan for the Events Center should encourage a seamless connection to the surrounding
Bay Meadows Phase II development.
PA 7.2:         Bay Meadows Phase I. The site is designated for mixed use development
                including residential, neighborhood commercial, and regional/community
                commercial land uses. Any residential component shall provide a minimum of
                720 dwelling units and a maximum of 785 dwelling units. Permitted
                neighborhood commercial uses and regional/community commercial uses shall
                include hotel, conference center, restaurant, entertainment, office, retail, live-work
                and day care uses. The specific heights and intensities of uses are set forth in the
                Specific Plan prepared for the site. The plan assures that adequate buffers and
                screening are developed and maintained, and that the design of the development is
                compatible with adjacent land uses. Maximum height shall be 55 feet, however,
                the Specific Plan may lower height limits for particular elements of development.
This policy permits development of the site in accordance with the Bay Meadows Specific Plan
that sets forth specific building heights, intensities, and land uses. A range of dwelling units is
required in order to assist the City in meeting its fair share housing needs goals. Both
neighborhood and regional/community commercial uses are allowed in accordance with the
standards developed in the specific plan. The specific plan also includes buffers, screening, and
design compatibility with adjacent land uses. As of 2009, the majority of Bay Meadows Phase I
is built-out; however, several vacant sites still remain.
PA 7.3:         Bay Meadows Phase II. The former Bay Meadows racetrack site is designated
                for transit oriented development including residential, neighborhood commercial
                and regional/community commercial, and park and open space uses. The
                residential component shall not exceed 1,500 dwelling units, office uses shall not
                exceed 1.5 million square feet, retail uses shall not exceed 150,000 square feet,
                the precise provisions to be determined in the Specific Plan. Permitted
                neighborhood commercial and regional/community commercial uses shall include
                office, hotel, retail and service uses. There shall be a minimum of 15 acres of
                park system provided. The specific heights and intensities of uses shall be
                generally determined by the Specific Plan Amendment for the site and
                specifically determined through Design Guidelines developed for the site and
                subsequent Site Plan and Architectural Review of “Blocks” within the site.

                                              Amended by the City Council on April 18, 2011, Resolution No. 42 (2011)
                                               Amended by the City Council on April 6, 2015, Resolution No. 36 (2015)

                                                                                     Land Use Element
This policy permits development of the site in accordance with the Rail Corridor Transit
Oriented Development Plan and with the adopted Bay Meadows Specific Plan Amendment for
the site that sets forth a land use program and a “framework” of streets and blocks. The land use
program provides for a mix of “transit-oriented” uses and helps achieve the City’s fair-share
housing goals and Sustainability Goals. The Specific Plan includes measures to both protect and
connect with adjacent neighborhoods through the layout of streets and the park system. By
supporting transit-oriented development, this project will achieve reductions in vehicular trips
and help the City achieve its greenhouse gas emissions reduction target. The Climate Action
Plan further describes the role of the Bay Meadows Phase II plan in reducing greenhouse gas
emissions.
PA 7.4:             Hillsdale Shopping Center. Allow expansion and redevelopment of the
                    Hillsdale Shopping Center for commercial retail, office, hotel, residential, or
                    mixed uses containing one or more of the above at heights and intensities
                    delineated on the Building Height and Intensity Plans. Should redevelopment or
                    major expansion of the site occur, a Master Development Plan is required to
                    ensure the site is developed comprehensively.
Hillsdale Shopping Center is an important source of sales tax revenue for the City. The General
Plan designates the site as a minor focal point for commercial, hotel, residential and office uses
and allows flexibility in its development. If major expansion or redevelopment should occur in
the future, it must be planned in a comprehensive manner which minimizes impact on the
surrounding areas.
PA 7.5:             East Hillsdale Boulevard Center. Retain the neighborhood commercial
                    shopping center and allow minor low-rise expansion limited to neighborhood
                    retail uses to serve the existing residences. Allow expansion of the Hillsdale Inn
                    in accordance with the Building Height and Intensity Plans. Encourage physical
                    and visual improvements during the interim.
This neighborhood shopping center provides goods and services to San Mateo Village. It is
intended that the center be retained with limited expansion permitted to meet the increased
demand which is anticipated with the residential development of Bay Meadows. Retention and
enhancement of the Hillsdale Inn is encouraged, consistent with Policy LU-1.16.
PA 7.6:        South El Camino Real.
                    1.       Allow commercial and high density residential use of the area of South El
                             Camino Real between SR 92 and the Belmont City limits, as delineated on
                             the Building Height and Intensity Plans. For all buildings over two stories
                             high, provide a minimum setback of ten feet adjacent to El Camino Real.
                             Additionally, provide a minimum setback adjacent to residential parcels of
                             one-half the maximum building height.

                       lots more than 100 feet deep, permit heights up to 55 feet for projects
                       which meet the following criteria and are approved by the City Council
                       except as noted in 3, below:
                       a.     The project provides amenities, such as landscaped plazas, covered
                              parking, setbacks from the street, stepbacks of upper stories, and
                              public improvements substantially in excess of City requirements;
                       b.     The building has high design quality, which is enhanced by
                              additional building height;
                       c.     Increased building heights are visually related to surrounding
                              building heights and promote the creation of a coherent City
                              image;
                       d.     Increased building heights are compatible with surrounding land
                              uses, and will not create adverse shadow or visual impacts on
                              surrounding residential uses; and
                       e.     The City's infrastructure is adequate to accommodate the proposed
                              development.
                3.     Allow transit-oriented development within the Transit-Oriented
                       Development (TOD) area in the vicinity of the Hillsdale station according
                       to the provisions of the San Mateo Rail Corridor Transit-Oriented
                       Development Plan.
Prepare design criteria to implement this policy prior to approval of any building over 40 feet
high.
In this area, El Camino Real (SR 82) is characterized by a mixture of low-scale commercial uses.
It is expected that most new development will be medium scale commercial or high-density
residential or mixed-use, due to urban design concerns and traffic congestion.
PA 7.7:         Twentieth to Twenty-fifth Avenues. Retain service commercial uses and allow
                limited low-scale expansion as delineated on the Building Height and Intensity
                Plans. Exclude office and residential development.
This policy is consistent with Policy LU-1.13 which encourages the retention of service
commercial uses.
PA 7.8:         Delaware Street. Development of the west side of Delaware Street between
                SR 92 and 25th Avenue should be consistent with the Rail Corridor Transit-
                Oriented Development Plan.

                                             Amended by the City Council on April 18, 2011, Resolution No. 42 (2011)
                                              Amended by the City Council on April 6, 2015, Resolution No. 36 (2015)
                                                                                        Land Use Element
It is intended that this area be exclusively transit oriented in character consistent with Policies
LU 3.4 and LU 3.5, because of its proximity to the Hayward Park Caltrain station.
Redevelopment may be for residential uses (except for property fronting onto 19th Avenue), as
delineated on the Building Height and Intensity Plans.
PA 7.9:             Twenty-fifth Avenue Shopping Center. Retain the neighborhood commercial
                    uses and allow limited low-scale retail expansion with heights up to a maximum
                    of two stories along 25th Avenue between Delaware Street and South El Camino
                    Real. Provide better signage and access to public parking areas.
PA 7.10:            Lauriedale Shopping Center. Allow expansion of the Lauriedale neighborhood
                    shopping center, as delineated on the Building Height and Intensity Plans.
                    Promote improved appearance of the center.
These policies are consistent with Policy LU-1.12, which encourages the retention and
enhancement of neighborhood shopping areas.
PA 7.11:            Transit-Oriented Development (TOD). Encourage a transit-supportive mix of
                    uses consistent with the San Mateo Rail Corridor Transit-Oriented Development
                    Plan (Corridor Plan) and Hillsdale Station Area Plan.
This policy is consistent with Policies LU 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6, which establish the Corridor Plan,
the TOD designation and the Hillsdale Station Area Plan. Actions to implement this policy are
further outlined in the Climate Action Plan which is an appendix of the General Plan.

                             Building Height and Intensity Plans. For all buildings over two stories
                             high, provide a minimum setback of ten feet adjacent to El Camino Real.
                             Additionally, provide a minimum setback adjacent to residential parcels of
                             one-half the maximum building height.
                    2.       For lots 100 feet deep and less, maximum building height is 40 feet. For
                             lots more than 100 feet deep, permit heights up to 55 feet for projects
                             which meet the following criteria and are approved by the City Council:
                             a.         The project provides amenities, such as landscaped plazas, covered
                                        parking, setbacks from the street, stepbacks of upper stories, and
                                        public improvements substantially in excess of City requirements;

                        b.       The building has high design quality, which is enhanced by
                                 additional building height;
                        c.       Increased building heights are visually related to surrounding
                                 building heights and promote the creation of a coherent City
                                 image;
                        d.       Increased building heights are compatible with surrounding land
                                 uses, and will not create adverse shadow or visual impacts on
                                 surrounding residential uses; and
                        e.       The City's infrastructure is adequate to accommodate the proposed
                                 development.

PA 8.2:      Twentieth Avenue Vicinity.
                1.      Between Elkhorn Court and O'Farrell Street, allow redevelopment either
                        as: a) low intensity office use with heights to a maximum of two stories; b)
                        mixed use with high density residential with heights up to four stories, as
                        delineated on the Building Height and Building Intensity Plans; or c) high-
                        density residential development with heights up to four stories, as
                        delineated on the Building Height and Intensity Plans.
It is not intended that this area be a large scale commercial node due to its proximity to
residential neighborhoods and limited peak period roadway capacity.
Allowable commercial expansion is limited to minimize neighborhood impacts. A mix of multi-
family and low-scale commercial uses is encouraged, consistent with this policy.
                2.      Retain the recreation and club uses on the south side of 20th Avenue
                        between Pioneer Court and Isabelle Avenue. Should redevelopment of the
                        site occur, a medium-density residential use with heights up to three
                        stories is appropriate, as delineated on the Building Height and Intensity
                        Plans.
The Elks Club has been a part of the community for many years and is not expected nor
encouraged to relocate its facility. Residential redevelopment of this large site is permitted due
to the limited impact on the adjacent residential neighborhoods and on roadway capacity in the
II-64                                        Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010, Resolution No. 134-2010
                                               Amended by the City Council on April 18, 2011, Resolution No. 42 (2011)
                                                Amended by the City Council on April 6, 2015, Resolution No. 36 (2015)
                                                                                      Land Use Element
area. Commercial redevelopment is prohibited due to the potential adverse impacts on the
neighborhood.
PA 8.3:             Twenty-Fifth Avenue Shopping Center. Retain the neighborhood commercial
                    uses emphasizing ground floor retail use. Allow limited low-scale expansion up
                    to two stories except for those parcels fronting on El Camino Real where four
                    stories are permitted providing that the two upper stories are for residential use.
This policy is consistent with Policy LU-1.12, which encourages the retention and enhancement
of neighborhood shopping areas.
PA 8.4:             Peninsula Golf and Country Club. Retain the existing club and recreation use.
                    Should the site redevelop, single-family and low-density residential development
                    is appropriate.
Retention of the Peninsula Golf and Country Club is encouraged. The facility is a recreational
resource and provides open space within the community. Should redevelopment occur, a Master
Plan should be established. Future development should be consistent and compatible with the
adjacent single-family neighborhood. This will include a site plan which preserves mature
vegetation, natural topography and a substantial amount of open space by clustering dwelling
units and a circulation plan which minimizes traffic impacts in the area.
PA 8.5:             SR 92/Hillsdale Boulevard/Campus Drive Vicinity.
                    1.       Allow expansion of the office uses east of Hillsdale Boulevard south of
                             SR 92, and along Campus Drive, with maximum heights and intensities as
                             delineated on the Building Height and Intensity Plans.
The area is a prominent regional office center allowing expansion due to its excellent freeway
access and relative isolation from single-family neighborhoods.
                    2.       Retain the Laurelwood (College Heights Plaza) Shopping Center's
                             neighborhood retail uses and allow limited low-scale expansion with a
                             maximum height up to two stories.
The shopping center provides goods and services to the several neighborhoods in the Western
Hills area. This policy is consistent with Policy LU-1.12, which encourages the retention and
enhancement of neighborhood shopping areas.
PA 8.6:             Alameda/SR 92 Synagogue Site. Allow redevelopment of the synagogue parcel
                    for either medium-density multi-family residential or office uses. Office
                    development is contingent upon obtaining joining access from the adjacent office
                    properties to permit vehicular access from the signalized 20th/Alameda
                    intersection.

Amended by the City Council on April 6, 2015, Resolution No. 36 (2015)
Land Use
Should redevelopment of the synagogue site occur, a medium-density multi-family residential
project or office use similar to the adjoining properties would be appropriate.
PA 8.7:         Campus Drive Emergency Access. Maintain access between Campus Drive and
                26th Avenue for emergency use only, and preclude modifications which would
                allow through vehicular access between these streets to protect surrounding
                residences.
This policy reaffirms that Campus Drive to 26th Avenue will be maintained for emergency
access only.
9.      SUGARLOAF.
PA 9.1:         Forty-Second Avenue Center. Develop a Specific Plan for the area between
                41st Avenue, Beresford Street, South El Camino Real and the Belmont border to
                improve the efficiency of the site design, circulation, appearance, and design
                relationship to surrounding uses, and to allow mixed commercial and residential
                expansion. Allow heights and intensities/densities as delineated on the Building
                Height and Intensity Plans.
The 42nd Avenue Shopping Center is intended to be the major neighborhood retail center in the
southern portion of the City. Problems such as circulation, parking, access, and appearance have
limited the market performance of the area. A Specific Plan will be prepared to address these
problems and to maximize the center's economic vitality, provide housing opportunities, and
encourage mixed use.
PA 9.2:         South El Camino Real.
                1.      Allow commercial and high density residential use of the area of South
                        El Camino Real between 36th and 41st avenues, as delineated on the
                        Building Height and Intensity Plans. For all buildings over two stories
                        high, provide a minimum setback of ten feet adjacent to El Camino Real .
                        Additionally, provide a minimum setback adjacent to residential parcels of
                        one-half the maximum building height subject to the El Camino Real
                        Master Plan.
                2.      For lots 100 feet deep and less, maximum building height is 40 feet. For
                        lots more than 100 feet deep, permit heights up to 55 feet for projects
                        which meet the following criteria and are approved by the City Council:
                        a.      The project provides amenities, such as landscaped plazas, covered
                                parking, setbacks from the street, stepbacks of upper stories, and
                                public improvements substantially in excess of City requirements;

PA 9.3:             San Mateo County Hospital. Should all or a portion of the San Mateo County
                    Hospital redevelop, a mixed residential development is appropriate with stepped
                    density compatible with adjacent residential areas, ranging from single-family
                    adjacent to single family residences to medium density where adequately
                    buffered.
The City encourages retention of the hospital use due to the community service and jobs it
provides. The hospital has undergone extensive remodeling including the addition of a new
building which should result in the retention of the facility. Should the site be redeveloped, a
Master Plan shall be prepared. Future development must be compatible with the surrounding
residential area. Because of the site's size and that it is surrounded by both single and multi-
family residences, a mixed residential development is appropriate. Stepped density will include
new single-family dwellings located adjacent to existing single-family areas, and multi-family
dwellings on the site's interior and adjacent to existing multi-family areas.

PA 10.1:            San Mateo County Facilities Site. Allow redevelopment of the San Mateo
                    County lands to low-density, multi-family or single-family residential, at a
                    maximum density equal to two dwelling units per acre. Encourage clustered
                    development to maximize open space and protect hillsides, major vegetation,
                    natural topography and views from surrounding areas. Development of a Master
                    Plan for any future development of the site is required.
Retention of the County Facilities is encouraged. Should redevelopment occur, the appropriate
use is low-density residential. This is due to the use characteristics of the surrounding area and
the natural conditions of the site, particularly its topography. Sites must not be owned and/or

  A. INTRODUCTION
The extent of exposure of the population to noise constitutes a major component of overall
quality of life in the community. The Noise Element sets forth the City's goals and policies
regarding the control of environmental noise and the protection of citizens from excessive noise
exposure.
   B. BACKGROUND
The following information does not attempt to fully describe all principles and data related to
noise generation, but rather provides a setting for the goals and policies of this Element.
BASIC CONCEPTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL NOISE
Noise is commonly defined as unwanted sound. Environmental noise is a part of modern society
– noise from transportation vehicles, machinery, and amplified sound. People can tolerate a
certain amount of noise, but excessive levels become a nuisance and can ultimately result in
hearing impairment.
Noise level or intensity is measured in decibels (dB), and ranges from 0 dB at the threshold of
hearing to 140 dB, which is the threshold of pain. The sensitivity of human hearing decreases at
extremely low and high frequencies and this is taken into account by the “A-weighted” decibel
scale, which is sometimes expressed as “dBA.” All references to decibels in this document refer
to the A-weighted decibel scale. In evaluating noise increases, it is important to know that a 3 dB
change in noise level is just noticeable to the human ear, a 5 dB change is easily noticeable, and
a 10 dB increase is perceived as a doubling of loudness.
Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010    VIII-1                      Resolution No. 134-2010

                                                                                            Noise Element
Since community noise levels vary continuously, a variety of noise metrics (i.e., descriptors)
were created to describe the time-varying character of environmental noise. One of the most
common metrics is the average (equivalent) sound level, or Leq. The Leq is the average A-
weighted sound level during a stated time period (often a one-hour period).
To evaluate community noise impacts, a descriptor was developed to account for human
sensitivity to noise during the nighttime (sleeping) hours and to account for the overall lower
community noise levels encountered at night. This descriptor is call the Ldn (or DNL); the Ldn
represents a 24-hour average sound level with a 10 dB penalty added for nighttime noise
between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m.
For suburban/rural highways and most roadways, the average noise level during the peak traffic
periods (i.e., rush hour) is approximately equal to the Ldn. For urban highways, the Ldn is
typically one to two dB higher than the peak hour Leq.

         Every increase of 10 dB doubles the perceived loudness of noise. For example, a
         motorcycle accelerating (90 dB) seems twice as loud as a power lawn mower (80
         dB).

                                                                                       Noise Element
NOISE IN SAN MATEO
A noise measurement survey was conducted in San Mateo during September 2008 to determine
noise levels throughout the community. The results are represented as a contour map in Figure
N-1. The noise contours show lines of equal sound level, but the contours are conservative since
the shielding effect of buildings and local topography is not taken into account when creating the
noise contours. Noise exposure in San Mateo is dominated by traffic and the Southern Pacific
(SPRR)/Caltrain rail line. Aircraft activity associated with San Francisco International Airport
does not significantly affect noise levels in San Mateo, although some neighborhoods in the
northeastern portion of the City are impacted by the airport approach path. Localized noise
sources include the San Mateo County Fairgrounds (when events are being held). Generally,
noise created by manufacturing uses does not have a major impact on the community, although
occasional complaints are received from neighbors immediately adjacent to the manufacturing
sites.
The noise contour map is used to determine the suitability of land uses for different types of
development, depending upon the extent of noise exposure in the area. The City of San Mateo
has developed a list of “noise-sensitive” uses (see Tables N-1 and N-2), which include residential
dwellings, schools, hospitals, hotels, and outdoor recreation areas. These uses should ideally be
located in areas not exceeding 60 dB (Ldn) and 65 dB (Leq) for outdoor recreational uses, but this
is not reasonable in San Mateo where existing noise levels exceed 60 dB (Ldn) in all but a few of
the western portions of the City (see Figure N-1). “Noise-sensitive” land uses could be located in
areas having noise levels between 60 and 70 dB (Ldn) if noise mitigating construction measures
are used to reduce interior sound levels to 45 dB (Ldn) or below as required by the State Building
Code for multi-family dwellings, and extended by the City of San Mateo to new single-family
dwellings. Exterior sound levels for new multi-family common open space should be reduced to
below 67 dB (Ldn). For parks or playgrounds, the exterior sound level should be reduced to
65 dB (Leq) during the noisiest hour; this can be accomplished by locating these spaces away
from noise sources or buffering them by the placement of buildings between the noise source and
the open space.
The areas of greatest noise impact in San Mateo, where 70 dB (Ldn) is exceeded and are therefore
unsuitable for the location of new “noise-sensitive” uses, are in the residential neighborhoods
adjacent to the Bayshore Freeway (US 101) and the SPRR/Caltrain rail corridor (see Figure N-
1). Narrow portions adjacent to SR 92 and El Camino Real (SR 82) also exceed the City's
guidelines. The projected cumulative noise increases in the year 2030 are shown in Figure N-2,
and are very similar to existing conditions, with noise increases generally due to traffic increases.
MITIGATING NOISE IMPACTS
Noise mitigation measures fall into two general categories: physical mitigation and
administrative regulation. Physical mitigation involves reducing the noise level, ideally at the
source, through methods such as enclosing a noisy piece of equipment with a barrier or by
substituting quieter machinery. Reduction in the overall community sound level can also occur

                                                                                         Noise Element
by limiting noise exposure of receivers to roadways and railways. This can be accomplished by
installing sound walls, using sound-absorbing building materials, and through careful site
planning (e.g., orienting buildings away from the noise source and eliminating narrow corridors
open to the noise source). The walls and windows of a building typically reduce noise by
approximately 20 dB. Noise barriers, such as sound walls and earthen berms provide varying
reductions of noise, depending on their height and size. A solid wall that just breaks the line-of-
sight between the noise source and receiver attenuates noise by 5 dB.
If noise cannot be reduced at the source as described above, the distance between the source and
the receiver can be increased to attenuate the noise. A doubling of the distance from a fixed noise
source (e.g., an air conditioning unit, train engine, or whistle) results in a 6 dB decrease in noise
level; a doubling of distance from a linear source (e.g., a highway or roadway) results in a 3 dB
decrease. Vegetation does little to reduce noise – a densely planted strip 50 feet wide is needed to
reduce noise by 5 dB.
Administrative regulation reduces noise generation by limiting the operating hours or duration of
the noise source, regulating locations where a noisy activity may occur, or enforcing State
standards that limit noise emissions, such as automobile and boat muffler requirements.

  These guidelines are derived from the California Department of Health Services, Guidelines for the Preparation
and Content of the Noise Element of the General Plan, 2003. The State Guidelines have been modified to reflect San
Mateo's preference for distinct noise compatibility categories and to better reflect local land-use and noise
conditions. It is intended that these guidelines be utilized to evaluate the suitability of land-use changes only and not
to determine cumulative noise impacts. Land uses other than those classified as being “noise sensitive” are exempt
from these compatibility guidelines.
2
  Normally Acceptable – Specified land use is satisfactory, based upon the assumption that any buildings involved
are of normal conventional construction, without any special noise insulation requirements.
3
  Conditionally Acceptable – New construction should be undertaken only after a detailed analysis of the noise
reduction requirement is conducted and needed noise insulation features included in the design.
4
  Normally Unacceptable – New construction should be discouraged. If new construction or development does
proceed, a detailed analysis of the noise reduction requirements must be made and needed noise insulation features
included in the design.

  C. GOALS AND POLICIES
GOALS AND POLICIES
GOAL 1: Protect “noise sensitive” land uses from excessive noise levels.
POLICIES:
N 1.1:         Interior Noise Level Standard. Require submittal of an acoustical analysis and
               interior noise insulation for all “noise sensitive” land uses listed in Table N-1 that
               have an exterior noise level of 60 dB (Ldn) or above, as shown on Figure N-1. The
               maximum interior noise level shall not exceed 45 dB (Ldn) in any habitable rooms.
N 1.2:         Exterior Noise Level Standard. Require an acoustical analysis for new parks, play
               areas, and multi-family common open space (intended for the use and the enjoyment
               of residents) that have an exterior noise level of 60 dB (Ldn) or above, as shown on
               Figure N-1. Require an acoustical analysis that uses peak hour Leq for new parks and
               play areas. Require a feasibility analysis of noise reduction measures for public parks
               and play areas. Incorporate necessary mitigation measures into residential project
               design to minimize common open space noise levels. Maximum exterior noise should
               not exceed 67 dB (Ldn) for residential uses and should not exceed 65 dB (Leq) during
               the noisiest hour for public park uses.
Implementation of N 1.1 and N1.2: Interior and Exterior Noise Level Standards.
               As part of the development review process, an acoustical analysis is required for all
               new project types listed on Tables N-1 and N-2 when the site noise levels exceed the
               noise level standards established in the General Plan. Mitigation measures to reduce
               both exterior and interior noise to acceptable levels are required as part of the
               analysis, and are incorporated into the conditions of project approval.
               Lead: Planning Division reviews General Plan and consults with Building Division
               on scope of analysis. Building Division approves content of final report and
               administers conditions of project approval. (Ongoing)
Most of San Mateo has existing noise levels that exceed the normally acceptable levels for
“noise-sensitive” uses. Since the majority of the City is within the “conditionally acceptable”
range of between 60 dB and 70 dB (Ldn), some form of noise mitigation will have to be
incorporated into building and site design for new “noise-sensitive” land uses. While the State
currently requires that multi-family dwellings in areas exceeding 60 dB (Ldn) incorporate
mitigation measures to achieve an interior sound level of 45 dB (Ldn), the City of San Mateo will

extend this requirement to single-family dwellings. In most cases, the necessary sound
attenuation can be accomplished with sound-rated double-pane windows.
A few of San Mateo's residential neighborhoods that border highways, El Camino Real (SR 82),
and the railway line are subject to sound levels exceeding 70 dB (Ldn), which is in the “normally
unacceptable” range for “noise-sensitive” uses. Rather than precluding new residential
development in these areas, the City will require that building construction techniques be utilized
that reduce interior sound to 45 dB (Ldn) or less.
Also of concern are outdoor recreation areas in new parks and schools. The City will require a
feasibility study to determine whether measures to reduce exterior sound levels, such as sound
walls, sheltering open space areas from noise sources by building walls, and placement of active
use areas away from noise sources are feasible. Particular attention should be paid to the design
of sound barriers so they are visually pleasing; this can often be accomplished through extensive
landscape screening.
GOAL 2: Minimize unnecessary, annoying, or unhealthful noise.
POLICIES:
N 2.1:         Noise Ordinance. Continue implementation and enforcement of the City's existing
               noise control ordinance: a) which prohibits noise that is annoying or injurious to
               neighbors of normal sensitivity, making such activity a public nuisance, and b)
               restricts the hours of construction to minimize noise impact.
Implementation of N 2.1: Noise Ordinance.
               Noise nuisances, as defined in the City's Municipal Code, are abated through a
               standardized enforcement process, which includes referral to the Housing and
               Advisory Appeals Board. This includes noise generated by building construction and
               equipment at unauthorized times.
               Lead: Code Enforcement Division. (Ongoing)
Enforcement of a noise control ordinance can reduce nuisance noise generated by commercial
uses or from residential sources such as amplified music, parties, leaf blowers, or barking dogs.
Construction activities also generate substantial short-term noise impacts, which can be limited
to specified hours and days of the week.
N 2.2:         Minimize Noise Impact. Protect all “noise-sensitive” land uses listed in Tables N-1
               and N-2 from adverse impacts caused by the noise generated on-site by new
               developments. Incorporate necessary mitigation measures into development design to
               minimize noise impacts. Prohibit long-term exposure increases of 3 dB (Ldn) or
               greater at the common property line, or new uses which generate noise levels of 60
               dB (Ldn) or greater at the property line, excluding existing ambient noise levels.

“Noise-sensitive” land uses, such as residential neighborhoods, hotels, hospitals, schools, and
outdoor recreation areas must be protected from new development that causes discernable
increases in noise levels as a result of on-site activities. Noise generators such as machinery or
parking lots must be mitigated through physical measures or operational limits.
N 2.3:         Minimize Commercial Noise. Protect land uses other than those listed as “noise
               sensitive” in Table N-1 from adverse impacts caused by the on-site noise generated
               by new developments. Incorporate necessary mitigation measures into development
               design to minimize noise impacts. Prohibit new uses that generate noise levels of 65
               dB (Ldn) or above at the property line, excluding existing ambient noise levels.
Commercial and industrial areas typically tolerate higher noise levels than residential
neighborhoods. However, some control is necessary for new development within non-residential
areas so that exceptionally noisy uses are restricted.
Implementation of N 2.2 and N 2.3: Minimize Noise.
               Where the potential exists for noise impacts inconsistent with these policies, a noise
               report identifying noise impacts and mitigation measures is required as part of the
               development review process. Mitigation measures are then incorporated as conditions
               of the project approval.
               Lead: Planning Division reviews the General Plan and consults with the Building
               Division on the scope of the analysis. The Building Division approves the content of
               the final report and administers the conditions of project approval. (Ongoing)
N 2.4:         Traffic Noise. Recognize projected increases in ambient noise levels resulting from
               traffic increases, as shown on Figure N-2. Promote the installation of noise barriers
               along highways where “noise-sensitive” land uses listed in Table N-1 are adversely
               impacted by unacceptable noise levels [60 dB (Ldn) or above]. Require adequate noise
               mitigation to be incorporated into the widening of SR 92 and US 101. Accept noise
               increases on El Camino Real at existing development, and require new multi-family
               development to provide common open space having a maximum exterior noise level
               of 67 dB (Ldn).
Implementation N 2.4: Traffic Noise.
               Sound walls have been constructed along US 101. Preliminary design work has not
               yet started on the widening of SR 92; however, the issue of sound walls will be
               addressed during both the design and environmental review phases of the project.
               Noise standards for development along El Camino Real are imposed on a case-by-
               case basis consistent with this policy's guidelines. New multi-family developments
               are required to comply with exterior noise standards as part of the development
               review process for consistency with the State Building Code.
Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010      VIII-8                        Resolution No. 134-2010

                                                                                          Noise Element
               Lead: The Public Works Department coordinates sound wall construction with
               Caltrans. Planning and Building Divisions coordinate the review and application of
               conditions of approval for new development regarding compliance with this policy.
               (Ongoing)
The City recognizes that traffic will increase during the next 20 years, and that mitigating traffic
noise is very difficult, except in certain instances. The installation of sound walls along highways
is supported as an effective means of reducing this major impact. Sound walls are not
appropriate, however, in residential neighborhoods or along major streets due to their visual
impact and the need for street access points, which diminishes the effectiveness of the barriers.
N 2.5:         Railroad Noise. Promote the installation of noise barriers along the railroad corridor
               where “noise-sensitive” land uses are adversely impacted by unacceptable noise
               levels [60 dB (Ldn) or greater]. Promote adequate noise mitigation to be incorporated
               into any rail service expansion or track realignment. Study the need of depressing the
               rail line to eliminate at-grade crossings or other mitigation measures to decrease noise
               levels prior to substantial expansion of the rail service.
Implementation N 2.5: Railroad Noise.
               The Joint Powers Authority has completed a study of electrification of the rail lines,
               and has adopted a policy for its implementation. Electrification of the rail line, in
               conjunction with the elimination of at-grade crossings, would greatly reduce railroad
               noise impacts. Installation of noise barriers is analyzed on a project-by-project basis
               for development adjacent to the railroad. Noise impacts were also considered in the
               examination of alignment alternatives in the railroad corridor study.
               Lead: The Public Works Department coordinates with the Joint Powers Authority on
               railroad alignment. The Planning and Building Divisions coordinate the review and
               application of conditions of approval for new development adjacent to the rail
               corridor regarding noise impacts. (Ongoing)
Another noise source that can be mitigated is the railroad corridor. The City supports the
installation of sound walls along the rail line. If substantial increases in rail service occur as
projected in the Circulation Element, the need for both noise mitigation and grade separation of
the rail line and streets will increase. To achieve both objectives, the City and the Joint Powers
Authority should consider depressing the rail line, particularly in the Downtown.

                        VII. Safety and
                Hazardous Waste
                                   Management
   A. INTRODUCTION
Public safety is one of the primary responsibilities of government. A risk-free environment is
not possible, because we cannot always predict the forces of nature or the strength of man-made
structures and effectiveness of preventative measures. Determinations of reasonable levels of
safety involve tradeoffs of cost, public inconvenience and limitations on the use of private
property. The Safety Element sets forth the City’s goals and policies which are intended to
minimize risk to people and property associated with natural and man-made hazards.
 B. GEOLOGIC AND SEISMIC HAZARDS
BACKGROUND
Earthquake Faults and Surface Rupture
The San Andreas Fault lies approximately two miles west of the San Mateo City boundary and
the Hayward Fault lies approximately 14 miles to the East. Despite its close proximity, there is
no evidence of significant ground rupturing in the City during the last one million years. There
are no known active faults in San Mateo, and inactive faults which are present are older features
which do not exhibit indications of recent motion. There is no reason to expect a recurrence of
movement along these other fault traces.
                                              VII-1

                                                                                       Safety Element
Ground Shaking and Seismically Induced Waves
Past earthquakes have shown that often the underlying soil conditions pose a greater hazard to
structures than the proximity to a fault. Ground shaking from an earthquake is amplified and
lasts longer in unconsolidated or water saturated, soils such as bay mud, than in harder bedrock
(see Figure S-1). Ground shaking can cause structural failure of buildings in moderate to severe
earthquakes, particularly older structures built prior to the establishment of seismic safety
standards in 1933. Masonry buildings are particularly vulnerable to the lateral motion of
earthquakes unless properly reinforced. In 1989, the City’s Building Inspection Division
identified 25 unreinforced masonry structures which maybe seismically hazardous. All but 2 of
these buildings are located downtown, predominantly on East Third Avenue, Second Avenue and
B Street. As of August 2008, 23 of the 25 unreinforced masonry buildings have completed
seismic retrofitting to increase stability in an earthquake. The remaining 2 unreinforced masonry
buildings are expected to be seismically retrofitted by the end of 2009. A list of these buildings
is available in the Building Division.
Concrete tilt-up buildings constructed prior to 1973 may be vulnerable to structural damage due
to ground shaking. The City has approximately 40 such buildings, a number of which have been
retrofitted since the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989. Most steel and wood frame buildings, due
to their lighter materials and seismically stability, have an excellent performance record.
Beyond structural failure, building features including exterior parapets, ornamentation and large
windows may be hazardous in the event of an earthquake. Other potentially dangerous effects of
ground shaking may include separation of buildings from their foundations, falling furniture and
suspended ceilings, and collapsed chimneys. Freeway overpasses are also critical structures
which may collapse in a major earthquake.
The Loma Prieta earthquake on October 17, 1989, was measured at 7.1 on the Richter scale with
the epicenter located between Santa Cruz and San Jose. San Mateo sustained substantial
building damage, but no fatalities. Earthquake damage in the City was estimated at
approximately $240 million, which included $100 million in structural damage and the
remainder due to damage to building contents. One unreinforced masonry building in the
downtown experienced structural failure of parapet walls causing significant but repairable
damage. Several concrete tilt-up structures and other buildings also experienced structural
damage, but all were repairable. Extensive interior damage was caused by falling ceiling tiles,
broken glass, and toppled furnishings. Numerous steel and concrete buildings had cracking of the
concrete fascia, but no major structural damage. There were approximately 200 chimneys that
failed or had significant damage.
While this earthquake resulted in substantial damage, it is important to note that its magnitude
was classified as a "major" earthquake. The force of a great earthquake, similar to the 1906 San
Francisco earthquake which was estimated to have been 8.3 on the Richter scale, would have
been at least 16 times greater than the Loma Prieta earthquake. An earthquake of this magnitude
would have a tremendous and long-term impact on the operations and financial health of the
City.
Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010  VII-2                          Resolution No. 134-2010

                                                                                     Safety Element
The ground shaking of earthquakes can also cause water related hazards known as tsunamis and
seiches. Tsunamis are sea waves commonly accompanying large submarine earthquakes. Such
underwater fault ruptures are generally not present along the California coast. The likelihood of
a major tsunami created near Alaska causing flooding of the San Mateo bayfront is very remote
since a wave 20 feet in height at the Golden Gate would be necessary to reach Coyote Point. The
area of inundation from such a tsunami is shown on Figure S-4.
A seiche is an earthquake induced water wave in a confined body of water, such as swimming
pools, water storage tanks, or reservoirs. Even in large bodies of water, seiches typically are less
than one foot high. The potential for overtopping of Crystal Springs Reservoir is very remote
and would not pose a flooding danger. There are approximately 20 water supply tanks in San
Mateo, most of which are covered.
Ground Failure: Landslides, Mudslides and Liquefaction
Slope failure is usually associated with heavy rainfall or a major earthquake. In the Bay Area,
landslides most commonly occur on slopes greater than 15%. Grading activities which increase
slope or alter drainage patterns often contribute to landslides. San Mateo’s western hills are
generally stable. Past known slope failures, which number over 50, have primarily occurred in
the Laurelwood, Highlands and Country Club Heights areas, and are indicated on Figure S-2.
Although past landslides have caused property damage, no loss of life or dwellings has occurred.
Another form of ground failure is liquefaction, which occurs as a result of an earthquake when
grains of soil become saturated. The soils become unstable and may behave as a liquid, causing
sudden ground failure. Liquefaction can be particularly destructive to building foundations.
Two common engineering practices to minimize these effects are to support buildings on piles
driven through filled soils to bedrock or on "floating" foundations designed to shift with the
altered soils. In San Mateo, the risk of liquefaction is highest on former baylands which were
filled, which extends as far west as El Camino Real as shown on Figure S-2. Areas of particular
concern include former sand beds or tidal channels indicated in Appendix H.
Other Geologic Problems: Ground Settlement and Erosion
Other geologic processes occur in San Mateo which may not be life-threatening, but nonetheless
cause damage to property and the environment. Ground settlement results from the compaction
of unconsolidated soils, causing buildings and foundations to crack, and utility lines to separate.
In San Mateo, ground settlement typically occurs on filled baylands in the eastern portion of the
City. Mitigating measures include proper soil compaction, construction methods such as pile
driving or floating foundations, and allowance of settlement in the design of utilities.
Soil erosion and the resulting sedimentation of creeks and storm drains are natural processes
which can be greatly accelerated by human activities such as grading, vegetation clearing and
poorly engineered drainage systems. This problem is most critical in the western hills, and can
be controlled through development restrictions and engineering techniques.
Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010 VII-3                         Resolution No. 134-2010

                                                                                         Safety Element
GOALS AND POLICIES
GOAL 1:            Take steps to protect the community from unreasonable risk to life and
                   property caused by seismic and geologic hazards.
POLICIES:
S 1.1:         Geologic Hazards. Require site specific geotechnical and engineering studies,
               subject to the review and approval of the City Engineer and Building Official, for
               development proposed on sites identified in Figure S-2 as having moderate or high
               potential for ground failure. Permit development in areas of potential geologic
               hazards only where it can be demonstrated that the project will not be endangered by,
               nor contribute to, the hazardous condition on the site or on adjacent properties.
Figure S-2 identifies those areas of the City which may be subject to ground failure. If
development is proposed, detailed geotechnical and engineering studies are necessary to
determine if the development is appropriate to the particular site and to evaluate potential
impacts on adjoining properties. In most cases, mitigation measures may be imposed, dictating
certain engineering methods for appropriate building foundation construction and drainage
control.
S 1.2:         Hillside Development Standards. Regulate hillside development consistent with
               the City’s Site Development Code and Open Space/Conservation Policy 3.1.
Most of San Mateo’s western hills were subdivided during the 1950’s and 1960’s, some
including slopes over 25% grade. During this subdivision process numerous lots were created
which far exceeded the minimum lot size standards, and therefore could have been further
subdivided. However, most of these "remainder" parcels were left unsubdivided due to their
steep slopes, poor accessibility, and/or poor soil conditions. With the increasing cost of housing,
subdivision and development of the "remainder" parcels in the western hills has become feasible.
Development of steeply sloped property poses greater risks than relatively flat land. It typically
involves substantial grading and alteration of the existing topography, which may affect the
stability of adjoining property and alter local drainage patterns. If not properly engineered, a
new structure may crack and separate in the event of seismic activity or landslide.
While these problems may be mitigated by proper engineering techniques, slope development
has visual impacts on adjoining property owners and on more distant vistas.
Open Space/Conservation Policy 3.1 discusses development on steep slopes in relation to
density, the clustering of development to preserve steep slopes for open space, the preservation
of existing topography by limiting cut and fill, and the visibility of new hillside development.
The Site Development Code seeks to minimize risk of harm to persons or property by requiring
appropriate engineering and/or hydrologic studies and recommendations for development located
on slopes 15% or greater, or within a slope setback area as defined in the Code.
Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010   VII-4                           Resolution No. 134-2010

                                                                                         Safety Element
S 1.3:         Erosion Control. Require erosion control measures for all development sites where
               grading activities are occurring, including those having landslide deposits, past
               erosion problems, the potential for storm water quality impacts, or slopes of 15% or
               greater which are to be altered. Control measures shall retain natural topographic and
               physical features of the site if feasible.
The impacts of erosion and altered drainage patterns can be most critical on land which has
shown a tendency towards landsliding, where existing erosion gullies are apparent or on very
steep slopes that have a 15% or greater grade. On such sites, an engineering study of erosion
control will be required in conjunction with new development proposals.
S 1.4:         Unreinforced Masonry Buildings. Maintain the program which requires mandatory
               modifications of existing unreinforced masonry buildings identified as being
               potentially hazardous, and similar unsafe building conditions, to reduce the
               associated life safety hazards. The mandatory structural modifications should be
               designed to be in character with the existing architectural style.
Unreinforced masonry buildings typically suffer life-threatening damage during great
earthquakes. State law requires that local governments identify unreinforced masonry buildings
and adopt a program to abate such life-threatening conditions. San Mateo’s 25 unreinforced
masonry structures are predominantly located in the downtown, and 9 have been identified as
having historic significance. As of August 2008, 23 of the 25 identified buildings have
completed a seismic upgrade. The remaining 2 buildings have been issued building permits and
are expected to be upgraded by the end of 2009.
   C. FLOOD HAZARDS
BACKGROUND
Bay Water Flooding
The City of San Mateo confronts substantial flood risks from the San Francisco Bay. The
potential for flooding is due to the combined effects of high tides, very heavy storm flows and
sea level rise due to global warming. A series of outboard levees, located within San Mateo and
Foster City, protect the City from San Francisco Bay tidal flooding. Without adequate levee
protection, areas between the Railroad tracks and the Bay are directly exposed to saltwater
inundation.
A Flood Insurance Study (FIS) was conducted by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
in 1996 for areas north of Highway 92, in the City of San Mateo. The studies indicated that San
Mateo Creek levees and the Bay levee at the north end of Coyote Point were not adequate to
Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010     VII-5                         Resolution No. 134-2010

                                                                                       Safety Element
comply with current FEMA requirements, and therefore are assumed to fail during a 100-year
flood event. As a result, FEMA issued a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) in 2001 which
included a portion of the low-lying areas north of Highway 92 in a special flood hazard area.
Mandatory flood insurance is required for properties financed by lending institutions that act in
accordance with Federal standards. Note that, although only these areas are included in the
FIRM, as the study area of the 1996 FIS focused solely on locations north of Highway 92, the
low-lying areas south of Highway 92 is subject to the same regulatory flood risks.
A Citywide hydraulic study completed in 2001 evaluated San Mateo’s flood protection facilities.
The hydraulic study identified information regarding the areas of the outboard levee system that
do not provide protection conforming to FEMA standards:
    1.   Shoreline from Burlingame to Coyote Point
    2.   Bayfront levee near Coyote Point
    3.   San Mateo Creek from the Bay to Highway 101
    4.   Bayfront levee near Detroit Drive
    5.   O’Neil Slough Tide Gate levee from Foster City to Highway 101
    6.   High ground located at the mouth of Marina Lagoon
The San Mateo Creek levee and O’Neil Slough Tide Gate levee improvements were completed
in 2003 and 2006, respectively. The City is working diligently to identify funding for the
remaining improvements.
To remove the special flood area designation from the FIRM, it is necessary to address tidal
flooding and residual flooding; that is, flooding caused by inadequate interior drainage facilities.
The 2001 Citywide hydraulic study identified a series of improvements, including pump station
upgrades, culvert improvements, and construction of flood walls along major channels.
FEMA launched a map modernization program in 2004. As part of that effort, the FIRM for San
Mateo was expanded to include areas south of Highway 92 into the existing special flood hazard
area. A preliminary FIRM issued by FEMA on April 18, 2008, is anticipated to become final
sometime in the spring of 2010.
In regard to sea level rise due to global warming trends, the City consulted with Schaaf &
Wheeler to determine the potential impacts of sea level rise on the City of San Mateo (Appendix
V of the General Plan). Their study reviewed numerous reports and studies that predicted
different levels of sea level increases. Currently, the City of San Mateo is prepared for some rise
in sea level, however if the extreme predictions of a 4.6 foot rise in sea level by 2100 occurs, the
City’s current levees will not be sufficient. Considering that there is no definitive estimate and
that sea level rise will occur slowly over time, the City will continue to address FEMA’s current
certification standards. If FEMA increases their requirements, the City will consider raising the
levees to meet FEMA’s certification. However, for the City of San Mateo to be fully protected
the City of Burlingame and Foster City will also need to raise their levees.
Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010 VII-6                           Resolution No. 134-2010

                                                                                      Safety Element
Dike Failure
San Mateo’s levees are structurally stable, with the exception of approximately 1,000 feet of
levee adjacent to the City of Foster City which will be reconstructed in the near future. The
probability of their failure is very low. However, failure could result from a major earthquake or
severe storm conditions. Should a failure occur at high tide, property could be inundated up to
an elevation of 4.7 feet (San Mateo datum/7.06 ft. NGVD), or a maximum water depth of about
six feet in the lowest areas of the Shoreview neighborhood. The area of potential inundation is
shown in Figure S-4.
Tsunami
Tsunamis, or seismically generated sea waves, are rare in California due to the lack of submarine
earthquake faults. An Alaskan generated tsunami would have to reach a height of at least 20 feet
at the Golden Gate to overtop San Mateo’s levees with a minimum runup of five feet at higher
high tide. The highest tsunami affecting the area during the last 120 years had a height of 7.4
feet at the Golden Gate, causing a two-foot runup along the San Mateo shoreline.
Dam Failure
Six dams affect the City of San Mateo: Crystal Springs, San Andreas, Laurel Creek and East
Laurel Creek (2), and Tobin Creek in Hillsborough.
Lower Crystal Springs Dam retains water supply for San Francisco and most cities within San
Mateo County. In 1977, the seismic safety of the dam was studied, finding that the risk of
structural damage to the dam with a maximum magnitude of 8.3 on the Richter scale earthquake
is low, and that landslides which might be triggered by such an earthquake would not generate
waves capable of overtopping the dam. Although the probability of Lower Crystal Spring Dam’s
failure is remote, should such an event occur, the San Mateo Area Office of Emergency Services
(OES) estimates that a population of 70,000 would be affected, with inundation occurring from
the downtown area north to the Burlingame Recreation Lagoon and south to the Ralston
Avenue/US 101 interchange. The area of potential inundation is shown in Figure S-4.
San Andreas Dam is located on San Andreas Creek in Burlingame and is also used to impound
water for San Francisco and much of San Mateo County. Seismic safety studies in 1979 and
1983 indicated that the dam would probably remain stable during strong seismic shaking.
Laurel Creek Dam is located at the end of Laurelwood Drive and reduces the peak storm water
runoff of 600 cfs in half. The most recent reports by the California Division of Safety of Dams
(DSOD) indicate that the dam is structurally safe and will perform without failure during a major
seismic event.
East Laurel Creek Dam is located at the end of East Laurel Creek Drive, and is also used to
control peak storm runoff. The dam is too small to be regulated by DSOD and its seismic

stability is unknown. Two other small dams are located in Belmont (East Laurel Creek) and in
Hillsborough (Tobin Creek).
Stormwater Drainage
Storm water drains through San Mateo to the Bay via three distinct drainage basins -- the San
Mateo Creek complex, North San Mateo complex, and the Marina Lagoon Complex, each
composed of numerous stream channels, culverts, and storm drainage piping systems.
The San Mateo Creek drainage basin is 35 square miles in size, only 4 square miles of which are
in San Mateo. Approximately 30% of the City drains into San Mateo Creek. Storm flows are
regulated in the upper reaches of the creek by Lower Crystal Springs Dam and the two
reservoirs. The San Francisco Water Department controls winter and springtime releases from
the dam to approximately 1,000 cubic feet per second (cfs), which is the capacity of the creek
channel at Polhemus Bridge. Uncontrolled releases may occur should reservoir levels exceed the
storage capacity during a major storm, and can increase to approximately 1,340 cfs.
There are six bridges between El Camino Real (SR 82) and the Bay along San Mateo Creek.
The first constriction is the Mills Culvert beneath El Camino Real (SR 82) and extending to San
Mateo Drive, which can accommodate 1,400 cfs. With normal winter operation at Crystal
Spring Reservoir, no or minimal spill is anticipated at El Camino Real. Figure S-4 shows that
this area will have a spill less than one foot during a 100-year storm which is not classified as
special flood hazard area by FEMA.
The San Mateo Creek watershed located within City limits is fully urbanized and little additional
runoff is anticipated from new development. The majorities of the remaining watersheds are
conservation lands meant to protect the water quality of Crystal Springs Reservoirs and will
remain undeveloped.
The northern portion of the City drains to the bay via major piping systems under Poplar and
Peninsula Avenues. The southern two-thirds of San Mateo are composesed of a 10-square-mile
watershed which originates in the western hills of San Mateo and Belmont, and drains into
Marina Lagoon. Peak storm flows from the western hills are controlled by four dams, three on
Laurel Creek and one in the Town of Hillsborough above Borel Creek. The watershed is almost
entirely urbanized with the exception of Sugarloaf Mountain, and little increase in runoff due to
future development is anticipated. Control of erosion and impervious surfaces on Sugarloaf is
important to reduce runoff into Laurel Creek.
In the past, flooding has occurred at several locations within the Marina Lagoon drainage
complex due to inadequate channel and storage capacities or blockages during storms. In the
1970’s, Laurel Creek Dam was overtopped, flooding a substantial portion of the San Mateo
Village neighborhood. In the 1980’s, East Laurel Creek Dam was overtopped, damaging homes
immediately downstream. San Mateo Village was also flooded in 1955, 1966 and 1982.
Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010 VII-8                        Resolution No. 134-2010

                                                                                     Safety Element
Marina Lagoon was created from Seal Slough for flood control in the 1950’s and deepened in
1965. Although heavy storm runoff never overtopped the Marina Lagoon levees, the water
elevation rose to dangerous heights in 1974 and 1982. In 1984 the pump capacity at the
Lagoon’s entry into the Bay was increased to a maximum discharge capacity of 750,000 cfs,
adequate to contain the 100-year storm and flooding in the Marina Lagoon drainage area.
A Storm Drain Master Plan was completed in 2002 to the local stormwater collection system.
Improvements were identified to upgrade these facilities to provide adequate flood protection.
GOALS AND POLICIES
GOAL 2:             Protect the community from unreasonable risk to life and property caused by
                    flood hazards.
POLICIES:
S 2.1:         Creek Alteration. Prohibit any reduction of creek channel capacity, impoundment
               or diversion of creek channel flows which would adversely affect adjacent properties
               or the degree of flooding. Prevent erosion of creek banks.
Most of San Mateo’s creeks are under private ownership, with adjacent properties extending to
the centerline of the creeks. Development of these parcels should not result in alteration of the
creeks in a way that could alter the creek capacity or water flow characteristics. Such activities
have the potential for causing downstream flooding or may increase bank erosion.
S 2.2:         Development Adjacent to Creeks. Protect new development adjacent to creeks by
               requiring adequate building setbacks from creek banks and provision of access
               easements for creek maintenance purposes.
A creek setback for new structures is necessary for adequate maintenance access, to permit creek
improvements and to protect buildings from creek bank erosion. The Downtown Plan
specifically requires a setback along San Mateo Creek for flood protection and maintenance
purposes. As hydrologic studies are completed for other creeks and drainage channels, setback
and maintenance access requirements will be developed as appropriate.
S 2.3:         Development within Flood Plains. Protect new development within a flood plain
               by locating new habitable floor areas to be above the 100-year flood-water level or
               by incorporating other flood-proofing measures consistent with Federal Emergency
               Management Agency (FEMA) regulations and the City of San Mateo’s Flood Plain
               Management regulations.
FEMA has designated certain portions of the City as flood plains. Properties located within the
100-year flood plain are required to locate habitable floorspace above the projected flood
elevation to minimize possible property damage consistent with FEMA regulations.
Development consisting of new construction or substantial improvement, defined by the City’s

                                                                                     Safety Element
Flood Plain Management regulations, shall comply with local ordinances.              As technology
changes, other means of flood-proofing structures should be explored by the City.
S 2.4:         Crystal Springs Reservoir. Encourage the City of San Francisco to develop an
               operations model or capital improvement projects for the entire San Francisco Water
               Supply System and Lower Crystal Springs Reservoir. These projects would
               facilitate acceptance of heavy and prolonged stormwater runoff without the necessity
               of releasing hazardous volumes of stormwater into San Mateo Creek.
The San Francisco Water Department controls the release of water from Lower Crystal Springs
Reservoir to maintain flood storage capacity in the event of a major storm. The City has worked
with the San Francisco Water Department to develop an Operation Plan to document its
operation practices for Lower Crystal Springs Reservoir during winter months. The plan,
approved by FEMA, indicates that the Water Department routinely maintains adequate freeboard
during storm events and will not release hazardous volumes of stormwater into San Mateo
Creek.
The San Francisco Water Department is currently working on a dam spillway enlargement
project for the ability to retain a higher water level in the event of a major storm and defer
discharge to non-storm periods. The City will continue to support this effort.
S 2.5:         Stormwater Drainage System. Implement the improvements identified in the City
               of San Mateo’s seven watershed areas to improve and maintain drainage capacity
               adequate to convey water during a typical storm event. Include consideration of
               creek maintenance and an education and/or enforcement program to minimize illegal
               dumping of debris and chemicals.
The City has completed a citywide hydrologic analysis to identify flooding potential and needed
improvement. The study evaluated the City’s major flood control facilities, including levees,
dams, pump stations, major channels and Marina Lagoon. A separate study was also completed
to evaluate the adequacy of the City’s local stormwater collection system and to identify
necessary improvements. The two studies indicate that the City has significant capital
improvement needs to warrant an upgrade of flood control and drainage facilities to meet current
standards. The ability to complete these improvements is impacted by the current lack of
adequate funding. A continuous effort is needed to identify sources of funding to complete these
improvements.
S 2.6:         Lowlands Protection. Protect lowlands from the potential rise in the sea level, high
               tides and tsunamis. Raise levees to meet FEMA current standards and continue to
               monitor sea level rise estimates. Protect new habitable buildings in areas subject to
               flooding in the event of levee failure.
The City’s levee system is not certified by FEMA at this time. The City has obtained FEMA
approval on the design of the required levee improvements and is working toward completing the
upgrades within the available fiscal structure. A continuous effort is needed to identify sources
Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010   VII-10                        Resolution No. 134-2010

                                                                                      Safety Element
of funding to upgrade all the levees to comply with current FEMA standards. In addition to
receiving FEMA levee certification, protection of new construction should be considered by
elevating habitable floor levels above potential flood heights.
Monitoring the various predictions in sea level rise is required to determine if the levee system is
adequate. As new studies emerge, FEMA may modify their certification requirements. If
FEMA modifies their requirements, the City of San Mateo will need to address the levee system
at that time. All efforts should be made to address climate change and the continuous rise in sea
level.
   D. WILD FIRE HAZARDS
BACKGROUND
There are no Wildland fire hazards in City of San Mateo; however to the west of the City within
the City’s Sphere of Influence there are undeveloped portions of the western hills that are
considered wildland fire hazards... These areas are subject to wildland type fires due to existing
vegetation, particularly chaparral, the steep slopes and the temperate climate with dry summer
months. During the past 27 years only one significant fire has occurred. It burned 20 acres in
the Laurel Creek Canyon watershed and caused limited residential damage. Although recent fires
have not occurred, these areas pose substantial risks to nearby residences and to the natural
environment.
Urban fire hazards and water supply requirements are discussed in the Land Use Element.
GOALS AND POLICIES
GOAL 3: Maintain adequate fire and life safety protection from wildland fires.
POLICY:
S 3.1:         Wildland Fire Protection.        Require all development adjacent to wildlands to
               provide fire retardant roofing materials, adequate site access, and fire breaks of at
               least 100 feet.
Fire retardant roofing materials reduce the spread of fire by wind-borne embers, and "greenbelt"
landscaping using irrigated, non-combustible plant species, at a minimum radius of 100 feet
surrounding the structures, acts as a fire break. Adequate site access for fire suppression
vehicles, particularly to steeply sloped areas, is also very important. Current standards require a
minimum 26-foot roadway, exclusive of parking. Generally two access routes are required
Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010 VII-11                           Resolution No. 134-2010

                                                                                      Safety Element
unless other mitigations are incorporated into developments. Access ways exceeding 300 feet in
length must have turnarounds with radii adequate for fire vehicles.
   E. EMERGENCY OPERATIONS
BACKGROUND
The City prepared a Multi-Hazard Functional Plan (MHFP) in 1995 as required by the California
Emergency Services Act. Additionally, as required by FEMA, the City adopted a Local Hazard
Mitigation Plan (LHMP) in 2002. Both of these plans define the City’s planned response to
emergency situations such as fire, earthquake, flood, hazardous materials spill, civil disturbance
or war.
The City’s Emergency Operations Center (EOC) is located at the Police Department at 200
Franklin Parkway. The center contains emergency supplies and equipment and would serve as a
communications and administrative headquarters. Since the EOC is located in the flood plain, an
alternate EOC is located at Fire Station 7, 1801 De Anza Boulevard. The MHFP identifies
fourteen possible shelter locations at school sites, including the College of San Mateo.
GOALS AND POLICIES
GOAL 4: Minimize potential damage to life, environment and property through timely, well-
               prepared and well-coordinated emergency preparedness, response plans and
               programs.
POLICIES:
S 4.1:         Emergency Readiness. Maintain the City’s emergency readiness and response
               capabilities, especially regarding hazardous materials spills, natural gas pipeline
               ruptures, earthquakes, and flooding due to dam failure, tsunami, peak storms and
               dike failure. Increase public awareness of potential hazards and the City’s
               emergency readiness and response program.
Emergency readiness depends upon maintenance of an updated and useable Multi-Hazard
Functional Plan, trained personnel through frequent emergency drills, and functional emergency
equipment, particularly emergency communications, power supplies and vehicles. The public
should be made aware of potential dangers, particularly those living or working in areas subject
to inundation, and of contingency plans or information sources. Education and training
programs, such as the San Mateo Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) and the
biyearly City staff emergency drills, helps to increase the public’s awareness and increase the
emergency readiness of the City.
Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010  VII-12                          Resolution No. 134-2010

                                                                                    Safety Element
S 4.2:         Evacuation Routes. Maintain adequate evacuation routes as identified by arterial
               streets shown in the Circulation Element, Figure C-1.
In the event of an emergency, the major arterial streets identified in the Circulation Element
would serve as principal evacuation routes. Routes which parallel US 101 and SR 92 are
particularly important since they would provide a backup to the freeway in the event overpasses
collapse or are blocked.
   F. HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
BACKGROUND
Much of the economic success of the Bay Area is based on research and manufacturing, the
byproducts of which include substances which may be harmful to people and to the surrounding
environment. Hazardous waste ranges from familiar substances such as waste oil and cleaning
solvents, to highly toxic industrial compounds, and include toxic metals, gases, flammable and
explosive liquids and solids, corrosive materials, radioactive materials and infectious biological
waste.
Up until 1990, the management of hazardous waste relied heavily upon land disposal of
untreated materials. With the elimination of this option, reduction of waste volumes or recycling
waste compounds for reuse has become the preferred strategies.
In 1989, a majority of cities in San Mateo County approved the San Mateo County Hazardous
Waste Management Plan (HWMP). The HWMP emphasizes waste reduction and recycling,
extensive educational processes, coordinated identification, permitting and inspection of waste
generators, and creation of a permanent facility for deposit of household hazardous waste. A
major feature of the plan is the identification of sites suitable for various types of hazardous
waste management facilities.
This portion of the General Plan constitutes the City of San Mateo Hazardous Waste
Management Plan as provided for in Section 25135 of the California Health and Safety Code.
The County HWMP is incorporated into the General Plan by this reference, and major provisions
of that plan are summarized below.
Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010  VII-13                        Resolution No. 134-2010
                                                                                         Safety Element
Existing Waste Generation
Most of the waste generators in San Mateo are small quantity generators -- small businesses and
households which generate less than 12 tons per year. Numerous industrial and commercial
operations, both past and present have manufactured, handled, stored and disposed of hazardous
materials in San Mateo
Hazardous material sites include manufacturing operations, facilities with leaking underground
storage tanks (UST’s), and generators of hazardous waste.
Storage and Disposal
Throughout San Mateo County, Hazardous Materials Business Plans (HMBP) must be prepared
for the County by businesses that use or store hazardous materials. The County provides copies
of Business Plans to the local fire departments.
The San Mateo County Environmental Health Department (EHD) issues permits for installations
and removals of UST’s. Before a tank may be removed, the applicant must prepare a closure plan
and submit it to the County HSD. Upon approval of the plan, the County of EHD issues a permit
for the tank removal. While UST’s are primarily associated with service stations, they may also
be found in connection with hospitals, companies with backup power supply, and older
industries.
Siting Waste Management Facilities
The HWMP provided criteria for the siting of new hazardous waste management facilities, and
indicates the areas which appear initially suitable for locating new facilities. In general, the
siting criteria direct new facility development away from areas having significant natural hazard
potential (landslides, potable water supplies, aquifers, high soil permeability); environmental
resources (wetlands, riparian corridors, wildlife reserves and prime agricultural land); and
population concentrations (residential zones). New facilities would be allowed in industrial
areas near transportation corridors and hazardous waste generators to minimize transport through
a community.
In the City of San Mateo, the HWMP has designated 15 areas which are zoned for either
commercial or industrial uses as suitable for waste treatment, recycling, storage and transfer
facilities (see Figure S- 5). Incinerators and residual repositories would not be permitted in San
Mateo. The sites designated for treatment, recycling, storage and transfer facilities are located in
manufacturing districts adjacent to the Southern Pacific rail corridor. Sites designated for
storage and transfer facilities are in service commercial and transit oriented development zoning
districts adjacent to the rail corridor, west of US 101 on Amphlett, and in Coyote Point Park.
Due to the highly developed nature of San Mateo and the lack of large waste generating firms, it
is unlikely that a large treatment or recycling facility will attempt to locate in the City. However,
Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010   VII-14                            Resolution No. 134-2010

                                                                                      Safety Element
should an application be filed to locate a hazardous waste facility in San Mateo, a detailed
process would be initiated including preparation of a site specific risk assessment analyzing
short- and long-term risks associated with the proposed facility. If the risk assessment reveals
that potential risks cannot be adequately mitigated, a proposal may be disapproved even if it is
located within a general area which has been designated in the HWMP as a potentially suitable
site for a hazardous waste facility.
Contaminated Sites
The presence of hazardous materials or hazardous waste in soil or groundwater could constrain
development of certain areas due to the actual or perceived threat to human health and the cost
associated with site cleanup. The actual health threat at a given site depends upon a number of
factors such as the quantity and toxicity of contaminates, exposure and the available pathways
for contaminants to affect human health. Cleanup of hazardous waste sites is mandated by law
and enforced by the appropriate regulatory agencies in order to protect human health, resources,
and the environment. Cleanup is usually expensive and can be a significant factor in viability of
land development.
Transportation Routes
Hazardous waste primarily is transported within San Mateo via trucks. Since the County is both
an importer and exporter of wastes, there is a significant potential for accidental release of wastes
in transit. Local government is pre-empted from regulating the transport of hazardous wastes on
State highways, which include US 101, SR 92 and I-280. Jurisdiction is under the California
Department of Transportation (Caltrans) with enforcement by the California Highway Patrol.
Local agencies have the authority to restrict the use of local roads for waste transport, as well as
the time of transit, if not unduly restrictive to commerce.
Generally, selection of transportation routes should minimize the time and distance that
hazardous waste is in transit, avoid residential neighborhoods and environmentally sensitive
areas, avoid periods and areas of traffic congestion, minimize use of local roads and provide for
adequate emergency response services.
Emergency Response
The high volumes of hazardous materials handled and transported in San Mateo County pose a
significant risk of accidental release or spill.
The San Mateo County Area Emergency Services Council has principal responsibility for
emergency response coordination. The Council was established by a joint powers agreement of
the County and all cities within the county, and has adopted a Hazardous Materials Area Plan
which establishes responsibilities and actions for responding to a wide range of hazardous
material incidents. If an incident were to occur in the City of San Mateo, the San Mateo Police
Department and the San Mateo Fire Department would act jointly as incident command, unless it
occurred on a State highway under the authority of the California Highway Patrol. The local
agency would be assisted by the Belmont – San Carlos Fire Department, which maintains a fully
equipped hazardous materials response vehicle to identify the hazardous material and provide

initial containment. Technical assistance would also be provided by the County Environmental
Health Section.
GOALS AND POLICIES
GOAL 5: Protect the community’s health, safety and welfare relating to the use, storage,
               transport, and disposal of hazardous materials.
POLICIES:
S 5.1:         County Cooperation. Cooperate with the County of San Mateo in the regulation of
               hazardous materials and transportation of such material in San Mateo.
State legislation has designated counties as the level of government to assume the lead role in
subregional planning for hazardous waste management. The San Mateo County Departments of
Health, Environmental Management, Public Works and District Attorneys Office have direct
responsibilities for planning and implementing the County Hazardous Waste Management Plan
on behalf of all cities in the County.
S 5.2:         County Hazardous Waste Management Plan. Adopt by reference all goals,
               policies, implementation measures, and supporting data contained in the San Mateo
               County Hazardous Waste Management Plan.
The County Hazardous Waste Management Plan (HWMP) establishes a comprehensive
approach to management of hazardous wastes in San Mateo County, including siting criteria for
new waste management facilities, educational and enforcement efforts to minimize and control
the waste stream, and maintenance of a unified data base on waste generators. Other policies
adopted by the City of San Mateo will elaborate and further define aspects of the County HWMP
which reflect local conditions and objectives, but which are consistent with the overall direction
of the County HWMP.
S 5.3:         On-site Waste Treatment. Promote on-site treatment of hazardous wastes by waste
               generators to minimize the use of hazardous materials and the transfer of waste for
               off site treatment.
The optimal methods of hazardous waste management are either source reduction, such as
substituting alternative raw materials or altering production processes to reduce the amount of
wastes generated, or on-site recycling, which reuses the generated waste in the production
process or as a marketable byproduct. The City of San Mateo promotes the HWMP through
educational efforts including preparation of informational pamphlets, the sponsoring of seminars
on alternative technologies, and directly assisting firms in assessing their reduction potential, and
by requiring large waste generators to submit waste reduction plans.
Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010  VII-16                          Resolution No. 134-2010

                                                                                        Safety Element
S 5.4:         Transportation Routes. Restrict the transportation of hazardous materials and
               waste to truck routes designated in Circulation Policy C-1.3, and limit such
               transportation to non-commute hours.
Risks associated with hazardous waste spills are exacerbated during transportation since such
spills would be uncontained and could affect a substantial population of motorists, pedestrians
and occupants of nearby residences and businesses. Transportation during peak commute hours
increases risks due to the increased surrounding population, increased accident potential during
such hours, and the difficulty in obtaining emergency response through traffic congestion.
Transportation through local, residential streets is unacceptable due to the risks posed to
residents.
S 5.5:         Regulating Hazardous Waste Management Facilities. Regulate the location and
               operation of hazardous waste management facilities through the issuance of a special
               use permit.
The development of hazardous waste management facilities which accept waste from off-site
generators should require the issuance of a discretionary special use permit to allow for
individual consideration of applications for new waste management facilities and their impacts
on nearby land uses, transportation routes and the environment.
S 5.6:         Siting of Hazardous Waste Management Facilities. Restrict the possible location
               of new hazardous waste management facilities to those areas designated on Figure
               S-5. Prohibit the location of residual repository and incineration facilities in the City
               of San Mateo due to proximity to residential uses. Consider allowing waste
               treatment, transfer and storage facilities in manufacturing districts only, and
               allowing waste transfer and storage facilities in service commercial districts. The
               location of waste management facilities in the City should be based on the ratings of
               area suitability contained in Appendix I.
The County HWMP has indicated fifteen areas within the City of San Mateo which are suitable
for the location of new off-site hazardous waste management facilities based on siting criteria
contained in the Plan. These areas are shown on Figure S-5, and are limited to manufacturing,
service commercial and transit oriented development (formally service commercial) land use
designations which would typically allow the types of businesses which use hazardous materials.
In addition, the City has established a matrix of various constraints affecting these areas, and has
rated the relative suitability of the areas as a guide to future applicants and decision-makers.
This matrix is included as Appendix I.
S 5.7:         Design of Hazardous Waste Management Facilities. Require the following
               features and mitigation measures in the design of proposed hazardous waste
               management facilities to minimize potential health, safety and aesthetic impacts on
               surrounding properties and occupants:
Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010   VII-17                           Resolution No. 134-2010
                                                                                           Safety Element
                     a.      For sites located in areas subject to flooding or inundation as shown on
                             Figures S-3 & 4, require facilities to have a surface elevation at least
                             1.5 feet above the maximum flood water level for areas containing
                             hazardous substances or to be flood-proofed in some other manner suitable
                             to the City.
                     b.      Require facilities to provide for full on-site containment of maximum
                             permitted quantities of hazardous substances, including protection of
                             storm drain or sanitary sewer inlets from accidental entry of hazardous
                             materials.
                     c.      Require facilities to provide separate storage and/or treatment of
                             potentially reactive substances, including separate spill containment
                             vessels. Require that storage of hazardous gasses provides for adequate
                             filtration and neutralization devices to prohibit accidental release of toxic
                             substances.
                     d.      Require that all storage and treatment occur within an enclosed structure.
The design of hazardous waste management facilities should mitigate many potential impacts of
such facilities, including the possibilities of off-site chemical spills or gas releases, dangerous
reactions of chemicals when accidentally mixed, or the entry of hazardous substances into the
storm or sanitary sewer systems. To offer further protection from accidental release and as an
aesthetic consideration, storage of hazardous materials should not be permitted outside a
building.
S 5.8:         Risk Assessment. Require the preparation of a risk assessment to determine site
               suitability for applications for hazardous waste management facilities, establishing
               the distance requirements from public assembly, residential or immobile population
               and recreational areas or structures; impacts from seismic, geologic and flood
               hazards; impacts on wetlands, endangered species, air quality and emergency
               response capabilities; and proximity to major transport routes.
The process for review of applications for hazardous waste management facilities requires the
preparation of a risk assessment for consideration by the decision-making bodies to determine
the suitability of the site for the proposed facility and necessary mitigation measures if the
installation is permitted. The HWMP does not contain distance requirements for waste
management facilities from sensitive land uses, such as residences or areas of assembly, due to
differing characteristics of each waste management facility. Distance requirements for a facility
which stores waste oil would be very different from a facility storing toxic gases. These distance
requirements will have to be determined by the risk assessment, evaluating the specific facility
proposed and the characteristics of the surrounding environment.
S 5.9:         Shared Data. Maintain the sharing of County data on businesses which store
               hazardous substances with local emergency service providers, such as the Police and

               Fire departments, as well as the Public Works Department for the wastewater source
               control program.
The first emergency units which would respond to a local emergency would be the San Mateo
Police and Fire departments. These units should have adequate information sources to determine
the location and types of hazardous substances which are likely to be encountered at commercial
and institutional locations throughout the City. The Public Works Department would need to
respond to hazardous substances that may impact the City’s Wastewater Treatment Plant or
stormwater drainage system.
S 5.10:        Contaminated Sites. Require the clean-up of contaminated sites indicated on the
               Hazardous Waste and Substances Sites List published by the Department of Toxic
               Substance Control and/or the Health Department in conjunction with substantial site
               development or redevelopment, where feasible.
Sites within San Mateo which are contaminated with hazardous substances are threats to the
quality of ground water aquifers and should be cleaned through decontamination of soils and
filtration of ground water. Clean-up should be required in conjunction with redevelopment of
the property or major expansions of existing uses.
S 5.11:        Cost Recovery. Require San Mateo County businesses which generate hazardous
               waste or applicants for hazardous waste management facilities to pay necessary costs
               for implementation of the HWMP programs and for application costs, and to pay for
               costs associated with emergency response services in the event of a hazardous
               material release, to the extent permitted by law.
Provisions of State law allow for cost recovery for permitting and enforcement actions for
hazardous waste generators and for costs associated with applications for new hazardous waste
management facilities. Application costs for hazardous waste management facilities would
include regulatory fees, license fees, fees relating to the environmental review process, costs of
required public notice, costs of the citizens local advisory committee, and continuing monitoring
fees. In addition, the costs associated with emergency response services, which might include
spill containment, traffic control and area evacuation should be passed on to the business
operator having responsibility for the hazardous material released.

                    V. Urban Design
    A.            INTRODUCTION
Urban design refers to the physical form and development of a city from the individual
neighborhood to the overall city scape. In the largest sense, urban design encompasses the
physical elements which make up the City and its natural setting, and which make up the City's
visual qualities. These elements are the City's relationship to neighboring cities and the
surrounding natural environment, the City's principal focal points, and the City's major
transportation corridors.
On a smaller scale urban design deals with the development patterns and characteristics of
specific areas. These include the design of multi-family and single-family neighborhoods, the
transition between neighborhoods, the design of commercial areas and the design and placement
of various public improvements.
The goals and policies of Urban Design are in two sections: City Image and Design. City
Image discusses focal points, corridors and gateways. Design discusses in detail the design of
multi-family, single-family, duplex, and commercial areas.
  B. CITY IMAGE
SETTING
San Mateo is set between two dominant physical features: San Francisco Bay and the ridge of
hills along the western border. The City has developed between these two features following
early transportation corridors. Similar communities at the north and south boundaries also
influence the City's development.
Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010, Resolution No. 134-2010                   V-1
Amended by the City Council on April 18, 2011, Resolution No. 42 (2011)
Amended by the City Council on April 6, 2015, Resolution No. 36 (2015)
                                                                                        Urban Design Element
The City's image is composed of many things: distinct residential neighborhoods, major open
spaces, tall buildings, major streets, distinct shopping areas, landscaping, the spatial arrangement
of buildings, and architectural styles. The first section of this report, dealing with urban design
in the largest sense identifies the major focal points, corridors, and gateways that contribute to
the City image.
FOCAL POINTS
Focal points provide orientation by serving as landmarks and designating important places. The
Downtown is a recognizable focal point because of its density, tall buildings, retail, restaurant,
and entertainment environment and historic character. Hillsdale Shopping Center is another
focal point because of its great number of retail shops and large scale structures at an important
intersection. The San Francisco Bay and western hills are natural focal points. The
"Crossroads" office buildings at SR 92 and US 101 help to mark this important intersection. The
Borel/Bovet offices stand just behind the SR 92 and El Camino Real intersection and denote the
major office developments lining SR 92. The office development at Mariner's Island marks a
focal point at the eastern edge of the City that visually relates to development in Foster City.
Other significant buildings along El Camino Real also create isolated focal points.
Focal points should be developed where they logically orient people and mark significant places.
The taller buildings in the Downtown are an excellent example of this. Intersections that mark
major business areas are also marking significant places within the City. Misplaced focal points
detract from the intended emphasis on important places. Tall buildings intermittently spaced
along a street suggest a special area when it may be just part of a commercial strip.
Many things can be done to strengthen major focal points. The Downtown Specific Plan
includes requirements for ground floor retail, and the General Plan permits mixed uses and
building heights of up to 75 feet in the Downtown. Hillsdale Mall could be strengthened by
higher floor area ratios (the ratio of building floor area to lot area), visible retail uses (outward
focusing), and a more consistent architectural or landscape treatment. The office development
along SR 92 could be enhanced by permitting taller buildings up to 75 feet in height, altering
higher floor area ratios and architectural and landscape treatments. Focal points can be

                                                                                      Urban Design Element
discouraged in the middle sections of El Camino (SR 82) and many other commercial zones by
changing the zoning to permit no high-rises or buildings with excessive bulk.
GATEWAYS
Gateways are the entry points to a city or specific area. They serve much the same function as a
front door serves to a home, as both symbolic entry to the City and a boundary marker. Gateways
should be located at major entry points or when there is a distinct change in character from one
area to another. The change in character may be a change in traffic speed, a change in the scale
of buildings, or change in the intensity of landscaping. Gateways would likely be located at the
major City boundaries at the north and south end of El Camino Real, at the City boundaries on
Mariner's Island Boulevard and J. Hart Clinton Drive where San Mateo meets Foster City, and at
US 101 exit ramps on Peninsula Avenue, Third Avenue, and Hillsdale Boulevard because at
these exits there is a major change in traffic speed and a sense of entering the City. Gateways
also should be located at various entrances to the Downtown as this area is distinctly different
from the areas surrounding it.
A gateway feature should be large enough to denote an entry point and should be illuminated at
night. The gateway could be a significant landscape or architectural feature and should be built
with high quality design and materials to give an appropriate image of the City. The materials
used should emphasize the image and type of materials common to the area. A similar design
feature or material should be common to all gateways so as to contribute to a unique and
consistent San Mateo image.
CORRIDORS
Corridors are the way residents and
visitors most commonly see the City.
A well designed corridor should lead
to a destination, provide a sense of
orientation, be attractive and project a
positive image of the City. Problems
often seen on major and minor
corridors include visual confusion
from signs and architecture, inadequate
or unmaintained landscaping and inconsistent building setbacks.
The major north/south corridors in the City are El Camino Real, US 101 and the railroad served
by Caltrain. Major corridors that connect with US 101 are Third and Fourth avenues leading to
and from Downtown and Hillsdale Boulevard connecting with Hillsdale Shopping Center.
SR 92 is the other major east/west corridor. Minor corridors are generally heavily used arterial
streets. In San Mateo these include Alameda de Las Pulgas, Peninsula Avenue, San Mateo
Drive, Delaware Street, Norfolk Street, J. Hart Clinton Drive and Mariner's Island Boulevard.

                                             Amended by the City Council on April 18, 2011, Resolution No. 42 (2011)

US 101 AND SR 92
US 101 and SR 92 are designed for high speeds. There is no commercial or pedestrian access.
US 101 is tightly fit between adjoining commercial and residential uses and partially screened by
soundwalls or a thin, intermittent layer of landscaping. Signs, businesses and homes are visible
creating a cluttered looking corridor. SR 92 is elevated through most of the eastern part of the
City, later travels through deep cuts, and then climbs on top of hills in the western parts.
Visual confusion on US 101 would be reduced by controlling the quantity and size of signs.
Soundwalls screen residential neighborhoods from the freeway. Stronger landscaping would
provide an attractive corridor. Any improvements also should work to capture views of the
City's focal points and take advantage of other vistas.
THIRD AND FOURTH AVENUE IN THE GATEWAY
Third and Fourth Avenue in the Gateway pass through residential districts as they connect
US 101 with the Downtown. Their appearance would be improved by future development
having consistent setbacks and building heights. A line of street trees can orient the street
toward its destination as well as provide greenery. The Downtown Specific Plan currently
includes a consistent setback for all new buildings and the requirement for planting of street
trees. Design guidelines for the Gateway have been adopted to address pedestrian and vehicle
entries, front porches, architectural features, landscaping, and street lighting.

HILLSDALE BOULEVARD
Hillsdale Boulevard provides direct access from US 101 to Hillsdale Shopping Center at El
Camino Real. This four lane arterial street passes through a single family area. Any future
improvements to this street could include street trees, lighting design, and adequate landscaping
to help buffer residences from traffic.
EL CAMINO REAL
El Camino Real is the longest commercial
corridor on the Peninsula. A mixture of
retail, office and residential uses lines the
street as it passes through San Mateo and
other cities. In San Mateo the character
changes several times because of changes
in use and private improvements. El
Camino Real north of Downtown is lined
primarily with multi-family residences with
only a few single-family homes. The street
has four narrow lanes with many large
trees. As El Camino Real enters the
Downtown area it widens to six lanes, with
high-rise office and retail uses creating an
urban character. South of Central Park to SR 92 the street contains a mix of residential, retail
and offices. For the most part buildings maintain a consistent property line setback with varying
building heights, narrow sidewalks and minimal landscaping. South of SR 92, El Camino Real is
a retail strip with a few office buildings mixed in.
At Hillsdale Shopping Center the street takes on more of a freeway character due to the
undercrossing of Hillsdale Boulevard. South of SR 92, building heights and setbacks vary
throughout, sidewalks are narrow and landscaping is very minimal. Improvements have been

                                                                                       Urban Design Element
made to this area including: locating utilities underground from SR 92 to 37th Avenue, removal
of chain link fencing in the medians, and the addition of new decorative street lighting.
Overall, El Camino Real south of Central Park does not take on any particular character or image
that is distinctive of San Mateo. Building heights and setbacks vary, and in some areas large
parking lots front along El Camino Real leaving no definition of the street edge. Except for the
northern areas of the street, landscaping is barely noticeable. Narrow sidewalks and no front
setback in many areas discourage pedestrian activity and leave little room for landscaping.
Street trees which could have the strongest visual effect are almost non-existent. All these
problems lead to a feeling that the street lacks any continuity or connection with San Mateo's
destination points.
The street appearance could be improved by providing a more coherent pattern of building
height, setbacks and landscaping. Setbacks should be adequate to permit walkways and
landscaping but should also keep the buildings close enough to define the street edge.
Storefronts or restaurants facing the street provide interest and are signs of activity. Parking lots
are rarely interesting and generally unattractive. Buildings should be oriented towards El Camino
Real with parking and accessory uses located away from the street. Street trees can help unify
the corridor by defining street edge and visually reducing paved areas. Undergrounding utilities
and controlling signage will also reduce visual clutter.
In 2001, the City Council adopted the El Camino Real Master Plan. The Plan provides a vision
for enhancements to El Camino Real from SR 92 to the Belmont border, which will further its
role as a major traffic arterial, and provide infrastructure and guidelines to create a vibrant
mixed-use community. The Master Plan includes a streetscape plan for public improvements
such as landscaping the median, creating theme intersections with landscaping and street
furniture, and recommendations for parking enhancements. Design guidelines address the
character of private development along the corridor. Topics such as building facades, setbacks,
building form, location of parking, and signage are discussed in the guidelines. The Master Plan
identifies a range of land uses for El Camino Real from infill development to larger scale transit
oriented development (TOD) around the Hillsdale and Hayward Park train stations. The Master
Plan is consistent with the Bay Meadows Specific Plans adopted by the City Council in 1997 and
2005.

In addition, the City of San Mateo is participating in the Grand Boulevard Initiative which is a
collaboration of cities, San Mateo and Santa Clara counties, and local and regional agencies to
improve the performance, safety, and aesthetics of El Camino Real. The goal of the Grand
Boulevard Initiative is “to produce a coordinated series of policy decisions that will be embraced
by all jurisdictions, thereby helping El Camino Real to function and look better.” In addition, the
initiative seeks to “transform El Camino Real into a boulevard that will stand as one of the
highlights of our communities, successfully fulfilling its role as the Peninsula’s most important
arterial, while bringing pride and unity to San Mateo and Santa Clara counties.” The City
Council adopted Resolution No. 18 (2008) on April 7, 2008, endorsing the Guiding Principles of
the Grand Boulevard Initiative, and incorporating them into future plans involving El Camino
Real. The Guiding Principles are consistent with the El Camino Real Master Plan.

   C. CITY IMAGE GOALS AND POLICIES
GOALS AND POLICIES
GOAL 1:       Establish a positive and distinctive City image by taking advantage of the natural
              setting and by developing and improving focal points, gateways, and major
              corridors.
GOAL 2:       Make El Camino Real (SR 82) a livable residential and successful commercial
              street that displays a positive image of San Mateo.
POLICES
UD 1.1:       Focal Points. Emphasize and improve established focal points identified as the
              Downtown, Hillsdale Station Area, including the Caltrain Station and the Hillsdale
              Shopping Center, Bridgepointe, Hayward Park Caltrain Station and adjacent office
              development areas, the intersections of US 101 and SR 92 and SR 92 and El
              Camino Real (SR 82), and the SR 92 corridor. Encourage focal points by
              emphasizing a particular use, or feature, or through entry or landscape treatments.
              Focal points should be discouraged at inappropriate locations.
Significant places in the City should be emphasized. Treating them as focal points and making
them more prominent by allowing concentrations of high buildings in designated areas,
emphasizing a particular use, or a special landscape treatment accomplishes this. Tall or bulky
buildings randomly placed confuse the most important areas of the City with other areas and
should be avoided.
UD 1.2:       Preservation of Natural Focal Points. Preserve and enhance views of and access
              to the foothills and the Bay through the design of new development consistent with
              the Shoreline Park Specific Plan. (See related policy C/OS-1.7)
By featuring the natural amenities of the foothills and Bay, San Mateo's identity can be
strengthened. Where possible development should orient views and access to take advantage of
these natural features.
UD 1.3:       Gateways. Develop gateways by creating strong architectural or landscape features
              exhibiting the character of San Mateo at the following locations: entrances to the
              Downtown, the north and south ends of El Camino Real (SR 82), US 101 and Third
              Avenue, US 101 and Hillsdale Boulevard, and Mariner's Island Boulevard and J.
              Hart Clinton Drive at the border of Foster City.
II-8                                         Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010, Resolution No. 134-2010
                                               Amended by the City Council on April 18, 2011, Resolution No. 42 (2011)
                                                Amended by the City Council on April 6, 2015, Resolution No. 36 (2015)
                                                                                        Urban Design Element
By developing gateway features, the entries to the City will be identified. Gateways may be
constructed in a variety of ways: a prominent landscape or architectural feature, a notable open
area or possibly an arch to pass through. All gateways should have some common element or
feature to give San Mateo a unique and consistent image.
UD 1.4:       Signage. Maintain signage controls regulating the design, size, type, illumination
              and quantity of signs visible from corridors.
Signage is a main factor creating visual confusion along US 101 and El Camino Real. Revising
the sign ordinance to control this has been a big step toward improving the image of San Mateo.
UD 1.5:       Direct Corridors to Focal Points. Visually improve and direct toward focal points
              the major corridors of Third Avenue, Fourth Avenue, Hillsdale Boulevard and El
              Camino Real (SR 82) with the installation of street trees, street lights and consistent
              building setbacks.
As constructed, many major corridors lack a visual connection to the City's focal points.
Improving this connection emphasizes the focal points and improves the appearance of these
heavily traveled streets. Street trees, distinctive and aesthetic street lights and consistent building
setbacks are the main ways to accomplish this. Further study may indicate that other public
improvements and design standards will also improve the corridors.
UD 1.6:       El Camino Real (SR 82) Ensure that new development and public improvements
              conform to the goals, policies, and guidelines established in the El Camino Real
              Master Plan to give El Camino Real an organized and appealing image. The street
              should maintain a landscaped residential character north of Downtown and allow
              mixed uses south of Ninth Avenue. The Guiding Principles of the Grand Boulevard
              Initiative shall be incorporated into future plans to be developed that involve El
              Camino Real in San Mateo.
El Camino Real is the dominant commercial and through street in the City. Much of the
commercial image of San Mateo comes from this street. Because of the importance of
El Camino Real, a Master Plan was adopted to improve it visually and economically. The Master
Plan provides a vision for enhancements to El Camino Real from SR 92 to the Belmont border to
further its role as a major traffic arterial, and provide infrastructure and guidelines to create a
vibrant mixed-use community. It is extremely important that new private development and
public improvements comply with the provisions contained in the Master Plan.
The Grand Boulevard Initiative has developed 10 Guiding Principles for El Camino Real that are
based on common themes throughout various planning documents in the multiple jurisdictions in
San Mateo and Santa Clara counties.
The Guiding Principles are: Target housing and job growth in strategic areas along the corridor;
Encourage compact mixed-use development and high quality urban design and construction;
Create a pedestrian-oriented environment and improve streetscapes, ensuring full access to and

between public areas and private developments; Develop a balanced multimodal corridor to
maintain and improve mobility of people and vehicles along the corridor; Manage parking assets;
Provide vibrant public spaces and gathering places; Preserve and accentuate unique and desirable
community character and the existing quality of life in adjacent neighborhoods; Improve safety
and public health; Strengthen pedestrian and bicycle connections within the corridor; and Pursue
environmentally sustainable and economically viable development patterns.
These Guiding Principles are consistent with the adopted El Camino Real Master Plan, and are
strategies that will be incorporated into future plans for improvements along El Camino Real.
UD 1.7:       Minor Corridors. Provide visual and pedestrian improvements on arterial streets
              such as Alameda de Las Pulgas, Peninsula Avenue, San Mateo Drive, Delaware
              Street, Norfolk Street and Mariner's Island Boulevard.
These streets are heavily used arterials that bring people into the neighborhoods. They often are
responsible for projecting an image of San Mateo's residential areas. Improvements should
include street trees, landscaping and methods to better accommodate pedestrians and bicycles.
UD 1.8:       Railroad Corridor. Improve the railroad corridor to create a positive City image
              as identified in the San Mateo Rail Corridor Transit-Oriented Development Plan.
              Develop design guidelines that address views, landscaping, screening, and
              treatment of buildings along the corridor and community identity of train stations.
              Encourage the maximum potential of Hillsdale Caltrain Station as major transit hub
              through implementation of the Hillsdale Station Area Plan.                                Encourage
              development around the Hayward Park Station that maximizes its potential as a
              local transit hub. Ensure that the new design of the Hillsdale and Hayward Park
              Caltrain Stations contribute to the character of the surrounding neighborhoods while
              respecting their regional and local context and that they have strong civic identity.
The railroad corridor is similar to the freeways in that it is the only view many Bay Area
residents have of San Mateo. In the past many developments have turned their back on the
railroad. This policy directs that the railroad corridor should be given a priority similar to that of
major street corridors.
   D. DESIGN
SETTING
San Mateo’s neighborhoods help make it a great city. San Mateo is a place where walking is
comfortable, where residents identify not just with their own homes but also with their
neighborhood, and where people are proud of where they live and work. The City’s residential
stock is approximately half single family dwellings and half multi-family. Single family

                                              Amended by the City Council on April 18, 2011, Resolution No. 42 (2011)

homeowners are remodeling their dwellings to add second stories or constructing completely
new dwellings on their property. In addition, many new developments contain mixed-use
buildings or combine residential and non-residential uses in close proximity to each other. As a
result, the design of new buildings and remodeled dwellings is critical to maintaining the
character of existing neighborhoods and providing graceful transitions between neighborhoods of
differing densities, while also providing desirable housing choices and work environments for all
who live and work in San Mateo.
The City of San Mateo has adopted design guidelines for development proposals that are located
within Specific Plan or Master Plan areas including: Downtown Specific Plan; Mariner’s Island
Specific Plan; Shoreline Park Specific Plan; Bay Meadows I and II; the San Mateo Rail Corridor
Transit-Oriented Development Plan; El Camino Real Master Plan; and the Downtown Retail
Core and Historic District Design Guidelines. Specific design criteria and standards for these
areas are contained in the various documents. In addition, the City has developed design
guidelines for single family dwellings, two-family dwellings (duplex); multifamily dwellings;
and commercial areas. These guidelines apply citywide and are summarized in the following
sections of the Urban Design Element.
SUSTAINABLE DESIGN
Since many goals and policies of the General Plan promote San Mateo as a sustainable city, it is
important to recognize that site layout and the design of buildings are major factors in meeting
the objectives of sustainable design. Sustainability starts in the early design stages of a
development. The location and orientation of structures on a parcel are critical in order to take
full advantage of solar opportunities and shading, and preserve natural resources such as mature
vegetation. Construction materials should be chosen to maximize energy efficiency and use
recycled materials whenever possible. High efficiency heating and cooling equipment and
appliances can reduce water use, maximize energy efficiency, and improve indoor air quality.
Drought tolerant landscaping and the use of pervious paving materials can also reduce water
waste and runoff into the Bay.
As previously discussed in the General Plan, the City prepared a Climate Action Plan (CAP) as a
comprehensive strategy to respond to the challenge of climate change. Part of the
implementation of the CAP calls for non-traditional building designs elements to be allowed if
necessary to support on-site renewable energy systems. In allowing for sustainable elements to
be included in civic buildings, commercial, residential and mixed use projects, the City will be
formalizing its commitment to creating a greener, more sustainable city that will enhance the
lives of current employees, residents and future generations to come. The City’s adopted design
guidelines for new development are intended to be compatible with the goals, policies, and
standards contained in the CAP and subsequent implementation measures.
SINGLE FAMILY DWELLINGS
For several years leading up to the development of the Single-Family Dwelling Guidelines there
were concerns that many additions to single-family houses were out of character with the
II-11                                      Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010, Resolution No. 134-2010

                                                                                       Urban Design Element
neighborhood. Residents stated that the additions: were bulkier than their neighbors, not visually
compatible with existing dwellings, resulted in a loss of privacy for neighbors, created impacts
on views and major landscaping, and were otherwise inappropriate in their neighborhood. In
2001, the City Council adopted the Single-Family Design Guidelines, and required planning
applications and public review for substantial removal of existing homes and construction of new
single family dwellings, and for second story additions to existing single family dwellings. The
Design Guidelines were revised in 2006 to address additional issues that arose during the public
review process for single family dwellings. These Design Guidelines are structured to address
the variety of neighborhood types in San Mateo.
When developing proposals for new or expanded single family dwellings, the homeowner should
consider the character of the neighborhood, the relationship of the dwelling to the neighborhood,
and specific elements of design.
NEIGHBORHOOD CHARACTER
The shape of a house, its arrangement of doors and windows, its roof style, and its architectural
style all make up the character of a building and contribute to the collective appearance of the
neighborhood. There are many architectural elements that contribute to the character of an
individual house and the neighborhood and it is important to look at the neighborhood when
preparing design options. Some of the most common elements are: setback from the street;
parking and garage patterns; arrangement of major building forms; the architectural style of a
house or houses in the neighborhood; number of stories in the area; location of entries and
windows (including window types); roof forms; building materials; landscaping; and if there are
historic buildings or features.
RELATIONSHIP TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD
A single building out of context with its neighbors can appear disruptive. It is important to
recognize patterns and building forms that may be common to a neighborhood to maintain or
enhance the neighborhood’s most important visual qualities. The pattern of building setbacks
often establishes a pleasing architectural rhythm to a block. This pattern should be respected
even if it is greater than the minimum setback contained in the zoning code.
The location of garages and the appearance of driveways can have a great effect on the
appearance of a neighborhood. Changes to the location, size, and appearance of the garage would
affect an established pattern of these features in the neighborhood. The widths of driveways in a
neighborhood also help to create a cohesive pattern in a given area. Changing a driveway may
affect the neighborhood pattern of landscaping versus hardscape area, result in removal of street
trees, and impact the amount of on-street parking in the area.
Building entries, windows, and front porches are also important components of neighborhood
design. Front walkways, front doors, and porches that face the street are common to most San
Mateo neighborhoods. Front doors and windows that are visible from the street also make for
II-12                                       Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010, Resolution No. 134-2010
                                             Amended by the City Council on April 18, 2011, Resolution No. 42 (2011)

                                                                                        Urban Design Element
safer neighborhoods by keeping ‘eyes on the street’ and by providing opportunities for
socializing with neighbors.
ELEMENTS OF DESIGN
The architectural elements of a house can affect its apparent mass, architectural character, and
the visual quality of the neighborhood. The placement of architectural elements can also impact
the privacy of neighbors. Along with the building footprint, the scale of buildings in the
neighborhood should be observed and respected when designing an addition or a new dwelling.
A common way to add on to a house in San Mateo is by constructing a second-story addition. A
second-story addition should be designed to be compatible with neighboring houses. Stepping
back second-story additions from the side and rear property lines increases available light into
neighboring properties and helps protect privacy between neighbors. The location of the second
story addition over the house and the roof design will also affect the appearance of a dwelling
and the neighborhood.
The location of the second-story on the property may affect privacy by creating sight lines into
adjacent homes. Additions should respect adjacent neighbor privacy through careful planning of
window locations, balconies and second-story decks, use of landscaping, and other architectural
solutions. In addition, it is important to recognize established views from the primary living areas
of neighboring houses and to design additions to minimize blockage of those views.
DUPLEX DWELLINGS
In addition to the Single-Family Dwelling Design Guidelines, the City Council adopted Duplex
Design Guidelines in 2004. Duplex zoned areas are typically located near single family
neighborhoods and provide a transition to higher density neighborhoods. The Guidelines address
how a building’s size, architectural character, and relationship to the street and nearby structures
contribute to successful neighborhoods. Many of the issues and guidelines are similar to those
contained in the Single-Family Dwelling Design Guidelines.
In duplex neighborhoods, parcels are often 40 to 60 feet wide which can lead to buildings that
are long and narrow and appear out of scale with established neighborhoods. Many elements can
affect how a building can appear compatible with its neighborhood such as building mass and
envelope, scale of the structure, architectural style, roof forms, materials, and detailing.
Architectural features such as bay windows, entries and chimneys can be used to visually divide
a building into smaller sections. Buildings can also achieve the architectural proportions
common to these neighborhoods by dividing walls and roofs into smaller sections. Many
neighborhoods have roof patterns that are distinctive and repeatable.
Front walkways, doors and porches that face the street are common in residential neighborhoods.
Visible front entries and porches improve street security and create a ‘human scaled’ appearance
to a building.
II-13                                        Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010, Resolution No. 134-2010
                                               Amended by the City Council on April 18, 2011, Resolution No. 42 (2011)
                                                Amended by the City Council on April 6, 2015, Resolution No. 36 (2015)

                                                                                       Urban Design Element
Pavement intended for parking and vehicle circulation can easily overwhelm duplex parcels.
Excessive paving also increases urban water runoff. Portions of the paved area not necessary for
circulation could be landscaped to break up the appearance of the paved area. In some cases,
vehicle circulation areas can be designed for multiple uses through the use of specialty paving
accompanied by landscaping.
As with other design elements, the neighborhood context provides direction for the choice of
building materials for compatibility within a given neighborhood. The design of building
additions should respect adjacent neighbors’ privacy through careful planning of window and
balcony locations, use of landscaping, and the use of architectural solutions. Door and window
styles also establish an architectural rhythm for a neighborhood.
MULTI-FAMILY HOUSING
In multi-family zoned areas, property is often redeveloped from lower density housing to multi-
family housing by combining two or more parcels to enable the construction of a larger
development. These larger projects can significantly alter the character of a neighborhood.
Recognizing that the character of the neighborhood is one of the most important parts of a
residential area, the City adopted Multi Family Design Guidelines in 1994. Several factors
contribute to the character of residential areas: the scale of the buildings, the materials used in
construction, the style of the buildings, the relationship of the buildings to the street and the
landscaping and open space.
SCALE OF BUILDINGS
The scale refers to the height, width and bulk of the buildings. Single-family homes and small
multi-family buildings which dominate many of these zones are typically one or two stories in
height and range in width from 25 to 60 feet. The height, width and spacing between the
buildings establishes a scale and rhythm of building for the neighborhood.
The zoning code encourages large scale development by permitting higher densities as parcel
size increases. As parcels are combined, larger buildings with more units are built. As a result,
the scale of the neighborhood is often destroyed.

When a building maintains the rhythm and
proportion of the neighborhood by visually
breaking up the building face it complements
and strengthens the neighborhood. This can be
accomplished by stepping the building back,
providing cut-outs in the building facade,
providing bay windows or changing the roof
line. The scale could be further matched by
providing a reduced street-wall height along the
street frontage to match the neighborhood.

BUILDING STYLE AND MATERIALS
The style of building architecture, quality of construction and type of exterior building materials
can have an effect on how a building fits in to a neighborhood. In neighborhoods where most
buildings utilize the same type of materials or style of architecture, new development should
respect the style of the buildings and use similar materials. Doing this strengthens the character
of the area. In areas where there is a greater mix of styles or materials, this becomes less
important.

The San Mateo Senior Center completed in July, 1990, has been constructed with several design
features that make it complement the character of the surrounding single-family neighborhood.
The mass of the building has been broken up into several smaller forms that are similar in size to
the adjacent houses, the building has roof slopes and window treatments common to the area,
and siding, roof and trim materials are similar to those found in the neighborhood.
RELATIONSHIP OF BUILDING TO THE STREET
Single-family homes in San Mateo have living
levels on the first and second floors, with the
garage within the main building or free standing
at the rear of the property. Ground floor
building walls typically have windows and other
forms of facade details, making a residential
presence very obvious. When a multi-family
building provides parking on the ground floor
with living levels above, ground floor walls are
often blank. Living areas are separated from the
ground level, gardens and the street, creating a
more anonymous character.
A residential character at street level can be achieved by locating parking underground or at the
rear of the parcel, providing adequate architectural detailing of the ground level, or providing
individual dwelling entrances at the street level to give each unit contact with the ground level
and gardens.

LANDSCAPING AND OPEN SPACE
San Mateo's strong landscaped character is formed by mature street trees and ample building
setbacks. Varied building forms and glimpses of side and rear gardens also add to the quality of
landscaping. Multi-family projects with required open space often meet their open space
requirement with only minimal building setbacks and balconies. Both types offer little garden
space for private use or public view. Better open space could be provided by varying building
forms to create useable courtyard and garden space, by more closely defining the quality of
required open space or by not permitting required open space in the setback areas.

COMMERCIAL AREAS
Commercial streets represent a large part of the image of San Mateo. Visual character and
pedestrian activity are two general but very important qualities that contribute to the livability
and vitality of a commercial street. The following are factors that contribute to these qualities.
SITTING
How the building, parking and pedestrian spaces are oriented on a site can have a strong effect
on its appearance and use.
A building that sits at or near the street property line provides visual interest for drivers and
pedestrians and a sense of street enclosure. Parking should be located towards the rear of the
parcel, helping to buffer the commercial areas from adjoining residential uses. Buildings that are
located at the rear of the parcel typically feature a parking lot along the street. The parking lot is
generally unattractive. It also eliminates any desire for on street parking, reducing any
pedestrian activity on the sidewalk. The street also develops much more visual clutter due to
varied building setbacks, more exposed building faces and the need for free-standing signage
adjacent to the street.

                                                                                       Urban Design Element
FORM
The quality of a street is composed of an
aggregation of all its pieces. Each building
has the ability to contribute to the visual
character or detract from it. A street with
buildings of greatly varying heights and
widths appears confusing. Larger buildings
appear more important and smaller buildings
appear out of place. Buildings that have
generally the same proportions can have
variation in size, style and design but will still
be perceived as being organized as a whole. A larger building may visually fit with smaller
buildings if it adopts the form or spacing of the facade width and height set up by neighboring
buildings. This can be done by providing breaks in the street facade or building form, or by
adopting a window or detailing pattern common to the area.
San Mateo's commercial areas are generally not dominated by a particular style but have a
variety of designs that can work together. When a style is introduced that has a very strong
individual character, such as a trademark roof design or large symbolic arches, it detracts from
the surrounding structures and stands out. As more
of these types of structures are added, more visual
clutter is created as each competes for attention.
Buildings with a particular corporate image are also
less adaptable to change over time, as their style
often dictates a particular use or service.
ACTIVITY
People are obviously a necessary part of any
successful commercial area. The presence of people
attracts others and adds to the excitement of the
area. The design of commercial areas should
include provisions to make people want to be there
and be seen.
People are attracted by comfortable spaces and
interesting things to look at and do. As stated
above, placing the building toward the front
property line near on-street parking helps create
activity on the sidewalk. The sidewalk, however,
must be wide enough to comfortably accommodate
pedestrians. Many sidewalks are too narrow for
commercial areas, particularly when they are shared by utility poles, fire hydrants and news
boxes. Pedestrians also need places to sit, protection from the sun by trees or awnings and

interesting things to look at. Building materials that provide interest at close range should be
used where people walk next to buildings. Buildings with glass on the first floor display retail
goods or show how the ground floor is used. Blank walls should be avoided at street level. The
design of the ground level should always consider the needs of pedestrians.
ART IN PUBLIC PLACES
In June of 2005, the City Council adopted Ordinance 2005 – 13, adding Chapter 23.60 to the San
Mateo Municipal Code Regarding Art In Public Places. This code chapter establishes the Art in
Public Places Program which: recognizes that cultural and artistic resources enhance the quality
of life for individuals living in, working in, and visiting the City; states that balanced
development of cultural and artistic resources preserves and improves the quality of the urban
environment and increases property values; recognizes the need to develop alternative sources
for cultural and artistic outlets as development and urbanization diminishes these resources; and
promotes the general welfare through balancing the community’s physical growth and
revitalization and its cultural and artistic resources.
This Code chapter establishes a requirement that new commercial and multi-family residential
projects valued at three million dollars or more provide for publicly visible art. This requirement
may be satisfied by either installing art on site, or by paying a fee in lieu of providing artwork on
a given development site.
This Code also calls for the establishment of the City of San Mateo Civic Arts Committee, which
is charged with implementing the City’s Art in Public Places program. This includes approving
individual requests to install art as part of private development projects, as required by Chapter
23.60. A criterion for review of artwork includes its location, aesthetic quality and harmony with
the proposed development and adjacent properties, and public accessibility. The Committee shall
also make recommendations to the City Council regarding the use of funds which are paid in lieu
of providing art work as part of private development projects.

                                                Amended by the City Council on April 18, 2011, Resolution No. 42 (2011)
                                                 Amended by the City Council on April 6, 2015, Resolution No. 36 (2015)

                                                                                       Urban Design Element
   E. DESIGN - GOALS AND POLICIES
GOALS AND POLICIES
GOAL 3:      Maintain and enhance the existing character and physical quality of residential
             neighborhoods through the appropriate design of new housing and additions.
GOAL 4:      Improve the visual character, livability and vitality of commercial areas.
POLICIES
UD 2.1:      Multi-Family Design. Ensure that new multi-family developments substantially
             conform to the City's Multi-family and Small Lot Multi-family Design Guidelines
             that address the preservation and enhancement of neighborhood character through
             building scale, materials, architectural style, quality of construction, open space,
             location of parking and lot size.
The building scale, materials, style, open space, location of parking and lot size are factors that
have been identified that affect the quality of residential areas.
UD 2.2:      Building Scale. Ensure that new multi-family developments respect the existing
             scale of the neighboring buildings by providing a change in the building face at
             spacings common to existing buildings and by stepping down building height
             towards the street to more closely match the height of existing buildings.
Neighborhoods in San Mateo have a building scale that is formed by facade widths of about 30
to 50 feet and the spaces between the buildings. New construction can visually fit into a
neighborhood when it recognizes and adopts this scale. This can be accomplished by stepping a
building back a few feet every 30 to 50 feet, adding cut-outs in the building facade, providing
bay windows, changing the roof line and height, or adopting a window or detailing pattern
common to the area.
UD 2.3:      Style and Materials. Encourage the design of new multi-family developments in
             areas with a dominant building style or dominant type of exterior building materials
             to complement the style and incorporate the common materials of the area.
The type of building style and materials used can have an effect on how a building fits in with a
neighborhood. In neighborhoods where the type of materials or styles of architecture are very
homogeneous, new development should respect the style of the buildings and use similar
materials. Doing this strengthens the character of the area.
II-22                                       Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010, Resolution No. 134-2010
                                             Amended by the City Council on April 18, 2011, Resolution No. 42 (2011)
                                              Amended by the City Council on April 6, 2015, Resolution No. 36 (2015)
                                                                                        Urban Design Element
UD 2.4:       Multi-Family Parking. Encourage new multi-family developments to place
              parking underground or towards the rear of the parcel to avoid blank, ground floor
              walls and to screen views of parking from the street.
When buildings have a blank wall or row of garages on the ground floor it creates an
anonymous, non-residential character. By encouraging parking to be undergrounded or at the
rear of the parcel, living space or dwelling unit entrances and windows can be located on the
ground floor. Adequate architectural detailing of the ground level can also improve the
relationship of the building to the street.
UD 2.5:       Multi-Family Open Space. Require that a portion of required open space be
              useable for passive or active recreation.
Multi-family open space requirements are often met with minimal setbacks and small private
balconies. In some projects there is little useable open space. By redefining required open
space, multi-family developments will more often meet the open space needs of the residents and
add to the quality of the neighborhood.
UD 2.6:       Orient Buildings Toward the Street. Encourage commercial development to be
              located at the street in retail areas to encourage pedestrian activity and the use of
              on-street parking. Locate required parking towards the side and rear of parcels.
Buildings that are located towards the rear of a parcel with parking in front create a cluttered
appearance from free standing signage, parking areas and many exposed building faces. They
also discourage pedestrian activity by placing a parking lot between the street/sidewalk and the
building. Buildings located at the street provide visual interest for motorists and pedestrians,
encourage pedestrian activity by being located next to the sidewalk and on-street parking, and
provide a sense of street enclosure. Placing the parking towards the rear of the parcel also helps
to buffer adjoining residential uses.
UD 2.7:       Respect Existing Scale. Encourage new commercial development to respect the
              scale of surrounding buildings by providing breaks in the building face at spacings
              common to buildings in the area and by stepping back upper floors.
A street composed of buildings with greatly varying height and width proportions appears
confusing. Larger buildings appear more important and smaller buildings appear out of place.
Larger buildings may be successfully added if they adopt the scale of neighboring building forms
by providing breaks in the building facade, or by adopting a window or detailing pattern
common to the area.
UD 2.8:       Trademark Building Forms. Discourage 'signature' or trademark building forms
              or colors where they would contribute to the visual clutter of the area.
Trademark building forms and colors detract from other buildings by unnecessarily standing out.
These should not be permitted if they cause visual clutter.
II-23                                        Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010, Resolution No. 134-2010
                                              Amended by the City Council on April 18, 2011, Resolution No. 42 (2011)
                                               Amended by the City Council on April 6, 2015, Resolution No. 36 (2015)
                                                                                      Urban Design Element
UD 2.9:      Pedestrian Oriented Design. On retail commercial projects, designate pedestrian
             activity as a priority through the design and provision of adequate sidewalk widths,
             locating windows along ground floor street facades, trees and awnings, and human
             scale construction materials and features.
UD 2.10:     Outdoor Display and Eating. To add visual interest and activity to commercial
             areas, encourage the outdoor display of plants, books and food, and restaurant
             seating areas.
UD 2.11:     Vendors. Encourage outdoor food and plant vendors in the Downtown.
Attracting people is an essential key to any commercial area. Inclusion of the items discussed in
policies 2.9 through 2.11 will make a more lively environment by encouraging pedestrian
activity. These improvements will make commercial areas more comfortable to walk through
and interesting to be in. In 1994, the City adopted zoning code regulations for outdoor seating
and display of retail goods.
UD 2.12:     Single-Family Design. Ensure that new single family dwellings and second story
             additions to single family dwellings substantially conform to the City's Single-
             Family Design Guidelines that address the preservation and enhancement of
             neighborhood character through building scale, materials, architectural style and
             details, privacy, and preservation of views.
The building scale, materials, architectural style, details of construction, privacy concerns, and
views are factors that have been identified that affect the quality of residential neighborhoods.
UD 2.13:     Duplex Design. Ensure that duplex dwellings substantially conform to the City's
             Duplex Design Guidelines that address the preservation and enhancement of
             neighborhood character through building scale, materials, architectural style and
             details, privacy, and open space.
The building scale, materials, architectural style, details of construction, privacy concerns, and
open space are factors that have been identified that affect the quality of duplex neighborhoods.
UD 2.14:     Sustainable Design and Building Construction. Require new development and
             building alterations to conform with the City's Climate Action Plan and subsequent
             City Council adopted goals, policies, and standards pertaining to sustainable
             building design and construction.
UD 2.15:     Integrate Sustainable Design. Encourage integration of sustainable design features
             and elements into the building early in the design process. Important considerations
             include:
               a. Use of recycled, sustainably harvested, or locally sourced building materials
                   such as siding, paving, decking, and insulation.
II-24                                      Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010, Resolution No. 134-2010
                                             Amended by the City Council on April 18, 2011, Resolution No. 42 (2011)
                                              Amended by the City Council on April 6, 2015, Resolution No. 36 (2015)
                                                                                        Urban Design Element
                 b. Preservation and/or adaptive reuse of structures is preferred over demolition.
                     Recycle and reuse materials on-site from dismantling and/or demolition of a
                     building or site improvements as much as possible.
                 c. Consideration of heat reflecting roof systems to reduce roof heat gain.
                     Balance the benefits of light colored roofs with aesthetics.
UD 2.16:      Design and Placement of Solar Access and Panels. Encourage applicants to
              incorporate solar energy systems into their projects. Building owners can minimize
              non-renewable heating and cooling methods and maximize solar heat gain by using
              solar panels and innovative building design features such as the use of overhangs,
              having south-facing windows and planting trees that provide shade. Important
              considerations in the design and placement of solar panels include:
                   a. Building placement and adjacencies should be considered such that they do
                      not unreasonably affect the solar access on neighboring residential
                      properties.
                   b. Solar panels and other roof-mounted equipment should be integrated into
                      building design so as not to detract from the appearance of a home and
                      reduce obtrusiveness.
                   c. Roof mounted solar energy equipment and panel should be located below
                      ridgelines and on sides of roof away from street view wherever possible.
                      Non-glare and non-reflective type panels should be utilized.
                   d. The design and placement of roof-mounted solar panels should account for
                      the heights of existing trees and future growth. This applies to both trees
                      on-site and on neighboring properties, including Heritage Trees and street
                      trees,
It is important to recognize that site layout, building design, and the construction of buildings are
major factors in meeting the objectives of sustainable design. The integration of sustainable
design features should occur early in the design process in order to fully consider available
options and technologies. This includes the location, orientation and placement of structures on
a parcel are critical in order to take full advantage of solar opportunities and shading. The
placement of windows, porches and overhanging eaves are important for solar conservation.
Non-traditional building design elements may be necessary to support on-site solar or other on-
site renewable energy systems, and should be considered while balancing the aesthetics of the
project in relation to the neighboring context. Deciduous trees should be planted on the south and
west sides of buildings to provide shade in summer and maximize sun exposure in winter.
Construction materials should be chosen to maximize energy efficiency and use recycled
materials whenever possible. High efficiency heating and cooling equipment and appliances can
reduce water use, improve the way energy is used, and improve indoor air quality. Drought
tolerant landscaping and the use of pervious paving materials can also reduce water waste and
runoff into the Bay.
II-25                                       Adopted by the City Council on October 18, 2010, Resolution No. 134-2010
