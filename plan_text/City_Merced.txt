10.3 NOISE GOALS, POLICIES AND ACTIONS
 Goal Area N-1: Noise
 GOALS
      Protection of City residents from the Harmful and Annoying Effects of Exposure to
       Excessive Noise.
      Protection of the Economic Base of the City by Preventing Incompatible Land Uses from
       Encroaching upon Existing or Planned Noise-Producing Uses.
      The Application of State of the Art Land Use Planning Methodologies in Areas of Potential
       Noise Conflicts.
 POLICIES
 N-1.1 Minimize the impacts of aircraft noise.
 N-1.2 Reduce surface vehicle noise.
 N-1.3 Reduce equipment noise levels.
 N-1.4 Reduce noise levels at the receiver where noise reduction at the source is not possible.
 N-1.5 Coordinate planning efforts so that noise-sensitive land uses are not located near major noise
         sources.
 N-1.6 Mitigate all significant noise impacts as a condition of project approval for sensitive land uses.
 Policy N-1.1
 Minimize the Impacts of Aircraft Noise
 Implementing Actions:
 1.1.a   Continue to follow the established noise abatement procedures for the Merced Regional
         Airport
 1.1.b   Encourage the use of noise-reducing flight procedures for large aircraft using Merced
         Regional Airport, such as maintaining minimum flight altitudes.
 1.1.c   Follow the recommendations stated in the Merced Regional Airport Master Plan and the
         Merced County Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan, such as limitations on occupancy
         and density levels, and restrictions on certain land uses near airports.
 1.1.d   Work with Merced County to minimize future noise impacts from Castle Airport.
 1.1.e   Update projected airport noise contours as information becomes available.
                                                 10-31

Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
Chapter 10--Noise
         The above implementing actions will address noise impacts associated with the Merced
         Regional Airport/Macready Field. The Airport is surrounded by industrial zoning (the Merced
         Airport Industrial Park) for the most part, but some residential/commercial land is located on
         the outer limits of some of the Merced County Airport Land Use Compatibility Zones (the
         Plan adopted in 1995 but due for an update). The City has always strived to avoid residential
         land use designations adjacent to the Merced Regional Airport in order to protect its long-term
         future. When residential development is allowed to locate adjacent to airports, many times
         airport operations suffer due to noise, safety, and other complaints. The City is committed to
         minimizing as much as feasible the noise impacts of the Airport per the Implementing Actions
         above.
 Policy N-1.2
 Reduce Surface Vehicle Noise
 Implementing Actions:
 1.2.a   Continue to discourage truck traffic and through traffic in residential areas in Merced.
 1.2.b   Evaluate the need to prepare and adopt a Noise Ordinance for the City of Merced.
 1.2.c   New development of noise-sensitive land uses may not be permitted in areas exposed to
         existing or projected levels of noise from transportation noise sources which exceed the
         levels specified in Table N-3, unless the project design includes effective mitigation
         measures to reduce exterior noise and noise levels in interior spaces to the levels specified
         in Table N-3.
 1.2.d   Noise created by new transportation noise sources shall be mitigated to the extent
         feasible so as not to exceed the levels specified in Table N-3 at outdoor activity areas or
         interior spaces of existing noise-sensitive land uses.
 1.2.e   It is anticipated that roadway improvement projects will be needed to accommodate
         build-out of the General Plan. Therefore, existing noise-sensitive uses may be exposed to
         increased noise levels due to roadway improvement projects as a result of increased
         roadway capacity, increases in travel speeds, etc. It may not be practical to reduce
         increased traffic noise levels consistent with those contained Table N-3. Therefore, as an
         alternative, the following criteria may be used for roadway improvement projects:
         •   Where existing traffic noise levels are less than 60 dB Ldn at the outdoor activity
             areas of noise-sensitive uses, a +5 dB Ldn increase in noise levels due to roadway
             improvement projects should be mitigated to the extent feasible; and,
         •   Where existing traffic noise levels range between 60 and 65 dB Ldn at the outdoor
             activity areas of noise-sensitive uses, a +3 dB Ldn increase in noise levels due to
             roadway improvement projects should be mitigated to the extent feasible; and,
         •   Where existing traffic noise levels are greater than 65 dB Ldn at the outdoor activity
             areas of noise-sensitive uses, a + 1.5 dB Ldn increase in noise levels due to roadway
             improvement projects should be mitigated to the extent feasible.

                                                                          Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
                                                                                        Chapter 10--Noise
       In order to minimize noise impacts associated with vehicular traffic, the City will use the
       above implementing actions to address new development proposals. The City designates truck
       routes (in Merced Municipal Code Section 10.40) that minimize truck traffic through
       residential areas. The City does not currently have a noise ordinance—noise complaints are
       currently addressed through nuisance regulations, but adoption of a noise ordinance should be
       considered in order to provide better guidance on acceptable community noise levels for
       residents in relation to loud music, construction hours, etc.
Policy N-1.3
Reduce Equipment Noise Levels
Implementing Actions:
1.3.a  Limit operating hours for noisy construction equipment used in the City of Merced.
1.3.b  Review City functions (e.g. construction, refuse collection, street sweeping, tree
       trimming) to insure that noise generated by equipment has been reduced to the lowest
       practicable level.
1.3.c  Include maximum noise level permitted for City equipment purchases and construction
       contracts.
       The Inspection Services Division currently addresses noise levels for construction equipment
       on a case-by-case basis, but adoption of a City Noise Ordinance could provide additional
       guidance (if one is adopted). The City will continue to review and monitor noise generated by
       City functions and seek to reduce noise levels to the practical extent feasible.
Policy N-1.4
Reduce Noise Levels at the Receiver where Noise Reduction at the Source is Not
Possible
Implementing Actions:
1.4.a  Require new residential projects to meet acceptable noise level standards as follows:
       •   A maximum of 45 dB Ldn/CNEL for interior noise level for residential projects.
       •   A maximum of 65 dB Ldn/CNEL for exterior noise level for residential projects

           65 dB Ldn/CNEL when all the best available noise-reduction techniques have been
           exhausted without achieving 60 dB, and the strict application of such a maximum
           becomes a hindrance to development needed or typical for an area.
       •   For Railroad operations the standard shall be 65 dB Ldn/CNEL or less for exterior
           noise level using a practical application of the best-available noise reduction
           measures. An exterior noise level of up to 70 dB Ldn/CNEL may be allowed provided
           that available exterior noise level reduction measures have been implemented and
           interior noise levels are in compliance with Table N-3.

 1.4.b   Encourage Merced County Airport Land Use Commission to update the Airport Land
         Use Compatibility Plan, especially for Castle Airport, and to require stringent noise
         reduction standards as applied at other airports in the County.
 1.4.c   Use the "normally acceptable" noise levels as established in the "Noise and Land Use
         Compatibility Guidelines" for the review of non-residential land uses.
         Where it is not possible to reduce noise levels at the source, the City will seek to minimize
         noise levels at the receiver through the above Implementing Actions. Noise abatement
         techniques are varied, but include sound walls or barriers, landscaping, additional building
         insulation for noise, strategic placement of windows and bedrooms away from noise sources,
         site and building designs to shield outdoor spaces from excessive noise, etc. The Merced
         County Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan needs to be updated for all Merced County
         Airports, but especially for Castle Airport to reflect the absence of military aircraft after the
         closing of Castle Air Force Base. The County should require stringent noise reduction
         standards for Castle Airport equivalent or greater to those standards applied at other airports in
         the County.
 Policy N-1.5
 Coordinate Planning Efforts so that Noise-Sensitive Land Uses are not Located Near
 Major Noise Sources
 Implementing Actions:
 1.5.a   New development of noise-sensitive uses should not be allowed where the noise level due
         to noise sources will exceed the exterior noise level standards of Table N-1 as measured
         immediately within the property line or within a designated outdoor activity area (at the
         discretion of the Director of Development Services) of the new development, unless
         effective noise mitigation measures have been incorporated into the development design
         to achieve the standards specified in Table N-1.
 1.5.b   Noise created by new proposed non-transportation noise sources should be mitigated to
         the extent feasible so as not to exceed the exterior noise level standards of Table N-1 as
         measured immediately within the property line of lands designated for noise-sensitive
         uses.
 1.5.c   The City of Merced shall also apply an interior maximum nighttime noise level criterion
         (Lmax) of 50 dB in bedrooms for new residential uses affected by a non-transportation
         noise source.
 1.5.d   Where proposed non-residential land uses are likely to produce noise levels exceeding the
         performance standards of Table N-1, or the maximum interior noise level criterion, at
         existing or planned noise-sensitive uses, an acoustical analysis, at the discretion of the
         Director of Development Services, may be required as part of the environmental review
         process so that noise mitigation may be included in the project design. The general
         requirements for the content of an acoustical analysis are given by Table N-2.
 1.5.e   Create a master noise contours map to be used in the review and approval process for
         development proposals

      Each of the noise levels specified above shall be lowered by five dB for simple tone noises, noises
      consisting primarily of speech or music, or for recurring impulsive noises (e.g., humming sounds,
      outdoor speaker systems). These noise level standards do not apply to residential units established in
      conjunction with industrial or commercial uses (e.g., caretaker dwellings).
      The City can impose noise level standards that are more restrictive than those specified above based
      upon determination of existing low ambient noise levels.
      Fixed noise sources which are typically of concern include, but are not limited to the following:
      The types of uses which may typically produce the noise sources described above include but are not
      limited to: industrial facilities including pump stations, trucking operations, tire shops, auto maintenance
      shops, metal fabricating shops, shopping centers, drive-up windows, car washes, loading docks, public
      works projects, batch plants, bottling and canning plants, recycling centers, electric generating stations,

           (Modifications may be approved at the discretion of the Director of Development Services)
      An acoustical analysis prepared pursuant to the Noise Element should:
      A. Be the financial responsibility of the applicant.
      B. Be prepared by a qualified person experienced in the fields of environmental noise assessment and
           architectural acoustics.
      C. Include representative noise level measurements with sufficient sampling periods and locations to
           adequately describe local conditions and the predominant noise sources.
      D. Estimate existing and projected cumulative (20 years) noise levels in terms of Ldn or CNEL and/or
           the standards of Table N-1, and compare those levels to the adopted policies of the Noise Element.
      E. Recommend appropriate mitigation to achieve compliance with the adopted policies and standards
           of the Noise Element, giving preference to proper site planning and design over mitigation measures
           which require the construction of noise barriers or structural modifications to buildings which
           contain noise-sensitive land uses.

         G. Describe a post-project assessment program that could be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the
             proposed mitigation measures.
         The above Implementing Actions will be used in City Planning efforts in order to ensure that
         noise sensitive land uses are not located adjacent to major noise sources or if they are, that the
         noise impacts are minimized as much as possible, using the standards described above.
 Policy N-1.6
 Mitigate All Significant Noise Impacts as a Condition of Project Approval for
 Sensitive Land Uses
 Implementing Actions:
 1.6.a   Where noise mitigation measures are required to achieve the standards of Tables N-1
         and N-3, the emphasis of such measures should be placed upon site planning and project
         design. The use of noise barriers should be considered a means of achieving the noise
         standards only after all other practical design-related noise mitigation measures have
         been integrated into the project.
 1.6.b   Where noise-sensitive land uses are proposed in areas exposed to existing or projected
         exterior noise levels exceeding the levels specified in Table N-3 or the performance
         standards of Table N-1, an acoustical analysis may be required as part of the
         environmental review process so that noise mitigation may be included in the project
         design.

3   Where it is not possible to reduce noise in outdoor activity areas to 60 dB Ldn/CNEL or less using a
    practical application of the best-available noise reduction measures, an exterior noise level of up to
    65 dB Ldn/CNEL may be allowed provided that available exterior noise level reduction measures
    have been implemented and interior noise levels are in compliance with this table. For residential
    uses located adjacent to major roadways such as S.R. 99, S.R. 59, and S.R. 140, the normally
    acceptable exterior noise level is 65 dB Ldn/CNEL.
4   In the case of hotel/motel facilities or other transient lodging, outdoor activity areas such as pool
    areas may not be included in the project design. In these cases, only the interior noise level criterion
    will apply.
5   Where it is not possible to reduce noise in outdoor activity areas to 65 dB Ldn/CNEL or less using a
    practical application of the best-available noise reduction measures, an exterior noise level of up to
    70 dB Ldn/CNEL may be allowed provided that available exterior noise level reduction measures
    have been implemented and interior noise levels are in compliance with this table.
The above Implementing Actions will be used in the City development process in order to
ensure that noise impacts are mitigated to the greatest extent feasible by incorporating noise
abatement into project conditions and mitigation measures.

 Policy S-2.2
 Encourage the Improvement of All Public Facilities and Infrastructure, Such as
 Natural Gas, Fuel, Sewer, Water, Electricity, and Railroad Lines and Equipment
 with Up-To-Date Seismic Safety Features.
 Implementing Actions:
 2.2.a Work with Caltrans to review and, where possible, increase the earthquake stability of
         grade-separated transportation structures such as highway bridges and overpasses
         within the City's planning area.
 2.2.b Provide adequate storage facilities to insure an adequate supply of water in the event of
         seismic activity. An evaluation of the seismic safety of the water system, including the
         elevated water towers, should be completed as part of the update of the Water Master
         Plan.
         The City of Merced will address the seismic safety of public facilities and infrastructure
         through the above Implementing Actions. For non-City facilities, the City will work with the
         appropriate agency to address any issues.

         development. In the Merced planning area, most of the unstable ground are in old
         streams beds, near embankments, and adjacent to streams with sufficient velocities to
         erode the bank.
 2.3.b   Retain a high level of groundwater supply in order to reduce the possibility of land
         subsidence, including the initiation of an educational program to discourage excessive,
         inefficient uses of water.
         The City of Merced will work with other affected agencies to address areas with potential
         ground failure characteristics through the above Implementing Actions. Ground failure and
         subsidence is not a widespread issue in the Merced area, but still needs to be monitored.

       and to limit development to the extent feasible in flood hazard areas.
Policy S-3.2
Implement Appropriate Land Use Planning Practices to Improve Flood Risk
Management and Reduce the Consequence of Flooding.
Implementing Action:
3.2.a  Require evaluation of potential flood hazards prior to approval of development projects
       to determine whether the proposed development is reasonably safe from flooding and
       consistent with the State of California Department of Water Resources’ (DWR) Urban
       Level of Flood Protection Criteria for an urban level of flood protection standard (200-
       year) in urban and urbanizing areas. The City will not approve new development or a
       subdivision or enter into a development agreement for any property within a flood
       hazard zone, unless the adequacy of flood protection specific to the area has been
       demonstrated.
3.2.b  Require that new development and substantial improvements or upgrades in identified
       FEMA flood hazard zones (i.e., 100- and 500-year floodplains) be constructed in
       accordance with applicable city, State, and federal regulations, including compliance
       with the minimum standards of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the
       National Flood Improvement Program to avoid or minimize the risk of flood damage.
3.2.c  Require new development in dam or levee inundation areas to consider risk from failure
       of these facilities and to include mitigations to bring this risk to a reasonable level.
3.2.d  Review annually and update, as necessary, appropriate General Plan elements to reflect
       current floodplain mapping data available from local, regional, State, and federal
       agencies to ensure the best available flood risk mapping information is contained in the
       General Plan.
3.2.e  Amend the Merced Municipal Code (Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance) pursuant to
       state law to provide consistency with amendments made to the General Plan pursuant to
       flood risk management.
                                                 11-33

Chapter 11--Safety
 Policy S-3.3
 Maintain Essential City Services in the Event of Flooding or Dam Failure.
 Implementing Actions:
 3.3.a   Continue to build all pump stations (both sewer and water) entryways at one (1) foot
         above the 200-year flood elevation, and continue to implement additional standards to
         address flooding due to dam failure.
 3.3.b   Continue the "flood-proofing" of high-value or important City infrastructure, such as
         lift stations and signal control functions, as required by the City's Flood Damage
         Prevention Ordinance.
 3.3.c   Maintain and update emergency response plans, including evacuation routes, that
         address potential flooding in flood hazard zones, in areas protected by levees and dam
         inundation areas. Maintain, update, and make available to the public, as appropriate,
         community flood evacuation and rescue maps.
         In times of flooding, when evacuation routes will be essential, the availability of a popular
         road may be submerged, while the availability of another lesser known road may become the
         viable evacuation route. Preparation and dissemination of emergency response plans and
         evacuation routes will benefit individuals and the community.
 Policy S-3.4
 Locate and Design Essential Facilities to Minimize Flood Risk
 Implementing Actions:
 3.4.a   Essential facilities (i.e., hospitals and health care facilities, emergency shelters, fire
         stations and police stations, emergency command centers, and emergency
         communications facilities), when feasible, shall be located outside of 100- and 200-year
         floodplains, or implement design and construction methods to minimize damage from
         flood hazards identified, so that structural and operational integrity is maintained during
         flooding.
         Protection of the City’s essential services will be key to provision of services during times of
         emergency. As described below, the City will evaluate and deploy a variety of means to
         accomplish this implementing action (see below).
 3.4.b   The City shall develop a program with criteria to determine when construction of
         essential public facilities and other critical facilities will be permitted in flood hazard
         zones or areas with other geologic hazards.
         This program will be developed in conjunction with the Engineering Division’s effort to craft a
         policy reflective set of codes (see below).
 3.4.c   Review the municipal code and amend as necessary to require the location of new critical
         facilities (e.g., hospitals, emergency command centers, communication facilities, fire
         stations, and police stations) outside of 100- and 200-year floodplains. Where such
         location is not feasible, include exceptions through appropriate mitigation methods to
         minimize the potential flood damage to the facility.
         Following adoption of the City’s General Plan Amendment, the City’s Engineering Division
         will develop and process an applicable code amendment.

Policy S-3.5
Coordinate with other Local, Regional, State, and Federal Agencies to Improve Flood
Risk Management.
Implementing Actions:
3.5.a    The City shall develop and maintain relationships with local jurisdictions, water districts,
         state agencies, and federal agencies for the purposes of: 1) providing information for the
         public; 2) utilizing current data (e.g., National Flood Insurance Program maps); and, 3)
         determining appropriate regulatory requirements for development in high hazard areas.
         Establishment and development of partnerships, collaborative efforts and communication are
         important elements of a successful program and safe community.
3.5.b    Cooperate with local, regional, State, and federal agencies in securing funding to obtain
         the maximum level of flood protection that is practical, with a minimum goal of achieving
         at least 200-year flood protection for urban and urbanizing areas.
         Working with its local partners and being aware of state and federal funding opportunities, the
         City will seek grant funds to improve its flood-related infrastructure.
3.5.c    Work with responsible parties to ensure flood management facilities and structures (e.g.,
         pump stations, levees, canals, channels, and dams) in the community are properly
         maintained and/or improved.
         The Merced Irrigation District maintains and improves these features within the planning area.
3.5.d    Annually maintain and implement the community’s Federal Emergency Management
         Agency (FEMA)-approved local hazard mitigation plan in order to apply for and/or
         receive project grants under FEMA’s hazard mitigation assistance programs (e.g.,
         Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, Pre-Disaster Mitigation, Flood Mitigation Assistance,
         or Severe Repetitive Loss).
         The 2015 Local Hazard Mitigation Plan has a life of 5-years and includes nine projects that are
         eligible for grant funds. Annual updates and maintenance of the plan are part of the duties of
         the City’s Disaster Council.

Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
Chapter 11--Safety
 Policy S-4.1
 Promote the Concept of Fire Protection Master Planning with Fire Safety Goals,
 Missions, and Supporting Objectives for the Community.
 Implementing Actions:
 4.1.a   Provide additional fire station locations as expansion of the City occurs in order to
         maintain a response time objective of 4 to 6 minutes citywide 90 percent of the time,
         within the financial constraints of the City.
 4.1.b   Work with the Fire Department and the Environmental Health Division to identify fire
         districts that will require specialized manpower and equipment, such as businesses that
         use hazardous materials, and request that land uses or structures with similar needs be
         confined to these districts.
         The planning of future fire stations is also addressed in Public Facilities Policy P-2.1 in the
         Public Facilities Chapter (Chapter 5), but the Implementing Actions above will also be taken
         into consideration when planning new fire facilities.
 Policy S-4.2
 Maintain a Reasonable Level of Accessibility and Infrastructure Support for Fire
 Suppression, Disaster, and Other Emergency Services.
 Implementing Actions:
 4.2.a   Continue to use 8-inch or larger pipe in high-value districts. In residential districts,
         additional "looping" or completion of water main grids shall continue to be provided
         where possible so that lengths of 6-inch pipe on the long side of the block will not exceed
         600 feet.
 4.2.b   Maintain current standards defined in the Fire Code and City Standards for the spacing
         of fire hydrants. In general, these standards call for 500-foot spacing in residential
         areas and 300-foot spacing in commercial and industrial areas.
 4.2.c   Continue to provide fire prevention and disaster preparedness information through the
         schools, public interest groups, and other facilities and people.
 4.2.d   Continue close collaboration between Inspection Services, Fire Prevention, and Fire
         Suppression support personnel to ensure public safety and improve construction safety
         through the building permit and life safety inspections process.
 4.2.e    Continue to enforce the present nuisance abatement program regarding a height limit
         on weeds during the dry season (mid-April through mid-November) in both vacant and
         developed lots, abandoned vehicles, and vacant buildings.
         The City Fire Department has several on-going fire prevention programs that have reduced fire
         incidents in the City, which are addressed in the Implementing Actions above and include
         requiring adequate water flow for fire hydrants and sprinkler systems, maintaining standards
         for fire hydrant locations, performing annual fire inspections of businesses, the annual Weed
         Abatement program, and other various educational programs. These programs should be
         continued and expanded as needed.

Goal Area S-5: Airport Safety
GOAL
     A Safe Airport Environment Both Above and On the Ground
POLICIES
S-5.1    Continue to protect approach areas and control zones for both existing and future runway
         systems through land use regulations and property acquisition where necessary.
S-5.2    Prevent the encroachment of potential hazards to flight within the Airport's airspace.
Policy S-5.1
Continue to Protect Approach Areas and Control Zones for Both Existing and
Future Runway Systems Through Land Use Regulations and Property Acquisition
Where Necessary.
Implementing Actions:
5.1.a    Retain existing agricultural land uses and discourage residential land use designations
         within the Merced Regional Airport Land Use Compatibility Zones A and B1 as defined
         in the Merced County Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan. Restrict densities within
         other Zones per Table 2A of the Merced County Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan.
5.1.b    Limit the peak occupancy levels of industrial/commercial uses per Table 2A of the
         Merced County Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan. Occupancy levels and density
         vary within each of the Land Use Compatibility Zones.
5.1.c    Continue to utilize various alternatives for acquiring approach protection easements and
         overflight easements for properties within the vicinity of the Merced Regional Airport as
         defined in the Airport Master Plan.
5.1.d    Work with the County of Merced on land use and master planning issues in the vicinity
         of Castle Airport and its Land Use Compatibility Zones.”
         Noise impacts associated with the Merced Regional Airport are addressed in Noise Policy N-
         1.1 in Chapter 10, and the importance of maintaining airport service to the community are
         addressed in Transportation Policies T-3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 in Chapter 4. The Implementing
         Actions above are to ensure that adequate measures are taken to protect residents and
         businesses on the ground from air crashes that could occur in and around the airport. This will
         include implementing the policies of the Merced County Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan
         regarding restricting residential land uses, prohibiting the location of inappropriate land uses,
         such as hospitals, schools, etc., and limiting the peak occupancy of industrial and commercial
         uses within certain compatibility zones as well as acquiring approach protection and overflight
         easements in the vicinity of the runways. The City currently has land designated for
         agricultural use only at the ends of the runways for this purpose.
         The City of Merced recognizes that Castle Airport is a County asset with the potential to
         generate job growth within the County of Merced. Merced County is currently in the process
         of developing a new Castle Airport Master Plan, which would outline Castle’s proposed
         development over the next 20 years. Merced County has expressed an interest in expanding
         Castle’s current role as mostly a general aviation airport (the County’s website in 2011
         indicates that general aviation uses are 99% of current operations) to include air cargo,
         military exercises, and commercial air service. If such a Master Plan was approved, the Land

Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
Chapter 11--Safety
          Use Compatibility Zones for Castle Airport would need to be modified to reflect those
          changes. If modified, Castle Airport’s Land Use Compatibility Zones could affect
          development within the existing City and the proposed SUDP/SOI. (Long time residents will
          remember the significant noise impacts of Castle’s military operations until Castle Air Force
          Base closed in 1995.) Therefore, the City wants to continue to work with the County on
          ensuring that any adopted Castle Airport Master Plan contains realistic aircraft operation
          projections that do not hinder both existing and future development within the City.
 Policy S-5.2
 Prevent the Encroachment of Potential Hazards to Flight Within the Airport's
 Airspace.
 Implementing Action:
 5.2.a    Continue to follow Federal Aviation Regulation standards regarding the maximum
          height of structures and other objects within the Merced Regional Airport Land Use
          Compatibility Zones.
          The above Implementing Action will ensure that objects that might pose hazards to flight due
          to height are not allowed adjacent to the Merced Regional Airport.
 Goal Area S-6: Crime
 GOAL
      Reduced Criminal Activity and An Increased Feeling of Safety and Security in the
       Community

 of the City.
 Implementing Actions:
 6.1.a    Continue programs, such as "Neighborhood Watch" which increase residents'
          involvement in, and ownership of, police operations.
 6.1.b    Direct services and outreach programs towards youths in the community.
 6.1.c    Locate future police facilities to enhance the "community policing" concept through the
          expansion of existing or the addition of new police service districts as the City grows.
        Crime is an important safety issue within any community and Merced is no different. The
        Merced Police Department has several on-going programs that seek to prevent crime, which are
        addressed in the above Implementing Actions. The City uses “community policing,” which
        seeks to make sure that the Police are visible and engaged throughout the community. The City
        has two police stations and will continue to expand police facilities, perhaps in conjunction with
        fire facilities, as the City grows.

Provide Services and Personnel Necessary to Maintain Community Order and Public
Safety.
Implementing Actions:
6.2.a   Maintain a police force sufficiently staffed and deployed to ensure quick response times
        to emergency calls, within the financial constraints of the City.
6.2.b   Encourage approaches to crime prevention to be designed into new buildings and
        subdivisions.
6.2.c   Identify changes to current laws and ordinances or create new ones to help carry out
        crime prevention strategies.
        In addition to maintaining sufficient Police staffing levels, the City can use other methods as
        described above to help prevent crime. Special attention should be paid to crime prevention
        through the design of new buildings, subdivisions, and public places. Design issues that need
        to be addressed include lighting, “hiding places,” graffiti prevention, the location of doors and
        windows “on the street,” etc. Various ordinances are in place to address crime prevention
        strategies, which include curfew laws, restrictions on the sale of spray paint, etc, but new ones
        should be added as needed.

11.4.3 Hazards Unknown in the Merced
        Planning Area
The following geologic or other hazards are
unknown in the Merced SUDP/SOI:
•  Hydrocompaction: Hydrocompaction
   occurs when open-textured soils become
   saturated with water for the first time,
   lose their strength, and consolidate under
   their own weight. In California, about
   124 square miles of land surface has
   experienced, or is subject to, subsidence
   due to hydrocompaction. Subsidence of
   three to five feet is common and has
   damaged         ditches,    canals,  roads,
   pipelines, electric transmission towers,
   and buildings. Hydro-compaction on the
   west side of the San Joaquin Valley
   required special consideration and
   engineering           treatment     during
   construction of the California Aqueduct.
   In contrast, the Delta-Mendota Canal
   was built without knowledge of the
   problem, and subsidence of certain
   portions has required extensive repair.

       Grow? and the Village Concept
Beginning in 1990 with the Merced 2030:
How Should We Grow? process, the City
began looking at the manner and direction of
the City’s future growth.
At that time, population projections
indicated that the City could reach a
population of 250,000 by the year 2030.
Although subsequent events (Castle AFB’s
closing, the recession in the economy, etc.)
tempered this projection, the assumption
remained the same--the City would grow to
be much larger and, if Merced is to avoid the
pitfalls of other urban areas that size, we
needed to start planning for accommodating
that growth today.
The Merced 2030 process evaluated four
different growth scenarios in terms of future

2.5     URBAN EXPANSION GOALS, POLICIES, AND ACTIONS
 Goal Area UE-1: Urban Expansion
 GOALS
  A Compact Urban Form
  Preservation of Agriculturally Significant Areas
  Efficient Urban Expansion
 POLICIES
 UE-1.1 Designate areas for new urban development that recognize the physical characteristics and
            environmental constraints of the planning area.
 UE-1.2 Foster compact and efficient development patterns to maintain a compact urban form.
 UE-1.3 Control the annexation, timing, density, and location of new land uses within the City’s
            urban expansion boundaries.
 UE-1.4 Continue joint planning efforts on the UC Merced and University Community plans.
 UE-1.5 Promote annexation of developed areas within the City’s Specific Urban Development Plan
            (SUDP)/Sphere of Influence (SOI) during the planning period.
 UE-1.6 Consider expansion of the City’s SUDP/SOI boundary for areas within the Area of Interest
            when certain conditions are met.
 Policy UE-1.1
 Designate Areas For New Urban Development That Recognize the Physical
 Characteristics and Environmental Constraints of the Planning Area.
 The City of Merced is situated in an area which contains physical characteristics and environmental
 constraints that would be adversely impacted by a poor urban expansion policy. It is in the long term
 interest of the City to promote urban expansion policies which protect and promote avoidance of
 sensitive environmental and resource areas.
 Implementing Actions:
 1.1.a    Direct development away from significant concentrations of “Prime” agricultural soils
          and give priority to the conversion of non-prime agricultural land if reasonable
          alternatives exist.
          Urban expansion should be directed away from significant concentrations of “prime” soils and
          where agricultural use can still be realistically and economically sustained. Development
          within the City’s SUDP/SOI should be developed in such a manner as to minimize impacts on
          “prime” soils along the City’s urban fringe. It is recognized that it is not possible to avoid all
          “prime” soils. The UC Merced Campus and University Community are located on prime
          farmland to avoid sensitive wetlands habitat. Some areas that contain prime soils are adjacent
          to important circulation and employment corridors and will need to be developed for urban use
          in order to achieve critical City economic development and circulation goals. Accommodating
          growth in a compact form within the City’s growth area will decrease the pressure to develop
          outside urban areas where more prime soils and intensive agricultural operations now exist.

Chapter 2--Urban Expansion
 1.1.b   Limit development and development related impacts on agricultural lands along the
         City’s urban fringe.
         The level and intensity of development adjacent to agricultural areas must be carefully
         considered to limit the impacts on those agricultural areas along the City’s fringe, which likely
         won’t be developed in the long-term. The City may consider adopting a “right-to-farm”
         ordinance to protect existing agricultural operations by notifying homeowners moving to areas
         adjacent to these operations of the continued use of agricultural chemicals and the operation of
         heavy farming equipment.
 1.1.c   Incompatible urban development should not be approved which would endanger the
         continued operations of the Merced Regional Airport.
         It is in the City’s interest to protect the Merced Regional Airport from incompatible
         developments which might interfere with its current operations and future expansion. To this
         degree, the City should consider the designated Land Use Compatibility Zones within the
         Merced SUDP/Sphere of Influence (SOI) with the intention of establishing land use policy
         which limits residential development while allowing some industrial and commercial
         development which would not interfere with airport operations.
 1.1.d   Work with Merced County to establish policies to protect prime agricultural areas
         around the SUDP/Sphere of Influence, including the areas north of Highway 140 and
         east of the proposed Campus Parkway, from future development. This process should
         include consideration of:
         a)   A process to implement techniques (transfer of development rights, agricultural
              easements, Farmland Trusts, etc.) in order to establish a limited access Campus
              Parkway with no adjacent urban development outside of the Merced SUDP/SOI.
         b)   Designation of an “Area of Interest (AOI)” or other process to require referral for
              comment to the City of any proposed development projects within the AOI
              boundary.
         c)   Limiting the expansion of the existing Rural Residential Centers and SUDP’s into
              prime agricultural areas around the SUDP/Sphere of Influence.
         The agricultural areas north of Highway 140 and east of the proposed Campus Parkway are not
         included in the City’s SUDP/SOI but are included in the City’s Area of Interest. However, the
         City does retain an interest in seeing that this area remains agricultural. The City has for many
         years sought to direct urban development away from this area in order to preserve its prime
         agricultural soils. The City will work with Merced County to establish policies which
         reinforce this goal and which seek to protect prime agricultural land around the City’s
         SUDP/Sphere of Influence.

1.1.e   Explore techniques to preserve areas of significant agricultural soils, aircraft noise and
        safety zones, buffers between cities, scenic areas, flood plains, endangered species
        habitats, etc. from incompatible urban development.
        The City’s growth has been directed mostly to the north and south for many years by General
        Plan policy in order to protect agriculturally-significant lands and/or aircraft noise and safety
        zones to the City’s east and west from incompatible urban development.             However, the
        location of the UC Merced Campus to the east of the City and the location of significant
        wetlands areas to the north of the City has led to a reconsideration of the predominant north-
        south growth pattern. The City should work in cooperation with agricultural interests, such as
        the Merced County Farm Land and Open Space Trust, the Merced Farm Bureau, and Merced
        County to explore alternatives for assuring the continued preservation of significant
        agricultural and other such areas, including transfer of development rights, agricultural
        easements, aircraft approach protection easements, etc.
1.1.f   Work with Merced County and the other cities in the County to develop a County-wide
        agricultural land preservation policy.
        A number of years ago, there was an effort to establish a Countywide Agricultural
        Preservation Strategy (CAPS) in which the cities in Merced County and the County worked on
        ways to address preservation of prime agricultural land. That effort ultimately failed and the
        County of Merced has imposed agricultural mitigation on certain large development projects,
        such at the University Community, on a case-by-case basis. However, in order to assure
        fairness and to be truly effective, a comprehensive strategy for dealing with agricultural
        preservation needs to be established Countywide. The City of Merced is committed to
        working with the County and the other cities to resolve this issue.
(Chapter 7--Open Space, Conservation, & Recreation contains additional policies (Policy OS-2.1)
regarding the preservation of agricultural land.)
Policy UE-1.2
Foster Compact and Efficient Development Patterns to Maintain a Compact Urban
Form.
Through the promotion of compact urban form, the City of Merced can achieve several important
environmental and community planning goals. Through the concentration of urban development
within the City’s SUDP/SOI, impacts on surrounding agricultural resource lands can be reduced and
important prime soils preserved. Additionally, through compact urban development, efficient public
transit systems can operate to protect the region’s air quality and pedestrian and bicycle use is
encouraged.      Compact urban development also reduces public infrastructure development and
maintenance costs to the City and its residents.
Implementing Actions:
1.2.a   Encourage development on in-fill sites by amending the Zoning and Subdivision
        Ordinances to better accommodate such requests.
                                                  2-25

Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
Chapter 2--Urban Expansion
         There are areas within the existing incorporated limits of the City which are undeveloped or
         under-developed.       These areas provide development opportunities which will somewhat
         relieve the need to expand the City’s urban limits. Many of these sites are vacant and/or
         undeveloped due to their unique site constraints. A review and possible revision of City
         policies and standards, relative to these sites is appropriate. Redevelopment is also a tool that
         can be used to encourage in-fill development in Project Area #2 (Downtown) and Gateways
         Redevelopment Areas (see Chapter 3).
 1.2.b   Work with Merced County to ensure that existing unincorporated Rural Residential
         Centers in the Merced area are not expanded and no new Rural Residential Centers are
         established.
         RRC’s are not efficient uses of land and have not proven to be ideal buffers between urban and
         agricultural uses. Existing RRC’s can remain but should not be enlarged and no new RRC’s
         should be established in accordance with County (and City) General Plan policy and
         provisions of the existing City/County Property Tax Sharing Agreement adopted in 1997
         (Section 2.3.4). The City will work with the County on service issues relating to the RRC’s.
         Industrial and business park development do provide good buffers adjacent to agricultural land
         and are designated along the City’s SUDP/SOI to the west, south, and east (south of Highway
         140).
 1.2.c   Continue to limit the expansion of City utilities to only those areas within the established
         urban boundary.
         Proposals for urban development within the City’s SUDP/SOI shall be considered only after
         annexation has taken place. To be eligible for annexation, a property must be contiguous to
         the City Limits and be located within the SUDP/SOI. City utilities should not be extended
         outside of the City limits except in cases where public health and safety are threatened or a
         significant public interest (such as the UC campus) is served. If it is necessary for
         technical/economic reasons to allow utilities to cross unincorporated territory (i.e. water/sewer main
         extensions), actual access to such utility services will be restricted to those inside the City limits until
         such time as annexation occurs. Annexation agreements would be utilized in these cases to
         address relevant issues and service costs.
 1.2.d   Promote higher residential densities within the Merced urban area.
         The City will continue to promote the use of higher residential densities, especially small-lot
         single-family residential and multi-family residential, in order to make the most efficient use
         of land and maintain a compact urban form. The highest densities should, in general, be
         directed toward central areas of the City and not along the urban fringes unless they are in
         Community Plan areas, where higher densities may be justified.

1.3.a The City should continue to require that all new urban development and annexations be
      contiguous to existing urban areas and have reasonable access to public services and
      facilities.
       “Leap-frog development” tends to be cost-prohibitive in these times due to the high up-front
      costs of extending utility lines, streets, etc., across undeveloped properties to outlying areas.
      Such development should be discouraged in most cases because of the service inefficiencies it
      creates. Exceptions can be made for industrial areas which for business recruitment reasons
      often need to provide infrastructure and services prior to development. Other exceptions may
      be made, with strong justification on a case-by-case basis, for other areas which may serve the
      public interest through early development.
1.3.b The City should adequately plan for public improvements/services to support designated
      land uses for all areas as they become suitable for development and/or proposed for
      annexation.
      The City should continue to revise master plans for providing sewer, water, fire protection,
      police protection, drainage, and other municipal services for all new growth areas after the
      adoption of the General Plan. Refer to Chapter 5--Public Services and Facilities for specific
      policies regarding each of these areas.
1.3.c The City shall encourage phasing of new development.
      Phasing of new development will prevent the premature conversion of agricultural land, and
      permit the efficient and cost effective extension of services. (Care must be taken, however, to
      ensure that citizens are aware of which land will likely stay in agricultural use and which areas
      will eventually be developed.)           When approving General Plan Amendments and
      Specific/Community Plans for large areas, the City should consider applying phasing to the
      development tied to the ability of the City to provide infrastructure and municipal services to
      new development and/or consider designating certain areas for development within 10-year
      time frames. These policies can be implemented through the Pre-Annexation Development
      Agreement process with property owners who seek these land use entitlements. The City will
      also consider policies to encourage the completion of vacant subdivisions (over 2,500 vacant
      lots were available for development within the City limits in 2009).
1.3.d The City shall continue to utilize and refine systems to evaluate the cost of providing
      various municipal services to new development and/or areas proposed for annexation
      and establish clear policy for meeting those costs.
      The City has developed appropriate tools and techniques for evaluating the fiscal impacts of
      new development, including the costs of providing municipal services and needed
      infrastructure. Policies (such as those contained in the Public Services and Facilities Chapter
      of this plan) should continue to be enforced to insure that new development pays for the
      impacts it causes, ensuring that an unfair burden does not fall on current City residents. The
      City will continue to use Pre-Annexation Development Agreements to bring County
      infrastructure up to City standards upon annexation.
1.3.e The planning for land uses in newly developing areas should reflect a mix of land uses
      which will support a neighborhood, including a variety of residential densities and price
      ranges, neighborhood and convenience shopping facilities, job creation, and public
      facilities such as schools and parks.
      The City will continue to promote the use of the mixed-use, pedestrian- and transit-friendly
      neighborhoods (“Urban Villages”) in all new growth areas of the City as much as feasible.

 1.3.f   Work with the County to implement the land use provisions of the “Property Tax
         Sharing Agreement between the City of Merced and the County of Merced” (Section
         2.3.4) and negotiate a new agreement that reflects the SUDP/Sphere of Influence (SOI)
         and Area of Interest (AOI).
         The City will work closely with the County to implement the land use provisions of the
         agreement, which include a) maintenance of existing agricultural zoning within the SUDP/SOI
         and no expansion of the existing County Rural Residential Centers; b) requirements and
         procedures for areas currently zoned for urban development; and, c) cooperative planning and
         referral of projects within the University Community SUDP. A new agreement will need to be
         negotiated to adopt land use provisions that relate to the new SUDP/SOI and AOI and that
         address financial inequities that make annexation difficult for the City.
 1.3.g   Evaluate future annexation requests against the following conditions:
         a) Is the area contiguous to the current City limits and within the City’s Specific Urban
              Development Plan (SUDP)/Sphere of Influence (SOI)? Do the annexed lands form a
              logical and efficient City limit and include older areas where appropriate to
              minimize the formation of unincorporated peninsulas?
         b) Is the proposed development consistent with the land use classifications on the
              General Plan Land Use Diagram (Figure 3.1)?
         c) Can the proposed development be served by the City water, sewer, storm drainage,
              fire and police protection, parks, and street systems to meet acceptable standards
              and service levels without requiring improvements and additional costs to the City
              beyond which the developer will consent to provide or mitigate?
         d) Will this annexation result in the premature conversion of prime agricultural land as
              defined on the Important Farmland Map of the State Mapping and Monitoring
              Program? If so, are there alternative locations where this development could take
              place without converting prime soils?
         e) Will a non-agricultural use create conflict with adjacent or nearby agricultural uses?
              If so, how can these conflicts be mitigated?
         f) Does annexation of the area help the City reach one of the following goals?
              1) Does annexation of the area bring the City closer to annexation of the UC Merced
                   campus and University Community?
              2) Does the area contain significant amounts of job-generating land uses, such as
                   industrial, commercial, office, and business/research & development parks?
              3) Does the project provide key infrastructure facilities or other desirable amenities,
                   such as the extension of major roads, utility trunk lines, parks and recreational
                   facilities, etc.?
     Future annexation requests will be evaluated against the above criteria as well as against the
     Policies and Implementing Actions of the Merced Vision 2030 General Plan, including but not
     limited to the following:
     a) Urban Expansion Policies--UE-1.1, UE-1.2, and UE-1.3.
     b) Land Use Policies--L-1.1, L-2.1, L-2.7, L-3.1, and L-3.2.
     c) Transportation and Circulation Policies--T-1.1, T-1.3, T-1.8, T-2.2, and T-2.4.
     d) Public Facilities & Services Policies--P-1.1, P-1.2, P-1.3, P-2.1, P-3.1, P-4.1, P-5.1, & P-7.1.

Continue Joint Planning Efforts on the UC Merced Campus and University
Community Plans.
The University Community Plan area is planned as an urban area requiring urban services.
Consideration has been given to making this area part of the incorporated City of Merced.
Cooperative planning efforts will be necessary to ensure the effective development of this area for all
interested and affected parties.
Implementing Actions:
1.4.a    Incorporate the UC Merced campus area as part of the City’s SUDP/Sphere of Influence
         and begin planning for the eventual annexation of the Campus.
         This designation within the SUDP/SOI would facilitate the eventual incorporation of the
         Campus into the City. The City should begin the process of planning for the eventual
         annexation of the Campus to the City, including evaluating various corridors for possible
         annexation in order to bridge the gap between the current City limits and the Campus
         boundary. Planning of the land uses along those corridors should also begin as well, including
         possible locations for research and development parks.
1.4.b    Working in cooperation with the County, implement the following policy statement from
         City Council Resolution #2006-89 regarding the University Community Plan Area.
        MERCED CITY COUNCIL: UNIVERSITY COMMUNITY POLICY STATEMENT
         The City Council establishes the following as the City of Merced's position regarding the
         development of the University community.
                                      Long-term Land Use and Governance
         The University Community should be incorporated into the City of Merced, and should not be
         part of the unincorporated County, or a separate City.
         •   It is in the public interest that the University Community's development not result in the
             creation of a new city or other jurisdiction.
         •   Multiplication of jurisdictions can lead to conflicts, which should be avoided. A separate
             City on Merced's border is inherently undesirable.
         •   The University Community is expected to develop at an urban density. Merced County
             does not currently provide urban services. The City is already serving the University of
             California campus, and it is logical for the City to serve the adjacent area as well.
         •   No separate wastewater treatment plant should be allowed or constructed in the area, given
             the risks to the City's groundwater supply that could result, and competition for qualified
             licensed operators. This statement does not, however, preclude consideration of innovative
             methods of wastewater treatment for the area which are reasonably viable from an
             economic perspective.
        The University Community should be developed with the use of annexation agreements and
        phased annexations, not through the creation of a County services district, either as an interim
        or permanent measure.

Chapter 2--Urban Expansion
                                      Phasing of Development and Services
         The City of Merced is willing to provide interim sewer and water services from existing sewer
         and water lines along Bellevue Road that serve the University campus, provided that certain
         conditions are met:
         •   Interim services to the University Community require compliance with environmental law
             and permitting, including the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and approval
             by the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCo).
         •   Prior to providing interim services, the City must receive an acceptable plan for long term
             service provision, enforceable commitment for annexation, and financial planning and
             commitments necessary to fund long term services.
         The City should encourage annexation along the Bellevue Corridor to provide contiguity
         between the University Community and the City of Merced.
         •   The Bellevue corridor is expected to become a major regional transportation arterial.
             Bellevue Road also contains sewer and water lines which have been extended from the
             City to the University of California campus. The western half of the Corridor, from G
             Street to Golf Road, is already within Merced's SUDP, and annexation proposals are
             pending. East of Golf Road, the area along Bellevue Road is held in large tracts by a few
             land owners, and is mostly undeveloped. It is realistic to expect development proposals in
             this area in the near term.
         •   Phasing of the University Community's development should provide for logical extension
             of urban services.
         •   The Merced County "Rural Residential Center" bounded by Lake Road, Cardella Road,
             Yosemite Avenue, and Golf Road (extended) should be annexed into the City of Merced
             as well. However, this area, which is already developed to a large extent, should be
             allowed to retain its rural character, with a special plan Designation to be worked out
             through the General Plan update process.
                                                Planning Processes
         The City accepts the University Community Plan adopted by Merced County on December 21,
         2004 as a general conceptual framework for the planning of the University Community.
         •   That existing plan can be used as foundational work for further planning for the area, with
             the City as lead agency in the planning process.
         •   If a special planning process or framework is used for the development of the University
             Community, then the costs of that planning process shall be borne by applicants and
             developers, not by Merced residents.
         The City should revise all of its various planning documents to accommodate the incorporation
         of the University Community into the City of Merced. These include not only the General
         Plan, but also plans for wastewater treatment, water, storm drainage, parks, fire protection, and

Policy UE-1.5
Promote Annexation of Developed Areas Within the City’s Specific Urban
Development Plan (SUDP)/Sphere of Influence (SOI) During the Planning Period.
Unincorporated suburban development within the City’s SUDP/SOI has resulted in problems of public
protection (police and fire) service delivery to residents in addition to posing potential long term
problems to residents with respect to maintenance of on-site water systems and wastewater disposal
(septic) systems. Such problems could also threaten the City’s future water quality. Also, residents of
these areas, while directly impacted by the City’s planning decision making process, have no direct
voice in municipal affairs. In the long-term interest of both the City and the residents, these
unincorporated suburban areas should be annexed to the City of Merced.
Implementing Actions:
1.5.a    The City should continue to promote the annexation of unincorporated urban areas
         within the urban expansion boundaries, which cause a duplication of public services and
         hinder extension of City services to new development, if they are financially feasible.
         To make annexation more attractive to these areas, the City will explore different options
         regarding the cost of connecting to City sewer and water (in 2006, the City removed the
         requirement that previously required that connections to City services take place within a
         certain period of time), the financing of public improvement standards, and the establishment
         of a “rural agricultural overlay” zone for limited areas where the keeping of farm animals may
         be allowed within the City limits. (Implementation of the “rural agricultural overlay” has
         occurred on some newly annexed areas on a case-by-case basis.) Care must be taken,
         however, to ensure that these annexations are financially feasible and do not create an unfair
         burden on existing City residents.
1.5.b    Review relevant City improvement and development policies to remove unnecessary
         obstacles to annexation.
         The formation of Community Facilities Districts or other equivalent funding mechanisms to
         pay for needed infrastructure improvements and City services should be utilized. City
         policies relative to mandatory connection to the City’s sewer and water system should be
         reviewed. Consideration might be given to establishment of policies which would allow
         residents, presently served by private sewer and water systems, to remain on these systems
         unless they pose a problem to public health and safety.
1.5.c    Provide assistance to residents of unincorporated areas to address public health and
         safety concerns of on-site water and sewer systems.
         The City may assist residents with coordinated expansion of utility service, where desired by
         the residents, and in support of an annexation petition.
1.5.d    Establish annexation policies and outreach program regarding the annexation of the
         existing Rural Residential Centers (existing development on one-acre lots)
                                                    2-31

Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
Chapter 2--Urban Expansion
          With the inclusion of many of the existing Rural Residential Centers within the SUDP/SOI,
          the City will need to establish policies and possibly an outreach program to address when
          those areas should be annexed and the level of services to be provided. The City will consider
          establishing a ‘Rural Residential’ (R-R) zoning district, which can be used in these areas upon
          annexation. The R-R district would address standards for existing private wells and septic
          systems, the keeping of animals and livestock, the level of public improvements in such areas
          (i.e. the possible omission of sidewalks, etc.), and other issues that often arise when such
          developed areas are proposed for annexation.” Modifications to the current City/County Tax-
          Sharing Agreement will be necessary to make annexation of these areas financially feasible for
          the City.
 1.5.e    Provide information to interested unincorporated area residents on the benefits of
          annexation.
          The City can develop and distribute information to county residents within the SUDP/SOI on
          the pros and cons of annexation, including comparisons of costs of City vs. County services,
          taxes (no difference), development standards, etc. City staff can attend meetings with
          neighborhood groups in unincorporated areas to explain the annexation process and City
          policy regarding annexing unincorporated areas.
 1.5.f    Target the State Route 59 (South) Corridor as a priority annexation area.
          This area is predominately built-out with land uses and forms an large peninsula of
          unincorporated lands. Residential neighborhoods have been developed or have been permitted
          on either side of this corridor. As more residents are added to the area, demand will increase
          for more neighborhood serving commercial land uses along this highway. Annexation will
          also remove obstacles for future annexations south of Mission/Dickenson Ferry Road.
 Policy UE-1.6
 Consider Expansion of the City’s SUDP/SOI boundary for Areas within the Area of
 Interest When Certain Conditions are Met.
 Some of the original General Plan Study Areas were found to have constraints which limited their
 development potential within the current plan timeline. In the interest of flexibility, and to provide
 interested property owners with some options, certain study areas have been designated as being
 within the Area of Interest (AOI). This area is of interest to the City, as it is likely going to be the
 location of City expansion in the next general plan update, 20-40 years hence.
 Implementing Actions:
 1.6.a    For areas within the City’s Area of Interest (AOI), these areas can be considered for
          future inclusion in the City’s SUDP/SOI as long as they are consistent with the criteria
          below:
          a)    City SUDP/SOI boundary is contiguous, and no “islands” are created;
          b)    A Community or Area Plan is approved that addresses land use, circulation, public
                facilities, infrastructure, and phasing of development;
          c)    The Public Facilities Financing Plan has been updated to include the area with
                revenue sources identified;
                                                    2-32

                                                                             Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
                                                                                  Chapter 2--Urban Expansion
         d)   The property owner is committed to finance the City’s Wastewater Treatment Plant
              & capacity is available;
         e)   New sewer trunk lines are planned and have capacity;
         f)   The developer agrees to install all off-site intervening infrastructure;
         g)   Community or Area Plans need to include adjacent areas within the SUDP/SOI that
              are affected by the development of Master Plans;
         h) The inventory of vacant land within the City’s SUDP/SOI has reached a certain level
              as determined by the City Council to ensure that development within the Area of
              Interest will not unduly delay development within the SUDP/SOI.
         Areas within the City’s Area of Interest can be added to the City’s SUDP/SOI in the future if
         the criteria described above has been satisfactorily addressed. The purpose of these criteria is
         to ensure that including additional land within the City’s SUDP/SOI will not interfere with the
         timely development of lands that are currently within the City’s growth boundary. Additional
         criteria may be added to this list at the discretion of the City Council.
 1.6.b   Work with Merced County to define a process of dealing with properties proposed for
         development within the City’s Area of Influence prior to being included in the City’s
         SUDP/SOI boundary.
         Although most of the land within the City’s Area of Influence is designated and utilized as
         agricultural land, it is possible that some of that land might be proposed for limited
         development (generally not residential or commercial development) prior to being included in
         the City’s SUDP/SOI boundary. The City will need to work with Merced County to develop
         policies of how to deal with these properties so that limited development could occur without
         conflicting with future City development or encouraging large-scale developments to occur
         outside of the City limits. The types of land uses that will be allowed within these “Reserve”
         areas will also need to be defined. The current City-County Tax Sharing Agreement (adopted
         in 1997) defines these land use policies for those areas within the City’s SUDP/SOI, but
         currently they do not address the Area of Influence.

The Housing Element must be prepared to a
very exact standard to comply with state law
and focuses primarily on identifying a
strategy for meeting the various housing
needs in a community and improving the
quality of the existing housing stock.
Current law calls for the Housing Element to
be updated every 5 to 7 years. The City of
Merced Housing Element (Chapter 9) was
adopted in 2011.
While the Housing Element focuses
primarily on the housing stock in a
community, this section of the Land Use

neighborhoods within which this housing
stock is located or is to be developed.

Changing patterns of ownership in older

become rentals, that can lead to reduced

property values and cause more owners to

3.4.4 RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD GOALS, POLICIES, AND
         ACTIONS
The goals and policies which follow reflect the City of Merced’s desire to maintain and enhance
the quality of the City’s residential neighborhoods.
 Goal Area L-1: Residential & Neighborhood Development
 GOALS
     Housing Opportunities in Balance with Jobs Created in the Merced Urban Area
     A Wide Range of Residential Densities and Housing Types in the City
     Preservation and Enhancement of Existing Neighborhoods
     Quality Residential Environments
     Mixed-use, Transit and Pedestrian-Friendly Residential Environments
     Ensure Adequate Housing is Available to All Segments of the Population
 POLICIES
 L-1.1    Promote balanced development which provides jobs, services and housing.
 L-1.2    Encourage a diversity of building types, ownership, prices, designs, and site plans for
          residential areas throughout the City.
 L-1.3    Encourage a diversity of lot sizes in residential subdivisions.
 L-1.4    Conserve residential areas that are threatened by blighting influences.
 L-1.5    Protect existing neighborhoods from incompatible developments.
 L-1.6    Continue to pursue quality single-family and higher density residential development.
 L-1.7    Encourage the location of multi-family developments on sites with good access to
          transportation, shopping, employment centers, and services.
 L-1.8    Create livable and identifiable residential neighborhoods.
 L-1.9    Ensure connectivity between existing and planned urban areas.
 Policy L-1.1
 Promote Balanced Development Which Provides Jobs, Services and Housing.
 The long term economic vitality of the City is enhanced by maintaining housing opportunities that
 accommodate a diversely skilled labor force. At the same time, residential development must have
 adequate and appropriate services which are accessible. The balance between job growth, housing
 opportunity and services not only supports stable economic growth in Merced, it also reduces vehicle
 trips for work commutes and service, and enhances the overall quality of life for Merced residents.
                                                     3-15

Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
Chapter 3--Land Use
 Implementing Actions:
 1.1.a   Promote mixed use development combining compatible employment, service and
         residential elements.
         Mixed use development plans would typically be proposed in the new growth areas of Merced
         in accordance with the Urban Villages development standards. The City should continue
         reviewing its zoning and development codes in the established areas of the City to determine if
         policies and programs could be proposed which would facilitate the location of appropriate
         employment centers and services, including knowledge-based research and development and
         green industries.
 1.1.b   Periodically review job growth statistics in the Merced urban area compared to new
         residential development.
         The City should continue to maintain and monitor housing cost data for different types of
         housing in the Merced Metropolitan area and for different parts of the City. This data would
         need to be periodically compared to existing employment opportunities to determine if there is
         a reasonable relationship between housing and jobs and determine if increased housing costs
         in a sector or area indicates demand for a particular type of housing. A shortage of available
         housing can lead to lost economic opportunities so that should be monitored as well.
 1.1.c   Determine the types of housing opportunities needed for the type of employment
         opportunities being created in the City.
         The City should periodically review State employment statistics for the Merced Metropolitan
         Area and determine if new housing construction has been occurring in relative balance with
         job growth. Value and type of housing should be somewhat related to the types of jobs being
         created and the needs of a diversely skilled labor force. Over time, if it appears that normal
         market forces are not matching housing growth with employment, the City may need to take
         action to promote the appropriate type of housing development by type and location.
 Policy L-1.2
 Encourage a Diversity of Building Types, Ownership, Prices, Designs, and Site Plans
 For Residential Areas Throughout The City.
 With a diverse population of ages, races, incomes, and lifestyles, Merced’s housing stock must reflect
 that diversity as well.
 Implementing Actions:
 1.2.a   Encourage higher-density residential developments within walking distance (approx. 1/4
         mile) of commercial centers.
         The Urban Villages Concept calls for higher-density residential developments within walking
         distance of village commercial cores. A wide range of densities, including small-lot single-
         family, townhouses, and apartments, can be allowed in these “Village Core Residential” areas
         to achieve an overall average density of at least 10 units per acre. This residential
         development will help ensure greater support for transit and the economic viability of the
         commercial uses. These principles should be applied to most of the City’s new growth areas
         and financial incentives explored for promoting their use.

                                                                         Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
                                                                                     Chapter 3--Land Use
1.2.b Encourage residential and/or office above retail in the downtown area and in
      neighborhood commercial cores.
      The City’s Central Commercial (C-C), Neighborhood Commercial (C-N), and Office
      Commercial (C-O) zones currently allows residential uses as well as commercial uses. Most
      of the zoning downtown is C-C. Traditionally, retail uses outside of the downtown area are in
      single-story buildings. Additional upper floors with residential or office uses should be
      encouraged in order to provide a higher degree of street security at night, concentrated
      pedestrian activity, increased support for transit, and a greater number of lunch-time and after-
      work shoppers.
1.2.c Continue to allow second units in single-family areas.
      The City’s Zoning Ordinance currently allows the second units in single-family areas without
      discretionary review in accordance with State law. Second units which can be rented to
      students and entry-level staff and faculty could provide an important housing resource to the
      UC campus.
1.2.d Encourage duplexes on corner lots in low-density residential areas.
      The City’s Zoning Ordinance currently allows duplexes on corner lots in single-family
      residential areas with a conditional use permit. Such duplexes should be encouraged.
1.2.e Consider density increases for existing residential sites where the necessary conditions
      exist for higher densities.
      Areas where such density increases should be considered would be areas along major transit
      corridors (such as the M Street transitway), areas within walking distance of commercial
      services, and infill sites.
1.2.f Create a new zoning category to correspond with the “Village Core Residential” land use
      category for mixed densities in residential areas within walking distance of neighborhood
      commercial centers.
      The “Village Core Residential” land use category does not have a corresponding zoning
      category. (This category is known simply as “Village Residential” on the Land Use Diagram,
      Figure 3.1.) Residential Planned Development zoning has been used on an interim basis
      (Table 3.2). A new zoning category should be created which would allow a mix of densities
      and housing types (small-lot single-family, townhouses, duplexes, apartments) in order to
      achieve a minimum average density of 10 units per acre.
1.2.g Encourage a diversity of building types, ownership, prices, designs, and site plans for
      residential areas as spelled out in the South Merced Community Plan. These same
      policies should be applied to other Village Residential areas of the City as well.
      The South Merced Community Plan was adopted in 2008 and contains implementing actions
      regarding residential densities and their distribution in various areas throughout the
      Community Plan area. These actions include reserving Village Residential areas for higher
      densities and locating small-lot single family developments in Low Medium Density areas;
      ensuring a mix of higher density housing types, such as town homes, condominiums, and
      apartments in Village Residential areas; and requiring minimum densities of 10-20 units per
      acre in Urban Villages.

 Policy L-1.3.
 Encourage a Diversity Of Lot Sizes In Residential Subdivisions.
 To encourage a wide variety of housing types to meet the City’s diverse housing needs, the City shall
 promote the following implementing actions.
 Implementing Actions:
 1.3.a   Continue the use of Residential Planned Developments to provide for smaller lot sizes in
         single-family developments.
         The City’s Low-Density Residential (R-1) zones currently have 5,000-, 6,000-, 10,000-, and
         20,000-square foot minimum lot sizes. With the use of Residential Planned Developments,
         smaller lot sizes and other options (zero-lot-line, cluster housing, etc.) can be allowed, thus
         offering a variety of housing choices to meet the City’s diverse housing needs.
 1.3.b   Continue to retain large lot parcel zoning (10,000 to 20,000 square feet) along Bear Creek
         and in areas adjacent to the urban fringe.
         Larger residential and estate lots have traditionally been required along Bear Creek Drive to
         preserve its rural and scenic nature. Larger lots and estate lots adjacent to the urban fringe
         provide a good transition from higher urban densities to adjacent agricultural or rural
         residential uses. The City should review its policies and standards to make sure no barriers
         exist to developing larger lots within the City limits to meet market demand.
 1.3.c   Continue to use the “Random-mixed Lot” ordinance (MMC 20.10.065) to allow a mix of
         lot widths and lot sizes in R-1-6 (single-family residential-- 6,000 square-foot minimum
         lot size) zones.
         This ordinance allows a mixture of lot widths ranging from 45 to 65 feet in single-family
         residential areas. The smaller lots are required to be “mixed-in” with the other lot widths with
         no more than two of these lots adjacent to one another. Up to 40 percent of the lots in a
         subdivision may be of this smaller width as long as 25 percent of the remaining lots are at least
         65 feet wide. This allows a greater variety of housing designs while rewarding the developer
         with a small percentage of additional lots.
 Policy L-1.4
 Conserve Residential Areas That Are Threatened by Blighting Influences.
 Many of Merced’s existing residential neighborhoods are threatened by blighting influences.
 Merced’s neighborhoods are the life blood of this community and considerable effort must be made to
 avoid their deterioration.
 Implementing Actions:
 1.4.a   Conduct a study of non-conforming land uses and determine if the land use designations/
         zoning should be changed to conform to the existing use or if changes should be made to
         the Zoning Ordinance restrictions on non-conforming uses.
                                                    3-18

                                                                          Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
                                                                                      Chapter 3--Land Use
        There exist a number of land uses throughout the City which are “non-conforming,” meaning
        that the existing use of the property would not be allowed under the current zoning even
        though the use was allowed under the zoning which was in place when it was built. For
        example, an area which was once residential has been converted to a commercial district.
        Over time, most residences were torn down and replaced with commercial development, but
        some “non-conforming” residences continue to exist.
        Under the provisions of the City’s Zoning Ordinance (MMC 20.60), these non-conforming
        uses may continue to exist, but their survival is not encouraged. This means that they cannot
        be enlarged or extended nor can they be rebuilt if they are substantially destroyed. Non-
        conforming structures often have trouble obtaining insurance and financing because of these
        restrictions, which can lead to blight. For the most part, these non-conforming uses should
        not be encouraged. However, a study of these uses should be conducted to see if there may be
        some existing non-conforming uses which may merit special consideration. This special
        consideration may lead to a change in land use/zoning designation or possible changes to the
        Zoning Ordinance restrictions.
1.4.b   Consider policies and programs to address the current inventory of un-built subdivision
        lots and foreclosed homes
        In 2010, the City of Merced currently has a significant inventory of over 2,500 lots, which are
        within approved subdivisions but have not yet been built on. In addition, the City has
        significant numbers of foreclosed homes. The City should consider developing incentives to
        spur the development of these undeveloped lots, including reduced development fees for “in-
        fill” areas and expedited processing of development applications for construction on “infill”
        lots, in addition to reviewing the City’s current annexation policies to make sure that such “in-
        fill” development is favored over new “Greenfield” development in outlying areas. The City
        should continue to require that developers demonstrate the marketability and fiscal viability of
        their developments in order to assure that necessary City infrastructure can be built and
        maintained over time.
1.4.c   Support Redevelopment efforts to preserve and enhance Downtown residential
        neighborhoods.
        The City’s Redevelopment Agency has invested substantial resources in preserving Downtown
        residential neighborhoods and to bring new residential developments to the Downtown area.
        These projects include the Downtown Lofts project and other prospective projects in the
        Midtown neighborhood. These efforts should be continued.
(Notes: For additional implementing actions, please refer to the Housing Element (Chapter 9)
Policy L-1.5
Protect Existing Neighborhoods From Incompatible Developments.
Merced’s existing neighborhoods should be protected from incompatible commercial and industrial
uses which may cause adverse impacts on the residences.
Implementing Actions:
1.5.a   Continue to use the Interface Overlay Zone regulations for the review of proposed land
        uses adjacent to residential areas.
        The Interface Overlay regulations (MMC 20.52.010) require conditional use permits for
        commercial, and industrial developments directly adjacent to residential uses. The purpose of
                                                   3-19

Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
Chapter 3--Land Use
         the use permit is to ensure that the residential areas are protected from possible negative
         effects such as obtrusive lighting, traffic, noise, loss of privacy, etc., from adjacent higher-
         intensity uses. Expanded setbacks, landscape buffers, height limits, restrictions on lighting
         and access, limited store hours, and other measures can be applied to these developments to
         make them better neighbors.
 1.5.b   Evaluate traffic and circulation generated by large scale development projects and seek
         to limit their impacts on residential areas to the extent feasible without sacrificing the
         need for connectivity between land uses.
         Sometimes residents in adjacent neighborhoods raise concerns over potential negative impacts
         of large projects. Traffic is a particular concern as employees or customers pass through
         neighborhoods. Through the City’s Development Review process, the City should watch for
         circulation patterns which may encourage such pass-through traffic and make alternatives
         available to limit the impacts. Changes to collectors and other streets that may cause existing
         traffic to take new routes should also be monitored. However, the connectivity between
         various land uses is also highly encouraged, so a balance between these two goals needs to be
         achieved.
 1.5.c   Continue to implement City Council Resolution #84-105 establishing policy for zone
         changes in the Central Residential Area of the City (bounded by 18th Street on the south,
         Glen Avenue on the east, and Bear Creek on the north and west).
         ▪    This resolution declares the City’s desire “to protect and preserve the single-family
              character of the City’s Central Residential Area by discouraging any application of a zone
              change which would result in the creation of additional commercial or multi-family
              residential uses within the area unless the applicant establishes, by clear and convincing
              evidence, that the benefits of the rezoning outweigh the perceived detriment to the City.”
         ▪    The following impacts are to be considered criteria for evaluating a zone change request:
              1) negative or economic impacts on existing residential properties;
              2) impacts on the City’s Redevelopment Area goals and objectives;
              3) impacts on the number of owner-occupied dwellings; and
              4) the impact on the availability of affordable single-family housing in the area.
         ▪    The resolution additionally requires that public hearing notices for such zone change
              requests be sent to all property owners within 500 feet of the property instead of the State-
              required 300 feet.
 Policy L-1.6
 Continue to Pursue Quality Single-Family And Higher Density Residential
 Development.
 To ensure the quality of the City’s residential areas, the City shall pursue the following actions:
 Implementing Actions:
 1.6.a   Continue to review proposed subdivision designs to ensure the provision of adequate
         circulation, public improvements, common open space, landscaping, maintenance, etc.
         through the Development Review process.
         Subdivision maps are reviewed by City staff and the Planning Commission prior to approval
         through the public hearing process. The maps are reviewed to ensure that adequate circulation

                                                                                     Chapter 3--Land Use
        (auto, bicycle, and pedestrian), public improvements, open space, landscaping, etc. are
        provided.
1.6.b   Continue to require multi-family projects to comply, at minimum, with the adopted
        standards and design guidelines contained in the "City of Merced Multi-Family Design
        Standards and Guidelines."
        Multi-family projects of three or more units are subject to the City of Merced Multi-Family
        Design Standards and Guidelines (MMC 20.54.290 to 20.54.310). There are different
        standards for planned development projects, non-planned development projects of six or more
        units, and non-planned development projects of three to five units. Standards are set for
        building design, setbacks, signs, mechanical equipment, trash collection areas, fencing,
        landscaping, parking areas, and addressing.
1.6.c   Continue to encourage residential subdivision projects to comply, at minimum, with the
        standards and design guidelines contained in the "City of Merced Small Lot Single
        Family Home Guidelines."
        These Guidelines are intended to guide development on lots in Planned Developments
        designated Village Residential or Low Medium Density.
Policy L-1.7
Encourage the Location of Multi-Family Developments on Sites With Good Access to
Transportation, Shopping, Employment Centers, and Services.
Multi-family developments are crucial to meeting the housing needs of Merced’s growing population.
They need to be located in appropriate areas where services are readily available to serve the needs of
residents in an efficient manner.
Implementing Actions:
1.7.a   Designate areas adjoining arterial streets, major transportation routes and commercial
        areas for multi-family development.
        Through the general plan process, sufficient areas for multi-family residential development
        should be designated. Locations appropriate for such development include areas adjoining
        arterial streets, major transportation routes, and commercial areas. On a yearly basis, the City
        should determine if the inventory of available multi-family property will be sufficient to meet
        the City’s needs. Potential multi-family sites which are too distant from necessary services
        should be discouraged.
1.7.b   Use the Urban Village Concept to promote higher density residential development
        adjacent to commercial services and transit.
        Multi-family development should be located in Village Core Residential areas for ready access
        to commercial services and transit.
                                                   3-21

Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
Chapter 3--Land Use
 Policy L-1.8
 Create Livable and Distinct Residential Neighborhoods.
 Implementing Actions:
 1.8.a   Encourage Neighborhood Watch programs and other neighborhood associations
         throughout the City which facilitate concern for and contact with one's neighbors.
         Continue to promote Neighborhood Watch, and other such programs which lead to increased
         interaction between neighbors.
 1.8.b   Define specific neighborhood boundaries using natural or man-made features, such as
         creeks and roads, or by common community facilities (parks, schools, shopping centers).
         Ethnic and economic boundaries are discouraged.
         As part of a neighborhood planning process, specific neighborhood boundaries may need to be
         determined. These neighborhood boundaries should be based on the above criteria as much as
         possible.
 1.8.c   Develop a neighborhood planning process by which the concerns of specific
         neighborhoods can be addressed through neighborhood plans.
         After adoption of the General Plan, the City should explore various options for creating a
         neighborhood planning process to address the needs of individual neighborhoods. These
         options could include the formation of new neighborhood associations or councils or the use of
         existing community-based associations. These plans should strive for a high-level of public
         participation at the neighborhood level.
 Policy L-1.9
 Ensure Connectivity Between Existing and Planned Urban Areas.
 In order to foster a sense of community among all citizens of Merced, and avoid separate “enclaves”
 within the City, all development should be required to extend access and access to services to
 surrounding existing community areas or vacant land.
 Implementing Actions:
 1.9.a   Ensure multiple points of access for all new development.
         Maximizing access between new development and adjacent existing neighborhoods (or vacant
         land) promotes interaction between residents.
 1.9.b    Discourage large-scale gated developments within Urban Villages and within Central
         Areas of the City.
         Gated developments typically isolate neighborhoods from each other, serve to “balkanize” the
         City, and can actually decrease public safety. Neighborhoods should be connected via public
         streets and residents should be free to travel between neighborhoods freely without having
         large areas of the City gated off from one another. If gated communities were approved in
         more isolated areas along the urban fringe, their streets and other infrastructure should be
         privately owned and maintained and access for emergency services and other City services
         should be maintained.

 needs to be actively involved in recruiting new industries and businesses.
 Implementing Actions:
                                                   3-41

Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
Chapter 3--Land Use
 2.1.a   Designate adequate amounts of commercial and industrial land to serve the City's
         employment needs through 2030 and beyond.
         Based on employment projections and employee per acre ratios, the amount of land needed
         to accommodate commercial, office, and industrial uses can be determined. The General
         Plan Land Use Diagram contains sufficient amounts of appropriately designated land to meet
         these needs. Since these projections will change over time with changing market conditions,
         it will be necessary to update this information on a regular basis in order to ensure that the
         City’s supply of commercial and industrial land remains adequate.
 2.1.b   Maintain an inventory of vacant commercial and industrial land and make this
         inventory available to the public and the development community.
         Several sources for such information currently exist.        The City of Merced Economic
         Development Department maintains such an inventory and other web-based site search
         programs backed by the Geographic Information System (GIS) are available.
 2.1.c   Continue the City's Economic Development activities.
         Work closely with the Small Business Development Center, Chambers of Commerce,
         Merced County Economic Development Corporation, the State of California, the Economic
         Development Advisory Committee, etc. to implement the City’s Economic Development
         Business Plan and any subsequent updates.
 2.1.d   Develop incentives as appropriate to encourage new commercial and industrial
         development.
         Work with agencies involved in economic development activities to develop incentives such
         as those offered through the Enterprise Zone to encourage new commercial and industrial
         development.
 2.1.e   Specifically target South Merced as an area that needs more commercial retail and
         office development.
         South Merced’s large residential population is currently underserved by retail commercial
         and office uses. Except for some scattered convenience commercial uses, this area lacks
         even the most basic services. Because of the low average incomes of this area, it is difficult
         to entice major commercial users to locate in South Merced even though most of the
         available land is located in the Enterprise Zone. The City will need to make considerable
         effort to turn this situation around. The Gateways Redevelopment Area provides some of
         the tools to help this occur. Strategies contained in the South Merced Community Plan
         (2007) and South Merced Strategy (2004) should also be utilized.
         Continue to apply the policies and implementation measures of the South Merced
         Community Plan, notably:
         •   Promote SR 59 south of Childs Avenue as a major auto service/agricultural service
             corridor, but be flexible to allow for neighborhood-serving retail where appropriate;
         •   Maintain industrial land use designations east of the Merced Regional Airport;
         •   Provide commercial and office zoning currently absent in the Community Plan area;
         •   Develop regional-commercial near the Mission Avenue/SR 99 interchange within the
             Community Plan area;
         •   Support Business Park land uses located at the intersection of R Street and Gerard
             Avenue; and,
         •   Develop an urban village on Mission Avenue, east of Tyler Road.

2.1.f   Promote industrial development that offers full-time, non-seasonal employment.
        Merced’s traditionally agriculture-based economy has led to large swings in unemployment
        due to the seasonal nature of agriculture. The City should, therefore, target new industries
        for recruitment purposes who can offer year-round employment.
2.1.g   Maintain a list of target industries for economic development purposes.
        The City’s Economic Development Business Plan outlines target industry sectors for both
        industrial and commercial development. These are intended to be impermanent target
        choices which will be reviewed and modified as economic conditions change by the City’s
        Economic Development Advisory Committee. Choice of target industries does not mean
        that other users are excluded from the community; it only indicates where it is believed
        active development recruitment efforts will be the most effective. Geographic target markets
        are also defined and prioritized for recruiting efforts in the Business Plan.
2.1.h   Evaluate the role of the Merced Regional Airport and the desirability of expanding
        uses in the Airport Industrial Park to further promote tourism uses dependent on
        aviation access.
        The City should promote tourist-related services in the area surrounding the Merced
        Regional Airport to take advantage of Merced’s status as the “Gateway to Yosemite” and
        being the nearest airport to Yosemite with commercial passenger service.
2.1.i   Actively market the benefits of the Merced Regional Enterprise Zone and Recycling
        Enterprise Zone.
        The City of Merced will continue to support local Enterprise Zone activities by marketing its
        benefits to local businesses located within the Enterprise Zone. Seminars and presentations
        will also be conducted on a periodic basis. The City will also highlight the benefits of the
        Enterprise Zone in its marketing brochures and other promotional material.
2.1.j   Create opportunity for small business development, entrepreneurship, innovation,
        technology transfer, and commercialization.
        The City’s Office of Economic Development has programs to encourage small business
        development, entrepreneurship, etc. The creation of a Business Assistance Center to support
        new and existing small businesses is under consideration.
Policy L-2.2
Locate New or Expanded Industrial Parks, Research & Development, Technology,
and Business in Appropriate Areas.
It is important to designate areas for new industrial, research & development, and technology
development ahead of other uses due to the area and access needs of industry as well as the need to
avoid planning for incompatible uses adjacent to industrial areas which might interfere with
continued industrial operations.
Implementing Actions.
2.2.a Industrial and business park areas should be located where they will have good access
        to air transportation, rail transportation, or major highway transportation links.
        Merced’s three existing industrial parks are located where they have good access from air,
        rail, and/or highway transportation. New and expanded industrial areas shown on the Land
        Use Diagram are also located to take advantage of good access. Any future industrial areas
        should follow this criteria.

Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
Chapter 3--Land Use
 2.2.b   Industrial reserve areas should be protected from non-industrial use or premature
         development through agricultural zoning until such time as the land is needed for
         industrial development.
         The City will work closely with the County to assure that industrial reserve areas are
         protected from premature or incompatible development. Generally, areas designated as
         “Industrial Reserve” will be combined with an interim use classification, such as Agriculture
         on the County General Plan, which maintains existing use practices in the area but
         establishes expected future uses based on need. Industrial reserve areas are designated on
         the Land Use Diagram within southwest Merced.
 2.2.c   Parcels of land in industrial reserve areas should remain as large as possible in order
         to accommodate a variety of plant sizes and types in the future.
         Lot splits should be discouraged in industrial reserve areas until such time as they are ready
         for development in order to provide maximum flexibility for future uses. The City will work
         with the County to ensure that industrial reserve areas are zoned for the appropriate
         Agriculture Zones which require 20-acre or 40-acre minimum parcel sizes.
 2.2.d   Develop an action program which outlines priorities for annexing new industrial and
         commercial areas and includes plans for providing services and infrastructure to these
         future industrial/commercial areas.
         With the advice of the Economic Development Advisory Committee and the Planning
         Commission, the City should establish an action program for annexing new industrial and
         commercial areas which would include plans for providing infrastructure. Since it takes
         time to bring industrial sites “on-line”, it is imperative that this be done in a timely manner.
         Special attention should be given to areas within the northeastern portion of the City as job
         centers for businesses seeking a location near UC Merced.
 Policy L-2.3
 Promote the Retention and Expansion of Existing Industrial and Commercial
 Businesses.
 In order to maintain the City’s economic base, it’s not enough to attract new businesses. Existing
 businesses, if taken for granted, can leave the area, go out of business, or stop growing. By
 reaching out to existing businesses, the City can make sure that their current and future needs are
 being met as well as promote their expansion.
 Implementing Actions:
 2.3.a   Protect industrial areas from encroachment by non-industrially-related uses and from
         incompatible uses within the industrial zones themselves.
         Designate buffer areas (which may include open space areas, business parks, commercial
         development, and/or heavily-landscaped roadways or parkways) between industrial and
         residential uses. Guidelines should be established for these buffer areas to address their
         minimum size, development standards, etc. Often incompatible uses, such as schools,
         churches, etc, which create conflicts with industrial uses, would like to locate in industrial
         zones. These uses should be strongly discouraged in order to protect the economic viability
         of the industrial areas.

2.3.b   Continue to improve the permit approval process to ensure that industrial
        development projects are approved in a timely manner.
        The Development Services Department has made considerable effort to streamline the
        permit approval process for residential, commercial, and industrial projects. These efforts
        are expected to continue on an ongoing basis. The development of design guidelines for
        commercial and industrial projects could be developed to make the City’s expectations
        clearer.
2.3.c   Maintain a business outreach program to ensure that the needs of existing businesses
        are being met.
        The City’s Office of Economic Development along with the Economic Development
        Advisory Committee and the Small Business Development Center, participate in various
        programs which contact local businesses regarding retention and expansion opportunities.
2.3.d   Review and update as necessary the City’s Zoning and Sign Ordinances in order to
        streamline and make the development process more business-friendly and
        understandable.
        The City’s Zoning Ordinance, adopted in the 1960’s, has only been periodically updated
        over the years and has never been comprehensively updated. The City’s sign ordinances,
        adopted in the 1970’s, is also in need of a comprehensive update (refer to Policy UD-2.2.j).
        Neither ordinance addresses “modern” concepts (i.e. mixed-use zoning, signs that use LED
        technology, etc.), and there is much interpretation by City staff involved for land uses that
        are not specifically described in the ordinance because they did not exist at the time the
        ordinance was written (i.e. dialysis centers, internet cafes, etc.) A comprehensive update of
        both the Zoning and Sign Ordinances are needed to make them more user-friendly and easier
        to understand for City residents and prospective and existing businesses. Many cities have
        found form-based zoning codes to better meet the needs of their communities and the City
        will consider implementing such a form-based zoning code as part of this Update process.
Policy L-2.4
Provide a Range of Services Adjacent to And Within Industrial Areas to Reduce
Auto Trips.
By providing services adjacent to or within industrial areas so that employees do not have to leave
the area to eat lunch or run errands, the number of noon hour auto trips may be reduced.
Implementing Actions:
2.4.a   Establish a new zoning designation called "business park" which would allow a mix of
        heavy commercial, "back office," and light industrial uses.
        The Merced Vision 2015 General Plan introduced a new land use designation, “Business
        Park.” Planned Development zoning has been used on an interim basis, but a “business
        park” zone should be established which would allow a mix of heavy commercial, “back
        office,” and light industrial uses. By allowing this mix of uses, the number of auto trips may
        be reduced within these areas.
                                                   3-45

Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
Chapter 3--Land Use
 2.4.b   Continue to allow services, such as restaurants and other retail commercial uses which
         mainly serve industrial employees, to locate in industrial zones as discretionary uses.
         The City’s Light Industrial Zone allows restaurants which serve employees and are located
         in main buildings as accessory uses. Retail commercial uses which are deemed appropriate
         by the Planning Commission are allowed as conditional uses.
 2.4.c   Consideration should be given to provide attractive, efficient, and affordable means of
         mass transit between industrial areas and residential areas of the City.
         Transit routes should serve industrial areas so that employees can reach their jobs by means
         other than the private automobile. The location of industrial areas and other major
         employment centers will be considered as transit routes are established.
 2.4.d   Consideration should be given to making changes to the Zoning Ordinance which allow
         for some commercial and service activities in and/or convenient to industrial areas.
         Because of increasing air quality and traffic concerns, it is becoming desirable to provide
         commercial and service activities convenient to industrial activities for easier accessibility
         by industrial employees. If restaurants, health clubs, daycare centers, auto services, some
         offices, and limited retail activities that draw primarily from industrial areas could be located
         convenient to such zones, it could have substantial traffic and air quality benefits to the
         community as well as making it easier for industrial employees to conduct business, run
         errands, etc. without having to drive across town.
         The City currently does not encourage or even allow in some cases these kinds of uses.
         Changes to the Zoning Ordinance will be necessary to achieve this objective.
 Policy L-2.5
 Maintain Attractive Industrial and Business Park Areas.
 For the purpose of recruiting new businesses and retaining existing businesses and for overall City
 image and appearance, attractive industrial areas should be maintained.
 Implementing Actions:
 2.5.a   Continue to require Site Plan Review of new industrial development and the
         application of standards regarding landscaping, appearance, circulation, access, and
         parking.      However, consider developing performance standards for industrial
         development to replace the Site Plan process in the future.
         The City currently requires Site Plan Review for new industrial development and the
         expansion of existing industries. This staff-level review applies consistent standards
         regarding landscaping, access, etc. to ensure that industrial areas are developed in an
         attractive manner while still recognizing that industrial development standards need to be
         flexible to balance aesthetic needs with operational practices. The emphasis should be
         placed on maintaining an attractive appearance along the perimeter of industrial areas where
         they are visible to other land uses and the public. The City will consider developing
         performance standards for industrial development in place of the Site Plan Review process
         in order to streamline the process for locating new businesses in Merced, while still
         addressing potential environmental and aesthetic impacts of new industrial development.

                                                                         Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
                                                                                     Chapter 3--Land Use
2.5.b   Consider requiring the planting of parking lot trees in industrial areas, perhaps at a
        reduced standard instead of the one tree for each six parking spaces required in other
        areas, to provide shade, reduce glare, and reduce reflective heat.
        Residential and commercial development throughout the City is required to provide one tree
        for each six parking spaces in parking lots to provide shade, reduce glare and reflective heat,
        and to promote a more attractive appearance. Industrial areas are not required to do the
        same even though they often have large expansions of asphalt which would benefit from the
        introduction of trees. The City should consider requiring the planting of parking lot trees in
        industrial areas but at a reduced rate so as not to create an undue burden on industrial
        development.
2.5.c   Require the removal or screening of all rubbish, abandoned buildings, processing
        wastes, old equipment, or other forms of blight in industrial areas.
        Through the Site Plan Review process, the City requires the screening of unsightly areas
        from view from the public streets.
2.5.d   Investigate the possibility of regulating industrial development on the basis of or in
        combination with performance standards instead of strictly by definition of specific
        allowable uses as in the Zoning Ordinance.
        Performance standards, if they can be made applicable, have the capability of translating the
        classified industrial categories (light and heavy industrial) into a well-defined and
        meaningful system for identifying possible impacts of different industrial uses. Under such
        a system, industrial land uses can be located and administered in a more effective and
        flexible manner.
2.5.e   Require high quality architectural, site (signs, lights, walls, etc.), and landscape designs
        for industrial developments that abut Highway 99.
        As the City grows to the west and southeast along State Route 99, current and future
        industrial and business park uses need to be constructed to a high standard in order to
        enhance the visual quality of these areas.
Policy L-2.6
Provide Neighborhood Commercial Centers In Proportion to Residential
Development in the City.
Residents of the City should have ready access to commercial services in close proximity to their
homes for convenience and to eliminate the need for excessive automobile trips. Neighborhood
centers with grocery, pharmacy, and other stores which serve the needs of surrounding residents
should be distributed throughout the City to serve most residential areas.
Implementing Actions:
2.6.a   Neighborhood commercial centers should be located approximately one mile apart
        along major arterial streets adjacent to residential areas throughout the City.
        A one-mile radius is the standard service area for neighborhood commercial centers.
        Therefore, in order to ensure that most residents in Merced have ready access to commercial
        services, neighborhood commercial centers should be located at regular intervals
        (approximately one for each square mile of residential development) along major streets
        within the SUDP/SOI.        The Land Use Diagram attempts to meet this standard, but
        additional sites may need to be designated in the future.

Chapter 3--Land Use
 2.6.b   Special emphasis should be placed on encouraging the development of neighborhood
         commercial center(s) in the general vicinity of the South Highway 59 corridor to serve
         the needs of South Merced residents.
         The South Merced area is currently underserved by commercial services. Many South
         Merced residents need to travel to Central and North Merced for even their basic shopping
         needs because of the lack of neighborhood commercial services in South Merced. Although
         several areas have been designated for such development, little actual development has taken
         place thus far. (New commercial developments, including the Rancho San Miguel, have
         developed along Highway 140 and Childs Avenue in Southeast Merced and significant
         development interest has been shown in several South Merced commercial sites in recent
         years.) The City will continue to explore alternatives for encouraging more neighborhood
         commercial services in the area.
         Continue to apply the policies and implementation measures of the South Merced
         Community Plan, notably, Policy CE 1.2, which states: “While it is important to promote SR
         59 south of Childs Avenue as a major auto service/agricultural service corridor, be flexible
         to allow for neighborhood-serving retail, and where feasible, require such development to be
         consistent with urban village design principles.”
 2.6.c   Efforts should be made to encourage the development of a neighborhood commercial
         center in the area east of G Street between Yosemite Avenue and North Bear Creek
         Drive.
         This nearly 2-mile-square-mile area is almost entirely built-out with single-family
         development, with some scattered duplex development. The only commercial services in the
         area are located along the far edge of this area, G Street, leaving those residents who live on
         the eastern edges (Parsons and McKee) over one mile or more from commercial services.
         There are very few vacant sites left in this area which would be suitable for commercial
         development. Additionally, residents may be concerned about the impacts of commercial
         uses on their neighborhoods. Efforts should be made, perhaps through a neighborhood
         planning process, to determine if there is a suitable commercial site in the area which would
         be supported by neighborhood residents.
 Policy L-2.7
 Locate and Design New Commercial Developments To Provide Good Access from
 Adjacent Neighborhoods and Reduce Congestion on Major Streets.
 Neighborhood, Regional, and Community Commercial areas throughout the City serve many
 adjacent neighborhoods. Their locations along major arterials also offer these commercial areas
 good visibility from passing motorists, which allows them to serve more than just their immediate
 neighbors. Sometimes, however, this leads to the reduced efficiency of these arterials if commercial
 driveways are allowed to proliferate in areas near major intersections. These problems can be
 minimized if commercial developments are located and designed carefully.

                                                                                      Chapter 3--Land Use
2.7.a New retail commercial designations shall be located along arterials at their
      intersections with collector streets (at 1/4 mile or 1/2 mile locations) in new growth
      areas. These commercial areas should not be located at the intersections of two
      arterials, except under very unique circumstances.
      Locating commercial developments at the corners of two major streets is fairly common
      practice in cities throughout the country.          However, these locations, while offering
      maximum visibility to drive-by traffic, often lead to access and circulation problems.
      Commercial developments tend to develop on all four corners of an arterial intersection
      because once the decision is allowed to zone one corner for commercial development, it is
      very difficult to turn down requests for commercial development on the other corners.
      Conflicts often arise between slower motorists entering or leaving these commercial areas
      and motorists using the arterials for higher speed cross-town trips. These conflicts not only
      decrease the efficiency of the intersection over time (the number of vehicles able to pass
      through the intersection within a certain period), but can lead to increasingly difficult access
      to and from these centers by customers. Locations away from these major intersections but
      still along arterials at collector street intersections offer the combined benefits of high
      visibility and easier access for both drive-by traffic and for adjacent residential areas.
      On the Land Use Diagram, new Urban Village commercial centers are located along major
      streets at their intersections with collector streets at the 1/2 mile point on a mile grid of
      major arterials. Traffic signals will likely be required at these intersections, providing a full
      range of turning movements into the shopping areas. Several examples of such
      developments already exist (Merced Market Place, Olivewood Center, Bear Creek Plaza,
      etc.).
      Although the City believes that new commercial centers should not ideally be located at the
      corner of two arterials, the City will consider extremely limited exceptions for large-scale
      (minimum of 20 acres), high-quality projects which agree to abide by strict access and land
      use restrictions in proximity to the intersection (i.e. no freestanding pads with multiple curb
      cuts and no driveway cuts on arterials—only on internal streets), provide internal access and
      strong connectivity from the adjacent neighborhood, provide a mix of uses and residential
      densities throughout the project, provide good transit and pedestrian access, provide high-
      quality architecture, landscaping, site design, and signage, and provide significant public
      improvements. Such exceptions would need to be negotiated as part of a development
      agreement and through the use of Planned Development Zoning.
2.7.b Commercial centers shall be designed to provide direct vehicular and pedestrian access
      from surrounding neighborhoods. In no case shall trips which could be internal (from
      adjacent neighborhood to center) be forced onto an arterial.
      Commercial centers should allow vehicular and pedestrian access from adjacent
      neighborhoods through the use of internal street access, driveways off of residential streets,
      and pedestrian paths.
2.7.c The number of commercial driveways on arterials shall be minimized and located in
      areas where they will cause minimal conflicts with traffic flow on major streets and
      through intersections.
      Commercial driveways should be kept to a minimum on major streets and located in areas
      away from intersections where they can cause conflicts with intersection turning movements,
      traffic flow, and signal loop/detection areas. When possible, they should be placed adjacent
      to whichever property lines are the farthest distance from the intersection.

Chapter 3--Land Use
 2.7.d   Cross-access and shared driveways between adjacent commercial uses shall be
         provided as much as feasible.
         Adjacent commercial uses should allow access between them without customer traffic
         having to go back out onto the public streets to travel between uses. Driveways off major
         streets should be shared as much as feasible between adjacent businesses to minimize the
         number required on major streets. This should be applied to all new development as much
         as feasible and to existing development whenever possible.
 2.7.e   Commercial developments shall be designed to encourage pedestrian, bicycle, and
         transit access.
         Sidewalks, pedestrian accessways, bike racks and/or lockers, on-site transit stops, and transit
         shelters are among the design features that can be used in commercial areas to encourage
         alternative modes of access for their customers.
 2.7.f   Continue to implement City Council Resolution #93-10 establishing policy for the
         location of retail and service related uses in North Merced.
         This resolution states that “the City desires to establish a policy which balances the need for
         commercial growth with the need to preserve the capacity of arterial streets and achieve
         long-standing planning objectives.” The resolution sets forth the following guidelines for
         the location of retail and service-related uses in North Merced (north of Bear Creek):
         1) “Freestanding retail and service-related uses on arterial streets in North Merced are
              discouraged in order to minimize the number of driveways and to better control location
              of driveways in relation to signalized intersections, with the objective of improving
              safety and not reducing capacity.”
         2) “Clustering of retail and service-related uses in shopping centers is encouraged for
              convenient pedestrian circulation, simpler internal circulation, and as a contribution to
              energy-efficient circulation and improved air quality (less start-and-stop car hopping).”
         3) “Freestanding retail and service commercial land uses in North Merced should be
              located either: a) inside shopping centers (subject to the provisions below); or b) outside
              shopping centers if limited to professional offices, financial institutions, and
              restaurants.”
         4) “Freestanding uses in shopping centers and sites which can be integrated with shopping
              centers are appropriate locations for offices and financial uses, restaurants, auto-oriented
              uses such as service stations and fast-food restaurants, and retail and service commercial
              uses providing these uses are consistent with the General Plan and Site Utilization Plan
              or zoning district.”
         5) “Uses on freestanding pads should: a) be compatible and consistent in design, materials,
              and colors with the main building complex; b) have circulation and access consistent
              with the Site Utilization Plan (SUP) if located in a Planned Development; and c) share
              common driveways with no new driveways on arterial streets.”
 2.7.g   Locate commercial nodes in new growth areas to avoid the aesthetic and circulation
         issues associated with “strip commercial” development through the implementation of
         the policies of the Urban Design chapter (Chapter 6), particularly the Core
         Commercial principles.
         In order to ensure high-quality commercial developments and to avoid typical “strip
         commercial” development, the policies and guidelines in the Urban Design chapter should
         be implemented for new developments. The City’s Zoning Ordinance should be updated and
         revised to implement these principles.

Policy L-2.8
Encourage a Mixture of Uses And Activities That Will Maintain the Vitality of the
Downtown Area.
In 2007, the Downtown Strategy Task Force (a 20-member group representing a broad range of
community interests) was formed to develop a consensus on the proper direction for Downtown.
They developed the following strategies for achieving the goal of maintaining Downtown as the
City’s center of cultural and civic activity, finance, and government.
Implementing Actions:
2.8.a   Solidify Downtown’s role as the arts, entertainment and dining destination.
        Strategies for achieving this include encouraging the creation of a strong Arts and
        Entertainment Committee, developing a program to increase the amount of public art
        throughout Downtown, and recruiting fine dining, clubs, and outdoor dining.
2.8.b   Retain all existing and attract new financial service businesses, office uses, and
        government-related offices in Downtown Merced.
        The identification of sites for additional financial activities and the recruitment of new
        institutions (especially back office functions, data centers, and regional headquarters) is a
        top priority. Existing City and County government offices should be encouraged to remain
        Downtown and new government-related offices should be encouraged to locate in the
        Downtown.
2.8.c   Ensure that the Downtown is connected to the rest of the City through improved bus
        service, better bicycle/ pedestrian connections, and enhanced connections between
        Downtown and Merced College and the UC campus.
        Attempts will be made to create unified store hours, recruit restaurants and apparel retailers,
        intensify the downtown promotion program, and cluster retail uses in a more compact area of
        downtown (generally bounded by 19th Street, O Street, the Southern Pacific railroad tracks,
        and Martin Luther King Jr. Way).
2.8.d   Create exceptional Downtown residential neighborhoods.
        Efforts will be made to develop policies to encourage Downtown housing development,
        developing the Mid-Town neighborhood as a premiere residential district with historic
        character, and to build additional housing units throughout the Downtown.
2.8.e   Develop more office space Downtown through renovation and new construction
        The City will attempt to create more office space Downtown for all types of businesses and
        services concentrated near the retail core. Renovation of upper floors of existing buildings
        for office use will also be encouraged and a business recruitment program to attract new
        Downtown businesses will be considered.
2.8.f   Strengthen transportation systems to support Downtown’s economic base
        Creation of an internal Downtown transit system, improvements to the City transit system,
        and expansion of Downtown arterial street capacity would be sought.
2.8.g   Encourage Downtown educational and training facilities and activities
        Strategies included the development of a consolidated education center (including Merced
        College, satellite locations for higher education, and adult education and training), which has
        been completed, and a Downtown day care center, which has yet to be developed.

Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
Chapter 3--Land Use
 2.8.h   Continue to use Redevelopment funds to upgrade Downtown's appearance and
         infrastructure, to develop new public projects to implement the Downtown Strategy, to
         assist in the development and financing of private projects, and to market the
         Downtown area.
         The Merced Redevelopment Agency has been used for all these purposes in the past and
         should continue to pursue these goals. Focus redevelopment resources on key properties
         identified in the 2007 Downtown Strategy.
 2.8.i   Create a superior ambiance and build a distinguished Downtown.
         Efforts identified in the 2007 Downtown Strategy to achieve this goal include enhancing the
         pedestrian environment, enhancing lighting, increasing open space, creating gateway
         monuments, establishing a commercial recruitment program, addressing Downtown parking
         needs, encouraging outdoor dining, and creating a significant City Center anchor to
         complement the Mainplace Theater.
 Policy L-2.9
 Identify Locations and Develop Standards for Campus-type Research and
 Development Parks.
 With the location of the UC Merced Campus by Lake Yosemite, there is a need to designate future
 sites near the Campus for research and development parks. One of the economic benefits of having
 a major research university is the “spin-off” businesses that develop from the research conducted by
 professors and students at the University.
 Implementing Actions:
 2.9.a   Plan for job centers in the northeastern portion of the City capitalizing on the
         proximity to a research university, UC Merced.
         As part of the development of the northeastern area, research and development campuses
         should be encouraged. The size and precise location would need to be determined through a
         market/economic study. However, as with retail commercial uses, research and development
         parks should be focused at the ¼ or ½ mile transit nodes along the arterials to avoid traffic
         congestion at the intersection of two arterials. Business parks to accommodate research and
         development, technology, light industry, and business uses complimentary of the UC Merced
         Campus research could also be located on appropriately-designated properties along the
         Bellevue Corridor and other transportation corridors in the vicinity of the UC Merced
         Campus if the market exists for such uses.
 2.9.b. Develop zoning and development standards for campus-type research and development
         parks.
         The City’s Zoning Ordinance does not currently contain zoning standards for campus-type
         research and development parks. Such standards will need to define permitted and
         conditionally permitted uses, taking into account desired uses in such districts, which might
         include restaurants and hotels to serve the employees and clientele; setbacks, building
         heights, etc.

Policy L-2.10
Encourage Well-Planned Freeway-Oriented Developments
With new regional commercial centers proposed along Highway 99, the City has a significant
interest in making sure these are high-quality developments since they are often the first or only
impression that highway travelers receive of the City.
Implementing Actions:
2.10.a Implement the following policy per City Council Resolution #2007-89 regarding
         Freeway-Oriented Commercial Developments”:
         The Resolution, which deals with other policies regarding commercial development, reads,
         in part, as follows:
         (1) The City acknowledges     the substantial public investment in the new Mission/Highway
             99 Interchange and the    proposed Campus Parkway and needed for other Highway 99
             connections in Merced.     As required by the California Environmental Quality Act and
             the General Plan, the      City intends to review potential traffic impacts and other
             connecting streets in a   careful manner before making any land use decisions in the
             freeway corridor; and,
          (2) Consistent with General Plan Policy UE 1.3, Ensure that the sequencing of freeway
             commercial development shall be done so in an orderly manner based upon access to
             public services and facilities.
2.10.b Review and update the Zoning and Sign Ordinances as necessary to ensure quality
         freeway-oriented development.
         In order to ensure that new freeway-oriented developments are built to high standards, the
         City should review and update the Zoning and Sign Ordinances as necessary to address
         architectural design, landscaping, pedestrian/bicycle/transit access, signage, etc., for such
         developments. Of particular note would be the possible use of “regional” freeway-oriented
         signs to consolidate signage for multiple parcels on one or two high-quality signs.

3.6.3 URBAN GROWTH AND DESIGN GOALS, POLICIES, AND
        ACTIONS
 Goal Area L-3: Urban Growth and Design
 GOALS
     Living Environments which Encourage People to Use a Variety of Transportation
      Alternatives
     A Compact Urban Village Design for New Growth Areas
     Self-sustaining, Mixed-Use, Pedestrian-Friendly Neighborhoods
     Transit-Oriented Development Adjacent to the High Speed Rail Station
 POLICIES
 L-3.1   Create land use patterns that will encourage people to walk, bicycle, or use public transit for
         an increased number of their daily trips.
 L-3.2   Encourage infill development and a compact urban form.
 L-3.3   Promote site designs that encourage walking, cycling, and transit use.
 L-3.4   Build identity, character, and enhanced community design in the South Merced Community
         Plan area.
 L-3.5   Develop a Transit-Oriented Development Overlay Zone adjacent to the planned High Speed
         Rail Station in Downtown Merced
 L-3.6   Require community plans for large new development areas within the City’s SUDP/SOI prior
         to development.
 L-3.7   Implement policies and principles to conform to the intent of the San Joaquin Valley Regional
         Blueprint.
 Policy L-3.1
 Create Land Use Patterns That Will Encourage People to Walk, Bicycle, or Use
 Public Transit For an Increased Number of Their Daily Trips.
 Existing land use patterns in some of the City of Merced, like many other urban areas in the San
 Joaquin Valley, are not conducive to walking, cycling, and transit use. Many office developments
 have low employment densities and are often isolated from commercial services, forcing people to
 drive to eat lunch or to complete errands. High-density residential projects often have little if any
 commercial development nearby or discourage pedestrian access to commercial uses with block walls
 and large parking lots. The most common single family lot size of 6,000 to 10,000 square feet leads to
 population densities too low to support frequent and direct transit service. The predominant suburban
 development patterns force all local trips for shopping, recreation, school, as well as commute trips
 onto the arterial street system. This leads to ever wider, more congested arterial streets which in turn
 discourage people from walking or cycling to even nearby destinations.
 Implementing Actions:
 3.1.a   Encourage pedestrian or transit-friendly designs at suitable locations.
         Most of the new growth areas in North and South Merced would be appropriate for pedestrian-
         and transit-friendly developments. Encourage the preparation of a specific or community plan

Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
Chapter 3--Land Use
         for large scale new development which incorporates the goals and policies of the City’s Urban
         Design Chapter.
 3.1.b   Work to preserve and enhance existing neighborhoods and commercial districts which
         have transit and pedestrian-friendly designs and protect them from development that is
         incompatible in design, scale, or use.
         Pursue redevelopment projects to improve the image of pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods and
         shopping districts (pedestrian amenities, street trees, transit facilities, etc.). The City will need
         to make sure that existing pedestrian-friendly projects are not compromised by allowing
         developments within them or adjacent to them that do not fulfill the same principles.
 3.1.c   Plan areas for higher density development within 1/4 mile of locations identified as
         transit hubs and commercial centers.
         Review and revise as necessary the City’s development and the Zoning Ordinance standards
         and maps designating high-density land uses in areas planned for transit hubs and commercial
         centers.
 3.1.d   Encourage higher housing densities in areas served by the full range of urban services.
         •    Encourage high and medium-density housing at sites within walking distance of transit and
              neighborhood commercial services during general plan updates and developer initiated
              general plan amendments.
         •    Consider higher housing densities for areas around existing and planned transit hubs.
         •    Encourage developers to take advantage of density bonus provisions of the Zoning
              Ordinance for projects located around transit hubs on existing or planned transit corridors.
 3.1.e   Encourage mixed-use developments that provide commercial services such as day care
         centers, restaurants, banks, and stores near employment centers.
         Establish mixed-use zone district standards. Tailor the allowed uses to those best suited for a
         pedestrian environment.
 3.1.f   Work closely with school districts to help them choose school site locations that allow
         students to safely walk or bicycle from their homes.
         When specific plans or subdivisions propose school sites for dedication, accept sites that
         emphasize the ability of students to safely walk or bicycle to school. Incorporate school sites
         into larger neighborhood activity centers where practical; this concept could include parks, day
         care facilities, and neighborhood commercial uses. Schools will be encouraged to locate
         adjacent to Village Core Residential Areas.
 3.1.g   Encourage regional shopping malls/centers at sites capable of support by a full range of
         transportation options.
         Identify sites with access by freeway or major arterial and public transit. The site could be a
         regional transit hub and major pedestrian-oriented activity center to increase transit mode
         share.
 3.1.h   Consider air quality and mobility when reviewing any proposed change to the land use
         pattern of this community.
         This step is part of the CEQA process established by the City of Merced in reviewing
         development applications.

Policy L-3.2
Encourage Infill Development and a Compact Urban Form.
Sprawling, low-density and discontiguous development discourages the use of alternative
transportation modes and increases travel distances. Infrastructure costs and most environmental
impacts are less when development is more compact.
Implementing Actions:
3.2.a   Encourage infill of vacant parcels.
        •    Conduct a survey of vacant lands through the Geographic Information System (GIS).
             Develop strategies and incentives for encouraging their development with appropriate
             uses, including expedited processing and reduced fees.
        •    Encourage infill projects that are determined to be compatible with existing development.
        •    Encourage growth to occur in and around activity centers, transportation nodes,
             underutilized infrastructure systems, and redevelopment areas.
        •    Work with land owners to re-designate vacant lands suitable for higher densities or for
             transit/pedestrian-oriented developments during general plan updates and periodic
             reviews.
3.2.b   Encourage infill and redevelopment projects within the urban area that could enhance
        the effectiveness of the transit system.
        •    Encourage projects that increase pedestrian activity and mixed-uses.
        •    Encourage commercial uses that are complementary to urban employment centers.
        •    Strategically locate high-density development to provide good transit access.
(Notes: Please refer to the Urban Expansion Chapter for policies relating to keeping a compact urban
form while promoting urban expansion.)
Policy L-3.3
Promote Site Designs That Encourage Walking, Cycling, and Transit Use.
Most developments are designed to provide the most direct and convenient access by car at the
exclusion of other modes of transportation. It is possible to design sites in ways that encourage less
polluting transportation modes and still support access by motor vehicle.
Implementing Actions:
3.3.a   Encourage project designs which increase the convenience, safety and comfort of people
        using transit, walking or cycling.
        Review the City’s Zoning Ordinance for possible amendment to include air quality design
        standards. Design standards must be general enough to apply under all but the most unusual
        circumstances to avoid the need for numerous zone variances and modifications. Some design
        measures like sidewalk widths and landscaping requirements are very appropriate for design
        standards. Design measures dealing with parking lot designs and building facades may be
        better left as guidelines because of site to site differences.
                                                    3-59

Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
Chapter 3--Land Use
 3.3.b   Encourage all subdivision street and lot designs, commercial site plans, and multi-family
         site plans to improve access by transit, bicycle, and walking.
         Review the City’s development review procedures and modify, as appropriate, to include
         policies that accommodate access and internal circulation by alternative transportation modes.
         Develop design guidelines that illustrate preferred designs.
         Just a few examples of design measures that could be recommended during design review
         include:
         •    Direct access to commercial centers from surrounding neighborhoods.
         •    Intra-development designs that incorporate integrated street patterns rather than designs
              which limit ingress and egress options to the development and restricts traffic to a limited
              number of arterials.
         •    Primary ground floor commercial building entrances should orient to plazas, parks, or
              pedestrian-oriented streets, not to interior blocks or parking lots as feasible.
         •    Promote the use of trees and plants in travelway landscaping and residences.
         •    Building facades should be varied and articulated to provide visual interest to pedestrians.
         •    Street trees should be placed in planter strips or tree wells. Tree species should be
              selected to create a unified image for the street and provide an effective canopy.
         •    Sidewalks should provide an unobstructed path. Larger sidewalk dimensions are desirable
              in commercial areas where pedestrian activity will be greatest.
         •    Encourage the use of front porches, bay window, and balconies which face onto the street
              to increase social interaction and provide heightened security for residential streets.
         •    Identify locations suitable for street furniture, and encourage its use.
 3.3.c   Encourage all development projects proposed within 2,000 feet of an existing or planned
         light rail transit, commuter rail, express bus or transit corridor stop, to incorporate site
         design measures that improve accessibility to the transit system.
         Analyze existing land use patterns and constraints around transit facilities to identify
         appropriate design measures
 Policy L-3.4
 Build Identity, Character, and Enhanced Community Design in the South Merced
 Community Plan area.
 The South Merced Community Plan, adopted in 2008, outlines strategies for building community
 character in the South Merced area.
 Implementing Actions:
 3.4.a   Create and enforce codes that will foster the development of an aesthetic environment
         and beautify and enhance the design of “Gateway” roads.
         Strategies discussed in the South Merced Community Plan include development of a new
         South Merced sign code; promoting Planned Development zoning with an emphasis on solar-
         orientation, open space, affordable housing, and architecture; increased Code Enforcement;
         improving the image of the Fairgrounds; and requiring high-quality designs for developments
         along Highway 99.

3.4.b  Beautify and enhance the design of Gateway roads in the South Merced Community Plan
       area.
       This would involve requiring design treatments to enhance the aesthetic quality along Childs
       Avenue, Mission Avenue, Tyler Road, and South Highway 59. Encouraging businesses to
       make façade and landscaping improvements, installing landscape medians, and establishing
       design guidelines would be among the strategies considered.
3.4.c  Utilize the City’s Urban Village Concept, policies, and designs guidelines for
       development in the South Merced Community Plan area.
       This would include the development of an urban village on Mission Avenue, east of Tyler
       Road, and promoting neighborhood-serving retail along the South Highway 59 in addition to
       the major auto services and agricultural services already developed.
Policy L-3.5
Develop a Transit-Oriented Development Overlay Zone Adjacent to the Planned
High Speed Rail Station in Downtown Merced
Implementing Actions
3.5.a  Develop a “Transit-Oriented Development” Overlay Zone for the area adjacent to the
       planned High Speed Rail Station in Downtown Merced.
       The California High Speed Rail project will provide passenger service from Los Angeles to
       San Francisco at speeds which would rival air service. A proposed High Speed Rail Station is
       planned for Downtown Merced, which will serve as a major transition point between different
       legs of the High Speed Rail service--The Merced-Bakersfield segment, the Merced-San Jose
       segment, and the future Merced-Sacramento segment. Although the precise location has yet to
       be determined, several options are under consideration for this multi-modal transit facility.
       Once the Station location is selected, the City will need to develop a “Transit-Oriented
       Development” overlay zone in order to take advantage of this opportunity to enhance and
       improve the Downtown area. Within this Overlay Zone, several concepts would need to be
       considered, including mixed-use development, increased residential and commercial densities,
       reduced parking requirements and managed parking strategies, an emphasis on
       pedestrian/bicycle/transit access, increased entertainment, retail, dining, hotels, research, and
       office facilities, and others. Some of the same principles and policies contained in the City’s
       Urban Village model (Chapter 6) may be utilized in the proposed “Transit-Oriented
       Development” overlay zone for the High Speed Rail Station, but a denser urban model would
       be needed to take advantage of the proposed ridership of the High Speed Rail.
3.5.b  Review and update as necessary the Downtown Strategy, Economic Development
       Strategy, and other planning documents after the selection of the High Speed Rail station
       location to reflect the City’s development goals adjacent to this important facility.
       Once a station location has been selected, the City will need to review and update as necessary
       its relevant planning documents in order to make sure that this important facility is taken into
       account into development and redevelopment efforts.
                                                 3-61

Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
Chapter 3--Land Use
 3.5.c    Consider changes to the City’s Urban Village Concept in order to better reflect its status
          as “Transit-Ready Development” instead of “Transit-Oriented Development.”
          Although the City’s Urban Village Concept has been described as “Transit-Oriented
          Development,” a more accurate description would be “Transit-Ready Development” since the
          necessary transit system to serve these developments is not yet in place. The City’s mixed-use
          Urban Villages are proposed at residential densities (a minimum of 10 du/ac) that would
          support an express bus system, but would not support a light rail system or the proposed High
          Speed Rail (see L-3.5.a above). The City’s Urban Village Concept policies and principles
          should be reviewed to make sure that they reflect realistic goals for future transit facilities.
 Policy L-3.6
 Require Community Plans for Large New Development Areas within the City’s
 SUDP/SOI Prior to Development.
 The Community Plan process is envisioned as an important implementation tool in the Merced Vision
 2030 General Plan for large-scale new developments. It is important to note, however, that it is
 intended to be a flexible tool that accomplishes a definite planning purpose yet does not unnecessarily
 frustrate the development process.
 Implementing Actions:
 3.6.a    Require the development of Community Plans for large-scale new developments within
          the City’s SUDP/SOI prior to development.
          As envisioned in this plan, a “Community Plan” may or may not conform with the
          requirements of Government Code Section 65450 for “Specific Plans.”. The Community
          Plans proposed are intended to recognize specific projects that have undergone significant
          developer-driven planning efforts but need to fit in with the Merced Vision 2030 goals and
          objectives. These projects will undergo additional detailed planning and environmental review
          when formally proposed to the City for development.
          The Land Use Diagram proposes the establishment of five new Community Plan areas
          (Figure 3.9). These areas are as follows:
          1)   The University Community Plan (Section 3.7.3);
          2)   The Bellevue Community Plan (Section 3.7.4);
          3)   South Thornton (or “Five Bridges”) Community Plan (Section 3.7.5);
          4)   South Mission Community Plan (Section 3.7.6).
          5)   Yosemite Lakes Community Plan (Section 3.7.7)
          In the above sections, each of these Community Plan areas will be described along with issues
          associated with the future development of these Community Plans. An illustrative plan of
          each of these Community Plan areas has been included in Section 3.10, Appendix. These
          illustrative plans are not adopted plans and are only included to inform the public of
          preliminary land use concepts under consideration in each of the Plan areas.

3.6.b   Make use of guiding principles in developing Community Plans.
        Community Plan Guiding Principles
        The following guiding principles should be used in developing these community plans:
        1) The “Urban Villages” concept should be incorporated into the planning of these areas as
            much as feasible.
        2) Community Plans which include or are adjacent to established neighborhoods will address
            the needs of these neighborhoods and potential adverse impacts resulting from plan
            implementation.
        3) The Community Planning process should be focused on the planning issues or concerns
            which need to be resolved for that planning area and, to this degree, provide data,
            information or policy clarification necessary to carry out the goals of the Merced Vision
            2030 General Plan. Public participation by area residents and property owners in the
            planning process will be emphasized.
        4) Community Plan areas need connectivity with existing and planned urban areas. This
            includes all modes of transportation, including vehicles, bicycles, public transit, etc.
        5) Community Plans will include a land use and infrastructure phasing plan.
        The City may undertake the development of these Community Plans subsequent to the
        adoption of the General Plan or require developers to complete such plans. The costs of
        developing the plans may be assessed to those property owners, builders, and developers who
        will benefit from the plans as development takes place.
Policy L-3.7
Implement Policies and Principles to Conform to the Intent of the San Joaquin
Valley Regional Blueprint.
In 2006, the eight Councils of Governments in the San Joaquin Valley ( representing the counties of
San Joaquin, Stanislaus, Merced, Madera, Fresno, Kings, Tulare, and Kern) came together to develop
a coordinated valley vision, the San Joaquin Valley Regional Blueprint. In April 2009, the San
Joaquin Valley Regional Policy Council adopted a Preferred Blueprint Growth Scenario and a list of
Smart Growth principles to be used by local jurisdictions in updating their General Plans. Conformity
to Regional Blueprint plans are likely to be required per California Senate Bill (SB) 375 in the future.
Implementing Actions:
3.7.a   Review the City’s General Plan and other policy documents to ensure that they conform
        to the Preferred Blueprint Growth Scenario, “Scenario B+,” and the preferred density of
        6.8 average dwelling units per acre.
        Upon initial analysis, the Merced Vision 2030 General Plan generally conforms to the
        principles and preferred density of the Preferred Blueprint Growth Scenario, known as
        “Scenario B+.” However, a more comprehensive analysis will be required in order to ensure
        that the City’s General Plan and other policy documents conform to the Blueprint.

 3.7.b   Continue to implement City policies and programs that conform to the Smart Growth
         Principles of the San Joaquin Valley Regional Blueprint
         In April 2009, the San Joaquin Valley Regional Policy Council adopted Smart Growth
         Principles to be used as a basis for Blueprint planning in the San Joaquin Valley. The policies
         include:
         1) Create a range of housing opportunities and choices.
         2) Create walkable neighborhoods.
         3) Encourage community and stakeholder collaboration.
         4) Foster distinctive, attractive communities with a strong sense of place.
         5) Make development decisions predictable, fair, and cost effective.
         6) Mix Land Uses
         7) Preserve open space, farmland, natural beauty, and critical environmental areas.
         8) Provide a variety of transportation choices.
         9) Strengthen and direct development toward existing communities.
         10) Take advantage of compact building design.
         11) Enhance the economic vitality of the region.
         12) Support actions that encourage environmental resources management.
         The Merced Vision 2030 General Plan contains many policies that relate to the above
         principles, which are spread throughout the General Plan Elements, including Land Use,
         Transportation, Public Facilities & Services, Urban Design, Open Space & Conservation,
         Sustainable Development, etc.

NOTE: These are general standards appropriate for most situations. Higher standards may be required or less standards may be
permitted based on detailed design studies. Expanded ROW’s may be required at intersections to accommodate turn lanes. On-
street parking may be deleted if adequate, convenient off-street parking is provided in a subdivision design. A subdivision design

possible reimbursement and/or maintenance costs for existing system).

 Policy T-1.1
 Design Streets Consistent with Circulation Function, Affected Land Uses, and All
 Modes of Transportation.
 It is extremely important to coordinate circulation and land use planning. Street systems are intended
 to move motor vehicles but streets also are expected to provide access to nearby land uses. Smaller
 streets called upon to carry heavy traffic to major activity centers can create large circulation
 problems. Large streets carrying heavy traffic through residential or other sensitive land use areas
 can create significant conflicts.
 Implementing Actions:
 1.1.a     Implement the General Plan Circulation Plan (Figure 4.1) as development occurs.
                                                      4-41

Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
Chapter 4--Transportation and Circulation
         The City will implement the General Plan Circulation Plan as development occurs in new
         growth areas and in developed areas, as feasible. This may be accomplished through the
         dedication of needed right-of-way or transportation easements, the construction of roadway
         improvements, and/or the collection of fees, consistent with the impacts of new development.
 1.1.b   Whenever feasible, implement a system of arterials and higher order streets in new
         growth areas based upon the adopted concept of arterials/expressways and ensuring the
         development of “complete streets” which address all modes of transportation.
         The adopted concept of arterials/expressways is designed to carefully separate streets by
         circulation function, and locate land uses consistent with these functions (Figure 4.1). Arterials
         and higher order streets will carry the higher-speed traffic to adjacent commercial, industrial
         and other major destinations.
         Collectors and local streets will be designed for local, neighborhood traffic that is either
         traveling towards a neighborhood destination or is exiting the area. It is important to try to
         apply these same principles to the extent possible in planning partially developed areas that
         have incomplete road networks. All streets should be designed as “Complete Streets” which
         address all modes of motorized and non-motorized transportation, including vehicles, transit,
         pedestrians, and bicycles.
 1.1.c   Evaluate existing streets in older portions of the City, and identify means of upgrading
         the system where necessary.
         As in-fill development and redevelopment occurs, existing street systems should be evaluated
         to determine if there are ways that circulation efficiency and accessibility can be improved
         without causing undue impacts on the neighborhoods.
 1.1.d   Design and build residential collector streets that balance as effectively as possible
         competing needs to be safe and efficient.
         The community needs to continue to seek and evaluate design options and other ways that
         might help to reconcile the competing functions of residential collector streets (to be safe for
         local neighborhood residents while being reasonably efficient traffic carriers). The City also
         needs to distinguish collector streets (“Major Collectors”) that, because of certain
         characteristics, are likely as time passes to experience increasing traffic pressures and impacts
         on adjacent residential settings.
         [NOTE: A “Major Residential Collector” is defined as 1) being of one-half mile or more in
         uninterrupted length; 2) having a current or projected ADT (Average Daily Trips) of 1,500 or
         higher; and 3) having outlets to at least one higher order street at an intersection which is
         either signalized or projected for future signalization. A Major Collector by its location a) is a
         central element of its neighborhood circulation system with connection to additional
         neighborhoods; and b) will receive, or is projected to receive, significant through traffic
         increases from outside its primary service area to major destinations to which the major
         collector has convenient access. Major Collectors would be the same width as other
         Collectors, but should have no residential driveways accessing directly upon them. See
         Appendix 4.8.1.]

1.1.e    Study projected future areas of City expansion prior to development to identify the most
         effective circulation pattern(s).
         Conceptual circulation planning should identify potential points of concern as early as possible
         in the planning process in order to obtain the most effective land use and circulation decisions.
         Circulation patterns should be based upon such factors as current patterns of land ownership,
         existing land use activities, present circulation patterns, and adopted land use plans.
Policy T-1.2
Coordinate Circulation and Transportation Planning with Pertinent Regional, State
and Federal Agencies.
Traffic-related problems including significant concerns over air quality in the Great Central Valley
have helped to forge requirements for more and more inter-governmental cooperation and planning,
often tied to prospective State and Federal funding. The City needs to remain active in these efforts,
while also periodically reviewing its position within these procedures.
Implementing Actions:
1.2.a    Work with Caltrans, the County, and MCAG to implement the current Regional
         Transportation Plan (RTP) and subsequent updates.
         The Regional Transportation Plan addresses necessary improvements to the regional
         transportation system and is updated every 2 years.
1.2.b    Coordinate local circulation/transportation plans, the financing and construction of
         improvements, and right-of-way preservation programs with interested area and
         regional agencies.
         The City works with numerous other bodies, including Merced County, Merced Association of
         Governments (MCAG), and Caltrans (the California Department of Transportation),
         concerning transportation and circulation matters. This will become even more important in
         the future as traffic volumes increase and funding sources decrease.
1.2.c    Identify a hierarchy pattern of major streets within the City’s General Plan and Sphere
         of Influence areas, and work with the County of Merced and Caltrans to retain
         unimpeded future rights-of-way to accommodate the current general plan period and
         projected future growth.
         It is extremely important that prospective right-of-ways (ROW’s) be protected from permanent
         development whenever feasible, not only within the City and in its immediate growth areas but
         also in areas projected for longer term growth. This will benefit both City and County, in terms
         of reduced costs as well as potential efficiencies to be gained from sufficient roadways. This
         will involve working with the County on developing an appropriate fee structure that would be
         used for specific identified road improvements on a priority basis. Maintenance issues relating
         to roadways built to City standards in areas not yet annexed can also be addressed through this
         process.
         The City shall also work with Caltrans and MCAG to insure the preservation of adequate
         rights-of-way for State highways and interchanges as outlined in the Regional Transportation
         Plan, and other regional plans.

Chapter 4--Transportation and Circulation
 1.2.d   Continue to work with the County and Caltrans to implement the Campus Parkway and
         the Merced-Atwater Expressway projects as high priorities to serve the northern growth
         area.
         Planning for the Campus Parkway corridor began in the late 1990’s when the concept of an
         “Eastern Beltway” to serve the City’s northern growth area was conceived. With the location
         of the UC Merced campus in the Lake Yosemite area, the concept evolved into the Campus
         Parkway. Planning for the Campus Parkway corridor was completed in 2005 with the
         selection of a final route, and construction of the first segment from the Mission/Highway 99
         Interchange to Childs Avenue is due to be completed in 2010. The Campus Parkway corridor
         will ultimately be extended north to the UC Merced Campus and Campus Community.
         Completion of this corridor is a high priority for the City, the County, and UC Merced. The
         City will continue to work with the County on obtaining funding to complete the corridor.
         In 2005, the City began working with the Merced County Association of Governments
         (MCAG), Caltrans, and the City of Atwater on an alternative to the proposed Highway 59
         Bypass west of Merced and the proposed Castle Parkway east of Atwater. In order to avoid
         the duplication of major expressways that would require two interchanges with Highway 99, it
         was decided to explore the development of a Merced-Atwater Expressway that would be
         located somewhere in between the two cities and would serve traffic from both cities, but only
         require one interchange with Highway 99. In 2006, a Project Study Report and EIR process
         began to define the corridor for such an expressway. In March 2009, MCAG selected
         Modified Alternative 1B and certified the EIR for the Merced-Atwater Expressway.
         The proposed Expressway will entail providing a seven mile long 4-lane divided expressway
         connecting SR-140 to the south with Bellevue Road to the north. The new expressway will
         provide a more cost-effective access to SR-99 and provide additional north-south roadway
         capacity within the Atwater and Merced, unincorporated portions of Merced County, and to
         the new University of California at Merced. It will also improve access to the Castle Airport
         Development Center and the United States Penitentiary located in unincorporated portions of
         northern Merced County.
 1.2.e   Continue to work with Caltrans and the Merced County Association of Governments
         (MCAG) on upgrades to the Highway 99 Corridor and its connectivity to the City’s
         street system.
         Highway 99, as Merced’s primary highway link to the rest of the State, is critically important
         to the City. The City will continue to work with Caltrans and MCAG on highway upgrades,
         including modifications to interchanges, the possible expansion of the one-way couplet system
         on 13th and 14th street corridors, upgrades to the Highway 99 bridge and overhead structures,
         and other projects that would increase connectivity with the City’s street system.
 1.2.e   Reduce congestion and improve accessibility by constructing new and improved road
         connections in South Merced.
         A major component of the South Merced Community Plan was its traffic analysis and resulting
         circulation plan and related policies. Although the circulation system within the community
         plan area was shown to function without deficient levels of service, the traffic study concluded
         that significant impacts would occur to several streets north and east of Childs Avenue and
         State Highway 59 (South) respectively, as well as State Highway 59 in the plan area itself.

                                                                  Chapter 4--Transportation and Circulation
         The South Merced Community Plan includes many policies, which are included in this
         General Plan by reference, that guide actions of the City to minimize impacts and to take
         appropriate steps to develop a street system in these areas that will function at acceptable
         service levels. The key aspects of these policies are noted in the following list, but one should
         refer to the South Merced Community Plan for a full discussion of the issues and applicable
         solutions.
         1. Utilize “R” Street, “M” Street, “G” Street, “D” Street, “B” Street, DeLong Street, and
              Brantley Street as important north-south oriented road connections;
         2. Explore the use of a rear-access local road at the rear of the commercial properties that
              front SR 59;
         3. Create a design and financing plan for the Childs Avenue/SR 99 interchange that will
              define the location, magnitude, and funding for improvements; and,
         4. Prior to further development that will utilize SR 59, work with Caltrans to construct
              signals at Childs Avenue, Gerard Avenue and Mission Avenue.
1.2.f    Continue to work with federal, state, and regional agencies and stakeholders to expand
         opportunities for multi-modal transportation.
        The City shall continue to seek funding for projects which complete transportation networks,
        utilize multiple modes of transportation, and provide, enhance, or sustain amenities for non-
        motorized transportation, such as tree shading for trails and bikeways. Examples of available
        funding include, but would not be limited to, Measure C funds for Transit-Oriented
        Development, Caltrans grants for “walkable, livable, and sustainable communities,” and other
        incentives found to be appropriate. As part of this overall strategy, the City shall support high-
        speed rail and shall guide siting of a station in Downtown Merced to be integrated into a multi-
        modal transportation network.
Policy T-1.3
Design Major Roads to Maximize Efficiency and Accessibility.
Based upon the physical characteristics of a particular roadway, it is possible to calculate the
maximum “peak-hour carrying capacity” for that road. Carrying capacity refers to the maximum
number of motor vehicles the road can carry past a given point within a specific period of time, at a
pre-determined realistic or reasonable speed. If the number of vehicles were to exceed this maximum
capacity, the vehicles will begin to slow down, which in turn reduces the number of vehicles the road
can safely carry. Every intersecting street, as well as every curb cut, that allows vehicles to interrupt
the traffic flow, either by slowing down to exit or by entering the road, affects both the speed and
number of peak-hour vehicles the roadway can accommodate.
Implementing Actions:
1.3.a    Adhere, to the greatest possible extent, to the standards adopted for spacing streets that
         intersect arterials and higher order roadways as outlined in Table 4.2.
         The locations at which streets intersect a major roadway, and the spacing or distance between
         such intersecting streets, are important factors affecting how well the major road fulfills its
         traffic carrying responsibility. The growth of traffic over time, along with accompanying
         disruptions such as increasing numbers of vehicle accidents, can significantly affect the
         efficiency of intersections.
                                                    4-45

Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
Chapter 4--Transportation and Circulation
         Spacing is a critical element in any subsequent need for installing traffic signals. Effectively
         spaced traffic signals can be efficiently synchronized. This allows greater peak hour
         efficiency, with more vehicles traveling farther, and faster, during these problem periods. As
         spacing becomes less consistent, traffic signals can themselves cause disruption and be less
         effective for moving traffic.
         Poor locations and/or spacing create problems that even signals will not be able to overcome.
         Proper distances involve one-eighth and/or one-quarter mile spacing for streets intersecting
         with divided and higher order arterials, and one-half to one-mile distances for streets
         intersecting with expressways (refer to Appendix).
 1.3.b   Improve traffic flow of arterials and other major roadways whenever possible by
         avoiding or eliminating on-street parking.
         On-street parking affects traffic speed and movement, and can increase safety problems along
         major roadways. Provision of off-street parking is required of all land uses in the City per the
         zoning code, so on-street parking along major roadways is generally not necessary and reduces
         the efficiency and safety of the major roadway.
 1.3.c   Work to insure that land uses fronting major streets have shared access across adjacent
         properties and provide sufficient on-site parking to avoid depending upon on-street
         parking.
         Shared access across adjacent properties helps to improve the efficiency of major streets by
         allowing traffic movements between adjacent properties to take place on-site and off the public
         street. This is particularly important for adjacent commercial properties. This shared-access
         should be formalized with mutual access easements as much as feasible.
         On-street curb-side parking can create a negative impact on adjacent land uses and its
         residents/customers if they have grown to depend upon it. Occasionally site plans may orient a
         land use activity in a way that makes on-street (curb-side) parking more convenient to an
         entrance than on-site parking. Such designs should be discouraged. On the other hand, care
         should be taken to consider the location of public transit stops (which are unlikely to change)
         and the provision of convenient access to these stops.
 1.3.d   Continue to require the provision of on-site visitor parking in multi-family projects.
         It is important to consider the provision of on-site visitor parking in multi-family complexes so
         that on-street parking (which could be restricted in the future along major roadways) is not
         solely relied upon. The City’s current parking standard of 1.75 spaces per multi family unit up
         to 30 units and 1.5 spaces thereafter allows for at least 8 visitor parking spaces.
 1.3.e   Improve traffic flow of all new arterial streets to the greatest possible extent by the use of
         median strips of sufficient width to facilitate vehicle movement.
         Medians of sufficient width provide the necessary space for turning lanes that help to keep
         traffic moving efficiently. They also allow a safe haven for cross-traffic vehicles where there
         are median openings for such traffic. In addition, they may act as a safety island for
         pedestrians who may be crossing, and add a measure of safety for separating traffic traveling
         in different directions.
 1.3.f   Whenever feasible avoid, or eliminate, unnecessary or poorly placed median openings
         and consider limiting left turns at uncontrolled intersections during peak hours on
         arterials.
                                                    4-46

                                                                        Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
                                                                Chapter 4--Transportation and Circulation
      Median breaks can cause interruptions in the free flow of traffic on a major street. Effective
      placement of these openings helps to minimize traffic disruptions and works to maximize
      major street efficiency. In order to relieve congestion, the City might want to analyze the
      impacts of a policy to prohibit left turns at uncontrolled intersections, especially those where
      no turn lanes are in place, on arterial streets, such as “G,”, “M,” and “R” Streets, during peak
      hours to ease the flow of traffic.
1.3.g Avoid residential “fronting lots” on Major Collectors and higher order streets.
      Residential traffic entering or leaving private driveways that front upon major collectors and
      other higher order streets (that are intended to efficiently carry traffic) create safety conflicts
      with traffic and affect traffic movement, particularly during peak traffic periods and if vehicles
      are backing onto the street. When the front of the house faces directly onto the street,
      residents also tend to be concerned about high speed traffic passing by their front yards where
      children may play and where noise impacts are greater.
1.3.h Obtain whenever feasible necessary rights-of-way in proximity to major intersections for
      needed turn lanes and to accommodate American with Disabilities Act (ADA) routes of
      accessibility and safe crossings.
      Intersections can become bottlenecks to efficient traffic movement. A key to maintaining
      smooth flowing traffic is to avoid as much as possible the disruption of through traffic by
      turning vehicles. Turn lanes of sufficient length are effective for removing traffic that is
      slowing to turn, with a minimum of impact upon through traffic. This can be especially
      important in older areas of the City where widening the entire street may not be possible, but
      where expanded intersections can reduce congestion. Intersections and traffic signals also
      need to be designed and upgraded to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
      requirements regarding accessibility and safe crossings.
1.3.i In new growth areas, obtain expanded arterial intersection rights-of-way (ROW)
      requirements
      As development projects are proposed in new growth areas, the expanded arterial intersection
      ROW’s generally described in the Appendix (Section 4.8) should be dedicated, so that turn
      lanes can be established in these intersections when traffic conditions warrant
1.3.j Maintain the land use and access restrictions identified for major collector and higher
      order street intersections.
      Streets have functions that are often at odds with each other. Major roads are expected to carry
      large amounts of traffic at reasonable speeds, but also provide access to adjacent land uses..
      Each intersection, driveway access, or median break that allows other traffic to enter or
      otherwise disrupt the traffic flow of a major street reduces efficiency (traffic carrying ability)
      from that major street. An intersection of two major streets becomes a point where each
      disruptive movement within proximity to the intersection has heightened potential to affect
      traffic flows on each street. Major traffic entering and leaving large commercial complexes or
      other major vehicle destinations create a variety of traffic movements that can magnify
      disruptions on traffic flow. Avoiding driveway access movements in the vicinity of major
      intersections promises to help maximize traffic flows, thereby maintaining efficiency while
      reducing air quality impacts at those intersections.
1.3.k Approve driveway access locations only if consistent with approved minimum acceptable
      distances from major intersections, except in unusual circumstances.
                                                  4-47

Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
Chapter 4--Transportation and Circulation
          Driveways can help disrupt major street traffic flows. Over time a driveway can be expanded,
          land uses can intensify, and other changes can take place that can significantly increase the
          impacts of a driveway on major street traffic. It is important to maintain adopted driveway
          location standards as outlined in Table 4.2, and to avoid driveway locations that can conflict
          with major street intersections. It is also important to consider the ultimate build-out of the
          area when determining needs at the time of initial construction.
 1.3.l    Ensure street and intersection designs provide for accessibility accommodations.
          The City will continue to design streets and intersections to meet the requirements of the
          Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA), including the street crossings and signals.
 (Notes: Chapter 5, Public Services and Facilities, contains policies relating to the timing of
 infrastructure improvements, including circulation improvements.)
 Policy T-1.4
 Promote Traffic Safety for All Modes of Transportation.
 As traffic levels on a street approach the street’s effective capacity, and as various factors affect how a
 roadway functions, safety is also affected. This interrelationship lends itself to some repetition among
 implementing actions relating to safety.
 Implementing Actions:
 1.4.a    If fronting driveways cannot be avoided on a Major Collector or higher order street (see
          Action 1.3.g), seek design solutions that will allow automobiles to avoid backing out.
          There are driveway designs that allow residential vehicles to avoid backing out into street
          traffic. Examples are circular driveways or the provision of “hammerhead turn-arounds” on
          site. Typically, however, such designs are more workable with larger residential lots, and the
          most effective solution remains the avoidance of direct residential driveway access if at all
          possible where backing traffic will create particular disruptions (refer to previous
          Implementing Action 1.3.g).       Where viable, provision of alley loaded homes to minimize
          vehicle conflicts on the major roadways and allowance of on-street parking to act as a buffer
          between residential uses and travel lanes and to serve as a traffic calming measure should be
          considered as well as more flexibility in subdivision layouts.
 1.4.b    Allow only adopted spacing of streets intersecting and traffic signals on any Arterial or
          higher order street, unless prior actions or unusual circumstances make this infeasible.
          Effective intersection spacing contributes to more efficient traffic flow and helps reduce
          unnecessary stop and go traffic.
 1.4.c    Promote increased traffic safety with special attention to hazards which could cause
          personal injury.
          Continue to maintain existing practices related to safety such as: maintain adopted sight-line
          requirements for signs, fences, etc. (line of uninterrupted vision along which a vehicle operator
          can see traffic, bicycles or pedestrians approaching from an intersecting street) at designated
          street intersections and driveways; continue to monitor street intersections to identify unusual
          levels of traffic accidents; etc. Evaluate ways to increase the effectiveness of traffic safety
          efforts.
                                                     4-48

                                                                            Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
                                                                   Chapter 4--Transportation and Circulation
1.4.d   Reserve adequate road and intersection right-of-way to provide for the needs of traffic
        safety.
        Sufficient right-of-way for facilities such as right and left turn lanes help to improve traffic
        movements in the vicinity of intersections.
1.4.e   Continue as feasible to mitigate or reduce safety hazards, and program improvements to
        congested intersections before they become significant problems.
        It is important to implement improvements as feasible. It is also important to recognize that it
        is often more cost effective to avoid creating significant traffic conflicts than it is to attempt to
        reduce or mitigate them once they have become problems. The City should continue to review
        development applications to mitigate prospective concerns as they are identified.
1.4.f   Seek to improve or correct the specific problem locations identified as “Circulation
        System Improvement Issues” in the City’s Circulation Element (Section 4.4).
        Pursue all available inter-governmental assistance and other sources, as feasible, for help to
        mitigate problem intersections and other identified site specific problems within the City’s
        circulation system.
Policy T-1.5
Minimize Unnecessary Travel Demand on Major Streets and Promote Energy
Conservation.
Traditional circulation patterns often tend to make it inconvenient for a driver to make a
neighborhood or other local trip without getting onto a major street. It is important to have a
circulation system that provides the flexibility to allow neighborhood and other trips on local roads,
while encouraging nonlocal trips to use the major road system.
Implementing Actions:
1.5.a   Encourage design of local and collector streets within Villages/Neighborhoods to provide
        multiple, reasonably direct routes to local neighborhood destinations.
        It is important to build flexibility into neighborhood circulation for reaching local destinations.
        At the same time, it is important to provide the opportunity for a local driver to reach the
        nearest major (arterial) road directly and quickly, if the destination is more distant. These
        needs must be carefully balanced with the need to discourage outside traffic from taking
        shortcuts through residential neighborhoods as described in Implementing Action 1.7.b. In
        other words, routes may need to be less direct in order to discourage such shortcuts but not so
        indirect as to make it difficult for neighborhood residents to reach their destinations.
1.5.b   Avoid whenever feasible neighborhood street system designs that make it more
        convenient for a local resident to use an arterial street to reach an in-neighborhood
        destination than to remain on the local street system.
                                                     4-49

Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
Chapter 4--Transportation and Circulation
          Often local street circulation patterns, whether intended or not, include barriers to the local
          driver who seeks to go to certain nearby destinations. The result is often that the driver is
          forced to go onto the major street system in order to reach a destination adjacent to the local
          neighborhood. This usually means that a bicycle rider or pedestrian would have been forced
          into the same inconvenient, out-of-the way trip, which is often the reason such trips are only
          made by automobile. Where cul-de-sacs are proposed, consideration should be given to
          providing walk-through (or “open-end”) cul-de-sacs to minimize walking distances to nearby
          destinations.
 Policy T-1.6
 Minimize Adverse Impacts on the Environment from Existing and Proposed Road
 Systems.
 The more efficient traffic movement is, the less fuel is consumed and the less air pollution is created.
 As traffic movements become less efficient (more stops, more slowing down and speeding up, etc.) with
 growth, the more traffic- related impacts are created on the environment.
 Implementing Actions:
 1.6.a    Continue working to minimize environmental impacts associated with heavily traveled
          traffic corridors, such as high noise levels and stop and go traffic situations (which
          contribute heavily to air pollution problems).
          Noise impacts can be reduced by such methods as solid walls, and heavy landscape barriers
          such as trees or heavy foliage. In the case of new roads, it may be relatively easy to find the
          opportunity to use these design methods. In older residential areas, however, with houses
          facing directly onto roadways that are becoming more heavily traveled, options to use noise
          barriers are typically more constrained. The use of some types of barriers on medians (if space
          is available) may reduce some noise but, perhaps as importantly, reduces visual impacts.
 1.6.b    Make a strong commitment to increase the number of people per vehicle so that the
          existing street system is utilized to its fullest.
          Continue to support MCAG and City efforts to encourage and promote carpooling and other
          alternatives to single occupancy vehicles. Consider the use of HOV lanes if and when they
          become feasible to use in Merced.
 1.6.c    Consider ways to encourage employers to reduce impacts upon the existing street system.
          Examples could include encouraging large employers to promote carpooling and other
          transportation alternatives within their work force, as well as encouraging, if feasible,
          staggered working hours.

                                                                           Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
                                                                   Chapter 4--Transportation and Circulation
1.6.d   Avoid neighborhood street system designs
        whenever possible that require a local                            Figure 4.16
        resident to travel away from a local
        destination in order to reach it.
        Street systems at time force inefficiency by
        requiring vehicles and pedestrians to double-
        back or double the distance they travel in order
        to reach a nearby destination. Such situations
        should be avoided if at all possible.
        For example, in Figure 4.16, the nearest retail
        center is one-half mile (along the directional
        arrow) from the indicated residential site. With
        the given road pattern, however, the shortest
        automobile distance is nearly one-mile.
1.6.e   Install traffic control devices only where warranted except in unusual circumstances.
        Caltrans has established a rating system for determining where traffic control devices, such as
        stop signs and traffic signals, should be installed. This “warrant” system considers such factors
        as the numbers of accidents, traffic volume, numbers of pedestrians, and the presence of
        schools. Traffic control devices should only be installed where they meet the minimum
        requirements of this warrant system. “Unwarranted” signals and signs may cause excessive
        delay, disobedience of traffic regulations, circuitous travel of alternative routes to avoid the
        devices, and increased accident frequency. These conditions negatively impact air quality and
        the efficiency and safety of the circulation system.
1.6.f   Ensure to the extent feasible that pedestrian, bicycle, and automobile connections are
        maintained in existing neighborhoods affected by transportation and other development
        projects.
        When new transportation or development projects, such as a highway interchange or
        separated-grade crossing, are proposed, some times it is necessary to minimize access from
        adjacent streets or land uses. To the extent feasible, existing connections for all modes of
        transportation should be maintained unless safety issues take precedence.
Policy T-1.7
Minimize Street System Impacts on Residential Neighborhoods and Other Sensitive
Land Uses.
The City has for many years fostered an inter-departmental, inter-agency development review process
which evaluates matters such as street design and street improvements, and their possible impacts
upon affected land uses and the environment.
Implementing Actions:
1.7.a   To the greatest extent feasible, maintain a distinct hierarchy of streets that will provide
        for major roadways between neighborhoods rather than through neighborhood areas.
                                                   4-51

Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
Chapter 4--Transportation and Circulation
         Major streets on the perimeter of neighborhoods or villages promise to cause the least amount
         of disruption to those areas. In new growth areas, arterials and higher order streets should be
         located to form the boundaries of neighborhoods, by placing them parallel to each other at one
         mile intervals, perpendicular to similarly spaced major street patterns to form approximate
         one-mile square neighborhoods or village areas. These villages are intended to be oriented
         around local activities such as parks and schools, as well as some level of commercial activity
         that would be located at the village edge with the intent to also avoid unnecessary intrusion
         through the neighborhood.
 1.7.b   Whenever feasible, approve street circulation patterns that discourage exterior traffic
         from driving through neighborhoods.
         The intent is to make local trips, within the neighborhood or shortly beyond, convenient for the
         local resident (Action 1.5.a) while at the same time, making it inconvenient for the driver from
         outside that neighborhood to use the same road system as a short-cut during a longer trip (see
         Figure 4.17). This is a critical distinction. If a street system is designed to be “perfectly
         convenient” for the local driver, it will almost surely be as convenient for outside drivers who
         speed through that neighborhood on their way to somewhere else.
                                              Figure 4.17
 1.7.c   Continue to implement the City’s Neighborhood Traffic Calming Guidelines to address
         traffic impacts on residential streets.
         In 2008, the City adopted Neighborhood Traffic Calming (NTC) Guidelines. These NTC
         guidelines were created to assist existing neighborhoods concerned about the traffic passing
         through their neighborhood, to assist the developer looking for guidelines to reduce the impact
         of a new project to existing and newly established areas, and lastly to help reduce potentially
         problematic speeds on the streets of the City of Merced. The guidelines seek to balance the
         desires of neighborhood residents with the needs of overall City circulation and public safety
         access.
         Goals of the NTC include: 1) Promote safe and pleasant conditions for residents, motorists,
         pedestrians, and bicyclists on neighborhood streets; 2) Enable social interaction among
         neighborhood residents; 3) Control the amount of traffic that uses neighborhood streets and
         limit vehicle speeds to levels stipulated by the General Plan Circulation Element; 4) Preserve
         and enhance pedestrian and bicycle access to neighborhoods; 5) Provide a process that will
         equitably address request for action by neighborhood residents with needs of all users of City
         Streets; 6) An integrated road system that is safe and efficient; and, 7) A comprehensive
         system of safe and convenient pedestrian ways.

         Policies in the NTC include: 1) To the extent feasible, through traffic should be routed to
         Arterial Streets, Regional Routes and Highways and away from neighborhood streets; 2)
         Access for emergency vehicles should be preserved at levels that meet City response
         standards; 3) The City will cooperatively work with its citizens to employ a variety of
         measures that achieve the traffic speed and volume standards set forth in these guidelines, the
         Circulation Element of the City’s General Plan and the State Vehicle Code; 4) Permanent NTC
         facilities will be designed in conformance with sound engineering and planning practices and
         should complement the residential character of the neighborhood; 5) NTC activities employed
         along particular street corridors should not create sub-standard traffic conditions on other
         streets; 6) Residents and property owners within an area where NTC facilities are installed
         should be prepared to share in the cost of their installation; and, 7) Maintain and improve
         planning for a pedestrian-friendly environment.
Policy T-1.8
Use A Minimum Peak Hour Level of Service (LOS) “D” As a Design Objective for All
New Streets in New Growth Areas and for Most Existing City Streets Except Under
Special Circumstances.
As the City grows, traffic volumes will increase significantly. In designing the City’s future circulation
system, the City has required sufficient rights-of-way be preserved to maintain an adequate level-of-
service, a minimum of LOS “D” but typically LOS “C” or better. On some existing roadways, such a
standard will most likely not be able to be maintained without widening these roadways and causing
great disruption to adjacent properties. The City will strive to maintain the minimum LOS throughout
the system, but some exceptions may need to be made.
Implementing Actions:
1.8.a    Traffic studies will be conducted as needed to determine the traffic impacts and to apply
         appropriate mitigation measures for new development projects.
         The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires cities to assess the environmental
         effects, including traffic impacts, of new development. Based on the conclusions of the “initial
         study,” the number of trips generated, or cumulative impacts, a detailed traffic analysis may be
         required. When the traffic analysis shows that the development will cause an intersection or
         roadway segment to drop below desired LOS standards, the City will require the new
         development to alleviate its share of the congestion as a condition of project approval.
1.8.b    Use peak-hour Level of Service “D” (“Tolerable Delays”) as the design standard for new
         streets and intersections in new growth areas.
         The preferred LOS levels are typically “C” and “D,” particularly for larger roads and major
         intersections. With LOS C, the road provides stable operation but is still underutilized to some
         degree. LOS D represents a fine balance between the relatively large number of vehicles
         served and the generally acceptable level of service provided. It is the intent of the City’s
         standards and policies for new and most upgraded intersections and road segments to be
         designed and built so as not to drop below LOS D (“tolerable delay”) during peak traffic
         periods.
                                                    4-53

Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
Chapter 4--Transportation and Circulation
 1.8.c   Establish minimum Level of Service standards for existing roadways and intersections
         that reflect the special circumstances of the surrounding area. For example, in the
         downtown area or adjacent to interchanges in build-out areas, LOS E or F would be
         acceptable if roadway widening conflicts with other General Plan policies or significant
         right-of-way acquisition, which would be severely disruptive to adjacent development, is
         required.
         Maintaining a LOS D on existing roadways and intersections is not always feasible,
         appropriate, or necessary. People may expect and tolerate varying levels of congestion
         depending on location (e.g. central Merced) and time of day. Heavier traffic can also be a
         reason to encourage greater pedestrian activity and heavier transit use in such areas. Other
         factors may make higher levels of service infeasible. In Central Merced, for example, widening
         existing streets could create great disruption to stable, older neighborhoods. In these areas,
         “significant delays” (LOS E) or even LOS F may have to be acceptable at peak hours. Special
         studies may be necessary to determine the appropriate LOS standards in such areas.
 1.8.d   Promote Transportation System Management (TSM) strategies in areas where LOS
         standards fall below the minimum.
         Traffic signal timing or coordination, additional lanes at intersections, transit service
         enhancements, parking management and traffic management are all examples of transportation
         system management strategies which can be expected to be used in the future. Ridesharing
         programs, preferential treatment for High Occupancy Vehicles (HOV’s), Park-and-Ride lots,
         one-way streets, the provision of bicycle facilities, and the promotion of variable work hours
         and telecommuting are also strategies which will be promoted by the City of Merced.

Policy T-2.1
Provide for and Maintain a Major Transitway Along "M" Street and Possibly Along
the Bellevue Road/Merced-Atwater Expressway and Campus Parkway corridors.
The City is fortunate to have a central corridor, containing many of the major land use destinations
within the urban area, aligned in general proximity to the length of “M” Street. These destinations
would be convenient to a primary transit route on this roadway, and additional urban area
destinations would be convenient to secondary or connecting routes on roads perpendicular to “M.”
In addition, Bellevue Road/the Merced-Atwater Expressway and the Campus Parkway could provide
connections to the “M” Street transitway, as well as a potential for future connections to regional
facilities.
Implementing Actions:
2.1.a    Continue to review land use decisions in the vicinity of the entire length of “M” Street to
         avoid creating or increasing conflicts with the intent of a major transitway.
         Major land use project proposals in proximity to the “M” Street area should be evaluated for
         possible long term consequences, such as orienting primary vehicle access for such projects
         directly onto “M” Street, if another option(s) exists.
2.1.b    Cooperate with Merced County and other interested agencies outside the City to
         maintain long-term flexibility to achieve an “M” Street Transitway.
         “M” Street is designated a “Transitway” within the City’s General Plan growth areas on the
         Circulation Plan Map. This corridor should be shown on regional circulation plans, illustrating
         a broad-based planning effort to maintain future public transit options to accommodate City
         expansion as well as University of California (UC Merced) growth in the region.
2.1.c    Continue to review land use decisions in the vicinity of “M” Street and Bellevue Road to
         avoid creating or increasing conflicts with the proposed future major commercial and
         office park sites at the major transfer point between designated transitway corridors.
         The prospective intersection of Bellevue Road and the future “M” Street (extended) is also the
         intersection of two transitway corridors designated on the Circulation Plan. The “M” Street
         Transitway is projected to run the entire north-south length of the City, while the prospective
         Bellevue Road/Merced-Atwater Expressway Transitway would tie the “M” Street Transitway
         eastward towards the University of California (UC) campus (and possibly westward to the
         potential regional job center at Castle Airport). It is important that land use decisions, relating
         to major commercial activities proposed for the immediate area, are carefully considered to
         avoid conflicts with the major public transit function also proposed in the location.
2.1.d    Cooperate with Merced County and other interested agencies outside the City to
         maintain a viable option for a Bellevue Road Transitway to provide regional public
         transit access to the University of California (UC) campus.
         The Bellevue Road Transitway Corridor concept needs to be considered as part of any
         cooperative planning process for the future University of California (UC) campus and its
         environs. This may also include further evaluation to confirm viability of this concept for
         providing public transit access to the UC. The Bellevue Corridor and other important
         corridors should be designed using the “Complete Streets” concept, which emphasizes use of
         all forms of transportation on streets, including automobiles, pedestrians, bicycles, and public
         transit.

Chapter 4--Transportation and Circulation
 2.1.e   Cooperate with Merced County and other interested agencies outside the City to evaluate
         the need to extend westward the Bellevue Road Transitway Corridor Concept.
         The General Plan’s Circulation Map identifies a Bellevue Road Transitway, extending
         eastward from the “M” Street Transitway corridor, providing regional public transit access to
         the UC campus. In connection with this prospective transitway to the east, it may also be
         advantageous to have the Bellevue Transit corridor extend westward, as part of the Merced-
         Atwater Expressway, in order to provide regional public transit access to the regional job
         centers.
 2.1.f   Work cooperatively with Merced County and other interested agencies to review and
         evaluate development proposals in the vicinity of Bellevue Road that might conflict with
         the prospective Bellevue Transitway.
         Bellevue Road is designated as both an “Arterial” and a “Transitway” on this General Plan’s
         Circulation Map. It will be important to obtain full regional cooperation to protect the future
         right-of-way (ROW) for this corridor, and to mitigate prospective impacts from any
         development projects upon these potential functions of this major roadway. The City/County
         Revenue Sharing Agreement could be one method of coordinating bicycle facility planning
         between the City, the County, and UC Merced.
 Policy T-2.2
 Support and Enhance the Use of Public Transit.
 Continue to cooperate with MCAG and other interested administrations and agencies to develop ways
 and seek methods for making public transit more successful in the Merced area.
 Implementing Actions:
 2.2.a   Promote land development patterns and site design criteria that support and enhance the
         use of public transit.
         While public transit ridership has not been particularly significant in the past in Merced, it has
         provided an important service to focused groups within the community. As Merced grows and
         as other factors change, it is more than likely that the use of public transit will increase in this
         area. It is important for the City, with Merced County Transit, to carefully evaluate how it can
         most effectively plan for this expanded demand before it happens. In this way, the City can
         seek to maintain flexibility to facilitate expected future public transit demands.
 2.2.b   Whenever feasible, avoid residential subdivision designs that require pedestrians to
         duplicate walking distance (double-back) to reach public transit routes.
                                                      4-56

                                                                          Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
                                                                 Chapter 4--Transportation and Circulation
      A key to public transit is to make the system readily available. Land planning that actually
      builds barriers into the system for prospective transit users, as illustrated below, does not
      encourage transit use. Where cul-de-sacs are proposed, consideration should be given to
      providing walk-through cul-de-sacs to minimize walking distances to nearby destinations.
                                                      Figure 4.18
             A walk of
          over 1,300 feet
          (nearly 1/4 mile) to
          reach a destination
          just 500 feet away.
2.2.c Whenever feasible, avoid creating barriers that prevent convenient access to current or
      prospective public transit routes.
      Considerable care needs to be taken to insure that development and redevelopment designs
      provide as much flexibility as feasible for non-vehicle circulation. Long, unbroken walls,
      misplaced cul-de-sacs, ill-conceived residential subdivision road patterns, etc., all can create
      limitations on how conveniently pedestrians can circulate through a neighborhood. It is
      important for residents to be able to reach the closest public transit route as directly and easily
      as possible. The more difficult it is for riders to reach a transit route, because of unnecessary
      or ill-conceived barriers, the more difficult it will be for public transit to serve the population
      effectively.
2.2.d Work with Merced County Transit (“The Bus”) to seek Federal, State, and other funding
      sources which provide major funding for transit equipment, maintenance, and operation.
      Support legislation which will provide additional funding.
      The City should work with the Merced County Transit system to seek outside funding sources
      to supplement expenditures for transit equipment, maintenance and operation.
2.2.e Support and participate in regional public transit planning.
      Through MCAG and the Merced County Consolidated Transit Agency, the City of Merced
      should continue to participate in planning efforts which promote improvements to the regional
      and local public transit systems.
2.2.f Plan for multi-modal transfer sites that incorporate auto parking areas, bike parking,
      transit, pedestrian and bicycle paths, and park and ride pick-up points.
      Identify locations where transportation systems converge and designate such areas as potential
      multimodal transfer sites. One such location could be the future Downtown High Speed Rail
      Station, where bike-friendly routes to the station and short/long term bike parking facilities
      could be incorporated into the station design to assist bicycle commuting.

Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
Chapter 4--Transportation and Circulation
 2.2.g   Encourage park and ride lots at suitable locations serving long distance and local
         commuters.
         There are many ways for providing such facilities The City should evaluate possible
         alternatives, including:
         1) Working with Caltrans and the Air District to identify suitable sites, which could be
              designated on the General Plan land use and circulation plans;
         2) Consideration of funding of park and ride lots as mitigation during CEQA review of
              residential development projects;
         3) Coordinating with appropriate transportation agencies and major employers to establish
              express buses and vanpools to increase the patronage of park and ride lots; and,
         4) Allowing developers to reach agreements with auto-oriented shopping center owners to
              use commercial parking lots as park and ride lots and multi-modal transfer sites.
         5) Work with Caltrans and transit providers to identify park and ride sites with convenient
              access to public transit.
 2.2.h   The City will work with Merced County Transit to pursue potential funding sources for
         operating and expanding the public transit system to increase frequency of service,
         routes and areas served, and to improve on-time performance.
         The City will work with “The Bus” to seek funding for improvements to the transit system.
 Policy T-2.3
 Support a Safe and Effective Public Transit System.
 Cost effective, efficient public transportation is important in any effort to provide a level of service
 necessary to attract increasing public ridership. The City will continue to work with Merced County
 Transit on the following actions:
 Implementing Actions:
 2.3.a   Include public transportation access in the review process for major public and private
         development projects, as well as all significant land use design proposals considered by
         the City.
         In view of the urban area’s growth potential, including future additions to the University of
         California (UC) which will no doubt add to the demand for public transit, it is important for
         public transportation management to take a long range view of how land and site planning can
         possibly affect future public transit options. The City will work with Merced County Transit
         on this endeavor.
 2.3.b   Provide transit stops on major streets and other transit improvements at sites deemed
         appropriate by the City and transit provider consistent with long-range transit plans.
         The City should discover where future bus routes are likely to go and help obtain facilities for
         such service, as feasible in cooperation with Merced County Transit.
 2.3.c   Avoid whenever possible public transportation transfer points that force passengers to
         cross major vehicle routes on foot.
                                                    4-58

                                                                            Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
                                                                    Chapter 4--Transportation and Circulation
         If feasible, public transit route transfer points should be located at one point, such as in
         conjunction with a major commercial area, so that passengers can go from one route to another
         with minimum inconvenience.
2.3.d    Provide off-street passenger loading/unloading at major public transportation
         destinations (shopping centers, etc.) whenever possible.
         This is more convenient for a higher percentage of passengers and also facilitates transfers,
         easing passenger problems in inclement weather, etc.
Policy T-2.4
Encourage the Use of Bicycles.
Studies have indicated that bicycles are the most efficient form of transportation ever devised, from the
standpoint of energy expended versus distance/speed attained. Given Merced’s attractive climate and
flat terrain, bicycle transportation can be very effective.
Implementing Actions:
2.4.a    Encourage area employers to promote bicycle use through incentive programs or other
         means.
         For example, a number of governmental agencies are concentrated in the central portion of the
         City, which could lend itself to the use by the City and other large employers of successful
         methods for increasing bicycle ridership.
2.4.b    Continue to support whenever feasible local efforts to promote cycling.
         In recent years, private promotion has brought a series of special cycling races/events to the
         Merced area. The City should also pursue partnerships with local cycling advocacy groups,
         such as the Merced Bike Coalition and the UC Cycling Alliance, and local bike shops in
         efforts to promote cycling in Merced. These events have been worthwhile public relations for
         both the Merced area and for cycling, and have helped to promote public awareness of the
         potential for bicycle riding in this area.
2.4.c    Seek to involve a cross-section of actual bicycle users in bicycle planning efforts and
         transportation-related bicycle activities through the City’s Bicycle Advisory
         Commission.
         In 2009, the City formed a new Bicycle Advisory Commission to serve as an advisory body to
         the City Council advising the City on matters relating to improving conditions for bicyclists,
         promoting bicycling as a means of transportation with the associated benefits of improved air
         quality, and improving safety conditions for bicyclists. The Commission reviews capital
         improvement projects relating to bicycles, reviews changes and updates to the City’s Bicycle
         Master Plan, General Plan, and the Municipal Code as they relate to bicycling, and promotes
         bicycling and assist in bicycle awareness and education. The Commission is made up of 7
         voting members who must be City residents and 2 non-voting members who may be County
         residents and the Commission meets every even numbered month. Bicycle users are a
         valuable resource for bicycle-related planning efforts. It is important to remember that there
         are very different bicycle populations. There are recreational bicycle users, those who
         commute to work, and also the “semi-professional riders” who are intense cyclists. There may
         be large differences of opinion between these groups regarding various bicycle topics, and
         therefore, the Bicycle Advisory Commission should be made up of citizens representing all
         types of cyclists in order to obtain a reasonable array of information and usable advice.

Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
Chapter 4--Transportation and Circulation
 Policy T-2.5
 Provide Convenient Bicycle Support Facilities to Encourage Bicycle Use.
 Because bicycles are light and mobile, it is extremely important that facilities be provided to secure
 them. Support facilities that help to make bicycle use convenient are important to encouraging a
 greater level of bicycle usage.
 Implementing Actions:
 2.5.a    Develop guidelines for public and private development relating to the design and location
          of bicycle parking facilities for both residential and non-residential uses and consider a
          bike parking ordinance.
          It is not good enough to provide parking facilities merely for automobiles. If a bicycle rider is
          forced to park a bicycle in an inconvenient area, subject to bad weather, or walk just as far in
          inclement weather as someone using a car, the incentive is greatly reduced for the average
          rider. Bicycle parking needs to be protected, needs to be more convenient than that provided
          for cars, etc. There have to be special advantages granted to those willing to ride, to make
          bicycling a realistic option. The City should consider the adoption of a bike parking
          ordinance. Bicycle parking guidelines from the Association of Pedestrian and Bicycle
          Professionals (APBP) should be considered as a resource for developing such a bike parking
          ordinance. The City should also encourage employers to provide end-of-trip facilities, such as
          bike lockers, bike rooms, and shower facilities, to encourage bicycle commuting.
 2.5.b    Design criteria in the construction of all bicycle trails, lanes and routes (Class I, II, and
          III bikeways) should conform to the State of California “Planning and Design Criteria
          for Bikeways in California;” Class I bikeways should have grade separation with all
          major streets where possible.
          The off-road bicycle/pedestrian trail system in the Merced region, financed in part by State
          and Federal funding, meets the construction standards required in order to obtain this
          assistance. Experience over many years with the existing standards has indicated a high level
          of public acceptance and satisfaction as well.
 2.5.c    Encourage The Bus system to continue to provide bicycle racks on buses.
          Although the City does not operate the Bus system so it cannot mandate such, the City should
          encourage the transit provider to continue to provide bicycle racks on buses, which has proven
          to be an effective tool for promoting bicycle and transit use.”
 Policy T-2.6
 Maintain and Expand the Community’s Existing Bicycle Circulation System.
 The City of Merced and Merced County have cooperated to develop an impressive regional bicycle
 system in the Merced/Lake Yosemite area. This has helped to place this area in a position to attract
 major cycling events. The bicycle system is also an important community and regional recreational
 asset. In addition, location of the University of California (UC) in proximity to Lake Yosemite will
 make an attractive and usable regional system much more useful and valuable.
 Implementing Actions:
 2.6.a    Continue to coordinate implementation and planning of the Merced Bicycle Master Plan
          with the County of Merced and the University of California.
                                                    4-60

                                                                             Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
                                                                    Chapter 4--Transportation and Circulation
          The City and County have a tradition of working together on off-road bicycle/pedestrian trails,
          as evidenced by the existing regional trail system tying together Merced and a significant
          portion of the greater urban area, including Lake Yosemite. Given Merced’s flat terrain, there
          is potential for bicycle commuting to be a significant travel mode for the UC campus. A UC
          study suggested that bicycle usage is significant at all UC campuses for student commutes up
          to 5 miles, about the distance from Merced to the campus. Coordinating bicycle planning with
          the University is, therefore, critical, and should be incorporated into the development of the
          University’s Long Range Development Plan, the University Community Plan, the Regional
          Bike Plan, and Merced Bicycle Plan. The City should update the Bicycle Master Plan, an
          implementing action of the General Plan, every four years to remain eligible for state funding.”
          “The South Merced Community Plan, as an implementing action of the General Plan, also
          includes various bicycle-related improvements, which should be incorporated into the Bicycle
          Master Plan for implementation. Through the South Merced Community Plan and the Bicycle
          Master Plan, the City will focus on adding and improving bicycle facilities in South Merced
          for recreation and commuting.
2.6.b     Pursue all available revenue sources for implementing the City’s Bicycle Master Plan.
          The City has been very successful over many years in obtaining monies that have helped to put
          the existing bicycle/pedestrian trail system in place. These efforts should continue.
2.6.c     Vigorously pursue and use state and federal funds earmarked for bicycle and transit
          improvements.
          The City will work with Merced County Transit and others to seek funding for transit
          improvements and the City will seek grants to fund needed bicycle improvements throughout
          the City.
Policy T-2.7
Maintain a Pedestrian-Friendly Environment.
It is extremely important for the City to work to insure its ability to obtain whenever feasible the most
efficient, most flexible, pedestrian access to important community destinations.
Implementing Actions:
2.7.a     Retain parkstrip and street tree planting requirements.
          Park strips offer distance from a street and thus a degree of security to a pedestrian. This is
          particularly important for younger children, especially those who may be actively engaged in
          an activity such as bicycle riding, roller skating or skateboarding. Street trees increase the
          feeling of security, help air quality, and the overhead canopies they form across residential
          streets are a strong aesthetic encouragement to pedestrians. Park strips are particularly
          important along major streets where vehicle speeds are higher.
2.7.b     Locate streetlights, street signs, fire hydrants, and other obstacles so they do not obstruct
          sidewalks and other pedestrianways.
          It is important to keep pedestrianways/sidewalks clear of any intruding City or utility
          equipment. (The American with Disabilities Act requires a minimum of four feet of
          unobstructed width.) This is another reason for making sure that sufficient rights-of-way are
          obtained to match not only current but prospective traffic demands, in order to avoid future
          street expansions that leave too little room for sidewalks.
                                                     4-61

Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
Chapter 4--Transportation and Circulation
 2.7.c   Continue to require new corner curb cuts and upgrade existing curb cuts to meet the
         American with Disabilities Act requirements.
         This is a Federal and State requirement. The City of Merced has also incorporated these
         provisions into City design standards.
 2.7.d   Work to maintain safe and convenient streetscapes for pedestrians.
         This is especially important in the Downtown and other urban areas that attract significant
         amounts of pedestrian traffic. The City has been involved with activities that serve as
         examples of what can be done, such as increased non-motor-vehicle police presence and the
         use of citizen volunteers.
 2.7.e   Continue to require sidewalks and pedestrianways for subdivisions and other
         development projects.
         The City requires the provision of sidewalks in all new residential and commercial
         developments. This requirement should be maintained and sidewalks should be encouraged in
         industrial areas to assist in employee access to public transit.
 2.7.f   Continue to encourage safe and convenient pedestrian environments in the Downtown
         and other areas that attract a great deal of pedestrian traffic.
         The City has been involved with activities that serve as examples of what can be done, such as
         increased non-motor vehicle police presence and the use of citizen volunteers.
 2.7.g   Continue to encourage the provision of plazas, malls, arcades, and walk-throughs.
         These can be important pedestrian links in high-traffic areas.
 2.7.h   Encourage the planting of shade trees and, as a minimum, plan for the prospective
         establishment of rest areas with seating facilities along major pedestrianways.
         These facilities can be important for making an inviting pedestrian environment. If such
         facilities are not feasible at the time of initial planning of such areas, flexible designs should
         be created that would facilitate later re-design/reconstruction at minimum cost in the future.
 2.7.i   Continue to review and evaluate possible options for dealing with the issue of incomplete
         pedestrian access to development projects that will be major pedestrian destinations.
         State of California provisions require access for the elderly and disabled to public use facilities
         (such as government buildings) and privately funded facilities intended for public use
         (commercial establishments, etc.). City design standards require on-site sidewalks for
         individual development projects. In recent years, development of some major projects in
         growth areas that are not fully built out have resulted in the problem of large segments of
         missing sidewalk. These missing segments, while not located on project property, have
         invariably been on the most direct pedestrian/bicycle route to or from the major pedestrian
         destination and efforts should be made to close those gaps.
                                                     4-62
                                                                            Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
                                                                   Chapter 4--Transportation and Circulation
Policy T-2.8
Improve Planning for Pedestrians.
Providing a pleasant pedestrian environment can often be achieved with very little cost or effort, but it
is often overlooked when overall circulation needs are evaluated. By making planning for pedestrian
access an integral part of the circulation planning process, significant enhancements to pedestrian
access within and around Merced’s neighborhoods can be accomplished. Significant air quality
benefits can be derived from promoting pedestrian-friendly environments.
Implementing Actions:
2.8.a    Seek to provide more flexible, more usable pedestrian access opportunities to land uses
         and land use combinations that are prospective pedestrian destinations (sports club
         facilities, schools, government facilities, parks, public open space areas, etc.).
         Examples include both public and private facilities. Schools, parks, trail systems and
         government centers are all activity areas that could be greatly enhanced by having one or more
         connecting pedestrian links to a nearby street(s), trail system, etc. A special case commercial
         example might be an athletic or sports club that could experience greater foot or bicycle traffic
         if made more accessible to other than motor vehicle traffic. Obvious prospective destinations
         such as commercial centers are often walled off from all direct access except motor vehicles
         using major streets and should not be.
2.8.b    Evaluate the future need for sidewalks in business parks and industrially-zoned areas.
         Increasing regional air quality problems are leading to requirements that make major job
         centers such as industrial areas more logical destinations for public or other forms of collective
         transit. This is turn may lead to a greater need for pedestrian distribution and sidewalks within
         these areas. An evaluation should consider any efficient and potentially cost-effective options.
2.8.c    Continue to review land use and project proposals with the intent to avoid pedestrian
         barriers that prevent or create unnecessarily circuitous access to community and
         commercial areas.
         It is important to continue to seek enhanced pedestrian access to major destinations such as
         shopping centers, schools, recreational areas, etc. Figure 4.19 shows how the College Green
         Shopping Center as built on the left with good pedestrian circulation and how it could have
         been built on the right with little pedestrian access.
                        Preferred                                        Discouraged

Chapter 4--Transportation and Circulation
 Policy T-2.9
 Ensure That New Development Provides the Facilities and Programs that Improve
 the Effectiveness of Transportation Control Measures and Congestion Management
 Programs.
 State and federal legislation requires local government to include strategies to increase the efficiency
 of transportation infrastructure and to reduce vehicle trips in their transportation plans.
 Transportation control measures are most effective when infrastructure is in place that supports all
 transportation modes. This would include community-wide transportation improvements and on-site
 improvements at individual worksites and businesses. The City of Merced can support these strategies
 by encouraging developers to construct infrastructure that reduces congestion and/or trips.
 Implementing Actions:
 2.9.a   Consider measures to increase the capacity of the existing road network prior to
         constructing more capacity (additional lanes, new roadways, etc.).
         Measures that may be included in local and regional transportation plans and capital
         improvement plans that may increase the capacity and reduce congestion on existing roads
         include the following:
         •    Establish an integrated and synchronized traffic signal network for major thoroughfares to
              assure smooth-flowing traffic through intersections and to minimize congestion through
              maintenance of stable traffic flow at intersections.
         •    Convert congested streets to one-way couplets where it would improve traffic flow and
              congestion.
         •   Modify intersections using turn restrictions, channelization, etc. where necessary and
             feasible.
 2.9.b   Work with employers and developers to provide employees and residents with attractive,
         affordable transportation alternatives.
         Encourage new development to provide on-site facilities that encourage employees to use
         alternative transportation modes as air quality and transportation mitigation measures. Some
         examples include:
         •    Showers and lockers provided in office buildings
         •    Safe and secure bicycle parking areas
         •    On-site employee cafeterias and eating areas
         •    Convenient access to transit waiting areas from offices
         The City may provide reduced parking requirements as an incentive for projects to incorporate
         measures proven to reduce employee commute trips or customer trips. Some methods
         developers/employers may use to encourage trip reduction and increased Average Vehicle
         Ridership include:
         •    Rideshare matching, transit subsidies, vanpool subsidies, flexible work schedules,
              compressed work weeks, telecommuting, shuttle services, parking management, and
              guaranteed rides home.

         •   Encouraging employers to provide preferential or subsidized parking for ride-sharing
             vehicles and low emission vehicles.
         •   Providing land use patterns and site designs that increase commuters’ ability to walk,
             bicycle, or use transit to get to work.
2.9.c    Expand programs to reduce vehicle miles traveled, stop and go traffic, and traffic
         congestion in order to improve traffic flow.
         Particular effort should be placed on further improvement of traffic signalization to reduce
         stop-and-go traffic, which causes excess vehicle emissions from excessive idling. This
         program requires various strategies and equipment, including optimized signal timing,
         interconnected signals, traffic-actuated signals, computer-based controls, channelized
         intersections, and additional turn lanes. Signalization changes should be done in consultation
         with Caltrans when effects will occur within the operational limits of a state highway ramp or
         when it will significantly change traffic volumes in and near ramps.
2.9.d    Complete the City’s network of bicycle and pedestrian transportation routes and allow
         for new forms of non-motorized transportation.
         The City should complete its network of on-street (bicycle lanes) and off-street bicycle routes
         and add sidewalks in areas where they do not currently exist. Example of non-motorized
         transportation include “neighborhood electric vehicles” and others.

Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
Chapter 4--Transportation and Circulation
 Policy T-3.1 AIR
 Preserve the Merced Regional Airport and its Land Use Compatibility Zones from
 Incompatible Encroachment and Incompatible Development Within the Airport
 Industrial Park.
 The City has worked for many years to provide protection of its airport. As the urban area expands, it
 is likely that growth pressures may increase in the general area of this facility. In addition to growth
 itself, the continuing development of the University of California offer possibilities that may change
 the future of the airport in ways completely unforeseen. It is important to retain an unencumbered
 facility in order to maintain necessary options for the future.
 Implementing Actions:
 3.1.a     Continue to protect the viability of approach areas and land use compatibility zones for
           both existing and future runway systems at the Merced Regional Airport through land
           use restrictions and property acquisition where necessary.
           Merced County adopts and updates from time to time a Land Use Compatibility Plan for all
           Merced County Airports. The last plan was adopted in 1995, but is being updated. The City
           will continue to follow the guidelines in the Plan to protect the viability of the Merced
           Regional Airport.
 3.1.b     Carefully review any zone changes or development proposals within the general area
           with special regard to identifying and evaluating possible long-term consequences upon
           the Merced Regional Airport.
           The City should apply the comprehensive planning process to any proposed development in
           the general area, including within the Airport Industrial Park itself, taking care to look at any
           development proposals in terms of both present and future impacts on airport operations.
 3.1.c     Continue to work with Merced County to retain low-intensity, compatible County zoning
           in the vicinity of the Airport Clear Zone, to avoid an increase in land use pressures.
           This appears to be the most effective way to continue long-term protection of the facility.
 3.1.d     Work with the County of Merced on land use and master planning issues in the vicinity
           of Castle Airport and its Land Use Compatibility Zones.
           The City of Merced recognizes that Castle Airport is a County asset with the potential to
           generate job growth within the County of Merced. Merced County is currently in the process
           of developing a new Castle Airport Master Plan, which would outline Castle’s proposed
           development over the next 20 years. Merced County has expressed an interest in expanding
           Castle’s current role as mostly a general aviation airport (the County’s website in 2011
           indicates that general aviation uses are 99% of current operations) to include air cargo,
           military exercises, and commercial air service. If such a Master Plan was approved, the Land
           Use Compatibility Zones for Castle Airport would need to be modified to reflect those
           changes. If modified, Castle Airport’s Land Use Compatibility Zones could affect
           development within the existing City and the proposed SUDP/SOI. (Long time residents will
           remember the significant noise impacts of Castle’s military operations until Castle Air Force
           Base closed in 1995.) Therefore, the City wants to continue to work with the County on
           ensuring that any adopted Castle Airport Master Plan contains realistic aircraft operation
           projections that do not hinder both existing and future development within the City.
 (Notes: Additional policies regarding the airport clear zones can be found in the Safety Element,
 Chapter 11.)

Policy T-3.2 AIR
Promote and Encourage the Orderly and Timely Development of Commercial
and General Aviation Facilities
This needs to be carefully reviewed on a periodic basis, as urban growth continues.
Implementing Action:
3.2.a    Implement the Merced Regional Airport Master Plan and update as necessary.
         The Master Plan, adopted in 2007, outlines the course for long-term development of the
         Merced Regional Airport. It concluded that the existing airfield would meet the needs of the
         community for the next 20 years, and thus focused on refinements to existing facilities and the
         preservation of options for future development.
Policy T-3.3 AIR
Provide Adequate Ground                  Transportation        Systems      that   Complement         Air
Transportation Facilities.
Circulation planning in the general area needs to keep transportation needs of the airport and its
adjacent industrial area firmly in mind.
Implementing Action:
3.3.a    As development in the area around the Merced Regional Airport takes place,
         consideration should be given to providing transit and truck access to airport facilities.
         Good transit and truck access to the Merced Regional Airport and its surrounding industrial
         areas is necessary to maintaining an economically-viable facility. Enhanced access from State
         Highways 99, 59, and 140 to the Airport area should be a high priority in this regard.
Policy T-3.4 RAIL
Reduce Rail System Impacts on Circulation within the Urban Area.
The City needs to continue to review and evaluate possible ways to reduce impacts of the rail system
on the City’s circulation efficiency. The two sets of railroad tracks, Union Pacific (UP) and Burlington
Northern & Santa Fe (BNSF), which bisect the community make cross-town trips more difficult given
the limited number of crossings.
Implementing Actions:
3.4.a    Review land use decisions in the vicinity of major at-grade railroad crossings to avoid the
         creation of unnecessary land use and circulation conflicts within areas that already
         experience special problems.
         When feasible, any land use decisions in these areas should be evaluated in an effort to see if
         any prospective future conflicts, such as traffic signal and driveway locations, can be reduced
         or mitigated.
3.4.b    Continue to seek approval of additional at-grade and separated-grade railroad crossings
         in the urban area.
                                                   4-67

Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
Chapter 4--Transportation and Circulation
         Public Utility Commission (PUC) regulations are very stringent and it is quite difficult to
         obtain approval for new at-grade rail crossings. This creates a real handicap to urban areas,
         and especially to those areas that are experiencing significant growth like Merced. It is
         important to continue to pursue PUC approval of additional rail crossings for the Merced
         urban area.
 3.4.c   Continue efforts to develop separated-grade railroad crossings as needed in the future.
         Construction of the G Street/BNSF Railroad Underpass will provide the City with a centrally-
         located separated-grade railroad crossing which would provide uninterrupted emergency
         access across Merced from north to south. Construction of this crossing began in 2010 and is
         due for completion by 2012. In the future, the City should consider if other at-grade crossings
         could be upgraded to separated-grade crossing if funding exists. New separated-grade
         crossings at the BNSF tracks would be necessary to complete the Parsons Avenue Corridor
         and Campus Parkway projects, and Caltrans has plans to upgrade the Bradley Overhead on
         Highway 140.
 3.4.d   Continue to communicate with railroad companies relating to traffic stoppage situations.
         Attempt to work with the rail companies to reduce as much as feasible conflicts that currently
         develop between trains and waiting vehicles at the City’s existing at-grade railroad crossings,
         particularly during peak-hour traffic times.
 Policy T-3.5 RAIL
 Support Enhanced Railroad Passenger Service and High Speed Rail for Merced.
 The City should work to keep all options available to Merced for future passenger service
 improvements in the Central Valley.
 Implementing Actions:
 3.5.a   Support efforts to extend existing rail passenger service directly to both Los Angeles and
         Sacramento.
         This would make rail service more convenient for passengers using the service from Merced
         and other Central Valley communities.
 3.5.b   Support efforts to provide high speed rail passenger service to the Central Valley
         including a stop in Merced. Work with the High Speed Rail Authority to determine the
         appropriate location for the Merced Station.
         Such service would offer enhanced rail opportunities for Central Valley communities. A stop
         in Merced has been planned. As further details become available, the City will work with
         involved agencies regarding preservation of right-of-way and station locations. Refer to the
         Land Use Element (Policy L-3.5) for further information regarding the development of a
         Transit-Oriented Development Overlay Zone around a future High Speed Rail Station in
         Downtown Merced.
 3.5.c   Plan the area around new commuter, passenger, and mainline rail stations to provide
         convenient and safe pedestrian and bicycle access and connections to the transit system.
         Just as the City’s Downtown Transpo Center is a primary transfer station for public transit and
         private bus services, the area around any high speed rail station or other commuter rail system
         should accommodate all modes of public and private transit. The City will continue to work
         with the High Speed Rail Authority and Amtrak to create and expand such facilities.

 Policy T-3.6 RAIL
 Retain and Expand as Needed Rail Facilities Serving Industrial Development.
 Two industrial areas (the Western Industrial Park and Santa Fe Industrial Park) currently offer access
 to rail connections, and it is important for these facilities to remain available as long as this is a
 viable industrial service.
 Implementing Action:
 3.6.a    When feasible seek to retain the availability of industrially-designated land in proximity
          to railroad tracks for industrial activities that actually require rail service.
          Underdeveloped industrial land adjacent to the Western Industrial Park and Santa Fe Industrial
          Park is designated on the Land Use Diagram. Other uses, such as rail transfer facilities, should
          be considered that would take advantage of the proximity of rail to many Merced industrial
          areas.

Functional road classification categorizes each existing street or proposed street according to its
primary function. This creates a hierarchical system as the basis for establishing standards,
designing streets, selecting necessary traffic control measures, establishing a priority for
construction, and measuring the quality of movement. In many cases, this system will also
define appropriate land uses, the intensity of development, and the location of public facilities.
The City’s classification system is based on functional categories used by County, Regional,
State, and Federal agencies.
The functional classification of streets and highways rests on the following concepts:
•    Streets and highways are classified into separate and distinct systems in accordance with their
     intended primary circulation purpose. Each system serves the movement of traffic and the
     access to property to a different degree.
•    Street classification governs design standards and construction and improvement priorities.
•    The City’s circulation system must be coordinated with the networks of the State and County.
•    All major streets and highways have continuity, logical termini, and adequate capacity to
     allow and provide a high quality of flow.
The functional classification system used in the Circulation Element and Map (Figure 4.1)
divides all streets and highways into categories. Table 4.2 found in Section 4.3.3 of the
Circulation Element and the cross-sections shown in Figure 4.20 through Figure 4.27e below
summarize the characteristics of each roadway category. These are illustrative characteristics
only. Official design requirements are found in the City of Merced’s Standard Designs of
Common Engineering Structures.
Bikeways
Class I Bikeways (Off-Street Bike Paths) are designed to serve corridors not served by streets and
highways, to provide recreational opportunities, or to provide high-speed commute routes for
bicycles. In Merced, such bikepaths are found along Bear, Black Rascal, Cottonwood, and
Fahrens Creeks, and will be expanded along powerline easements, canals, and abandoned
railroad corridors in the future. All bikeways are designed to meet Caltrans minimum standards.
Class II Bikeways (Bike Lanes), which provide striped lanes for bicycles along streets, are
included in the street cross-sections on the following pages.
Freeways/Highways
Freeways are major routes designed to carry large traffic volumes over long distances. Access is
controlled, and grade separations and median strips are used to separate lanes of traffic moving in
different directions. Through Merced, Route 99 is a four-lane freeway, elevated from about the
crossing of Bear Creek on the west, through the central part of the City, to the intersection of
Childs Avenue in the southeast area of the City. Its capacity for average daily traffic (ADT) is
approximately 55,000 to 60,000 vehicles. Portions of SR 99 through the City currently
                                                 4-71

Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
Chapter 4--Transportation and Circulation
accommodate more than 60,000 vehicles per day. Route 99’s role is interregional in character,
carrying both the traveling public and serving as a vital commercial link carrying goods and
produce to and from the community. State Routes 140 and 59, which are highways, function
more like major arterials in the City of Merced.
Expressways
Expressways are roads designed to carry traffic volumes intermediate between freeways and
major arterials. Opposing traffic is separated by wide medians, but speeds are usually somewhat
lower than freeways. Access is fully controlled. Expressways should be designed to include
separated Class I bike paths if feasible to provide a safe avenue for bike commuters.
Expressways are designed to have cross-traffic only at signalized intersections with Arterials or
higher order streets, located at approximately one-half to one-mile or greater intervals.
Intersections may be separated or at-grade.
Currently, there are no roadways within the City built to expressway standards. Campus
Parkway is ultimately envisioned to connect SR 99 to Yosemite Avenue. The expressway would
be constructed between the Mission Avenue interchange at State Route 99, with intersections
proposed at Mission Avenue, Gerard Avenue, Childs Avenue, Olive Avenue, and Yosemite
Avenue. An overpass will cross over the Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) Railway and the
adjacent State Route 140. The Campus Parkway north of Yosemite Avenue has not yet been
designed in detail and may require modified access spacing, right-of-way, and/or alignment.
Standards for the design of Campus Parkway north of Yosemite Avenue will need to be defined
in the University Community Plan and any subsequent modifications.

Major Arterials
Major arterials are roads typically designed for new growth areas. They are intended to carry
moderately heavy traffic volumes at moderate speeds on longer intra-city and cross-town trips, to
regional destinations, and to State/Interstate routes for continuing longer trips. The extensions of
State Route 59, “R,” and “G” Streets (north of Yosemite Avenue in the North Merced growth
area) are classified as “major arterials.” Access is controlled, crossings are at-grade.

                                                                Chapter 4--Transportation and Circulation
There are medians between traffic traveling in opposite directions. Expanded arterial
intersections are generally at every mile, where they intersect a divided arterial or higher order
street (beginning with and north of Cardella Road in the North Merced growth area). Intervening
intersections with collector streets may be permitted every one-quarter mile (right-turn-in, right-
turn out movements only) and one-half mile (signalized four-way intersections with appropriate
median break).
The basic right-of-way for major arterials is typically 128 feet. At 970 feet from standard
arterials intersections, the basic right-of-way for the major arterial will typically begin expanding;
the maximum curb-to-curb width of 150 feet will be reached for the final 400 feet approaching
the major intersection, or as designed in those standards to be established in the City of Merced
Standard Designs of Common Engineering Structures. Access to abutting properties is restricted
to internal streets or frontage roads. Parking is prohibited. Capacity varies depending upon lane
width, lateral clearance, and distance between intersections. Major arterials should provide bike
lanes and be heavily landscaped to give them a parkway-type character and to identify their
function to the driver.
                                             Figure 4.21
                               Major Arterial/Arterial Cross-Sections
Divided Arterials and Minor Arterials
Divided Arterial streets are designed to carry moderate traffic volumes at lower speeds than
Arterials and Major Arterials. Divided Arterials, like higher order roadways, have medians to
control cross-traffic. Presently, parts of Olive Avenue, “M” Street, “G” Street, and “R” Street
(south of Yosemite Avenue) are designed and function as divided arterials. The main function of
divided arterials is to accommodate trips within the City, providing the basic transportation links
between various land uses and major destinations, and other medium-distance movements.
Separate turning lanes are usually provided and signals control major intersections. Expanded
Arterial intersections are presently required on, and north of, Cardella Road for major street
intersections such as expressways, major arterials, divided arterials, and other arterials.
                                                  4-73

Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
Chapter 4--Transportation and Circulation
The basic right-of-way (ROW) for Divided Arterials is typically 118 feet, and each leg of the
standard Divided Arterial intersection forms a curb-to-curb ROW of 138 feet for a length of 400
feet, and narrows to the basic ROW at 780 feet from the intersection, or is designed as found in
those standards to be established in the City of Merced Standard Designs of Common
Engineering Structures. Curb cuts for driveways are located away from intersections and limited
to only essential access points. Restrictions may be placed on entering and exiting. Curbside
parking is not allowed in most cases. Turnouts for transit stops should be considered.
Undivided arterials (Minor Arterials) should have a right-of-way of at least 94 feet wide. Minor
Arterials are often designated in older portions of the City, particularly in areas where trends such
as changing land uses and increasing traffic require larger streets but existing development limits
the amount of land available for street right-of-way. Landscaping and lighting should be
designed to emphasize and identify the importance of the street. Parsons Avenue/Gardner Road
is an example of a Minor Arterial.

Transitways
A transitway is a special category of Arterial Street that is designed to accommodate a higher
level of transit service than provided on standard arterial streets. They may be exclusive (for
transit only) or may permit a mix of auto and transit vehicles. For those that also function as
major arterials or arterials, such as M Street south of Cardella and Bellevue Road, the right-of-
way requirements will be the same as for a major arterial or arterials, but the cross section may
change to provide HOV lanes. In newly developing areas, transitway segments that
accommodate only local traffic (Figure 4.23) can be alternated with exclusive “transit-only”
segments.
Mixed transitways will accommodate two high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes for express
buses, two travel lanes for other vehicles, bicycle routes, and special landscaping within the
cross-section for a divided arterial or major arterial/arterial (118 or 128 feet). New transitways
should be designed to facilitate future conversion to a trolley or light rail system when volumes
warrant it. In already-developed areas, transitways are usually mixed, with exclusive bus or
HOV lanes designated for the curb lane within the existing rights-of-way.

Collector Streets
Collector streets are designed to channel traffic from local streets into the major street system and
to handle short trips within neighborhoods. They distribute and collect traffic which is generated
in the area circumscribed by major streets. They provide for movement within industrial,
commercial, and residential areas, or for connecting adjacent land uses. Speeds are generally low
due to pedestrian activity and the frequent access to abutting land uses.
Collectors normally have just two lanes of traffic with right-of-ways up to 74 feet (except larger
where a median strip is included). Parking may be prohibited in selected areas where the
pavement width is needed for traffic capacity (or when certain design factors have been
incorporated into the street design).
Examples of streets that originally were intended to fulfill the function of a residential collector
in built-up areas of the community include Loughborough Drive, East Alexander Avenue, or East
21st Street. Often such examples illustrate the difficult functional balance expected of collectors
-- to serve as a safe residential street within a neighborhood(s) while also acting as an efficient
traffic conduit carrying an increasing number of vehicles to important destinations.
Residential Collector
A residential collector that does not meet Major Residential Collector status but does end in a
signalized terminus at a major street (or whose terminus is intended for future signalization--
Figure 4.24). If feasible, they should have no lots accessing them within 300 feet of the
existing/future signalized intersection.
                                                                           Figure 4.24

                   Collector Street Alternate
 NOTES FOR ALTERNATE COLLECTOR:
 1) 68 feet of right-of-way may be permitted where supported by a traffic analysis
    to assure that the narrower street would not be overloaded. Analysis would             Collector
    include trip generation and distribution based on existing and future land use
    and circulation system. Additional width may be necessary at intersection
    where analysis shows need for turn lane(s).
 2) Fronting lots would be permitted on collectors where a traffic analysis shows
    daily traffic volumes will not exceed 1,500 vehicles under ultimate conditions.
 3) On-street parking may be deleted if adequate, convenient off-street parking is
    provided in a subdivision design.
 4) A subdivision design with deletion of on-street bike lanes may be permitted if
    adequate, convenient Class I bikepath is available.
                                                                                    4-77
Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
Chapter 4--Transportation and Circulation
Major Residential Collector
As feasible in new growth areas ( and where possible within the existing street systems in built-
up areas) the prospective Village Circulation concept (Figure 4.25) will identify and define a
Major Residential Collector as a collector street 1) with 1,500 ADT or higher; 2) that is one-half
mile or longer in uninterrupted length; 3) whose terminus is at an existing signalized intersection
or at a higher order street whose intersection is identified for future signalization; 4) which is
connected to other neighborhoods; and 5) is expected to be the recipient of traffic from outside
its primary service area to access major destinations. (Uninterrupted length means no offset or
similar interruption that would result in traffic being distributed to any significant degree to
another route.) These streets where feasible shall not have lots either fronting upon them or
accessing from them. There is no difference in ROW between a major collector and a residential
collector.
Local Streets
Local streets primarily provide access to destinations within residential neighborhoods or
business districts. Local streets include local through-streets, local cul-de-sacs, and alleys. In
residential areas, these are the streets upon which houses front and/or access. Therefore, it is
important to minimize through-traffic to a maximum degree by using curvilinear alignments,
looped streets, and T-intersections. They should be designed to carry no more traffic than is
required to serve the abutting land uses at low travel speed, and usually permit parking on at least
one side.

Rural Roads
Rural roads may be arterials or major or minor collector streets, depending upon their traffic-
carrying requirements, adjacent land uses, or special circumstances. Separate turning lanes,
passing lanes, curbs, gutters, and sidewalks are provided only where necessary or when the area
is planned for future urbanization. Design details may vary, but this type of road should reflect
consideration of an existing environment and the future development of the area. In
unincorporated areas that are within or adjacent to the City’s Sphere of Influence or Specific
Urban Development Plan (SUDP)/growth boundary, adequate right-of-way should be reserved,
and direct access to a roadway should be restricted. At a minimum, adequate building setbacks
should be required so that it is easier to widen roads when the area eventually develops to urban
densities.
Special Arterial, Collector, or Local Streets
These are special streets which do not use normal design sections. These streets are designated
where conditions warrant special designs, such as absence of curb and gutter adjacent to
permanent agricultural areas, insufficient right-of-way, State highway needs, physical boundaries,
or older existing neighborhoods. Variations in right-of-way width, curb-to-curb width,
requirement of improvements, etc., may be permitted for these special streets. Several special
street sections are discussed on the following pages.
 “M” Street
M Street needs a greater right-of-way to accommodate the preservation of existing trees in the
center median area (Figure 4.27a). “M” Street normally has 94-foot right-of-way because of its
“arterial” status. However, a special street section from Black Rascal Creek to approximately
University Avenue requires a width of approximately 153.5 feet to accommodate a larger center
median area. This section of “M” Street is also designated as a scenic corridor.

Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
Chapter 4--Transportation and Circulation
North Bear Creek Drive
North Bear Creek Drive is designated as a “special street” in order to maintain its status as a
“Scenic Corridor.” This designation should apply from a point approximately 400 feet east of
16th Street, in the vicinity of Highway 59 (the point at which West North Bear Creek Drive turns
northward away from Bear Creek), to McKee Road. North Bear Creek Drive is a roadway
immediately adjacent to the Bear Creek open space corridor for the entire length of this
designated area and, as such, is party to visual and acoustic opportunities rarely available to
urban area dwellers except in special open space areas. This special atmosphere has, historically,
been augmented by the proximity of large trees, forming a heavy canopy, and lush natural and
maintained growth along North Bear Creek Drive.
This semi-natural state has been possible because a number of typical urban roadside
improvements (curb, gutter, sidewalks, streetlights, etc.) were not required along this corridor
because nearly all of the development was constructed when this area was outside the City. An
irrigation canal is present along with side berms on both sides, which are often heavily planted
and in close proximity to the roadway. This would be not likely if traditional roadside
infrastructure were constructed. Therefore, this section of North Bear Creek Drive should
continue to be exempt from installing such improvements unless they become necessary for
safety reasons in the future.
Other Special Streets
The following streets also require special sections because of non-standard rights-of-way or curb-
to-curb widths and other special circumstances:
•    Childs Avenue between West Avenue and Martin Luther King Jr. Way (Figure 4.27b)
•    Highway 140 from V Street to 207 feet west of “X” Street (Figure 4.27c)
•    Yosemite Park Way from 21st Street to Bradley Overpass (Figure 4.27d)
•    “R” Street between Highway 99 and Childs Avenue (Figure 4.27e)
•    Yosemite Avenue, East of Parsons/Gardner (Figure 4.27f)
Bellevue Community Plan Streets
The unique street cross-sections and design features of roads and rights-of-way within the
Bellevue Community Plan as described in that plan take precedence over comparable language of
the Merced Vision 2030 General Plan.

4.8.2 Intersection Spacing and Design Standards
In order to provide for maximum traffic volumes on Arterial streets, access must be controlled,
intersections must be carefully spaced, and adequate capacity must be built into each intersection.
The design and spacing standards listed below apply to those areas within the City’s Specific
Urban Development Plan (SUDP) and Sphere of Influence. They are generalized standards and
apply to the most common conditions. Detailed traffic studies for specific development projects
may indicate that higher level of improvements may be required, or that lesser standards may be
permitted.
Intersection Spacing Standards for Major Arterial Streets
•   Major four-way intersections (intersections of future major arterial, arterial and divided
    arterials with expressways and other divided arterials and higher order streets) should be no
    closer than (approximate) one-mile intervals.
•   Intervening four-way signalized intersections of future Major Arterials with (major) collector
    streets should be no closer than +1/2-mile. Intervening four-way signalized intersections of
    future Arterials with (major) collector streets should be no closer than +1/4-mile. These
    distances should be proportionately adjusted if the distance between adjacent parallel arterial
    streets is more or less than the base one-mile distance.
•   Right-turn intersections (right-turn-in/right-turn-out) of future Major Arterials with collector
    streets may be permitted at +1/4-mile intervals. Free right-turn intersections of future
    Arterials with local streets may be permitted at +1/8-mile intervals at the City’s discretion.
    These standards are illustrated graphically for North Merced in Figure 4.3.
Intersection Design Standards
Intersections are critical components of a circulation system. They frequently overload before
the rest of the system and adversely affect adjacent arterial streets. In order to serve the high
traffic volumes projected for future arterial streets, adequate capacity must be built into the
intersection or enough right-of-way must be preserved for future expansion. Curb cuts adjacent
to and within the intersection tapers must be restricted or prohibited.
Summarized below are general right-of-way and design standards for standard intersections.
More detailed descriptions of requirements are established in the City of Merced Standard
Designs of Common Engineering Structures.
Like intersection spacing standards, these are general standards for the most common situations.
Detailed intersection design studies may demonstrate that a higher level of improvements may be
required (like at the intersections of an expressway and an arterial), or a lesser design may be
permitted.

Major Arterial/Arterial
Right-of-way width shall be 150 feet starting at the intersection and going back 400 feet, then the
right-of-way tapers to 128 feet at a point 970 feet from intersection.
This configuration will permit three through-lanes in each direction, with double left- and single
right-turn lanes. Bike lanes should be added to the extent safe and feasible within the proposed
right-of-way.
Divided Arterial
Right-of-way width shall be 140 feet starting at the intersection and going back 400 feet. The
right-of-way tapers to 118 feet at a point 780 feet from intersection.
This configuration permits two through-lanes in each direction, with double left-turn lanes and a
single right-turn lane. Bike lanes should be added to the extent safe and feasible within the

        (2) “C+” indicates Level-of-Service (LOS) “C+” or better, including LOS A and B.
        (3) The number of lanes shown is the number of lanes planned in the circulation element; additional travel lanes,

             that traffic amounts in the BCP area are 20% lower than the General Plan conclusions and, therefore,
             recommends that further traffic studies occur to determine whether fewer travel lanes could be supported.

5.4 PUBLIC SERVICES AND FACILITIES GOALS, POLICIES, AND
       ACTIONS
 Goal Area P-1: Public Facilities and Services
 GOALS
     Maintenance and Improvement of Merced's Existing Infrastructure
     New Development Which Includes a Full Complement of Infrastructure and Municipal
      Public Facilities
     Efficient and Cost-Effective Public Service Delivery
 POLICIES
 P-1.1   Provide adequate public infrastructure and municipal services to meet the needs of future
         development.
 P-1.2   Utilize existing infrastructure and public service capacities to the maximum extent possible
         and provide for the logical, timely and economically efficient extension of municipal
         infrastructure and services where necessary.
 P-1.3   Require new development to provide or pay for its fair share of public facility and
         infrastructure improvements.
 Policy P-1.1
 Provide Adequate Public Infrastructure and Municipal Services to Meet the Needs of
 Future Development.
 One of the key elements to promoting a healthy local economy in Merced is the quality of life enjoyed
 by the City’s residents. The quality and availability of urban services and infrastructure is found to
 be an important measure of urban quality of life. It is understood that facilities and infrastructure
 not provided by the City is the planning and funding responsibility of other governmental, quasi-
 public, or private entities.
 Implementing Actions:
 1.1.a   Through development review and long range planning efforts, ensure that utilities are
         adequately sized to accommodate the proposed development and, if applicable, allow for
         extensions for future developments, consistent with master plans.
         Improvement standards applied through the long range planning and/or development review
         processes should be based upon existing and potential utility needs to a site as well as existing
         and potential utility needs in surrounding areas. The review process will consider both
         municipal utility services and utility services provided by quasi-public or private utility service
         providers as much as feasible. It is understood, however, that facilities and infrastructure not
         provided by the City is the planning and funding responsibility of other governmental, quasi-
         public, or private entities.

Chapter 5--Public Services and Facilities
 1.1.b    Master municipal infrastructure plans for newly developing areas may be prepared and
          adopted as necessary.
          The City may prepare master infrastructure plans for newly developing areas. Individual
          development proposals will need to develop plans and specifications for accessing planned
          City infrastructure.
 1.1.c    Include in Community Plans, Specific Plans and master plans, a phasing plan for
          providing access, sewer, water, drainage, flood control, schools, parks and other
          appropriate governmental facilities and services.
          A phasing plan helps ensure that adequate service facilities can be accommodated in the
          planning area and that new facilities and services will be provided in a manner that keeps pace
          with population growth. It is understood, however, that facilities and infrastructure not
          provided by the City is the planning and funding responsibility of other governmental, quasi-
          public, or private entities.
 1.1.d    Construct the storm water drainage, water and sewer systems in accordance with
          adopted master plans.
          City Master Plans identify needed infrastructure improvements and extensions, phasing
          options, cost estimates and potential funding alternatives.
 1.1.e    Apply for Federal, State and regional funding sources set aside to finance infrastructure
          costs to the maximum extent feasible.
          Use of public funding sources to help off-set infrastructure costs could benefit the entire
          community by increasing housing and employment opportunities.
 Policy P-1.2
 Utilize Existing Infrastructure and Public Service Capacities to the Maximum Extent
 Possible and Provide For the Logical, Timely and Economically Efficient Extension
 of Infrastructure and Services.
 It is in the community’s interest to maintain an efficient and cost effective public service delivery
 system. To this end, the City supports development that utilizes and improves existing infrastructure
 and service delivery systems as much as possible.
 Implementing Actions:
 1.2.a    Develop plans which establish priorities to address existing inadequacies in the City's
          infrastructure system.
          Current sewer, water, drainage and circulation plans shall to be reviewed and updated to
          reflect planned and existing circumstances. The updates should identify existing system
          deficiencies and propose corrective measures.
 1.2.b    Expand existing facilities to the extent possible at present locations.
          As long as it remains cost-effective, existing facilities (such as the Wastewater Treatment
          Plant) should be expanded at their present locations to save the cost of obtaining and
          constructing new municipal facilities. Long term facility development plans should include

        adequate area for future expansion. Shared or regional facilities are also encouraged where
        appropriate to avoid duplication of services. However, if not possible, new municipal facilities
        should be located in central locations, close to the residents being served.
1.2.c   Periodically evaluate the City’s service delivery system and identify policies and
        programs which may improve operating efficiency and/or reduce service delivery costs.
        The City shall on a continuing basis evaluate its municipal service delivery systems to search
        for ways of improving efficiency and service, reducing costs, etc.
Policy P-1.3
Require New Development To Provide or Pay For its Fair Share of Municipal Public
Facility and Infrastructure Improvements.
New growth and development within the City is accommodated to assure that adequate space is
provided to meet future population growth needs. The City will endeavor to provide for cost-effective
new infrastructure and public service expansion to serve that growth. It is the City’s policy, however,
that new development should not create a financial burden for existing City residents and that all new
development should be more self supporting with respect to infrastructure availability, maintenance,
and future municipal service provision.
Implementing Actions:
1.3.a   Prepare and adopt adequate fee schedules commensurate with the cost of planned
        improvements and services, with annual review and update.
        The City shall review and periodically update its public services and facilities fee structure to
        assure that it adequately provides for the maintenance of City service levels.
1.3.b   Periodically evaluate the City’s service delivery system and identify policies and
        programs which may be applied to new development to improve operating efficiency
        and/or reduce service delivery costs.
        Design elements and standards for new development should be periodically upgraded to reflect
        modern technological advances and standards. Standards should be developed to minimize
        long-term operations, maintenance, and replacement costs.
1.3.c   All new development shall contribute its fair share of the cost of on-site and off-site
        public infrastructure and municipal services as appropriate.
        This could include installation of public facilities, payment of impact fees, and annexation to
        the City Communities Facilities District for annual operating costs of City services. New
        development shall provide adequate financing, as necessary, to meet all identified costs
        associated with new development, including, but not limited to, public facilities and municipal
        services where nexus can be shown. It is understood, however, that facilities and
        infrastructure not provided by the City is the planning and funding responsibility of other
        governmental, quasi-public, or private entities.

 1.3.d   The City may require developments to install off-site facilities which also benefit other
         properties.
         The City may establish funding mechanisms to reimburse developers for infrastructure
         capacity in excess of the fair share costs resulting from a specific development’s impacts if
         these excess facilities are deemed necessary to efficient and orderly development.
 1.3.e   Master Plans, Community Plans, General Plan amendments, pre-zoning, and annexation
         proposals, through the Development Agreement process, shall ensure that infrastructure
         development and public facilities and municipal services are consistent with overall local
         public agency plans, and that the local public agencies can reasonably provide and/or
         extend services within the proposed development time frame of implementation.
         Master Plans, Community Plans, General Plan amendments, pre-zoning, and annexation
         proposals prepared for areas subject to annexation to the City shall include an evaluation
         (prepared by the applicants with input from the City, School Districts, and other service
         providers) of all infrastructure, public facilities, and services under the jurisdiction of all local
         public agencies. These Plans for Service should include an evaluation of existing
         infrastructure and services, future public facilities and services required to serve the
         development, and the timing and funding of such public facilities and municipal services. The
         determination of the ability to reasonably provide or extend services for purposes of this
         implementing action rests with the City Council when considering the master plan, community
         plan, or annexation as a whole.
 1.3.f   Consider changes to the Public Facilities Financing Plan and Public Facilities Impact Fee
         program, under applicable provisions of law, to reflect lower fees for “in-fill”
         development, transit-oriented development, and new development within the 2015 SUDP
         vs. areas being added to the SUDP/SOI in the Merced Vision 2030 General Plan.
         The Public Facilities Financing Plan and Public Facilities Impact Fee Program will need to be
         updated after the adoption of the new Merced Vision 2030 General Plan in order to reflect the
         proposed SUDP/SOI and more infrastructure projects within those areas. At the same time,
         the City should consider whether lower impact fees should be offered to those developments
         that are closer to current City infrastructure and services, such as “in-fill” development within
         the existing City limits, transit-oriented development, and areas within the existing 2015
         SUDP. This would also discourage “leap-frog” development within the SUDP/Sphere of
         Influence. This would also be in keeping with greenhouse gas reduction and agricultural
         preservation goals to discourage City development far from existing infrastructure.

Policy P-2.1
Maintain and Enhance Public Protection Facilities, Equipment, and Personnel to the
Maximum Extent Feasible Within the Resource Constraints of the City to Serve the
City's Needs
Public protection services and facilities are to be maintained in the City of Merced at a level that
promotes the health and welfare of the City’s residents. The City is committed to assuring that
facilities, equipment and staffing levels of its fire and police service units meet the highest standard
that can be accommodated within the resource constraints of the City.
Implementing Actions:
2.1.a    Periodically review existing and potential station facilities, equipment and staffing levels
         in light of protection service needs.
         Fire-fighting equipment and companies of personnel should be sufficient in number and
         adequately distributed throughout the planning area in order to allow optimum response time
         to calls within the primary service areas of a fire station and to ensure prompt availability of
         additional companies for serious or simultaneous fires.          Police service districts should be
         sized to promote community-based policing concepts and to maintain sufficient personnel to
         promote crime prevention and to combat criminal activity.
2.1.b    Determine that new development is adequately served by fire and police protection
         services.
         Subject to the resource constraints of the City, fire stations should be located so that no
         development within the City is located outside the primary response time objectives (4 to 6
         minutes, at least 90 percent of the time) for at least one fire station. Development plans should
         be reviewed with respect to existing and planned future fire station sites and police resources.
         Consider the use of closed circuit TV systems to enhance security in new developments.
2.1.c    Fire station sites should be selected based on the distribution of land uses and population
         projected when the area is fully developed.
         Future sites should be located within planned urban service centers based on future use.
2.1.d    Ease of access should be a primary consideration in selecting a fire station site.
         The following guidelines should be considered when locating new firehouse facilities:
         a) Fire stations should be located on streets close to and leading into major or secondary
              thoroughfares.
         b) Fire stations should be located such that delays caused by incomplete street patterns are
              minimized, and developments required to minimize incomplete street segments or be
              required to complete those sections concurrent with the early phases of development.
         c) A fire station should be near the center of its primary service area, measured in terms of
              driving time to the periphery of this area.
         d) Fire stations should be convenient to high value areas of commercial or industrial districts,

         e) Fire stations should be located, as much as feasible, away from other uses which may be
             sensitive to the noise impacts of frequent alarms.
         f) Fire stations and their sites should be designed to fit in with their surroundings, including
             consideration of open spaces, off-street parking, landscaping, and general appearances,
             especially when located in residential districts.
         g) In residential service areas, fire stations should be located in or near those sections which
             have the highest density.
 2.1.e   Maintain an adequate and reliable water system to serve fire protection needs.
         An adequate and reliable water system is a key element in maintaining adequate fire protection
         to the community. In fact, the adequacy of the water system is one of the primary criteria
         used for determining the City’s fire protection rating from the Insurance Services Office (refer
         to Section 5.2.1).
 2.1.f   Provide fire facilities and related resources to support the Fire Department Facilities
         Master Plan and any subsequent updates.
         In order to maintain fire insurance ratings and the plan for additional stations, fire facilities
         should be provided and sited to support the current Fire Department Facilities Master Plan and
         any subsequent updates.
 2.1.g   Utilize existing community resources, to the maximum extent feasible, in the provision of
         public protection services.
         The City should continue participation in and support community level crime prevention
         programs such as the Neighborhood Watch, VIP (Volunteer In Police), and Community
         Emergency Response Team (CERT) programs.
 2.1.h   Assure that new development utilizes modern public protection concepts in their design
         and development.
         Development review processes should involve public protection service providers in the City.
         Public protection planning concepts such as “defensible space,” security lighting, access,
         visibility, closed-circuit TV surveillance, etc., may be applied to new development to reduce
         policing problems and improve police effectiveness.

Policy P-3.1
Ensure That Adequate Water Supply Can Be Provided Within the City's Service
Area, Concurrent With Service Expansion and Population Growth.
According to the Merced Water Supply Plan and the Urban Water Management Plan, the City of
Merced currently has adequate water resources and will continue to do so if they are properly
managed to meet its future growth needs. The City must continue to work closely with the Merced
Irrigation District (MID) in order to ensure that these resources remain stable. The City of Merced is
committed to a program of cooperating in the long-term management of the area’s water resources
and utilizing policies and programs which conserve and manage water use in such a manner as to
maintain the potable quality of the City’s system and reduce treatment costs on applications which do
not require the use of treated water.
Implementing Actions:
3.1.a    Pursue innovative programs to reduce the demand for potable (“drinkable”) water.
         The City should explore programs for utilizing untreated water since many urban water uses
         do not require treated, “drinkable” water. Non-treated water can be used for landscape
         irrigation, industrial processing, and other uses. Possible sources of non-treated water might
         include: (1) MID surface water supplies; (2) storm water; or (3) reclaimed water.
3.1.b    Update the City's Water Master Plan and Urban Water Management Plan as needed.
         The updates shall include a detailed analysis of adequacy of existing and planned water
         distribution and storage facilities to meet minimum pressure and flow requirements throughout
         the existing and future service area. The Updates should integrate the principles of the Merced
         Water Supply Plan and plan for recharge facilities. The Water Master Plan update shall utilize
         the entire City SOI/SUDP area as its boundary. The update shall serve as a basis for
         calculating development connection fees and shall establish standards for on-site requirements
         for water system design on new development projects. The Urban Water Management Plan is
         required to be updated every 5 years with the next update due in July 2011.
3.1.c    Review the current water system maintenance program and coordinate planned water
         main replacements with the updated Water Master Plan.
         Plans must be reviewed in light of needed system upgrades to service an expanded service area
         and assure that appropriate facilities are resized to meet future demands, rather than replace
         existing system components without consideration for future requirements. Upgrades and
         replacements should be scheduled prior to substantial deterioration of facilities in order to
         avoid service disruptions.
3.1.d    Continue to work with MID and the County of Merced to ensure that adequate water
         supply and distribution facilities can be developed to meet the growth of the Merced
         metropolitan area.
         Coordination will not necessarily require the development of common water supply and
         distribution facilities among the agencies involved. The primary goal of such coordination
         shall be the development of individual agency, or joint agency, programs and facilities that
         will meet the water supply needs of the current, and future, metropolitan area while protecting
         the area's valuable natural resource by maintaining a water balance between the extraction of
         groundwater and recharge to the groundwater aquifer.

Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
Chapter 5--Public Services and Facilities
 3.1.e    Continue to support policies and programs which prohibit the use of private wells and
          water systems within the City limits.
          Private wells are normally drilled at smaller depths than City-owned wells, which tends to
          make them more vulnerable to contamination. City wells are also consistently monitored to
          assure health and safety standards. For these reasons, the City does not generally allow the
          use of new private wells within the City limits.
 3.1.f    Plan and design water facilities to efficiently serve the City’s urban area.
          Water lines along the urban fringe, however, will need to be adequately sized in order to
          achieve efficient “looping” and reliability of the water system and adequate fire flow.
 3.1.g    The City shall not extend water service outside its incorporated limits, except under
          limited circumstances.
          City policy requires that an area be annexed to the City before City water can be provided.
          Exceptions to this policy include emergencies where public health and safety are threatened or
          a significant public interest is served, such as the UC campus or as otherwise determined by
          the City Council. (Refer to the Urban Expansion Chapter for other policies which relate to
          the UC.)
 3.1.h    The City will convert flat-rate water services to water meters in compliance with the
          California State Water Code Section 527.
          The City will continue its program of converting flat-rate water services to water meters (just
          as required of all new construction for many years) in compliance with the timelines and
          provisions of California State Water Code Section 527.
 [Note: The Urban Expansion Chapter (2) includes policies regarding the extension of City services to
 outlying areas. The Open Space, Conservation, & Recreation Chapter (7) contains policies relating to
 water quality and water conservation. The Sustainable Development Chapter (8) also contains a
 discussion of water resources.]
 Policy P-3.2
 In Cooperation with the County and the Merced Irrigation District Work to Stabilize
 the Region’s Aquifer.
 Studies have concluded that the long-term potable water needs of the City can best be served through
 the use of the area’s groundwater resources. To the same degree, there is a need to improve and
 enhance the ability to utilize surface water resources and to develop groundwater recharge facilities
 for the long-term stabilization of the regional aquifer. The City has historically cooperated with the
 Merced Irrigation District to preserve and enhance the regional water resources and is committed to
 continuing this cooperation.
 Implementing Actions:
 3.2.a   Work closely with the State and County agencies in exploring innovative technology and
         procedures for water conservation and recycling.

        The State Department of Water Resources and Department of Health, along with the County
        Environmental Health Department, can provide the City and MID with resources and
        information on innovative water conservation and reuse strategies. The overall goal of the
        program should be to conserve water pumped from wells and promote development of systems
        that can utilize non-treated or recycled water where appropriate.
3.2.b   Work cooperatively with MID to preserve and enhance its surface water delivery system.
        It is important that the viability of the MID irrigation system be preserved and enhanced to
        assure long term, cost-effective water supplies for area agricultural interests. MID’s water
        rights must also be protected. The long term strategy of promoting surface water use by area
        farms will reduce agricultural demands on the area’s groundwater resources and promote
        water conservation throughout the region.
        The existence of this historic agricultural water use system in the expanding urban area
        provides a significant future opportunity for the City to develop innovative means of landscape
        maintenance in addition to meeting some of the area’s groundwater recharge needs. This
        surface water system also provides an important open space element to the City’s urban
        environment.
3.2.c   Explore the use of MID water resources for applications that do not require treated
        water to reduce demand on the regional groundwater supplies and reduce costs of water
        treatment.
        By using surface water for uses such as landscape maintenance that do not require treated
        water, the City can reduce its demand on regional groundwater supplies and perhaps reduce
        the costs of water treatment.
3.2.d   Cooperate with MID and the County in the development of groundwater recharge
        facilities.
        Groundwater recharge has been identified as key to maintaining an adequate water supply into
        the future. Groundwater recharge can operate in conjunction with park and open space
        facilities incorporating the development of recreational lakes and use of storm water retention
        basins for summer recharge programs. Recharge facilities should be designed as multi-use
        facilities within the Merced urban area where feasible.
3.2.e   Obtain, purchase or preserve rights to open space such as transitioning agriculture lands
        for proposed major treatment plants, ground water recharge and storage facilities.
        Master plans should identify potential sites for such uses.

 Provide Adequate Wastewater Collection, Treatment and Disposal Capacity for
 Existing and Projected Future Needs.
 Future growth and development will depend on the availability of wastewater system capacity. The
 City is committed to keeping the City’s system current with respect to present and projected future
 needs of the growing urban area.
 Implementing Actions:
 4.1.a   Maintain and enhance the existing wastewater system to increase the lifetime of the
         system.
         The City shall utilize modern wastewater system management technology to identify
         deteriorating system components and replace or repair worn equipment as required.
 4.1.b   Develop and maintain wastewater master plans to serve future Merced urban expansion.
         The City shall review all existing wastewater master plans for comprehensiveness. Each
         master plan shall be reviewed to determine whether it accommodates for all planned growth
         within its boundaries and the immediate vicinity. Where planned growth areas are not
         accommodated for under existing wastewater master plans, the wastewater master plans shall
         either be revised or new master plans shall be created to accommodate for the planned growth
         areas and growth in these areas required to cover the cost of facilities.
 4.1.c   Coordinate wastewater planning activities with the County.
         The City and County should develop a joint strategy for accommodation of development in the
         Rural Residential areas to minimize ground water contamination from septic tank systems.
         Additionally, development proposed within the City’s SUDP/SOI and not yet annexed to the
         City or proposed within an area that will likely be annexed in the future should be reviewed by
         both the City and County to assure its future compatibility with the City’s wastewater
         collection, treatment and disposal plans.      Plans for servicing the UC Merced campus and
         University Community should also be coordinated.
 4.1.d   Prohibit the extension of wastewater service outside of City limits, except in unique
         circumstances.
         “Unique circumstances” is defined as a “substantial public use,” such as the UC campus,
         “health and safety” emergencies, or as otherwise determined by the City Council. In recent
         years, there has been some discussions regarding the desirability from an environmental and
         financial aspect of providing wastewater treatment on a “regional basis.” The City of Merced
         may want to consider initiating an analysis of possible costs and benefits of providing
         wastewater treatment to areas outside the City’s SUDP/SOI on a limited basis. Such an
         analysis, which should be financed by those entities wishing to utilize the City’s wastewater
         system, should consider the land use and governance implications (i.e. desire for City
         wastewater treatment is a significant incentive for annexation), as well as the engineering,
         environmental, and fiscal impacts of such an endeavor.

Policy P-4.2
Consider the Use of Reclaimed Water to Reduce Non-Potable Water Demands
Whenever Practical.
In future years, the urban expansion area of Merced may require the development of expanded
wastewater treatment systems as part of a long-term comprehensive wastewater treatment plan. In
Their design should incorporate beneficial use of treated wastewater. It is necessary that other
development components also be planned to incorporate the potential to utilize reclaimed water as a
primary or secondary disposal process.
Implementing Actions:
4.2.a   Consider the development of reclaimed water systems, including pipelines, pump stations
        and storage ponds.
        Design and development would be dependent upon proximity of the system to potential users.
4.2.b   Consider conducting a reclaimed water market study to identify potential users.
        Potential users include cemeteries, industrial users, agricultural irrigation, golf courses, and
        transit corridor parkways. The use of reclaimed water as a part of the overall groundwater
        recharge strategy for the region can also be studied. In general, the use of reclaimed water for
        uses that have a high degree of evapo-transporation (landscape irrigation) are more desirable
        for reuse strategies than groundwater recharge provided that adequate levels of treatment can
        be obtained to meet state health guidelines. The City should continue to explore with the
        Merced Irrigation District the exchange of reclaimed water for MID water if the exchange
        meets the water quality requirements of both entities and is economical.
4.2.c   Consider preparing a plan for the use of reclaimed water which evaluates the facilities
        and costs required to serve potential users, determines required capacities of facilities,
        and presents an implementation plan.
        As part of the long-term wastewater service plan for the City’s expansion areas, the use of
        reclaimed water should be studied as one of the alternatives to wastewater disposal with an
        analysis of additional treatment costs, costs of delivery of reclaimed water to a beneficial user,
        etc.

Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
Chapter 5--Public Services and Facilities
 Policy P-5.1
 Provide Effective Storm Drainage Facilities For Future Development.
 Merced is located in an area with little topographical relief. This results in poor drainage and
 potential flooding during peak storm events. The City presently relies on a combination of natural
 drainage courses, MID canals and storm water retention basins to manage storm waters. Urban
 expansion will require development of new long-term storm water facilities in the City’s urban area.
 The City is committed to providing overall coordination for the management of storm water within its
 urban limits and working cooperatively with other agencies in resolving regional storm water
 management issues.
 Implementing Actions:
 5.1.a   Continue to implement, the City’s Storm Water Master Plan and the Storm Water
         Management Plan and its control measures.
         The City’s Storm Water Management Plan, adopted in 2007, was required by the State to meet
         the National Pollution Discharge and Elimination System (NPDES) permitting requirements.
         Implementation of the control measures contained in the City’s Storm Water Management
         Plan are expected to result in significant reductions of pollutants discharged into receiving
         water bodies. Detention basins are to be developed and maintained under the jurisdiction of
         the City within the Merced urban area wherever feasible in accordance with the Storm Water
         Master Plan. The Merced Irrigation District has jurisdiction of flood waters deposited within
         its canal system and Merced County has responsibility for water deposited in the area’s natural
         drainage channels.
 5.1.b   Work with the MID and the County to update the City’s Storm Water Master Plan to
         account for changes in expected storm drainage runoff due to expanded land uses within
         the Merced area.
         The Storm Water Master Plan does not include all of the City’s proposed SUDP/SOI. The
         system will need to be reevaluated in light of new development plans. Since drainage issues
         cross jurisdictional lines, it is best to deal with these issues on a regional level. Therefore, the
         City of Merced will work with MID and/or the County to prepare a regional plan which will be
         designed to serve the needs of existing and future City development.
 5.1.c   Continue to require all development to comply with the Storm Water Master Plan and
         any subsequent updates.
         All new development proposals will be reviewed for consistency with the plan and shall be
         responsible for construction of storm water retention basins, collection, treatment and disposal
         facilities necessary to adequately support the project. Where development is proposed in an
         area which lacks basic drainage infrastructure at present, the development project may be
         required to construct the necessary improvements with non-project related costs to be
         reimbursed as other development occurs in the area.
 5.1.d   Installation or design of facilities necessary to provide services to development projects
         will be based on the full build-out scenario.

         Short-term or intermediate flood control and storm drainage facility improvements can result
         in higher long-term costs for ultimate system development and result in short-term flooding on
         adjacent areas. At the same time, if it can be demonstrated that an immediate development
         project’s storm water can be contained completely on-site without off-site impacts to the
         regional drainage system, such proposals can be approved provided that the project contribute
         its fair share towards the regional flood control and drainage system.
Policy P-5.2
Integrate Drainage Facilities With Bike Paths, Sidewalks, Recreation Facilities,
Agricultural Activities, Groundwater Recharge, and Landscaping.
In order to provide for the most cost effective infrastructure development and maintenance strategy,
the City is committed to a program of developing facilities that can accommodate multiple uses. To
this end, the City will identify multiple use sites throughout the Merced SUDP/SOI.
Implementing Actions:
5.2.a    Provide drainage channels in transportation or canal easement areas to the extent
         feasible.
         Reflect the planned regional street and open-space network to the degree possible when
         locating new future drainage facilities.
5.2.b    Storm water facilities shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the
         standards in the Parks and Open Space Master Plan and the Storm Water Master Plan.
         The City’s Parks and Open Space Master Plan and Storm Water Master Plan include design
         criteria and standards for joint use facilities. Design criteria include the use of rounded or
         sculpted edges, natural materials, and abundant landscaping.

Chapter 5--Public Services and Facilities
 Policy P-6.1
 Establish Programs to Recover Recyclable Materials and Energy From Solid Wastes
 Generated Within the City.
 State law mandates that the waste stream be reduced significantly and that local governments
 implement programs and activities to accomplish this objective. The City of Merced deems that it is in
 the City’s long term interest to support efforts to reduce the amount of solid waste deposited in the
 Merced County Regional Waste Management Authority’s landfill sites and support private and public
 recycling efforts.
 Implementing Actions:
 6.1.a   Continue to implement source reduction and recycling programs to minimize waste at
         the point of manufacture or use.
         Such programs should include the following:
         1) Continuing citywide recycling efforts for homes and businesses.
         2) Supporting public and private recycling efforts to divert wood, leaves and yard waste from
              being deposited in the landfill site.
         3) Assisting the private sector wherever possible in developing methods for the reuse of inert
              materials (concrete, asphalt and other building materials waste) which currently use
              valuable landfill space and increasing resource and material recovery from solid wastes.
 6.1.b   Work with Merced County Regional Waste Management Authority officials in seeking
         federal and state funds for projects utilizing resources and material recovery processes.
         Support efforts to obtain grants and loans to subsidize recycling center operations and to
         market recycled materials in the Merced urban area.
 6.1.c   Participate in resource and material recovery studies.
         Support Merced County Regional Waste Management Authority efforts to study the region’s
         waste stream and develop recovery methodologies that will facilitate and promote enhanced
         recycling efforts and further reduce the volume of waste material deposited in landfill sites.
 Policy P-6.2
 Minimize the Potential Impacts of Waste Collection, Transportation and Disposal
 Facilities Upon the Residents of Merced.
 The Merced County Regional Waste Management Authority landfill is located on the western side of
 the City’s expansion area along Highway 59. This facility will most likely be in operation well into the
 next century and will impact development and growth on the City’s northwestern edge. It is in the
 City’s interest to work closely with Merced County Regional Waste Management Authority on solid
 waste reduction programs and to develop strategies for protecting the existing landfill site from
 encroachment by non-compatible uses.
 Implementing Actions:
 6.2.a   Intermediate processing facilities and materials recycling facilities should be distanced
         and buffered from sensitive land uses.

        Where feasible, intermediate waste processing facilities and materials recycling facilities
        should be sited in or adjacent to compatible heavy commercial or industrial areas, with access
        to major roadways.
6.2.b   Cooperate with Merced County Regional Waste Management Authority to implement
        recommendations for source reduction programs which have the least environmental
        and economic impacts on the City and its residents.
        The City development review process should incorporate polices and programs for waste
        collection points and waste transfer points which minimize traffic, noise, and other adverse
        impacts on surrounding areas. The City will cooperate with the Merced County Regional
        Waste Management Authority on implementing actions directed at reducing solid waste and to
        promote community awareness of recycling program activities and services available in the
        City.
6.2.c   Continue implementation of programs in cooperation with the Merced County Regional
        Waste Management Authority to meet solid waste diversion goals.
        The City’s waste reduction efforts should be designed to complement the Authority’s efforts.

Goal Area P-7: Schools
GOALS
     Adequate School Facilities for All Students in the Merced Urban Area
     Excellent Cooperative Relationships between the City, the School Districts, and the
      Development Community
POLICIES
P-7.1   Cooperate with Merced area school districts to provide elementary, intermediate and high
        school sites that are centrally located to the populations they serve and adequate to serve
        community growth.
P-7.2   Support higher educational opportunities.
Policy P-7.1
Cooperate With Merced Area School Districts to Provide Pre-Kindergarten,
Elementary, Intermediate, And High School Sites That Are Centrally Located to the
Populations They Serve and Adequate to Serve Community Growth.
While the primary responsibility of providing education services in the City of Merced belongs to the
various school districts which operate in the community, the City can provide an important element of
support to education service providers. In a time of limited resources, cooperative arrangements
between all levels of local government are essential to maintaining and enhancing service levels. The
City of Merced is committed to working cooperatively with local educational service providers, both
public and private, in the improvement of the educational resources available to City residents.

Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
Chapter 5--Public Services and Facilities
 Implementing Actions:
 7.1.a.  The City recognizes that education and public schools are an important and integral part
         of a well balanced community—providing not only educational opportunities for our
         youth, but also vital recreation and open space for our community.
         In addition to providing educational opportunity for our residents, quality public schools also
         serve as a foundation of long-term economic development and for a healthy local economy.
         The City also recognizes that public school districts are organized, funded, and established as
         distinct and separate legal entities having separately elected governing boards and missions
         while sharing many of the same constituents as the City. It is the primary responsibility of
         these public school districts and their governing boards to provide for the budgetary priorities
         to address their needs.
         State legislation has severely constrained and limited the ability of the City to require
         development interests to do more than the statutory minimums to mitigate development’s
         impacts on the public school systems. However, the City, in recognizing the importance of
         public education to the well balanced community we desire, will look to those seeking
         entitlements from the City to be good trustees of the future and to go beyond the statutory
         minimums to address the impacts of their development on schools by entering into voluntary
         agreements with the relevant public school districts to the extent permitted by law. While the
         City may not be able to deny a project because of its impact on schools, development interests
         can and should anticipate being asked what they have done to help address those impacts. To
         this end, the City will seek to facilitate discussions between development interests and the
         relevant public school districts to address at a global or project specific level the reaching of
         voluntary agreements to address the needs of public school districts.
 7.1.b. The City of Merced will assist, support, collaborate and cooperate with the school
         districts having jurisdiction in planning for and providing of educational services and
         School Facilities to meet the needs of current and projected future students and
         employees. The City will work with the school districts to negotiate a memorandum of
         understanding (MOU)/cooperative agreement, which will address how the school
         impacts of development projects will be analyzed, the preparation of plans for services
         by developers, and school funding issues.
         Such memorandum(s) of understanding shall ensure that the relevant district is planning and
         developing new school sites which minimize negative impacts on the community and
         demonstrate recognition by the district(s) of its obligation to participate early in the City’s
         development review process. Should a district fail to have such a memorandum of
         understanding with the City, the City will consider any input by the district, but the provisions
         of this implementing action shall not limit the City’s ability to approve new development
         applications or projects.
         The planning and site plan review for the development of new growth areas should involve
         school planners as early in the process as feasible. Where school districts have cooperative
         agreements with the City, the City will provide information and timely notification to the
         School Districts regarding Annexation applications, Master Plans, Specific Plans, General
         Plan Amendments, Zone Changes, and Development Agreements, so that the Districts can
         provide information to the City regarding the impacts of the applications on school facilities
         and that information can be provided to the Planning Commission and City Council during the
         public hearing process. As part of the cooperative agreements, details regarding the level of
         analysis required for various development applications, the topic areas to be covered, and
                                                   5-36

                                                                          Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
                                                                    Chapter 5--Public Services and Facilities
       timelines for preparing the analysis will be negotiated between the City and the School
       Districts. The MOU should also address the preparation of a plan for services by the
       developers and various school funding issues, including the use of public tax exempt
       financing.
7.1.c. The City will promote the clustering of public and quasi-public uses such as schools,
       parks, child care facilities, and community activity centers. Joint-use of public facilities
       will be promoted and agreements for sharing costs and operational responsibilities by
       school districts and public entity partners will be encouraged.
       The purpose of developing “joint use” facilities is to reduce facility construction and operating
       costs for local public agencies. Joint use facilities may require development of joint use
       agreements between participating agencies. Normally a joint use facility would involve
       design components which would exceed individual agency needs and therefore increase
       overall facility costs; however, joint use facilities may reduce total costs for facility
       development and operation. Individual facility studies would need to be conducted on facility
       designs to assure a positive cost benefit to the agencies involved.
       Exploration of new opportunities for joint use school facilities may include, but are not limited
       to, gymnasiums and/or multi-purpose buildings, libraries, play fields and nearby restrooms,
       child and/or senior care facilities, after school tutoring centers, and community meeting
       facilities. Efforts to create school facilities should reflect attractive design to serve as
       neighborhood and community gathering places, and contribute to neighborhood identity and
       pride. The City will cooperate with school districts to establish systems of planning and
       collaboration that result in effective communication and relationships leading to the creation,
       maintenance, and improvement of joint-use agreements which provide mutual benefits to their
       shared constituents. The City will continue to enter into memorandums of understanding with
       school districts for the shared planning, design, operation, and maintenance of facilities
       associated with adjoining parks and schools. Joint-use agreements should seek to maximize
       facility use, reduce overall costs of operation and maintenance, provide for the use of school
       facilities by City as well as school district sponsored recreational, athletic, and educational
       programs during non-school day operational times.
7.1.d. In general, schools should be located within residential neighborhoods near parks,
       bikeways, and other open space amenities.              Schools should not be located within
       industrial areas. In urban village areas, schools should be located adjacent to Village
       Core Residential (higher density) areas.
       Schools should be sited near open space areas such as parks and bikeways in order to promote
       joint use of facilities and good bicycle and pedestrian access. In urban villages, schools
       should be located adjacent to the “Village Core Residential” areas where densities are higher.
7.1.e. The City and the School Districts will work together toward circulation and
       transportation systems within the City that provide for the movement of students from
       homes to schools, including considerations for pedestrian, bicycle, and overall safe routes
       to school.
       The City and the School Districts will work together to establish safe and convenient systems
       of public transportation and circulation linked to residential neighborhoods, business centers,
       parks, schools, and other public facilities which encourage walking or bicycling as an
       alternative to driving. Overall designs for access/egress to schools should include
       student/passenger drop-off and pick-up areas whenever possible.

Chapter 5--Public Services and Facilities
 7.1.f.  School Districts will select new school sites consistent with the Land Use Diagram in
         accordance with City policies and based on its own site selection studies in coordination
         with the City of Merced.
         The City’s General Plan Land Use Diagram identifies general areas where school facilities are
         expected to be needed based on proposed land uses. Implementing Actions P-7.1.c, P-7.1.d,
         P-7.1.f, P-7.1.g, and P-7.1.h address the City’s preferences for locating school facilities.
         Specific sites would only be designated after the school district’s site selection process has
         resulted in a site being obtained by the district to provide the district with maximum flexibility
         in obtaining new school sites. For the purposes of this section, “obtain” (above) means actual
         ownership or an agreement between the School Districts and the property owner to acquire or
         designate a school site.
 7.1.g. Designate specific school site locations on the Land Use Diagram as needs and sites are
         identified and ensure their compatibility with adjacent development.
         Once the school districts have selected and obtained school facility sites, the City will review
         existing land use plans to assure compatibility with the proposed site. Through the City’s
         environmental review process, development permits adjacent to, or in the immediate vicinity
         of, a proposed school site will be reviewed to address any negative impacts on the school as
         long as the school site is located consistent with City policies.
         The City of Merced will designate, in cooperative and ongoing dialogue with school district
         officials, adequate, appropriately located land for City and School Facilities, which the School
         Districts will verify compliance with the District’s school facility plans and the requirements
         of the California Department of Education. Sites should be sized and sited to accommodate
         all grade levels that are required to be housed generated from the developing area. The City
         will support school districts in identifying school sites which are appropriately located and
         sized within attendance areas and appropriately distributed throughout the community. The
         design and site configuration of school facilities should be in accordance with the
         requirements and standards of school district master plans, inclusive of but not limited to net
         acreage requirements, access by the public and necessary off street parking, and safe routes of
         access/egress.
         In the event, a district overrides the City’s zoning for a site, any obligation the City has under
         this Implementing Action shall be inapplicable to that site.
 7.1.h. Elementary school sites should be encouraged to locate on collector streets near but not
         directly on arterials.
         New elementary school sites should not result in the creation of hazards for City residents or
         students. The City will assist by providing data as required by the school districts so the
         districts can ensure that safe, adequate access is provided to school sites. This will best be
         served by locating schools on collector streets where access is good but lower traffic speeds
         lead to a safer environment for students walking to school. At the same time, schools should
         be located near arterials but not on them, so that bus transportation to the school will not
         unnecessarily disrupt residential neighborhoods. Off-street passenger loading and unloading
         areas should be encouraged. Good pedestrian and bicycle access is also an important factor
         to be considered. Future school sites should have as many sides fronting on streets as possible.

                                                                          Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
                                                                    Chapter 5--Public Services and Facilities
7.1.i. Cooperate with the school districts to ensure that school facility impact fees are collected
       in accordance with State law. In addition, the City will work with the School Districts to
       coordinate discussions with developers of residential projects to enter into voluntary
       agreements with the school districts with provisions that child care and school facilities
       required by development are funded in a timely and adequate manner, concurrent with
       development, and in accordance with the standards and requirements of the school
       district having jurisdiction.
       The City will work closely with the school districts in the management of the School Impact
       Fee system and to encourage developers to enter into voluntary agreements with the school
       districts to fund child care and school facilities.
7.1.j. Work with the school districts to obtain adequate funding for infrastructure
       improvements on and adjacent to school sites.
       The City will work with the school districts so that funding for school construction includes
       mitigation of off-site impacts, such as traffic signals, sidewalks, and street improvements. All
       infrastructure utility systems should be provided to the property line of all school sites by
       private development where feasible at school district expense and should include water, gas,
       electricity, telephone, sewer, storm drainage, cable television and wiring and conduit for
       cabling systems to serve modern telephone and computer systems.
7.1.k. The City of Merced will support and cooperate with the School Districts in planning for
       and providing child care and educational services and School Facilities with sufficient
       capacity, to meet the needs of current and projected future student enrollments and
       employees. To this end, the City will work cooperatively with the School District(s) in
       monitoring housing, population and school enrollment trends to plan for future School
       Facility and Child Care Facility needs.
       In order to maintain an adequate and sufficient level of public facilities and services for child
       care the following should be considered and provided:
       1. Public facilities and services for child care should be encouraged in any land use
            designation, except open space and heavy industrial designations.
       2. The City will work with, assist and coordinate policing and public safety programs and
            activities with the local School District to enhance the safety, security, and protection of
            property and persons of the District’s schools.
       3. Encourage the use of public facilities for child care services, including collaboration
            between schools and parks, faith based institutions, community centers, and senior centers.
       4. School Facilities, and education programs, including child care options for all City
            residents, should be an integral component of residential neighborhoods.
       5. The site planning and design of developments, which include school sites, should provide
            efficient and effective pedestrian and vehicular access/egress to such sites and to utilities.
       6. The City will work with local child care advocacy organizations including the Local Child
            Care and Development Planning Council and the Child Care Resource and Referral office
            to determine unmet community child care needs which will be considered in site plans and
            designs of developments.

Chapter 5--Public Services and Facilities
 7.1.l.  Through the City’s environmental review process, reasonable attempts will be made to
         reduce the effects of incompatible land uses and noise adjacent to or within a quarter
         mile of school facilities and other noise sensitive land uses.
         Land uses and developments which emit excessive noise, exceeding noise standards
         established in the City’s General Plan, odors, particulates, light and/or glare, vibration, or
         other environmentally sensitive contaminates will need to address and reduce as much as
         feasible any negative impacts on school facilities within a quarter-mile of the proposed use
         when such school facilities are located on sites zoned for residential use. In the event, a school
         district overrides the City’s zoning, the provisions of this implementing action will be
         inapplicable to that school site.
 Policy P-7.2
 Support Higher Educational Opportunities.
 The City of Merced is fortunate to have well regarded institutions of higher education. The City is
 committed to promoting these institutions and facilitating their growth and development.
 Implementing Actions:
 7.2.a   Work with Merced College to ensure that facilities and grounds are available to meet
         future student needs.
         The City will participate, as required, with Merced College planning efforts.         The City will
         provide assistance in obtaining necessary campus development permits.
 7.2.b   Work closely with both the Merced Community College District and University of
         California Chancellor’s Office to assure that adequate community infrastructure is
         available to meet their institutional needs.
         The City’s street system, along with water, sewer, and drainage systems, serve the existing
         Merced College campus site and the UC Merced campus site. The City will work closely
         with Merced Community College and the UC system on future campus expansion and
         development plans, coordinate infrastructure extension, and upgrade programs to meet the
         development needs of these two campuses to the maximum extent feasible. The City
         anticipates and expects these institutions to pay their fair share of facility costs and to mitigate
         their impacts on the community.
 7.2.c   Work with the County and UC Merced planning staff in the preparation of necessary
         plans and studies for the expansion of the UC Merced campus site and grounds.
         Land use on the UC Merced campus site is under the jurisdiction of the Regents of the
         University of California with only limited review available to the City or the County. There is
         a need, however, to assure that infrastructure planning (sewer, water, drainage systems) and
         circulation system planning be well integrated with existing and planned City and County
         systems. The City will continue to work with UC staff, and the County of Merced, to provide
         assistance in matching campus needs with City resources. The City anticipates and expects
         these institutions to pay their fair share of facility costs and to mitigate their impacts on the
         community.
 7.2.d   Develop programs with UC Merced students, faculty, and employees to gain their
         prospective on future development goals for the City.
                                                    5-40

                                                                          Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
                                                                    Chapter 5--Public Services and Facilities
         In 2006, the City’s Economic Development Office met with focus groups of UC Merced
         students to learn which types of retail and entertainment opportunities they would like to see in
         Merced in the future, how students receive information about what is going on in Merced, and
         what modes of transportation the students use. The information from those focus groups has
         been very helpful to Economic Development staff. The City should develop similar on-going
         programs to encourage UC Merced’s students and employees to become involved in Merced’s
         future development.
Goal Area P-8: Government, Health, Library, & Cultural Facilities
GOAL
    Support for Cultural and Community Services that Improve and Maintain the Quality of
     Life for the Residents of Merced
POLICIES
P-8.1    The City will support the cultural and health related needs of the community by incorporating
         such facilities and services in development and redevelopment proposals.
P-8.2    The City will promote consolidation of complementary or support services to avoid
         duplication of programs.
P-8.3    Work with others to study innovative ways of delivering library services at the neighborhood
         level to promote community education and provide a focus for community activity and cultural
         development.
Policy P-8.1
The City Will Support The Cultural and Health Related Needs of the Community by
Incorporating Such Facilities And Services in Development And Redevelopment
Proposals
The long term vision of the City of Merced is that of a major urban center in the San Joaquin Valley.
With growth comes the normal problems of urban expansion but along with the problems, comes
expanded opportunities. Facilities and services which are not practical for a mid-sized community
can be supported in a larger metropolitan area. With the development of the UC Merced campus,
many new cultural resources will become available in the City of Merced. The City’s vision is to plan
for the development of facilities which complement the expanded community resources and reflect the
future status of Merced as a major metropolitan area in the region .
Implementing Actions:
8.1.a    Encourage a range of health related facilities in Merced to meet the needs of a growing
         and aging population, including rehabilitation centers, walk-in medical centers, and full
         service hospitals.
         The City will periodically review its development regulations to insure compatibility with
         current medical technology and service delivery philosophy.

 8.1.b    Encourage the continued operations of the multi-cultural and performing arts program
          and facilities in the Downtown area of Merced.
          The City will work closely with civic groups and other public agencies in continuing to
          support arts programs in the Downtown area.
 8.1.c    Examine the needs for developing youth services programs and supporting facilities.
          Youth services and center facilities may be integrated into joint use facilities and operated in
          cooperation with the Parks and Recreation programs, or separate programs and facilities may
          be developed as desired.
 Policy P-8.2
 The City Will Promote Consolidation of Complementary or Support Services to Avoid
 Duplication of Programs.
 The City of Merced recognizes that local governments are faced with increasingly limited resources
 and while demand for community services is constantly increasing. New ways of providing cost
 effective public services must be explored if existing service levels are to be maintained.
 Implementing Actions:
 8.2.a    Senior centers, satellite libraries, adult education, recreation and/or other public
          facilities should be located in proximity to each other in each Village Core mixed-use
          area to allow for integrated activities to the maximum extent feasible.
          Specific plans, site plans and other development plans for Village Core areas should be
          reviewed to ensure that adequate area is available for the development of these types of uses.
          Not every village will have these facilities. However, when they are provided, they should be
          located in core areas where they will serve the population most efficiently.
 8.2.b    Continue to emphasize Downtown Merced as the central location for public and
          government facilities in the City (e.g., County and City government centers, civic center,
          post office, department of motor vehicles, federal and state offices, etc.).
          These facilities should be located in close proximity to, or adequately served by, public
          transportation.
 8.2.c    Encourage development of child care centers in all areas, including non-residential areas.
          Locating child care facilities in areas with similar uses like schools and near employment
          centers will help reduce unnecessary vehicular trips and to facilitate parental involvement.
          The development of a Downtown child care center is of particular interest to the City.
 8.2.d    Encourage the inclusion of child care facilities in new housing developments.
          Regularly work with child care advocacy organizations, including the Local Child Care and
          Development Planning Council and the Child Care Resource and Referral office, to prioritize
          and determine unmet community needs. Care should be taken to ensure that child care
          facilities are easily located in newly developing areas, particularly within affordable housing
          developments.

8.2.e    Promote the development of shared cultural and recreational facilities and programs
         between the community and local educational facilities.
         Work with local school districts and secondary education institutions to develop cultural and
         recreational facilities and programs that can be available for local community purposes.
8.2.f    Continue to encourage parks to be located adjacent to schools in order to promote the
         joint use of buildings and sports facilities.
         Give priority consideration to sites located near school campuses. The City will work with
         local school districts to develop joint use sports facilities with shared development, operation
         and maintenance responsibilities.
Policy P-8.3
Work with Others to Study Innovative Ways of Delivering Library Services at the
Neighborhood Level to Promote Community Education and Provide a Focus for
Community Activity and Cultural Development.
Library services are an important element of any community’s cultural resources. Technological
developments have created new opportunities to deliver information at the neighborhood level in an
efficient and cost effective manner. The community is committed to improving the quality of its
cultural resources, such as library services, and will study and evaluate means by which this can be
accomplished.
Implementing Actions:
8.3.a    Explore ways to incorporate “information access” into public facilities and buildings.
         Public facilities located in neighborhoods, such as fire stations, police stations, parks, etc., can
         provide important opportunities for providing public access to information resources. The
         location of computer terminals or kiosks in these facilities should be considered to allow ready
         public access to information on City business, library services, cultural and historical
         attractions, etc.
8.3.b    Work with the County of Merced to define an efficient means of maintaining and
         delivering library services within the Merced urban area.
         In early 1997, the City and County adopted a property tax sharing agreement in which the
         County will receive a share of the tax increment from Redevelopment Project Area #2
         specifically for library purposes. The County could receive up to $8 million from this source
         through the year 2014. The City will continue to work with the County to explore other
         options for maintaining library services for Merced residents.

Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
Chapter 5--Public Services and Facilities
 Goal Area P-9: Telecommunications
 GOAL
     Development of Infrastructure and Service to Allow All Merced Residents to Utilize New
      Technologies to Communicate with the Region, the Nation, and the World
 POLICIES
 P-9.1   Develop City standards for telecommunications infrastructure and encourage its installation in
         all new development.
 P-9.2   Make information regarding City government and decision-making, local services, and
         opportunities to participate in City governance available to Merced citizens in electronic form.
 P-9.3   Make use of telecommunications services to increase public safety.
 Policy P-9.1
 Develop City Standards for Telecommunications Infrastructure and Encourage its
 Installation in All New Development.
 Telecommunications infrastructure and services have been identified as important community
 resources, which are likely to be important to the continuing economic development of the community
 as basic infrastructure, such as sewer, water, and road systems.
 Implementing Actions:
 9.1.a   The City will consider new development standards for the installation of
         telecommunications infrastructure so that new residential, commercial, and industrial
         development projects include the infrastructure components necessary to support
         modern communication technologies.
         The City would develop plans and standards for the installation of telecommunications
         infrastructure. Examples would include conduit space within joint utility trenches for future
         high speed data equipment and flexible telephone conduit to allow for easy retrofit for high
         speed data systems. To minimize street cutting and trenching for the City, consideration
         should be given to requiring installation of conduit when streets are initially constructed. This
         conduit can be empty, and available for any and all service providers to fill with cable; filled
         with 'dark' fiber that is owned by the City, and leased for use by service providers; or, filled
         with 'lighted' fiber that allow the City to operate its own telecommunications services. Merced
         should develop a telecommunications infrastructure that is not dependent on any single
         medium, but incorporates a variety of media such as wireless and fiber optics as appropriate.
         Encourage new residential development to provide for the maximum reasonable bandwidth
         connectivity to each unit.
 9.1.b   Work with other agencies, such as the County of Merced and neighboring cities and
         schools, to integrate telecommunication infrastructure planning on a regional basis
         Working with other local agencies should help bring down costs and increase the availability
         of infrastructure to all City residents and businesses.

                                                                            Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
                                                                     Chapter 5--Public Services and Facilities
9.1.c    Work with service providers to encourage the provision                             of   high-speed
         telecommunications service to all existing areas of the community.
         This will require installation of new facilities and retrofitting existing facilities to ensure that
         all areas receive service. Use City right-of-way as a resource to foster development of a
         "public utility" telecommunications networking infrastructure to provide high-speed
         networking throughout the community, and to make the community attractive to information-
         based businesses.
9.1.d    Develop standards for electronic map and plan submittals.
         The City should develop new application submittal requirements so that new development
         provides accurate maps based upon the Citywide Control Network and Geographic
         Information System (GIS). New tentative and final map applications should include electronic
         submittals and infrastructure layers tied to the control network. Locations of new public
         facilities should be electronically mapped. The City should establish a format for submittal of
         electronic parcel and facility maps as well as building permits.
9.1.e    Continue implementation of the City’s Wireless Communications Facilities Ordinance
         (MMC 20.92).
         When approving telecommunications and similar facilities, balance the need for aesthetics and
         screening with the function of the facility and the need to provide services to the public.
         Identify areas where telecommunications providers can jointly locate equipment such as
         switching shelters. These shared locations can increase service availability and reduce cost by
         allowing for sharing of security, landscaping and maintenance costs.
Policy P-9.2
Make Information regarding City Government and Decision-making, Local Services,
and Opportunities to Participate in City Governance Available to Merced Citizens in
Electronic Form.
 Electronic forms of communication have become much more available to all citizens so it is important
for the City to keep up with the new technologies and attempt to communicate with its citizens in most
popular forms of communication.
Implementing Actions:
9.2.a    Make appropriate City documents and information regarding City services available for
         immediate retrieval by means of electronic access and the Internet
         Continue to update and upgrade the City’s website to provide information to citizens on a 24-
         hour, 7 days per week basis. Most important City documents should continue to be made
         available in electronic form and posted on the Internet, including agendas, minutes, and staff
         reports for the City Council and all City boards and commissions.
9.2.b    Use electronic communication in citizen input procedures, such as electronic mail,
         websites, news groups and social media to the extent feasible and practical.
         Utilize new technologies to conduct citizen outreach and to seek citizen input on important
         City issues.

Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
Chapter 5--Public Services and Facilities
 Policy P-9.3
 Make Use of Telecommunications Services to Increase Public Safety.
 Telecommunications services have become important tools for the law enforcement and emergency
 medical services. Not only is radio used to dispatch units, but also data on suspects and patient
 records is commonly sent to vehicle-based computer systems. Global Positioning System (GPS)
 receivers are also used to keep track of emergency response vehicles. A high quality
 telecommunications system for City safety services can be enhanced by joint use with private
 telecommunications facilities.
 Implementing Actions:
 9.3.a   Develop a plan for locating telecommunication facilities to serve emergency response
         providers in the City.
         The plan should also include the following: 1) Where possible, reduce equipment and service
         costs by sharing facilities with other service providers; 2) Include CCTV cameras and wireless
         support for new development; and, 3) Ensure that the City's telecommunications and Internet
         services are capable of providing timely emergency information.
 9.3.b   Review the potential health and environmental impacts of new telecommunications
         facilities, consistent with the requirements of federal and state laws and regulations.
         Wireless telecommunications facilities emit radio-frequency electromagnetic radiation (EMR).
         The power and frequency of these emissions is regulated by federal law, administered by the
         Federal Communications Commission (FCC). So long as transmitters operate within the FCC
         limits, the City is limited by law in its ability to consider EMR as an environmental or health
         factor.

 UD-1.1 Apply Transit-Ready Development or Urban Village design principles to new development
           in the City’s new growth areas.
 UD-1.2 Distribute and design Urban Villages to promote convenient vehicular, pedestrian, and transit
           access.

           Development or Urban Village principles.
 Policy UD-1.1
 Apply Transit-Ready Development or Urban Village Design Principles to New
 Development in the City’s New Growth Areas.
 The fundamental building block of the Plan is the Village, a compact, mixed-use district that will
 accommodate projected growth, maintain Merced's present quality of life and help ensure its
 continued economic vitality. Villages achieve these goals by encouraging pedestrian and transit
 travel, and by minimizing single-use, low density developments that generate traffic congestion, air
 pollution, a scarcity of affordable housing, monotonous landscapes and poor utilization of
 environmental and land resources. The City of Merced has established the “Urban Village” model
 (also known as “Transit Ready Development”) as the basic design concept governing urban form in
 new growth areas. Its principles should be applied as much as feasible in new growth areas
 throughout the Merced urban area.
 Implementing Actions:
 1.1.a    The focus of new development will be the “Urban Village,” which are mixed-use,
          pedestrian- and transit-friendly communities within a one-square mile area.

                                                          Villages should include a mixture of parks,
                                                          shops, a variety of housing types, and civic uses.
                                                          Villages combine these uses within a convenient
                                                          distance, making it easier for residents and
                                                          employees to travel by transit, bicycle or foot as

                                                          on or near planned transit segments and provide
                                                          a physical environment that encourages

            adjacent to Village Core Residential neighborhoods.
                                                                 At a minimum, plans for designated Core

                                                                 include major supermarkets, professional
                                                                 offices, day care, restaurants, service
                                                                 commercial, comparison retail and other
                                                                 retail stores located adjacent to the transit
                                                                 stop. Optional upper floor office and
                                                                 residential uses in the Core
Commercial area increases the mixed-use, round-the-clock nature of the Core area. A transit stop and
village green should be located between commercial uses and Village Core Residential areas.
Three kinds of Core Commercial areas may occur:
a) Convenience Centers — providing a convenience “mini-market” with some ancillary retail
     (typically 3-10 acres);
b) Neighborhood Centers — providing a supermarket with an additional anchor store, major ancillary
     retail and professional offices (typically 10-20 acres); or,
c) Community Center — providing a supermarket and drugstore, ancillary retail, professional offices
     and additional anchors such as junior department stores and health clubs (ranging from 20-60
     acres).
1.1.c      “Village Core Residential Areas” (part of the “Inner Villages”) shall include residences
            that are within a convenient walking distance from Core Commercial areas and transit
            stops, and are built at densities high enough to help support them.
            Village designs should incorporate an average minimum gross density of 10 dwelling units per
            acre (du/ac) which will allow a mix of small lot single-family, townhomes and apartments in
            Village Core Residential areas. All Village Core Residential areas should be pedestrian in
            scale, ranging from slightly under to slightly over one-quarter mile in radius and should
            provide direct and easy access to Core Commercial areas and transit stops.
                                                     6-9

Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
Chapter 6--Urban Design
         Village Core Residential areas may contain a variety of housing types and ownership options,
         ranging from small lot single-family homes to apartment buildings, as long as the overall
         average gross density of the Village is at least 10 du/ac. (Gross densities calculations should
         include the area in lots as well as in streets and alleys immediately in front and behind the
         lots). While housing diversity is desirable, this density requirement could be achieved using
         only a single-family product — small lots with carriage (ancillary) units. Small village parks
         should be provided as an urban amenity within these denser Village Core Residential areas.
 1.1.d   Each Village will have an “Outer Village” adjacent to it which includes lands no further
         than one mile from the Core Commercial area.
                                                      Site plans for the “Outer Village” street network
                                                      must provide multiple direct street and bicycle

         power lines, transitways, and along the abandoned Yosemite Valley Railroad (YVRR) railroad

      An important concept of Urban Village development is to create areas which are less
      dependent upon auto and truck transportation than other areas of the City. Many uses typically
      allowed in commercial areas rely predominantly upon auto travel to generate business patrons.
      These uses, such as auto dealers and repair shops, mini-storage facilities, travel commercial
      complexes, and motels, should not be permitted in Villages in most cases. These uses should
      be accommodated in nearby areas where the street and highway system can support the traffic
      loads that they generate. For example, such uses are appropriate in business park areas
      adjacent to Highway 59 in North Merced.
      Similarly, light industrial uses should not generally be permitted in Villages except that
      business park/research & development type uses may be appropriate in those Villages in the
      northeastern portion of the City near UC Merced. Industrial uses are appropriate, however,
      where existing industrial activities occur and along major transportation corridors.
1.1.g  The City will work with individual property owners within the Village areas to assure
      that development occurs in a balanced manner to assure economic viability of individual
      projects.
                                                           The growth area must be developed in a
                                                           balanced phasing pattern. Schools and parks
                                                           must be dedicated concurrent with
                                                           commercial and residential uses. Further-
                                                           more, areas must be set aside for land uses
                                                           that will be needed in later phases, but where
                                                           market demand needs to mature, such as
                                                           Core Commercial and higher density
                                                           housing areas. For this reason, development
                                                           of Villages is seen as a cooperative effort
                                                           between the City, landowners and the
                                                           development community.

         Conceptual Phasing of a Village
                                                           Villages represent relatively large projects
      which may be executed over several years. The phasing of the project is critical to its success,
      both as a financial undertaking and as a mechanism to encourage transit use. In order to
      encourage the public service agencies to provide public facilities in a timely manner to serve
      the needs of residents, developers are asked to dedicate sites designated for public uses
      concurrent with development of commercial and residential uses. Developers should also
      work with the City to ensure that the recommended mixture of land uses is achieved in a
      timely manner and development costs remain low.
1.1.h Develop special “Urban Village” design principles to encourage more job-generating uses
      within the Urban Villages.
      Special “Urban Village” designs should be developed to provide for increased opportunities
      for job-based land uses attracted by a university climate in some Urban Villages, especially in
      the northwestern area of the City, while still maintaining the basic concept of mixed-use,
      pedestrian and transit oriented communities. These “Urban Villages” may differ from others
      in the Community in the mixture of business park, research and development, office,
      public/cultural uses, and retail uses within the Village Core areas instead of the
      retail/office/public facilities focus of other Villages which are more residential in nature.

Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
Chapter 6--Urban Design
 Policy UD-1.2
 Distribute and Design Urban Villages to Promote Convenient Vehicular, Pedestrian,
 and Transit Access.
 Villages should be distributed throughout the City’s growth area in a pattern that allows the greatest
 number of residents access to a variety of shopping opportunities. Villages should be distributed to
 permit residents to walk to retail and public facilities without having to cross an arterial street.
 Villages should also be located to take advantage of main transit lines and existing retail market
 demand.
 The Urban Village circulation system encourages all modes of travel, while providing adequate access
 for automobile traffic. This street pattern is achieved by providing multiple routes to destinations
 without relying on arterials. This pattern of multiple routes keeps traffic volumes lower on individual
 connector streets and allows pedestrians and bicyclists to avoid unfriendly arterials. This pattern also
 favors pedestrians by slowing traffic, reducing pavement, and improving the sense of shelter afforded
 by houses and trees. Within the Urban Village development concept, local and connector streets
 should be designed to discourage through traffic, while still providing an interconnected and a legible
 circulation network.
 Implementing Actions:
 1.2.a Villages should be located to maximize access to their Core Commercial areas from their
         adjacent neighborhoods without relying on arterials.
         Villages with major retail centers should be spaced at least one mile apart and should be
         distributed to serve various growth sub-areas. Generally, there should be one Village for each
         full square mile bound by arterials, except in rural residential areas.
 1.2.b The boundary of each village varies with the size of the Core Commercial area and does
         not extend across arterials.
                                                      While the shape of the Village may vary, the size of
                                                      the Inner Village should not be less than the area
                                                      described by the quarter-mile walking distance
                                                      radius (ranging from 1200 to 1600 feet) from the
                                                      transit stop and core commercial area.

         major intervening features such as major creeks and high-voltage power lines, where the
         boundary should follow the major feature.
         Inner Villages should typically be at least 100 acres when associated with a Community
         Center, 70 acres when associated with a Neighborhood Center, and 50 acres when associated
         with a Convenience Center.

1.2.c Building intensities and densities should meet the minimum requirements set forth for a
      Village to promote more active centers, support transit, and encourage pedestrian-
      oriented development that fronts onto the street.
      Compared with other Village areas, the Inner Villages should have the highest commercial
      intensities (the amount of building relative to the size of the site) and the highest residential
      densities (the number of dwelling units in a given area). Core Commercial areas should be
      intensive enough to provide a "main street" shopping spine. Multi-storied buildings and
      structured parking are strongly encouraged near transit stops to better utilize the lands adjacent
      to the transit line and to provide additional transit ridership. A development pattern is
      encouraged where densities are highest at the center of the Village and become lower as the
      distance from the center increases. Thus higher density housing types such as apartments and
      townhouses are most appropriate adjacent to the Core, with lower density single family
      housing placed further out.
1.2.d The Village street system should provide multiple and parallel routes between the Core
      Commercial area and the rest of the Village. In no case shall trips which could be
      internal to a square mile bound by arterials be forced onto an arterial.
      The collector street pattern should be simple and memorable. Winding roads, dead end streets
      and cul-de-sacs that cut off direct access to Village Centers should be discouraged in Village
      Core Residential Areas, but may be appropriate in some Outer Village areas. Streets should
      converge near common destinations that contribute to an area’s unique identity, such as transit
      stops, Core Commercial areas, schools and parks
      The street system should allow autos, bikes, and pedestrians to travel on small local streets to
      any location in the Village. At no time should an arterial street be the only preferable route to
      and from the Inner Village and its Outer Village.

 1.2.e      Arterial streets should allow efficient conveyance of through traffic and must not pass
            through Villages.
            The paved width of arterials should provide for safety, efficiency and long term needs. The
            regional traffic circulation system is dependent upon an efficient and smooth-flowing network
            of arterials. The required right-of-way for arterials varies with anticipated need. (Refer to
            Chapter 4, Circulation Map.)
 1.2.f      Collector and local streets should connect the Inner and Outer Village to Core
            Commercial areas, schools, and community parks without the use of arterials.
            In general, Collectors should be designed to carry moderate levels of local traffic smoothly, in
            a way that is compatible with bicycle and foot traffic. A network of collectors should provide
            alternative paths to destinations within the Village for neighborhood residents. The collector
            network should not provide a speedy through-route alternative to arterials. “T” intersections
            and “dog leg” alignments could be used to reduce through traffic and reduce speeds. The
            precise alignment of collectors will be determined as individual projects are designed.
            Collectors should contain bikeways. Driveway cuts should be minimized and alley access to
            rear garages is encouraged to minimize potential conflicts among autos and bicyclists, and for
            the convenience of residents along collectors. Collectors and some local streets should be
            aligned along the edge of parks and open space to enhance the aesthetic character of the streets
            and sidewalks.
 1.2.g      The pedestrian and bicycle system must provide clear and direct access to the Core
            Commercial area and the transit stop.
                                                    Although the street and sidewalk system will
                                                    accommodate many destinations within Villages, the
    Core Commercial
                                                    primary destination will be the Commercial Core and
                                                    transit stop. Direct paths to the transit stop should be
                                                    lined with activities and be shaded. The configuration
                                                    of parking, shopping and pedestrian routes should
                                                    reinforce access to transit. A feeling of safety for
                                                    pedestrians and bicyclists can be provided through the
                                                    use of park strips between the curb and the sidewalk or
                                                    bike path which provide separation from auto traffic.

                                      STREET DESIGN
Commercial Streets
Commercial streets located in Core Commercial areas should be designed to accommodate
pedestrians, slow traffic, provide on-street parking and create a pleasant shopping environment.
Explanation: Commercial streets should create an intimate shopping environment that maintains drive-
by visibility to stores. Shops should front onto commercial streets with minimal setbacks. Wider
sidewalks, street trees, awnings and arcades should be used to accommodate this active, pedestrian
environment. Curbs and landscaping should be configured to allow street cleaning equipment.
Local Streets
Local Streets should have travel and parking lanes sufficiently narrow to slow traffic and allow
trees to form a pleasing canopy over the street, while still providing for adequate access for
automobiles, and emergency and service vehicles.
Explanation: Local streets should be designed to serve low volumes of traffic through a pedestrian-
oriented environment. Street trees should be provided to enhance the quality of the neighborhood and
provide relief from summer heat.
Alleys
Alleys can be used to serve residential and commercial developments within Villages, and for
lots facing onto parks and collector streets.
                                                 Explanation: Alleys provide visual relief for the
                                                 streetscape and a secondary means of access to
                                                 individual parcels.       Alleys serving residential
                                                 development should be at least 20 feet wide with a 5
                                                 foot setback to each garage. No parking would be
                                                 allowed within the 20 foot right-of-way, but parking
                                                 should be provided within garages or on-site parking
                                                 areas. Visitor parking should occur on the street in
                                                 front of units. Street trees and landscaping are
                                                 encouraged within the 5' setback where access to
                                                 garages and on-site parking is not needed.

Street Vistas
Where possible, streets should frame vistas of the Core Commercial areas, public buildings,
parks, or natural features.
                                                                        Explanation:          Streets and
                                                                        buildings should be designed so
                                                                        views down streets terminate at
                                                                        important buildings and places.
                                                                        This will establish a series of
                                                                        pedestrian “landmarks” and allow
                                                                        pedestrians to see the context of
                                                                        their community. Straight streets,
                                                                        in particular, can allow clear
                                                                        views to landmarks and are
                                                                        encouraged.
                               Figure 6.9
Street Trees
Shade trees are required along all streets. Street trees should be spaced a maximum of 40 feet
on center and should be located in planter strips between curbs and sidewalks where
appropriate. Tree species should be selected to create a unified image for the street and provide
an effective canopy.
Explanation: Many streets are identified and remembered by their street trees. Village streets should be
lined with similar trees to give them a unified and distinct image. Within Villages, trees should be placed
in a planter strip between the street and sidewalk. In areas that do not have planter strips, the trees
should be kept close to the sidewalk to provide shade and should be aligned to visually frame the street.
Arterial Crossings
Crosswalks across arterials should be provided at all signalized intersections. Undercrossings
designed for pedestrians and bicyclists should be provided at specified locations, where
greenways cross arterials.
Explanation: Crosswalks and underpasses should be provided for easy and safe pedestrian and bicycle
movement across arterials. As part of the City-wide trail network, undercrossings should be provided
where “greenways” and bikepaths cross arterials and in some cases, collectors, where feasible.
Additional crossings should be provided at Core Commercial areas and signalized intersections.

                                          STREET DESIGN
Pedestrian Routes
Primary pedestrian routes should be located along or visible from streets. Routes through
parking lots or at the rear of residential developments should be avoided. Bordering primary
pedestrian routes and bikeways with rear yards and fences should be avoided. Where primary
pedestrian routes cross arterials, undercrossings or signalized intersections should be provided.
Explanation: Too often pedestrian paths have been separated from streets, giving a confusing message
to pedestrians and creating safety concerns due to reduced visibility. Where possible, the primary
pedestrian path system should coincide with the street system. Diagonal short cuts through parks, plazas
and greens are an exception and should be encouraged. Paths through parking lots and away from streets
should be used only where large setbacks from the street are permitted. Alternate routes around parks
should be provided for night use.
Safe pedestrian crossings across arterials, and in some cases collectors, should be provided where major
pedestrian movement is anticipated, such as along greenways and across from Core Commercial areas.
Undercrossings or signalized intersections should be provided in these locations.
Bikeways
Bike paths should also be provided along greenways, along transitways, the approximate
alignment of the Yosemite Valley Railroad (YVRR), and along major creeks and powerline
easements. Bicycle routes are also encouraged on small residential streets, but marked bike
lanes may not be required. Connections to Merced's existing bikeway network should also be
provided.
Explanation: Selected routes to the transit stop should provide marked or separated bikeways
connecting Village areas. The greenway network provides additional bicycle-oriented connections to
parks and schools. On smaller residential streets within the Village, slower auto speeds will allow bikes
to share the travel lanes. The YVRR bike path in North Merced need not follow the existing alignment
of the railroad but should run near it and provide a direct route.
Bike Parking
Bicycle parking facilities should be provided throughout Core Commercial areas, in office
developments, and at transit stops, schools, parks, and other special destinations.
Explanation: Bike racks or other bike storage facilities should be provided at various shopping,
employment, transit and recreational destinations in Villages. Bike parking may be shared between uses,
but should be centrally located, easily accessible to building entries, protected from weather extremes,
and visible from streets or parking lots.

 Policy UD-1.3
 Promote and Facilitate Core Commercial Design Principles in Village Commercial
 Areas.
 The Commercial Core of the Village plan provides the focus for service, employment, recreation and
 entertainment within each Village area. It is vital that these core areas contain ample space to
 accommodate all necessary uses and activities and at the same time be highly accessible to
 surrounding residential areas by non-vehicular means. Core Commercial areas must be adjacent to a
 future transit stop. Street-level retail space should form a pedestrian-oriented “main street” that is
 accessible from the surrounding Village without using an arterial road. Shopping malls and centers
 should face shops onto streets that connect to the surrounding neighborhood without large intervening
 parking lots. The design of Core Commercial areas should encourage shopping enroute to the transit
 stop or by office workers during the day.
 Implementing Actions:
                                  1.3.a Each Village must have a mixed-use Core Commercial area
           CORE
                                           containing ground floor retail and commercial space,
      COMMERCIAL                           including: Convenience Centers, Neighborhood Centers,
           AREAS                           and Community Centers.
                                           The size and uses in each Core area can vary, depending on the
                                           size, location, and village's function in the region. At a
                                           minimum, it should serve as a transit destination and
                                           convenience shopping area for Village residents, and can
                                           contain professional offices as well as retail uses.
                                           Community Retail Centers should concentrate a diverse set of
     Community Center
                                           major commercial and civic uses such as junior department
                                           stores, discount stores, restaurants, health clubs, grocery
                                           stores, drug stores, hardware stores, public offices, and day
                                           care. Large-scale office areas should be located across an
                                           arterial road from Community Retail Centers.
                                           Neighborhood Retail Centers should serve the growth area
                                           with major grocery stores, drug stores, ancillary shops, and
                                           offices. Professional office uses may also be located across
    Neighborhood Center                    arterial roads from Neighborhood Retail Centers.
                                           Convenience Retail Centers should provide convenience
                                           “mini-markets” and some ancillary commercial uses.
                                           Convenience Retail Centers must not contain major anchor
                                           stores.

                                                        ratio of the total floor area to the lot area,
                                                        excluding public streets.           Office and
                                                        residential uses over ground floor retail are
                                                        encouraged. Joint use parking should be
                                                        provided wherever possible, making higher
                                                        intensities feasible. Structured parking is also
                                                        encouraged and should be considered in the
               Figure 6.11

         Core Commercial Area
                                                        implemented in later phases.
1.3.c Office areas should be built at an intensity that concentrates activity near transit stops
      and Core Commercial areas.
      A F.A.R. of 0.35 to 0.60 is encouraged without structured parking, and may be as high as 1.00
      F.A.R. with structured parking. Larger office areas should be located across from the
      Community Retail Centers. Smaller office areas should be located across from Neighborhood
      Retail Centers.     Professional and commercial office uses are also permitted in Core
      Commercial areas. In most cases offices will be developed with surface parking. As land
      values rise in Merced, structured parking will become more economically feasible. This
      guideline encourages development of multi-story buildings with structured parking, thereby
      allowing more efficient use of land near transit stops.

Building design principles, while not critical to the function of Village development, contribute
to the overall attractiveness of a Village and its marketability. It is the City’s desire to promote
Village development which accomplishes the basic goals of reducing traffic congestion and
urban pollution; at the same time, the Village development concept must achieve market
acceptance for its potential residents. Therefore, Village building design principles are provided
in this section to promote building designs which will enhance the market image of Village
areas.
Parking Lots
Parking lots should not dominate the frontage of pedestrian-oriented streets or street segments,
or interrupt major pedestrian routes.
                                                        Explanation: Parking lots should be located
                                                        behind buildings or in the interior of a block
                                                        whenever possible. Parking lots that serve
                                                        buildings facing pedestrian-oriented streets or
                                                        street segments should be located to the rear
                                                        of the building. Major anchor retail stores
                                                        may have deeper parking lots.
                        Figure 6.12
Parking Lot Landscaping
All parking lots must have at least one tree per 6 parking spaces so that within ten years
approximately 50 percent of the surface area of the lot is shaded. Additionally, parking lots
should be screened from streets by landscape treatments. Views of retail facades should not be
blocked by tree canopies.
Explanation:         This parking lot landscaping
standard is intended to achieve a quality of
environment that is comfortable to pedestrians,
rather than planting a specified number of trees that
may or may or not achieve the desired results.
Additional trees should be located along walkways;
perimeter landscaping should screen views of cars,
but not block views of retail facades. Tree canopies
should be trimmed to retain shade, while allowing                    Figure 6.13
building visibility.

MERCED URBAN DESIGN GUIDELINES
     COMMERCIAL AREA APPEARANCE
        Architectural Character
        Buildings should create visually pleasing human-scaled
        environments that reinforce the identity of the various uses and
        express the importance of the Village centers and civic buildings
        Explanation: No project should appear to dominate an entire street
        or block. Variety in floor level, facades, roof forms and architectural
        details that create the appearance of several smaller projects are
        strongly encouraged, but should not detract from an overall sense of
        continuity created through massing roof types and materials.
        Building materials should convey durability and permanence, and
        should be suited to Merced's climate. Building materials such as
        concrete, stucco, masonry, tile, stone and wood should be used to the
        greatest extent possible. Glass curtain walls and all reflective glass
        should not be used. Shading devices and techniques should be used to
        reduce interior glare, conserve energy and contribute to visual interest.
        The use of “green buildings” should be encouraged.
        Building heights that transition gradually from perimeter areas to the
        Core Commercial and Office areas are encouraged. Special buildings,
        such as community centers, schools and theaters, should have
        ornamental and vertical elements to communicate their civic
        importance.
        Landscaping
        Landscape elements such as trees, trellises, arbors, water
        features, amphitheaters, plazas, and courtyards should be used
        to enhance public spaces, pedestrian paths and building
        entrances.      Drought tolerant plants are encouraged for
        landscaped areas. Areas that require irrigation should use
        water conserving features and systems, when practical.
        Explanation: Landscape elements should be used to provide relief
        from summer heat, create a visual interest and to reinforce patterns of
        use. Trees, trellises, and arbors should be used along sidewalks and
        across parking lots to provide protection from the sun and create a
        pleasant canopy. Plazas and courtyards should be located near office
        entrances and within Core areas. Water features (with recirculated
        water) and amphitheaters may be used to mark places of civic
        importance. Street trees should be planted along streets.

Core Commercial Configuration
The configuration of shops in the Core area should seek a balance between pedestrian and auto
comfort, visibility, and accessibility.
Explanation: While anchor stores may orient to arterial streets and parking lots, smaller shops must
orient to pedestrian “main streets” and plazas. Core Commercial areas should be configured to allow
standard parking quantities, access and visibility for the car, as well as providing convenient paths for
local pedestrians. The Core Commercial area's configurations should allow local residents to walk and
drive to shopping and transit stops without using arterials. Often, the smaller shops can turn to form a
“main street” with street-side parking and parking lots behind the shops to form a pleasant place to walk.
Simultaneously, the edge of the Core fronting the arterial may house larger parking areas and anchor
stores in a location visible from arterials. Anchor stores are encouraged to provide entries to their
parking lot and to the pedestrian-oriented shopping street. (See Figure 6.14 below.)
                                                                           Figure 6.14

                           COMMERCIAL AREA APPEARANCE
Commercial Building Setbacks
Building setbacks from non-arterial streets should be minimized. Setbacks should reflect the
desired character of the area and bring buildings close to the sidewalk.
Explanation: Buildings in Core Commercial areas should build to non-arterial streets and the sidewalk
edge whenever possible, except for anchor tenants that may require larger setbacks. Parking areas or
garages should be recessed or placed to the rear of buildings, in clustered parking areas and along alleys.
Larger setbacks should be permitted in appropriate areas.
Commercial Building Facades
Commercial building facades should be visually accentuated with various architectural elements
such as arcades, porches, bays, and balconies to enhance the pedestrians' environment. Street
level windows and numerous building entries are encouraged in the Core Commercial area. In
almost no case should the facade of a building consist of an unarticulated blank wall.
Explanation: Buildings should incorporate design elements that draw in pedestrians and reinforce street
activity, especially along main streets. Anchor retail tenants should be encouraged to add small-scale
retail uses on building frontages. Commercial facades should vary from one building to the next, rather
than create an overly unified frontage. Monotonous and undifferentiated commercial facades should be
avoided; variations in floor level, facades, roof forms and architectural details that create the appearance
of several smaller projects are strongly encouraged.

Chapter 6--Urban Design
            MERCED URBAN DESIGN GUIDELINES
                            COMMERCIAL AREA APPEARANCE
Commercial Building Entries
Primary ground floor commercial building entrances should orient to plazas, parks, or
pedestrian-oriented streets, not to interior blocks or parking lots, except for anchor retail
buildings, which may have their entries from off-street parking lots. On-street anchor street
entries are strongly encouraged, however.
Explanation: Entries into small shops and offices should orient directly onto a pedestrian-oriented
street. Buildings with multiple retail tenants should have numerous entries to the street. Off-street
parking should also be located at the rear of buildings with short, pleasant passageways leading to the
pedestrian-oriented street and primary entrances.
Some retail anchor stores, such as neighborhood grocery stores, need parking lot access to the primary
entry. This is acceptable if pedestrian access to the entry is provided from the street, and pedestrians are
not required to walk from street sidewalks through the parking lot to enter the store. Along walls without
entries, building elevations should include windows, display areas, and/or be lined with small retail
shops.
Upper Story Uses in Core Commercial Areas
Two- and three-story buildings are encouraged in the Core Commercial areas. Upper floors
may contain residential or office uses.
                                                Figure 6.15
Explanation: Retail developments in the Core Commercial area may add up to two additional floors of
residential and/or office uses. Additional office and residential uses in the Core Commercial areas are
encouraged as long as retail uses and activities are maintained. Special care must be given to the design
of residential units to ensure privacy and security.

Policy UD-1.4
Promote and Facilitate Urban Village Residential Area Design Principles.
Within a Village development, a wide range of housing types and sufficient density needs to be
developed to meet the varied housing needs of residents and to promote the economic stability
necessary to support a healthy Commercial Core area.
Implementing Actions:
1.4.a A mix of residential densities, ownership patterns, cost, and building types is desirable in
        Villages.

                                           Housing Types
        While each Village will take on a different character and will have a different proportion of
        single-family and multi-family densities, care should be taken to provide a variety of housing
        types, costs, and ownership opportunities within each Village. The Village Core Residential
        portion of the Village can be a combination of small-lot single-family units, duplexes,
        townhouses, and up to three-story apartment buildings. Outer Village areas provide
        opportunities to develop other lower density housing types.

                                1.4.b A range of densities and dwelling types are permitted in
                                      Villages.
                                      Gross residential densities within Village Core Residential
                                      areas should be a minimum of 7 units per acre, an average of at
                                      least 10 units per acre, and a maximum of 30 units per acre.
                                      Gross residential densities within Outer Village areas should
                                      have a minimum average density of 4.5 units per acre (or
                                      higher) with a minimum of 2 units per acre. These gross
                                      density requirements must be met to ensure the viability of
                                      transit and retail centers, as well as providing housing
                                      opportunities for a range of households. (Gross density
                                      calculations should include the area in lots as well as in streets
                                      and alleys immediately in front and behind the lots, except
                                      where existing property configurations and site constraints
                                      reduce effective densities.)
                                      Many single-family residential types will meet these
                                      requirements, especially if ancillary units are used. Many
                                      multi-family housing types are permitted in Inner Villages;
                                      duplex and triplex units are also permitted in Outer Village
                                      Areas. The range of permissible housing types are illustrated in

                                               Single-family residential types cover a wide range of
                                               densities. They should enhance the pedestrian-oriented
                                               character of Villages. Single-family types illustrated
                                               here include: zero-lot line homes, small-lot single
                                               family, standard-lot single family and estate
                                               residences. Ancillary units may be used in single-
                                               family areas.
                                               Explanation: Single-family housing types should create a
                                               high-quality, pedestrian-oriented environment, as illustrated
                                               by the following housing types.
                                               Zero-Lot Line Homes
                                               Zero-lot line homes are detached single-family dwellings
                                               with only one private side yard. Zero-lot line homes have
                                               three sides with windows and one blank wall set to a side
                                               property line. (The blank wall provides privacy for the
neighbor's side yard.) Zero-lot line homes may be built at gross densities ranging from about 7 to 10
dwelling units per acre (du/ac). Ancillary units can increase this density by 75% to a maximum of 17.5
du/ac.
Small-Lot Single-Family Homes
Small-Lot single-family homes have side setbacks on both sides, thereby allowing windows to occur on
all sides. Efficient lotting of small-lot single-family homes can result in gross densities of about 6 to 8
du/ac. Ancillary units can increase this density by 75% to a maximum of 14 du/ac.
Standard Lot Single-Family Homes
Standard lot single-family homes are similar to small-lot single-family homes except for larger lot sizes.
Standard lot single-family homes may be built at gross densities of between 2 to 6 du/ac. Ancillary units
in the rear can increase this density by 75% to a maximum of 10.5 du/ac.
Estate Residences
Estate residences have very large lot sizes and may be built at gross densities of up to 2 du/ac. Ancillary
units can increase this density by 75% to a maximum of 3.5 du/ac.

Multi-Family Housing Types
Multi-family housing types should be varied in character and enhance the pedestrian-oriented
character of Villages. Multi-family housing types cover a range of densities and include: podium
apartments, garden apartments, small multiplexes and townhouses. Duplexes and triplexes (two
and three unit multiplexes) are the only multi-family housing types permitted in Outer Village
areas.
Explanation: Multi-family types include housing with stacked and/or attached units, as illustrated by
the following housing types. Several multi-family types can be consistent with the preceding guidelines
and used to create a high-quality, pedestrian-oriented environment. These types may be rented or owned.

                                                          units above a structural platform or podium with
                                                          a parking garage provided below. Shared stairs
                                                          lead from the garage to the street or to the
                                                          podium, where paths lead to units and shared
stairs to upper units. Podiums should be not more than 5 feet above finished grade to allow direct access
to first floor units and to permit visual access to the street, unless flooding conditions preclude this
arrangement. Because of their compact arrangement, podium apartments can generally be built at
densities ranging from 20 to 30 units per acre.
                                                                Garden Apartments:
                                                                Garden apartments contain attached and
                                                                stacked units with surface parking lots.
                                                                Shared stairs, accessible from public
                                                                streets, provide access to the upper-floor
                                                                units of Garden apartments, while ground-
level units often have entrances directly off of public streets. Garden apartments may be built at gross
densities ranging from 16 to 22 du/ac.
                                                       Small Multiplexes
                                                       Small multiplexes have 2-6 units contained in a
                                                       building that has many of the aesthetic and
                                                       functional qualities of single-family houses. Units
                                                       may be rented or owned. While units are attached
                                                       and may be stacked, the overall form of the
                                                       building can bear a strong resemblance to large
traditional homes. Small multiplexes may have mirror-image plans or asymmetrical arrangements, where
some entries face a sideyard. Every dwelling unit should have access to the street and private open
space. A main entrance should always face and be visible from a public street and be articulated with a
porch. Upper floor units should have entry stairs extending to grade. Side entrances should be visible
from the street. Multiplexes may be built at gross densities ranging from 10 to 18 du/ac.

                                              Townhouses
                                              Townhouses are a traditional housing type found in many
                                              older towns and villages. Townhouses are attached at their
                                              sides in groups of three or more. Each unit has its own
                                              front yard and entrance, as well as a private back yard.
                                              Because there is only one unit per lot, townhouses tend to
                                              be owner-occupied. Townhouses may be built at gross
densities ranging from 10 to 20 du/ac.
Residential Building Entries
In most cases, primary ground floor residential building entrances should face and be visible
from the street, instead of parking lots and driveways in the interior of blocks.
Explanation: In residential areas, the front door and guest entry should orient to the street. Private back
door entries can provide access from alleys, garages, and parking lots. Ancillary units and upper floor
units in multi-family or apartment complexes may be accessed by rear or side entries.

                                Residential garages should be designed to reduce the visual
                                impact of the auto and to line the street with active, visually
                                interesting features.
                                Explanation: The garage should be set back behind the front
                                facade of the residential building if possible. Garages may be sited
                                in several acceptable ways: in the rear and accessed from an alley,
                                or in the rear and accessed from a side drive. Garages may be sited
                                to the side, but should be recessed behind architectural features and
                                the front facade. Garages for most housing types should be sited
                                away from the street behind or below residential buildings.
                                Garages may be located in front of the house if a carriage house is
                                provided above and/or if garage doors do not face the street. Where
                                flooding is not an overriding concern and garages can be located
                                below residences, they should be depressed so that the first floor of
                                residences is not more than 5 feet above finish grade.

                                          Ancillary units or ‘second units’ are encouraged in
                                          association with single-family residences. They may be
                                          counted as 3/4 of a unit to meet density requirements.
                                          Carriage houses, ancillary units situated above garages,
                                          are encouraged.
                                          Explanation: Ancillary or second units create affordable
                                          rental units without changing the quality of single-family areas.
                                          They can also serve to offset housing costs for the primary unit,
                                          or provide needed space for a teenager, college student, or
                                          elderly family member. Ancillary units can be provided in
                                          Village Core Residential areas, either as part of the primary
                                          home or above a garage.

                                          Carriage Houses are ancillary units built over detached garages
at the rear lots and accessed by alleys or side drives. Carriage Houses may occur in combination with
any of the following housing types: Zero-Lot Line, Small-Lot Single-Family, Standard Lot Single-Family
and Estate Residential.
Residential Building Facades
The exterior of residential buildings or facades should be varied and articulated to provide
visual interest to the streetscape.
Explanation: Building entries and windows should face the street. Front porches, bays, and balconies
are encouraged. In no case shall a facade of a building consist of an unarticulated blank wall or an
unbroken series of garage doors. Varied and human-scaled building facades are key to making a place
“pedestrian-oriented.” Building designs should provide a high level of visual interest, without creating a
chaotic image. Residences should include design elements that enhance the streetscape and address or
front the street. Facades should vary from one building to the next to avoid a monotonous streetscape.
Trellises and overhangs are encouraged as ways of combating Merced's summer heat.

Residential Building Setbacks
Residential building setbacks from public streets should be minimized, while maintaining
privacy. Minimum and maximum front setbacks should be established that reflect the desired
character of an area and ensure that residences face streets and sidewalks.
Explanation: In most residential areas, building setbacks should be between 10 and 20 feet to the back
of sidewalk. If apartments occur over first floor commercial space, no setback is required. Estate
Residences (less than 2 du/ac) may be set back as much as 30 feet.
Porches, bays and balconies should be allowed to project into these setbacks to contribute to a street's
human scale and activity.
Residential Building Heights
Multi-family residential types should not exceed 3 1/2 stories. Single-family residences should
not exceed 2 1/2 stories.
Explanation: Building heights should gradually transition from perimeter areas to the Core area, with
the Core area serving as the visual focal point of the Village. Heights should be greatest adjacent to Core
Commercial areas and across from parks. Construction of residential buildings over underground or
partially underground parking structures is encouraged. Vertical projections above the main building
volume such as chimneys, roof peaks and cupolas are also encouraged.

Policy UD-1.5
Design and Develop Public and Quasi-Public Buildings and Uses Utilizing Transit-
Ready Development or Urban Village Principles.
Public facilities and services are a central part of the design and development of a successful Village.
The application of public facilities planning principles in designating space for public and quasi-
public services at the neighborhood or “Village” level will help assure that future community service
needs can be met in a cost effective manner.
Implementing Actions:
1.5.a   Civic services should be placed in central locations in Villages.
        Public buildings should be placed in central locations, in highly visible focal points, or
        adjacent to public parks and plazas. Civic uses such as an urban plaza, community center, post
        office, and library, are best located in the Core area in conjunction with retail businesses and
        offices and adjacent to village greens. Recreation-oriented uses, such as parks, recreation
        facilities, and community buildings, should be centrally located with easy access from both
        residential and Village Core areas. In most cases, parks and plazas should also be provided.
        Developers should work with City agencies to determine needed locations for future public
        parks, plazas and buildings, and conditions for their provision. Public service providers are
        encouraged to make every effort to place new facilities in Villages to provide a transit travel
        option for patrons.
        Major entries should face public streets and be articulated architecturally. The building and
        architectural features should be sited to take advantage of vistas along streets, to visually
        connect these civic buildings with their surrounding neighborhood. Major public buildings
        should have a civic presence enhanced by their height, mass and materials. Construction and
        materials should convey a sense of permanence and importance.
1.5.b   School sites should be selected by their respective districts in a way that provides
        opportunities to use pedestrian trails and bicycle routes to and from school and
        minimizes the need for students to cross arterial streets.
        Schools should also be designed to communicate their civic importance and located on or near
        a “greenway” bicycle and pedestrian trail to provide safe and convenient access to school.
        Elementary schools should be distributed so few students have to cross arterials. Junior high
        school and senior high schools should be distributed to minimize the need for busing. High
        school sites should be selected by their respective Districts so they can be served by transit.

                                                                  be enhanced through their height, mass
                                                                  and     architectural    features    and

 1.5.d   Utility facilities such as wells, pump stations, and electrical substations should be located
         in sites poorly suited for other forms of development, such as small sites bounded by high
         voltage power lines and arterials.
         Utility facilities should be screened by dense vegetation or architectural features. Areas that
         are poorly suited to residential and other uses could be used efficiently as locations for utility
         facilities. Locations adjacent to arterials may be desirable but should be accessible by local
         streets if possible and should be designed to accommodate needed equipment.
 1.5.e   Public parks and plazas should be designed for both active and passive uses. They should
         reflect and reinforce the character of the surrounding area.
         Various types of parks and plazas can be designed for Villages to establish an identity or
         character for each neighborhood. For example, plazas in Commercial Core areas may be most
         appropriately designed with finished pavement materials such as stone or brick, and include
         fountains and seating areas; parks in residential areas could be developed with grassy fields,
         play equipment, and sports facilities. Parks should be located and designed to take advantage
         of view corridors along streets to create a legible and memorable street pattern.
 1.5.f   Encourage subdivision designs that provide neighborhood parks in proximity to activity
         centers, such as schools, libraries, and community centers.
         Neighborhood parks are an important aspect of the Urban Village and should be provided in
         proximity to areas where citizens gather.

Policy UD-2.1
Use Urban Village Design Concepts in Neighborhood Revitalization Programs.
Urban Village development policies and principles can result in improved neighborhood
environments, reduced traffic congestion, and better and more cost effective service delivery systems.
Although some existing neighborhoods throughout Merced contain certain elements of the Urban
Village, some service and infrastructure improvements could enhance these “Villages.” Through the
use of the Specific Plan and Redevelopment Plan process, existing neighborhoods could be revitalized
utilizing modified Urban Village policies, programs and standards.

         Specific planning areas have been identified in Downtown, South, and Southeast Merced
         where Village design principles may be applied. City staff should inventory the existing
         commercial service centers in these designated planning areas and evaluate their potential for
         application of Core Commercial planning principles.
2.1.b    Evaluate public transit alternatives and service levels within existing neighborhoods.
         Based on existing population and service centers and in cooperation with Merced County
         Transit, locate optimum public transportation service routes, park and ride facilities, transit
         stops, etc. Through the Community Plan or other appropriate planning technique, prepare a
         program for developing necessary public transit support facilities within existing
         neighborhoods throughout Merced.
2.1.c    Identify needed neighborhood level public and quasi-public service facilities within
         existing neighborhoods.
         Prepare a plan and program for the development of public and quasi-public facilities which
         should be located in the vicinity of existing or planned Core Commercial service centers.

Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
Chapter 6--Urban Design
Policy UD-2.2
Maintain and Enhance the Unique Community Appearance of Merced.
Over the years, the City of Merced has developed a unique physical character and civic flavor. The
City’s compact form, tree shaded streets, well kept neighborhoods and extensive open space areas have
contributed to its charm and attractiveness. The Courthouse Square and re-energized downtown
commercial center have maintained their human scale which enhances the small town flavor of Merced
even though the city has grown significantly in recent years. To preserve and enhance this positive
community appearance, the City has traditionally committed to a policy of civic improvement and
beautification.
Implementing Actions:
2.2.a   Encourage joint City and County cooperation in establishing land use and development
        standards along all major gateways to the City.
        Highways 99, 59 and 140 are important entry points into the Merced urban area. Scattered and
        unsightly development along these entry points detracts from the overall positive appearance of
        the city. To a large extent, these entry corridors are subject to development rules and
        regulations administered by Merced County. Working in cooperation with the County, the City
        shall propose development standards for these city entrances and outline a strategy for
        implementation.
2.2.b   Encourage the design of buildings that are in scale with adjacent development and
        harmonize with the character of the area or neighborhood.
        Through the site plan and design review process, encourage the preparation of architectural
        renderings of new buildings in scale and context with existing improvements in the area to
        permit a broader range of review options.
2.2.c   Discourage the visual monotony along major streets created by designs which use
        uninterrupted walls or fences with little or no landscaping.
        Where it is necessary to develop fences or walls as visual screens or sound barriers, encourage
        the use of earth berms and other landscape techniques to minimize visual monotony. Fences
        and walls shall have landscaped areas with varied setbacks where they are visible from public
        streets.    Adequate measures, such as the annexation to the City’s Services Community
        Facilities District (CFD), shall be imposed on development permits to assure that long-term
        maintenance of these areas can be assured. Openings for pedestrian access in such walls will
        also be encouraged at intervals along arterial streets. Modified open-end cul-de-sacs will be
        encouraged in place of continuous walls along collector and lower-order streets.
2.2.d   Encourage the development of methods to require acceptable levels of landscaping for
        new development and for effective maintenance in highly visible areas of the community.
        Landscape designs should incorporate water conservation and low maintenance features.
2.2.e   Expand the City's programs for undergrounding utility lines and require all new utility
        lines to be placed underground.
        Working closely with PG&E and other utility companies, the City shall continue its efforts to
        place existing overhead electrical and communication lines underground. All new utility lines
        shall be placed underground. Utility boxes, which cannot be placed underground, shall be
        screened from view in residential and commercial areas.
                                                   6-36

                                                                         Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
                                                                                 Chapter 6--Urban Design
2.2.f Expand the City's policies which require architecturally suitable means of screening
      utility equipment and garbage containers.
      Site plan review procedures shall consider screening of utility equipment, garbage
      collection/recycling stations and other necessary appurtenant features of urban development.
2.2.g Require, where possible, the landscaping of railroad corridors through the City with low
      maintenance yet highly effective plant materials as commonly used in the community by
      various Caltrans facilities.
      Through the development review process, developments proposed along a railroad corridor may
      be required to contribute to a landscape improvement fund or establish a landscape
      improvement and maintenance district along a rail corridor adjacent to the development site.
      The City may investigate other programs and actions which would assist in the financing of
      landscape efforts along these railroad corridors.
2.2.h Support merchant groups that initiate improvement programs that make commercial
      centers more attractive and more efficient.
      The City shall work closely with various merchants and merchant groups to facilitate
      improvements to existing commercial centers.           Particular attention should be given to
      improving pedestrian and transit support facilities to assure that these older centers are
      competitive with newer more transit/pedestrian oriented centers.
2.2.i Continue to support the long-term beautification and preservation of downtown
      commercial areas.
      The City’s Redevelopment program efforts shall be maintained in this area.
2.2.j Maintain and update as necessary the City’s sign ordinances in order to maintain
      attractive and uncluttered commercial landscapes throughout the City.
      The City’s current sign ordinance has different standards for different areas of the City, but all
      with the same goal of maintaining attractive and uncluttered commercial areas. There is a
      North Merced Sign section, which covers areas north of Bear Creek; the Redevelopment Sign
      section, which covers the Downtown Redevelopment Area; and the General Regulations and
      individual zoning districts, which cover the rest of the City. The regulations for North Merced
      and Downtown are, by the policy direction of the City Council when they were adopted, more
      restrictive on the amount and type of signs allowed than the general regulations. The City’s
      sign ordinance has not been comprehensively updated since the 1970’s. After the adoption of
      the General Plan, City staff would like to begin the process of preparing a comprehensive
      update of the City’s sign ordinance along with the Zoning Ordinance in order to reflect
      changing practices within the sign industry and to make the ordinance more user-friendly and
      understandable for the public.

easier to maintain, create less conflicts
between user groups and have less impact on
adjoining neighbors. According to the 2004
Park and Open Space Master Plan, the
parks in Merced have been classified as
follows.
Mini-Parks, tot lots and children's
playgrounds are all small, single purpose
play lots designed primarily for small
children usage. Due to their size, the
facilities are usually limited to a small open
grass area, a children's playground and a
small picnic area. (The Park Master Plan
has recommended that the City dispose of
several mini-parks that get very little use,
and are in need of maintenance. These
resources would be better utilized on other
park sites.)

 Goal Area OS-1: Open Space for the Preservation of Natural Resources
 GOALS
     Maintenance of Merced’s Biological Resources
     A High-Quality, Expanding Urban Forest
     Preservation of Scenic Corridors and Resources
     Improvement and Enhancement of Water Quality
 POLICIES
 OS-1.1       Identify and mitigate impacts to wildlife habitats which support rare, endangered, or
              threatened species.
 OS-1.2       Preserve and enhance creeks in their natural state throughout the planning area.
 OS-1.3       Promote the protection and enhancement of designated scenic routes.
 OS-1.4       Improve and expand the City’s urban forest.
 OS-1.5       Preserve and enhance water quality.
 (Notes: The preservation and protection of important soil resources is addressed under Conservation
 [erosion], Open Space for the Managed Production of Resources [agricultural preservation policies],
 and the Urban Expansion Chapter of this General Plan, where the issue of growth impacts on prime
 soils is addressed.)
 Policy OS-1.1
 Identify and Preserve Wildlife Habitats Which Support Rare, Endangered, or
 Threatened Species.
 The Merced SUDP/SOI is known to contain potential habitat for several sensitive wildlife species.
 Much of this potential habitat is located along riparian corridors of the community’s creek system in
 vernal pools found in the northern part of the City’s SUDP/SOI area, and on some agricultural lands
 throughout the planning area. As a matter of law, the City is required to review development
 proposals that threaten to impact known sensitive species. As a matter of policy, the City is committed
 to integrating potential wildlife habitat into the regional park and recreation system to enhance
 community awareness of the region’s wildlife resources and to provide shelter for native plant and
 animal life of the area.
 Implementing Actions:
 1.1.a    Identify, and recognize as significant wetlands and critical habitat areas which meet the
          appropriate legal definition under Federal and State law.
          Wetlands, as defined by statute, have special regulations which must be followed as opposed
          to other riparian or “water” areas of the community. This policy provides for the identification
          of those lands subject to special Federal and State rules and standards and those which are
          solely subject to local policies and standards. Development applications will be reviewed to
          determine if potential wetland habitats exist on-site, and wetland delineation may be required
          in accordance with current U.S. Army Corps of Engineers guidelines.

      “Wetlands” containing sensitive plant and/or animal species should be protected according to
      law. Specific protection policies should include:
      a) protection of wetland watershed areas;
      b) establishment of minimum setback areas around “wetlands” in accordance with the
           recommendations of California Department of Fish and Game, U.S. Fish and Wildlife
           Service, or a qualified wildlife biologist.
      c) Provision of compensation or wildlife mitigation banks if a site is not protected.
      The City, in cooperation with the County, may consider establishing a mitigation “banking”
      program in accordance with state and federal guidelines for vernal pools and other types of
      wetland habitats. Vernal pool preserves may be incorporated into other open space preserves
      (i.e. parks and trails) that would not be directly impacted by urban development.
1.1.b Urban development should occur away from identified sensitive species critical habitats
      areas unless specific provisions to ensure adequate protection and monitoring exist.
      When, as a result of specific site studies, it is determined that “potential” habitats actually
      contain sensitive or endangered species, development rules, policies and standards should be
      applied to assure that further degradation of these species does not occur. These policies
      should emphasize “avoidance” as a desirable mitigation alternative. In instances where open
      space areas are established to protect a sensitive wildlife species, those areas shall be subject
      to appropriate management principles as approved by the City upon recommendation of the
      California Department of Fish & Game or the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
1.1.c Establish development review procedures which minimize impact on sensitive species
      and their habitat.
      Maintain an inventory of potential wetlands, vernal pools, threatened and endangered plant
      and wildlife species sightings, and wildlife habitat areas.          Require detailed biological
      assessments of these areas, including mitigation plans if necessary, prior to development. To
      permit contiguous development with sufficient density, it may be necessary to develop some
      areas containing vernal pools and marshes; on-site mitigation areas for these wetlands should
      be contiguous with existing wetlands or the open space network of parks and trails.
1.1.d Design parks and open space corridors to provide linkages between potential habitat
      areas.
      It is important to develop linkages between open space areas to facilitate wildlife movement
      between designated habitat areas. This can be accomplished by connecting the east-west
      trending urban stream corridors with a north-south corridor provided by power lines, railroad
      rights-of-way and the regional irrigation canal network. Whenever possible, park open space
      areas should be connected to one or more of these designated open space corridors.
1.1.e Manage Open Space areas to reduce the risk of injuring wildlife species with harmful
      chemicals, insecticides, herbicides, etc.
      Within the City’s open space network containing protected wildlife species, specific
      management practices may be required under Federal and/or State regulations. In other open
      space areas, care should be taken to assure that management practices do not cause an
      unnecessary threat to area native plant and animal life.
                                                  7-21

Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
Chapter 7--Open Space, Conservation & Recreation
 1.1.f   Design improvements within parks, open space areas and open space corridors to
         facilitate animal life movement.
         Creek road crossings should utilize culvert or bridge designs which provide adequate areas for
         wildlife to travel along the creek corridor without being forced into a motor vehicle pathway.
         Fences and other barriers should be designed to allow passage of native wildlife species
         throughout the open space area.
 1.1.g   Implement the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the City of Merced and
         the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), dated June 16, 2008, regarding the
         processing of development applications to ensure compliance with the Federal
         Endangered Species Act relating to Projects to be Served by the Wastewater Treatment
         Plant Water Quality Upgrade and Expansion Project.
         The MOU specifies the kinds of development projects affected by the MOU (generally all
         those properties north of Cardella Road and all projects beyond the existing 10 mgd capacity
         of the City’s Wastewater Treatment Plant). The MOU also outlines the procedures and
         comment period for notifying the U.S.F.W.S. of qualifying development projects and requires
         that applications for development projects shall demonstrate compliance with the Endangered
         Species Act (ESA) as a pre-condition to having their application scheduled for public hearing.
 Policy OS-1.2
 Preserve and Enhance Creeks in Their Natural State Throughout the Planning Area.
 The urban creek system of Merced provides an important open space element within the City and
 provides important wildlife habitat. This creek system is also an integral part of the City’s drainage
 system. The City is committed to a policy of preserving and protecting these important open space
 resources and assuring their continued viability as open space and drainage corridors.
 Implementing Actions:
 1.2.a   Designate major creeks, streams, woodlands, and other appropriate areas in the City’s
         SUDP/SOI as Open Space corridors.
         Major creeks, riparian habitat, significant woodlands, and other sensitive environmental
         features should be conserved as open space amenities, when feasible. Significant stands of
         trees and knolls should also be preserved. Fencing and piping of creeks should be avoided.
         Open Merced Irrigation District channels should not be considered as Open Space corridors,
         but where MID canals have been undergrounded, MID is open to working with the City on
         establishing open space corridors (with limited landscaping).
         Channelization of non-MID improvements should be naturalized. Whenever possible, in
         keeping with City standards and CEQA required mitigation measures, major creeks, riparian
         habitat, significant woodlands and other environmental features should be incorporated into
         the design of development.
 1.2.b   Continue to acquire a minimum 50-foot dedication from the centerline (or 25 feet from
         the crown, whichever is greater) of all creeks within the planning area in order to
         maintain these open space areas as natural riparian preserves and recreation areas.
                                                   7-22

                                                                          Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
                                                          Chapter 7--Open Space, Conservation & Recreation
        Public access should be permitted, while important natural features and sensitive habitats are
        preserved. Corridor width shall be dictated by site specific circumstances of the creek,
        however, at least the established minimum setback shall be maintained as Open Space.
1.2.c   Encourage alternatives to concrete channeling of existing creeks and streams as part of
        any flood control project and support more natural flood control methods.
        There is an inherent conflict between flood control and drainage needs of the community and
        the value of natural drainage course as open space and wildlife habitat areas. While
        meandering streams and vegetation have the best wildlife values, they are least efficient in
        terms of removing flood waters from the community. Stream improvement plans must attempt
        to strike a compromise between drainage needs and open space needs on a case by case basis.
1.2.d   Recognize Bear, Black Rascal, Cottonwood, and Fahrens Creeks as important open
        space resources and promote their protection and enhancement through the use of
        natural plant materials.
        Use of natural or native plant landscape material instead of turf along creek banks whenever
        possible may result in improvement of the habitat value of the channel and reduce maintenance
        costs to the City.
Policy OS-1.3
Promote the Protection and Enhancement of Designated Scenic Routes.
Historically, the City of Merced has developed along routes and corridors which have come to be part
of the City’s identity. The City has designated many of these scenic routes for special development
review regulation in the past. This practice has served the City well and will be continued into the
future.
Implementing Actions:
1.3.a   Identify, and where appropriate, designate additional scenic routes within the City’s
        SUDP/Sphere of Influence.
        Use the following criteria to identify scenic routes:
        a) The scenic area through which the corridor passes should possess important scenic,
             historic, or aesthetic value.
        b) As appropriate, the scenic corridor should contain a variety of vegetation or landscape
             types.
        c) Routes of historic significance which connect places of interest should be considered even
             though the route is of marginal scenic value.
        d) Routes which incorporate significant views or vistas should be considered.
1.3.b   Preserve the designated Scenic Corridors
        The Scenic Corridors are as follows:
        a) North and South Bear Creek Drive within the City limits.
        b) N Street from 16th Street to the Merced County Courthouse.
        c) 21st Street from the Merced County Courthouse to Glen Avenue.
                                                   7-23

Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
Chapter 7--Open Space, Conservation & Recreation
         d)   M Street from Black Rascal Creek to Bellevue Road.
         e)   West 28th Street from M Street to G Street.
         f)   Lake Road from Yosemite Avenue to Lake Yosemite.
         g)   R Street (extended) from Black Rascal Creek to Bellevue Road.
         h)   Olive Avenue East of McKee Road.
         i)   M Street from 18th Street to Bear Creek.
         j)   Campus Parkway.
         k)   Bellevue Road from Lake Road to “G” Street.
 1.3.c   Utilize established guidelines for the review of projects proposed within a designated
         Scenic Corridor.
         The following guidelines apply to the review of applications for development in vicinity of a
         designated Scenic Corridor:
         a) Utility lines should be placed underground whenever feasible.
         b) Signing should be carefully controlled to insure that it does not detract from the scenic
              beauty of the corridor. Specific guidelines for signing along these corridors should be
              established.
         c) Limit the intrusion of future land uses which may detract from the scenic quality of the
              corridor.
         d) Unsightly mechanical and utility structures shall be screened from view by use of planting,
              grading, and fencing.
         e) Heights and setbacks of buildings should be regulated to avoid obstructing important
              scenic views.
         f) Every effort should be made to preserve and properly maintain existing stands of trees and
              other plant materials of outstanding value.
         g) Structures on private and public properties visible from the corridor should be maintained
              in good condition (free of trash, weeds, etc.).
         h) Architectural and landscape design should result in an attractive appearance and a
              harmonious relationship with the surrounding environment.
 1.3.d   Explore the feasibility of creating some scenic corridors in South Merced through the use
         of special standards.
         Continue to implement the Gateway Road policy of the South Merced Community Plan, which
         states: “Require design treatments along Childs Avenue (between SR 99 and SR 59), Mission
         Avenue (between SR 99 and SR 59), Tyler Road, and SR 59 that will enhance the aesthetic
         qualities of the roadways,” notably:
         •    encourage and/or provide programs to businesses on SR 59 that will enable building
              facade and site landscaping improvements;
         •    install a landscaped median in Tyler Road; and,
         •    utilize the established design guidelines (Policy OS-1.3.c of the Merced Vision 2030
              General Plan) for projects proposed alongside these roads.

Policy OS-1.4
Improve and Expand the City’s Urban Forest.
Early in the development of Merced, trees were planted to provide shelter from wind and summer heat.
As a result, the City has a large number of mature trees along its streets, in public places and in
private yards and has been designated a “Tree City USA” for over 30 years. The City’s urban forest
provides valuable wildlife habitat and creates an attractive atmosphere for residents and visitors
alike. Additionally, the City’s trees have substantially reduced summer heat and glare around paved
areas, thereby helping the City maintain a cooler summer average temperature and reduce energy
usage. In continuing this tradition, the City of Merced has established policies and programs to
protect, maintain and expand its urban forests.
Implementing Actions:
1.4.a    Continue the City's Street Tree program (Merced Municipal Code 14.12) and explore
         alternative funding sources for providing long-term maintenance.
         The City needs to explore new and innovative ways of maintaining trees in public spaces.
         This could include establishment of landscape maintenance service areas within new
         developments and other programs such as an “Adopt-A-Tree” program within the City where a
         business or individual would assume the responsibility for the long-term care and maintenance
         of a significant urban tree or stand of trees.
1.4.b    Continue to require new development to plant street trees approximately 40 feet apart,
         at a maximum, along City streets.
         Tree planting policies have been established by the City for new development projects. These
         practices are to be continued. Exceptions to the spacing requirements are granted in selected
         areas where trees may interfere with other public facilities, such as street lights, traffic signals,
         etc.
1.4.c    Work with local non-profit agencies, service clubs, and other voluntary organizations to
         plant trees and shrubs in appropriate areas throughout the City.
         As part of an overall City beautification effort, local residents and service clubs, along with
         non-profit groups and businesses, can assist in expanding the City’s urban forest programs into
         areas which are already developed with less than a full complement of tree plantings.
1.4.d    Continue to promote Merced's "Tree City USA" designation with Arbor Day and other
         public events.
         These programs serve to generate public awareness of the City’s urban forest and the need to
         protect and enhance this urban amenity.

 Policy OS-1.5
 Preserve and Enhance Water Quality.
 Water has become one of the most important resources for determining a region’s ability to grow and
 prosper. California has enacted several major laws which require local communities to address the
 complicated issue of resources. The City of Merced has adopted policies addressing the conservation
 of urban water use and a development strategy to meet future water needs (see Section 5.2.3). The
 final element in the City’s comprehensive water strategy is the preservation of water quality. It should
 be noted that these policies are directed towards enhancing or implementing the many existing water
 quality regulations which affect the City and its residents.
 Implementing Actions:
 1.5.a    Utilize storm water retention basins and other “Best Management Practices” to improve
          the quality of storm water discharged into the region’s natural surface water system.
          Working in cooperation with the Merced Irrigation District and Central Valley Regional Water
          Quality Control Board, study alternative means of implementing cost effective “Best
          Management Practices” for the treatment of storm water discharges into the regional surface
          water system. (“Best Management Practices” are defined as the most up-to-date methods of
          dealing with a problem as determined by experts in the field. These practices change over
          time as new techniques and methodologies are developed.) A program may be developed
          which integrates the use of storm water retention ponds, groundwater recharge basins, swails,
          or other techniques which could improve the quality of storm water run-off. Additionally,
          design guidelines for new development may be prepared to address storm water treatment prior
          to its entry into the City’s storm water drainage system.
 1.5.b    Monitor known sources of groundwater contamination within the City and its future
          expansion area.
          In cooperation with the State Department of Health Services, the Central Valley Regional
          Water Quality Control Board and the Merced County Environmental Health Department, the
          City will maintain an inventory of known sources of groundwater contamination in the City’s
          planning area. When appropriate, the City may implement policies and/or programs which
          minimize the threat of aggravating existing problems and eliminate potential future problems
          of ground water contamination. In some instances, the City may consider extending municipal
          water service to suburban areas on the City’s urban fringe experiencing problems from
          polluted ground water or to prevent future problems.
 1.5.c    Monitor ground water in areas in and around the City using septic system wastewater
          disposal systems.
          In cooperation with the Merced County Environmental Health Department, monitor developed
          areas within the City’s planning area for nitrate concentrations exceeding state standards.
          Where problem areas are identified, study potential resolutions to the problem, including
          annexation and the extension of City sewer service to the area.

GOAL
     Protection of Regional Agricultural Resources
POLICIES
OS-2.1 Protect agricultural areas outside the City’s SUDP/SOI from urban impacts.
OS-2.2 Relieve pressures on converting areas containing large concentrations of “prime” agricultural
          soils to urban uses by providing adequate urban development land within the Merced City
          SUDP/SOI.
Policy OS-2.1
Protect Agricultural Areas Outside the City’s SUDP/SOI From Urban Impacts.
Regional agricultural cropland provides an economic base for the City of Merced, and the long term
economic health of the City is directly linked to conserving the productive capacity of regional
farmland. To this degree, the City has established urban expansion policies directing urban growth
away from “prime” agricultural soils. Policies are also needed to protect farmland along the urban
perimeter and to promote open space policies which protect farmland and the farming industry.
Implementing Actions:
2.1.a   Continue to explore the use of Farmland Trusts, exclusive agricultural zoning, the
        transfer of development rights, and other methods to protect prime agricultural areas.
        The City, in cooperation with the County of Merced and the City of Atwater, can explore
        various agricultural preservation programs in proximity to the City. The policies should limit
        present tendencies towards suburbanization of farmlands into large lot Rural Residential
        developments which have a long term adverse impact on the productive capacity of the
        region’s agricultural production capacity. The possibility of establishing a land bank should be
        investigated further.
2.1.b   Establish policies and programs which minimize conflicts between urban and
        agricultural uses.
        Consider adoption of a “right-to-farm” ordinance to inform residents of continued agricultural
        production and the lawful use of agricultural chemicals, including pesticides and fertilizers, in
        proximity to urban areas. Also, to assert that no pre-existing or future agricultural operation
        would be considered a nuisance solely due to a change in adjacent land use or adjoining
        residential development.
2.1.c   Minimize conflict between agricultural and urban uses by requiring buffers, such as
        landscape areas, roadways, or creeks, to separate these uses.
        The City should periodically review its urban boundary policies to assure that adjacent farm
        lands are adequately buffered from urban uses.
2.1.d   Work with Merced County and the other cities in the County to develop a Countywide
        agricultural preservation policy as defined in Urban Expansion Implementing Action
        UE-1.1.f.
        Please refer to the Urban Expansion Chapter for details regarding this Implementing Action.
(Notes: This policy is supported by other policies and implementing actions found in the Land Use and
Urban Expansion Chapters of this Plan.)

 Relieve Pressures on Converting Areas Containing Large Concentrations of “Prime”
 Agricultural Soils to Urban Uses by Providing Adequate Urban Development Land
 Within the Merced City SUDP/SOI.
 Generally, overly restrictive growth and development policies within a city can translate into
 increased development pressure on rural areas. The City of Merced is committed to providing
 adequate and economically competitive development land within its urban growth area in order to
 reduce rural development pressures on the valuable agricultural lands outside the City’s SUDP/SOI
 and in the surrounding region.
 Implementing Actions:
 This important policy will be carried out through several implementing actions found in the Land Use,
 Public Services and Facilities, and Urban Expansion Chapters of the Merced Vision 2030 General
 Plan. These programs are not duplicated here under this policy heading.
 Goal Area OS-3: Open Space for Outdoor Recreation
 GOALS
     High-Quality Recreational Open Space
     Adequate Public Recreation Facilities
     Comprehensive Urban Trail and Bike Path System
 POLICIES
 OS-3.1 Provide high-quality park and open space facilities to serve the needs of a growing
           population.
 OS-3.2 Maintain and expand the City's Bikeway and Trail System.
 OS-3.3 Maintain the City's existing high-quality open space facilities.
 OS-3.4 Develop a diverse and integrated system of park facilities throughout Merced.
 Policy OS-3.1
 Provide High-Quality Park and Open Space Facilities to Serve the Needs of a
 Growing Population.
 The City of Merced has benefited from the foresight of early leaders in the City’s development with
 respect to parks and open space. The City’s growth has historically incorporated its natural open
 space resources along Bear Creek and other lesser drainage courses into an overall open space
 network which has become a major source of civic pride. The City is committed to continuing this
 high standard of park and open space development in the expansion areas of the existing City.
 Implementing Actions:
 3.1.a   Continue efforts to acquire new park sites within future growth areas in advance of
         development to meet the recreation open space needs of an expanding population.
                                                  7-28

                                                                        Merced Vision 2030 General Plan

      Overall, a total of five (5) acres of parkland should be provided per 1,000 residents in the City,
      of which 1.5 acres should be in community park and 3.5 acres should be in various forms of
      neighborhood parks, including village greens, school parks and other neighborhood parks.
      “Greenway” trails should provide bicycle and pedestrian access throughout the City and its
      growth areas.
3.1.b Consider density bonuses for development proposals which offer extra park land
      dedications where needed.
      Density bonuses on new development should be linked to park land needs for the area and
      exclude areas which must be set aside as wildlife preserves or left undeveloped for other
      environmental concerns. Land dedication for planned trails and bikeways are appropriate, but
      areas used for drainage facilities to serve a development would not be considered for parkland
      except those areas to be improved for park and open space use by the developer.
3.1.c Continue to implement the City’s 2004 Parks and Open Space Master Plan and any
      subsequent updates.
      The City’s Parks and Open Space Master Plan (2004) provides specific system design and
      implementation standards for the development of the City’s park system. This plan serves as a
      basis for requiring development recreation dedications as well as a guide for public facilities
      expenditures in the parks and recreation category. The 2004 Master Plan provides a road map
      for the acquisition and maintenance of the City’s park and open space resources. The
      implementation measures and design and development policies contained within the Master
      Plan should be followed. This plan requires periodic update and will need to be revised to
      reflect the City’s proposed SUDP/SOI and the parks and open space opportunities and needs
      resulting from development.
3.1.d Continue to encourage joint use agreements between the City and local school districts to
      combine the design and use of park and school facilities when feasible.
      This policy supports and complements other joint use facility policies of the Public Facilities
      chapter of this General Plan. A 5- to 10-acre neighborhood park should be associated with
      each elementary and junior high school. These schools and school parks should be centrally
      located, placed at the edge of a Village or neighborhood center and along greenways when
      possible. By designing both facilities at the same time, the functionality can be significantly
      improved.
3.1.e Use the City’s Park Dedication Ordinance to develop the City’s park system.
      A strong effort should be made to use the following criteria to locate parks:
      a) No household should have to walk more than approximately one-half to three-quarters of a
           mile to a park site.
      b) Parks should be located adjacent to schools as much as feasible.
      c) Provide visual, pedestrian and vehicular access to all parks by requiring them to front on
           public streets on as many sides as possible and not be surrounded by privately owned
           property. Adequate parking facilities should be provided where needed.
      d) Neighborhood park sites should front on at least one side on a collector street with the
           remaining sides on local streets. Community or Regional parks may front on arterials.

         e) Park sites should be located so as to incorporate naturally-occurring open space features,
              such as significant stands of trees, riparian and wildlife habitat, scenic vistas, and creeks
              and drainage canals.
         f) Park sites should be located adjacent to bikeway facilities.
         g) Park sites should be located near higher-density residential areas as much as possible.
         h) Parks should have access to nearby subdivision and greenways by means of cul-de-sacs,
              access easements, etc.
 3.1.f   Design and develop parks which are compatible with adjacent land uses through the
         establishment of a park planning process that is responsive to community and
         neighborhood input.
         Existing parks should be evaluated periodically by the Recreation and Parks Commission to
         ensure that they are meeting the needs of the neighborhoods in which they are located, and
         programs for expansion/ relocation/reconfiguration should be established when needed.
 3.1.g   Ensure that if park sites are also used for storm water detention, that there is sufficient
         land made available so that storm water detention does not interfere with the park and
         recreation function of the park.
         According to the 2004 Park and Open Space Master Plan, if storm drainage basins are
         included in a neighborhood park, at least 2 contiguous, usable acres should be provided in
         addition to the acreage contained in the basin. At least 50 percent of the site should be flat and
         open. For community parks, at least 8 acres should be provided outside the basin.
 Policy OS-3.2
 Maintain and Expand the City’s Bikeway and Trail System.
 Merced’s bikeway and urban trail system has become a model for the region and an important element
 of the character of Merced. The system’s use of the natural open space resources of the community
 has benefited the public and helped to preserve important open space lands in addition to providing
 recreation and all transportation to residents. Bikeways and urban trails are an important element of
 the greenway system and provide linkages between other elements of the park system, public
 transportation, and residential and commercial areas throughout the City. The City is committed to
 building upon this system and expanding it into the growth areas within the resource constraints of the
 City. The 2004 Park and Open Space Master Plan provides a detailed needs assessment, along with
 policies and design standards for the acquisition, development and maintenance of new park and
 recreation facilities. The City’s Bicycle Master Plan also addresses bikeway and trail systems.
 Implementing Actions:
 3.2.a   Utilize the urban stream system in the planning and design of bikeways and trails.
         It is the City’s policy to acquire a minimum 50-foot dedication from the centerline (or 25 feet
         from the crown, whichever is greater) of all creeks within the planning area in order to
         maintain these open space areas as natural riparian preserves and recreation areas.
         Development of bikeways and trails in these open space areas can enhance the open space
         value of the urban stream system provided that the trails do not unnecessarily interfere with
         other open space goals and policies.

3.2.b Make use of creekside areas, utility line easements, abandoned railroad rights-of-way,
      and canal easements for bikeway purposes.
      These areas are generally set aside as open space areas, and their use for bikeway and trail
      systems would enhance the public value of open space in addition to providing an important
      amenity to neighborhood residents.
3.2.c Provide links between parks, schools, and open space areas via the bikeway system.
      The bikeway system can also be part of a greenway linking parks, schools, and other important
      open space areas.
3.2.d Provide a link between the City and County bikeway systems by establishing a connector
      to the Lake Road Bikeway Corridor out to Lake Yosemite.
      This area will become an important bikeway link to the new U.C. Campus area and its
      surrounding development. Plans may be integrated with future development of the Campus
      Parkway and linear open space plans along drainage courses and irrigation canals.
3.2.e Develop an off-street bikeway and trail system in South Merced.
      As part of the South Merced Community Plan process, an inventory of potential off-street
      routes was reviewed by neighborhood groups. A system was developed to link existing and
      planned future park areas and provide links to other open space and school areas as well as
      being integrated into the rest of the City’s bikeway system (see Figure 4.9), and this plan’s
      Policy T-2.4.b. The City should explore using existing drainage facility easements to
      accommodate such a system. The planned system should be implemented within the resource
      constraints of the City.
3.2.f Expand the existing bikeway system to all new growth areas as development occurs.
      As part of the development review process, bikeway dedications should be required, when
      appropriate, as a condition of permit approval.
3.2.g Explore the possibility of providing unpaved trails for equestrian and mountain bike use
      as part of the overall trail system.
      These types of trail systems may be appropriate along the eastern fringe of the City where
      lower density Rural Residential development permits the keeping of horses and other livestock
      on large lots.
3.2.h Bike path designs should reflect security and other needs of the surrounding community.
      When locating bike paths and trails, the design should be sensitive to the need for privacy and
      security of neighboring residents. If feasible, bikeways should be designed with multiple
      access points from surrounding neighborhoods so there is sufficient visibility from public
      roadways to facilitate surveillance by residents and police patrols. Where feasible, bike paths
      should be designed so that at least one side is open to a public street. Situations where bike
      paths are located along the back sides of homes with limited visibility should be avoided as
      much as possible. Open fencing along bike paths should be considered, especially adjacent to
      multi-family developments.

 Policy OS-3.3
 Maintain the City’s Existing High-Quality Open Space Facilities.
 Resources for parks and recreation programs and facilities are derived from the same sources which
 provide essential public services such as public protection. Within the municipal finance structure of
 the City, it can be expected that other municipal needs may limit the resources which can be dedicated
 to maintaining and improving existing park and recreation facilities. At present, park and open space
 expansion is funded largely though exactions and dedications resulting from growth and development.
 These resources cannot necessarily be applied to the maintenance and upgrading of existing facilities.
 For these reasons, the City is committed to exploring new alternatives for meeting the park and open
 space maintenance obligations for existing facilities.
 Implementing Actions:
 3.3.a   Design park facilities so that a high quality of maintenance can occur with minimum
         effort.
         This should include the use of sturdy, low-maintenance plant materials, equipment, and
         surfaces. Where practical, existing facilities should be upgraded utilizing low maintenance
         materials and design techniques.
 3.3.b   Encourage community participation in park maintenance and improvement programs.
         Community and neighborhood groups should be encouraged to “adopt-a-park” or playground
         and become involved in the planning, upgrading and maintenance of the park and its facilities.
         Monthly or semi-annual neighborhood park special events or programs can be planned
         involving park users, neighborhood residents and local service organizations in park clean-up
         and maintenance efforts. These events could also be used as fund raising events for needed
         park improvements.
 3.3.c   Explore park concession opportunities as a revenue source for park improvements and
         maintenance.
         In appropriate park locations, the City may consider establishment of concession stands or
         vending machine locations which could be leased to concessionaires; revenues would be
         deposited into a park maintenance and improvement fund. Concession operators may include
         local youth service, neighborhood, or community groups, which could operate the concessions
         to raise money for charitable purposes.
 3.3.d   Encourage neighborhood participation in policing and park security efforts.
         In cooperation with the Police Department, involve community and neighborhood associations
         or similar groups in providing park security to discourage vandalism.
                                                   7-32

Policy OS-3.4
Develop a Diverse and Integrated System of Park Facilities Throughout Merced.
Throughout the City, a system of park and open space facilities should exist which include
neighborhood parks, community parks, and greenways. This park system should be developed to serve
all age, social, and economic groups in every geographic area of the City. Refer to the City’s 2004
Park and Open Space Master Plan for design and development policies for new parks.
Implementing Actions:
3.4.a   Community parks should be distributed throughout the City.
        There should be at least 1.5 acres of community park provided per 1,000 residents.
        Community parks are usually 15 acres in size or greater. Community parks are major
        recreation facilities and contain many ball fields, play lots, picnic opportunities and other
        facilities. They must be located along a greenway and should be at the junction of two
        greenways when possible. Greenways, streets and landscaping should be used to minimize
        and buffer residences from the noise and nighttime lighting associated with ball fields.
        Development of the Community Park at the northwest corner of Tyler and Mission in South
        Merced as described in the City’s Park and Open Space Master Plan, should be a top priority.
3.4.b   Neighborhood parks and village greens are to be located within Villages.
        Neighborhood parks should be distributed so most areas are less than one-mile from any park.
        Within any square-mile quadrant bounded by arterial roads, a total of 3.5 acres of
        neighborhood parks should be provided for each 1,000 residents. “Village greens,” which are
        a special form of “Neighborhood Park,” should be located between Core Commercial areas
        and Village Core Residential areas, and may be used to meet village park acreage
        requirements. Parks should be situated away from arterial streets. Public facilities, such as
        day care, libraries, community centers and post offices, may be developed within or
        immediately across from village greens when possible.
        In the location, design, and maintenance of neighborhood parks, it should be kept in mind that
        they are fundamental features of livable and enjoyable higher-density neighborhoods.
        Neighborhood park sites should reinforce retail and residential areas by creating “town
        squares” suitable for informal gatherings, public events, and recreation. Neighborhood parks
        should create a formal focus within villages.
3.4.c   Greenways should be designed to connect various park sites, schools and other public
        places with paths exclusively for pedestrians and bicyclists.
        Greenways weave through the residential neighborhoods connecting larger public uses
        (schools, open space, commercial uses, etc.) and provide many points of physical and visual
        access to the park sites. Some greenways may also act as mini-parks because of play and
        exercise equipment placed along the paths. Greenways act as valuable greenbelts of open
        space through a neighborhood. Greenways should be designed in association with bike paths,
        trails, and pedestrian ways to follow creeks, canals, power line easements, etc.
        Greenway design should emphasize access. Access has a major effect on whether a greenway
        is used. If a greenway is hidden, tucked away in a neighborhood, enclosed by high fences,
        and/or unmaintained, the public may avoid using them and they may become unsafe.

Chapter 7--Open Space, Conservation & Recreation
 3.4.d   In cooperation with Merced County and the Merced Irrigation District, evaluate the
         Lake Yosemite regional park to identify how it might adequately meet the needs of the
         City of Merced and the new growth areas in the region including the U.C. Merced
         campus.
         Regional parks can serve many cities and are sometimes used as resting stops for travelers.
         Often their focal points are lakes, rivers or other natural resources. Typically, they are
         provided by counties and the state. Because of their distance from a city, their accessibility is
         generally limited to those who can drive there. Lake Yosemite Park is a regional park located
         in the northern expansion area of the City and operated by the County of Merced. Lake
         Yosemite Park is of special interest to Merced because of its water recreation opportunities
         and open space qualities in addition to the fact that it is within bicycle commute range for
         many residents.
         Lake Yosemite will likely become more heavily used by City residents as Merced grows and
         the U.C. Merced campus expands and grows. As the City expands to the north and public
         transportation becomes more available in the area, Lake Yosemite Park will become even more
         accessible to local residents. As a result, additional space and facilities may be required to
         accommodate future growth. Some of the area around the park contains potential wildlife
         habitat which limits development options for land owners. The City and County might
         cooperate in developing a wildlife mitigation banking program for this area which would allow
         landowners to transfer development rights to other lands upon dedicating habitat and potential
         park land for public use. Consideration should be given to providing expanded public access
         and additional roadway entrances into the Lake Yosemite Regional Park.

 POLICY
 OS-4.1 Preserve open space areas which are necessary to maintaining public health and safety.
 Policy OS-4.1
 Preserve Open Space Areas Which Are Necessary to Maintaining Public Health and
 Safety.
 Areas within the City which may represent a substantial risk to public health and safety have
 historically been designated for open space uses which may permit limited public or private use but
 generally reduce potential exposure of the public to potential health hazards. The City is committed to
 continuing to protect public health, where practical, by limiting the potential for public exposure
 through the sound application of open space practices and policies.
 Implementing Actions:
 4.1.a   Continue enforcement of the City's Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance (MMC 17.48)
         to discourage construction in high-risk areas.

         Areas that are known to represent a flood hazard to people and property are subject to land use
         standards which would limit exposure. These policies could allow limited development with
         special development standards to accommodate periodic flooding or exclusive use of the area
         for parks and open space. Agricultural uses are appropriate in some areas which exhibit 200-
         year flood risk potential. The State of California now requires that floodplain regulations be
         applied to the 200-year floodplain.
4.1.b    Utilize areas along railroad rights-of-way and under high-voltage power transmission
         lines as open space.
         These areas could be used as greenways and open space areas which would provide scenic
         buffers from potential health hazards in addition to providing visual (and noise in the case of
         railroads) buffers to surrounding areas. These areas could also be developed with storm water
         retention basins, groundwater recharge basin or used as part of the municipal water or other
         utility systems where the risk of public exposure to health hazards could be minimized.
4.1.c    Continue enforcement of the City's weed abatement program to ensure undeveloped
         areas do not become fire hazards.
         Weed abatement programs are an important management concept in open space areas to
         minimize the risk of fire. In all cases, open space areas are best used with planned plantings of
         native trees, brush and other plants in a park type setting. When possible, unused plots of land
         may be appropriately used for community garden uses for neighboring residents. This use
         would be most appropriate in areas where there is a large number of multi-family dwellings
         and few public parks are available.
4.1.d    Continue to discourage residential uses in Merced Regional Airport Clear Zones.
         Airport clear-zones and approach and landing corridors represent potential hazard areas to
         residential development. The areas are subject to noise nuisances as well. These areas are
         best used for open space purposes such as agriculture, golf courses and other types of uses that
         do not involve large populations.

 Policy OS-5.1
 Promote Water Conservation Throughout the Planning Area.
 Water is a finite resource in the Central San Joaquin Valley and is an essential ingredient to the
 region’s continued agricultural production capacity as well as a vital element in the continued growth
 of the Merced Metropolitan Area. The City, in conjunction with the Merced Irrigation District, has
 studied the long-term needs for water and concluded that water conservation must be part of any
 successful long term water development strategy. For this reason, the City is committed to continue its
 water conservation efforts and expand on those efforts where necessary.
 Implementing Actions:
 5.1.a   Continue implementation and enforcement of the City's Water Shortage Regulations
         (MMC 15.42.010-100).
         The City’s emergency water shortage regulations have been in effect for many years to ensure
         an adequate water supply into the future.
 5.1.b   Continue implementation of the Water Efficient Landscaping and Irrigation Ordinance
         (MMC 17.60.010-070) and subsequent updates.
         Promote the conservation of water and the preservation of water quality by requiring drought
         tolerant plant material in landscaping and the retention of existing natural vegetation on new
         development projects. The City will also consider alternatives to turf and other water-
         intensive landscaping, including artificial turf.
 5.1.c   Provide leadership in conserving urban water resources.
         City buildings and facilities should be equipped with water saving devices whenever practical.
         Municipal parks and playgrounds should employ water conservation techniques such as
         mulching, drip irrigation and other appropriate technologies.
 5.1.d   Encourage public water conservation efforts.
         Through established public information systems in the community, the City should promote
         water conservation by providing information on water savings from low-flow fixtures and the
         value of insulating hot water lines in water recirculating systems. Other conservation
         techniques can be addressed such as the use of non-potable water for landscape irrigation
         purposes (water re-use, MID water, etc.).
 [Notes: Water conservation policies are supported by other policies in this General Plan to protect
 regional water resources (Public Facilities Goal Area P-3) and water quality (Open Space Policy
 1.5).]
 Policy OS-5.2
 Protect Soil Resources From the Erosive Forces of Wind and Water.
 Merced is situated on some of the finest soil resources found in the Central San Joaquin Valley. Some
 of these soils are of a silty-loam texture and highly vulnerable to erosion from wind and water. Wind
 erosion contributes to the region’s PM10 and PM 2.5 air quality problems, as discussed in the
 Sustainable Development Chapter(8) of this General Plan, and water erosion can contribute to
 sedimentation of the region’s surface water drainage system. In all cases, the loss of soil through
 erosive forces of nature degrades the productive capacity of the land and contributes to regional
 environmental problems.

  Implementing Actions:
  5.2.a   Reduce soil erosion potential of new development.
          During the development review process for projects which involve grading and excavation,
          apply permit conditions which reduce or prevent erosion, siltation and contamination of storm
          water during construction. Techniques such as mulching of exposed surfaces, restricting
          major excavation projects during peak storm periods, or watering exposed surfaces during
          summer dry periods, can be successfully employed to reduce construction-caused erosion.
  5.2.b   Encourage the planting of trees as windbreaks in agricultural areas of the community.
          Historically, trees have been successfully used as windbreaks in the region. Stands of wind-
          break trees can be established as part of an open space corridor, along roadways and bike
          paths, or at appropriate locations along the urban perimeter adjacent to agricultural land.
  5.2.c   Maintain adequate vegetation along the banks of urban streams and storm water
          drainage channels.
          The erosive force of storm water can cause damage to stream channel banks that have been
          cleared of their vegetative cover. Where it is necessary to remove natural vegetation along
          stream channels to improve storm water flows, “rip-rap” (rocks, concrete, etc.) should be
          applied to reduce erosion and sedimentation hazards.
  (Notes: These policies are proposed in support of Air Quality PM10 PM       2.5 policies contained in the

                                                                        Chapter 8--Sustainable Development
Policy SD-1.1
Accurately Determine and Fairly Mitigate the Local and Regional Air Quality
Impacts of Projects Proposed in the City of Merced.
The environmental assessment process required under the California Environmental Quality Act
(CEQA) is by far the most important tool for local government to communicate with other agencies and
the public on the air quality impacts of development within a community. CEQA, however, has only
limited applicability with respect to development review and approval. The law focuses on
“Discretionary” projects, as opposed to “administrative” development proposals. As a result, large
scale developments, which typically require “discretionary” permits are often subjected to CEQA
mitigation that is not required of “administrative” projects. While consistent application of CEQA can
make a difference in project-level air quality impacts, uniform air quality standards for all projects
could make a significant contribution toward limiting regional, cumulative air quality impacts.
Implementing Actions:
1.1.a   Implement uniform standards, analysis methods, and significance thresholds
        recommended by the Air District for mitigating air quality impacts resulting from
        development.
        The City will work closely with the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District
        (SJVAPCD) to develop and implement uniform standards for determining “thresholds of
        significance” for air quality impacts for use in the City’s CEQA review process. The City will
        also identify cost effective and uniform mitigation standards and use these standards in a
        manner that they can be applied to all development in a consistent and uniform manner.
1.1.b   Ensure that significant air quality impacts identified during CEQA review are
        consistently and fairly mitigated.
        The City will work closely with the SJVAPCD, builders and other interested parties to develop
        uniform and appropriate mitigation measures in the City. City policies and provisions will
        attempt to eliminate mitigation policies and practices which discourage large-scale
        comprehensively planned projects.
1.1.c   All air quality mitigation measures should be feasible, implementable, and cost effective.
        City planning efforts have focused on development standards which discourage growth patterns
        that unnecessarily have an adverse impact on air quality. Further mitigation of air quality
        impacts, at the project specific level, should focus on the unique circumstances of the project
        and the site with respect to air quality impacts. Project specific mitigation measures will be
        developed to assure that they can be implemented in a manner so as to achieve the desired
        effect and that the benefits in improved air quality are justified in light of private and public
        expenditure.
1.1.d   Work with the SJVAPCD to identify regional cumulative transportation and air quality
        impacts.
        The City shall work with the SJVUAPCD, and other local governments in the region, to
        perform uniform air emissions modeling on the cumulative land use changes in the region. The
        City will participate in regional planning efforts which will fairly assess the air quality impacts
        of various local governmental growth policies. It is expected that this effort would lead to
        regional growth and development strategies (developed, administered and implemented at the
        local government level) which will substantially reduce the adverse impacts of new growth and
        development on regional air quality.
                                                   8-23

Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
Chapter 8--Sustainable Development
 1.1.e   Reduce the air quality impacts of development projects that may be insignificant by
         themselves, but cumulatively are significant.
         Small residential and commercial projects usually do not cause significant air quality impacts,
         but when a number of small unrelated projects are developed in an area, they produce a
         cumulative impact. These potential impacts have been addressed in the development of the
         Merced General Plan Land Use Diagram. Individual projects which are consistent with these
         General Plan policies should be subject to limited air quality analysis which focuses on
         neighborhood level impacts. Other projects will need to be evaluated within the context of the
         net cumulative effect on regional air quality. These principles of review shall also be applied
         to development proposed outside of the City’s SUDP/SOI which are subject to City review and
         comment.
 1.1.f   Encourage innovative measures to reduce air quality impacts by coordinating with the
         SJVAPCD, project applicants, and other interested parties..
         Innovative measures can be identified during a pre-application consultation process and during
         city staff/applicant consultation over CEQA mitigation approaches. The Air District should be
         involved in these discussions to the extent feasible.
 1.1.g   Include the evaluation of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Climate Change in
         environmental review documents prepared by the City.
         As required by recent changes in the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), the City
         shall include the issue of Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas Emissions in environmental
         documents prepared by the City. Techniques and best practices for evaluation these issues are
         currently being developed by various government agencies and interest groups and the City
         will keep track of these developments and endeavor to remain up-to-date in evaluation
         methods.
 Policy SD-1.2
 Coordinate Local Air Quality Programs With Regional Programs and Those of
 Neighboring Jurisdictions.
 Effective coordination and cooperation between local agencies in the implementation of government
 air quality programs is critical. Air quality problems transcend local agency boundaries and
 management of these problems requires various units of government to search for comprehensive
 solutions to the problem. Local governments working together for a common interest can multiply the
 resources available to accomplish air quality goals.
 Implementing Actions:
 1.2.a   Work with neighboring jurisdictions and affected agencies to address cross-jurisdictional
         and regional transportation and air quality issues.
         The City can create an environment that allows and encourages staff members to keep up with
         activities in neighboring jurisdictions and regional agencies. This may be accomplished by
         sending representatives to appropriate meetings, by contacting counterparts in other agencies
         when developing programs, and most important, by active participation in regional program
         planning.
                                                   8-24

                                                                        Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
                                                                     Chapter 8--Sustainable Development
      The Planning Department, as required by law, maintains internal procedures to ensure that all
      affected jurisdictions and agencies are notified of development proposals. When another
      agency notifies the City of a pending project, air quality related issues, such as the following,
      should be examined:
      1) Congestion on City streets from increased traffic caused by the project;
      2) Effects on the viability of transit and pedestrian-oriented developments in the area (i.e.,
           approval of a low density development on the same transit corridor as a transit-oriented
           development could reduce the ability of the transit provider to provide reasonable
           headways);
      3) Failure of the other jurisdiction to require the construction of a segment of a bikeway
           planned in the regional bikeway plan; and/or,
      4) Proposed circulation amendments that may restrict traffic flow to or from the City or that
           produce urban sprawl.
1.2.b Consult with the SJVAPCD during CEQA review for discretionary projects.
      Ensure that the SJVAPCD is on the distribution list for CEQA documents for discretionary
      projects with a potential to cause adverse air quality impacts. Conduct a pre-application air
      quality review to identify issues or problems that might require redesigning or major alterations
      of the project.
1.2.c Coordinate with other jurisdictions and other regional agencies in the San Joaquin Valley
      to establish consistent and uniform implementation measures (trip reduction ordinances,
      indirect source programs, etc.).
      The City will work with the Merced County Association of Governments on programs
      implementing transportation control measures. Work with the County and neighboring cities to
      ensure programs are complementary. The City will maintain its involvement in the rule
      development process and provide representation on air quality steering and advisory
      committees.
1.2.d Support cost-effective multi-use modeling and geographic information system (GIS)
      technology.
      Maintain participation in the Merced County Association of Governments (MCAG) GIS
      project which is part of the Valley-wide GIS project with the Valley Councils of Government
      and the SJVUAPCD. This land use data can be used to evaluate air quality impacts in the
      City.
1.2.e In cooperation with the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District, examine
      potential sources of revenue to pay for air quality improvement measures.
      The City may elect to participate in nexus studies to demonstrate the need for and benefit of
      revenue collected to combat air pollution, when such revenue could be used for implementing
      the following air quality-oriented programs:
      1. Computerization/synchronization of the City’s traffic signals
      2. Mass transit improvements and operation subsidy
      3. Development of alternative modes of transportation such as bike lanes/paths and trails
      4. Remedial improvement of existing congested intersections and underdeveloped planned
          City streets.

         5. The planting of more trees and other landscaping in the City.
         6. Development of renewable energy projects and programs such as liquefaction to convert
             methane gas from liquid and solid waste to LNG, residential and commercial solar energy
             installations, and cogeneration and power exchanges in new development and
             redevelopment.
 Policy SD-1.3
 Integrate Land Use, Transportation, and Air Quality Planning for the Most Efficient
 Use of Public Resources and for a Healthier Environment.
 In the past, transportation planning emphasized the construction of new roadway capacity to reduce
 congestion and to meet the needs of planned development. Air quality legislation now mandates all
 transportation plans to consider air quality. This new emphasis requires our land use and
 transportation plans to create patterns of development and transportation infrastructure that reduce
 the need for new capacity and improve air quality.
 Implementing Actions:
 1.3.a   The City of Merced will consider air quality when planning the land uses and
         transportation systems to accommodate the expected growth in this community.
         Develop coordinated land use and transportation plans to meet federal, state, and local air
         quality requirements. Ensure that land uses proposed in general plan updates and general plan
         amendments are supported by a multi-modal ( auto, transit, bicycling, pedestrian, etc.)
         transportation system and that the land uses themselves support the development of the
         transportation system.
 1.3.b   Transportation improvement should be consistent with the air quality goals and policies
         of the General Plan.
         Analyze project submittals for consistency. Examples of inconsistent projects are a road
         widening project that does not consider transit, bicycling, and pedestrian needs along the route
         or an intersection signalization project that does not involve the installation of signal actuators
         that can be activated by bicyclists or pedestrians.
 1.3.c   The City of Merced will consult with transit providers to determine project impacts on
         long range transit plans and ensure that impacts are mitigated.
         Work with transit providers to develop long range transit plans based on land use plans
         supportive of future transit service. Consult with transit providers during the CEQA process to
         determine the impacts of development projects on the transit system.
 1.3.d   Encourage the construction of low income housing developments that use transit-oriented
         and pedestrian-oriented design principles.
         The Village Plan policies provide sufficient density to make public transit feasible. The City,
         in cooperation with other public agencies, may explore the use of special funding sources
         which could assist in financing necessary infrastructure which would enhance residential
         development and maintain affordability for low and moderate income households.

                                                                      Chapter 8--Sustainable Development
1.3.e   The City of Merced will work with Caltrans and MCAG, the Regional Transportation
        Planning Agency, to minimize the air quality, and mobility impacts of large scale
        transportation projects on existing neighborhoods.
        Use existing rail right of ways where feasible. Provide safe pedestrian and bicycle connections
        between neighborhoods and shopping areas when they become separated by new rail or
        freeway projects.
1.3.f   Provide for installation and maintenance of additional landscaping which helps maintain
        and improve air quality, by continuing to increase the extent of landscaped areas in the
        City using street trees, parking lot shading, median islands, and landscape buffers.
        The City has a strong history of requiring the planting of trees (i.e. street trees, parking lot
        trees) and landscaping on residential, commercial, and industrial projects and that tradition will
        continue.
(Notes: The Urban Design goals and policies contain specific standards for land use which
incorporate the Urban Villages design concepts for developing land uses which support development
and operations of public transportation systems and other alternative modes of transportation.)
Policy SD-1.4
Educate the Public on the Impact of Individual Transportation, Lifestyle, and Land
Use Decisions on Air Quality.
Without the understanding and support of the general public, local air quality programs cannot be
expected to achieve the desired results. Programs to educate the public on air quality issues are a vital
component of a successful air quality program.
Implementing Actions:
1.4.a   Work to improve the public's understanding of the land use, transportation, and air
        quality link.
        The City should support the SJVUAPCD efforts to educate developers and the public on the
        benefits of pedestrian and transit friendly development and should participate in local programs
        that can reduce vehicle trips and miles traveled.
1.4.b   Support SJVAPCD efforts to encourage formation of local groups that provide air
        quality education programs.
        The City supports the SJVAPCD efforts in forming a community-wide public/private air
        quality organization to promote air quality education programs. To this end, the City will work
        with the SJVAPCD, Farm Bureau, the University of California Extension Studies, farm
        organizations, and other community-based air quality groups on educational programs.

 Policy SD-1.5
 Provide Public Facilities and Operations That Can Serve as a Model for the Private
 Sector in Implementation of Air Quality Programs.
 City and county governments are often the largest employers in a jurisdiction and operate large
 vehicle fleets. While it is recognized that the City of Merced has very limited resources with which it
 can play any meaningful role in supporting private sector energy conservation efforts, the City can
 pursue policies and programs which may have private sector applicability. In this respect, the City
 may take a leadership role in implementing employer-based trip reduction programs and fleet operator
 programs to reduce the City’s emissions, demonstrate cost effective energy management techniques,
 and save public money. Options available to the City of Merced and other larger employers include:
 Implementing Actions:
 1.5.a   Continue to support, encourage, and implement to the extent feasible innovative
         employer-based trip reduction programs for their employees.
         Ensure that employment contracts negotiated with employee unions are flexible and allow
         workers to participate in programs that reduce commute trips, such as staggered work hours,
         incentives for using public transit, car pools, etc.
 1.5.b   Fleet vehicle operators should evaluate alternatives which include replacing or converting
         conventional fuel vehicles with clean fuel vehicles as rapidly as feasible within the
         financial constraints of the City.
         Budget for clean fuel vehicles in long range capital expenditure plans.
 1.5.c   Support the use of teleconferencing and internet-based training opportunities in lieu of
         employee travel to conferences and meetings when feasible.
         Work with the telephone company and interested public agencies to develop a multi-user
         teleconferencing center. Use commercial teleconferencing facilities as well as internet-based
         training if they are cost competitive considering travel costs and employee time savings.
 1.5.d   Make use of telecommuting programs as part of their trip reduction strategies.
         Identify positions where telecommuting is feasible. Consider a pilot program with employee
         volunteers for the most promising positions.
 1.5.e   Encourage the development of state of the art communication infrastructure linked to the
         rest of the world.
         Support changes to the State Building Code to encourage new homes and businesses to be
         wired with fiber-optic cables or to encourage wiring conduits with easy access and adequate
         capacity to allow for efficient retrofitting.         Encourage the development of video-
         teleconferencing facilities and telecommuting centers. The City should study formation of
         public/private partnerships with major employers employing large numbers of long distance
         commuters. Telecommuting centers are generally compatible with mixed-use, pedestrian-
         oriented and transit-oriented neighborhood commercial areas.

Policy SD-1.6
To Reduce Emissions of PM10 , PM2.5, and Other Particulates With Local Control
Potential.
The levels of PM10 and PM2.5 (particulate matter less than 10 and 2.5 microns in diameter) exceed state
and federal health based standards. The San Joaquin Valley is classified as a serious non-attainment
area for PM10 under the federal criteria. Because of this classification, the Air District is subject to a
series of federal mandates aimed at achieving federal ambient air quality standards. Control efforts
for sources under the jurisdiction of cities and counties can significantly reduce these emissions.
Implementing Actions:
1.6.a   Work with the SJVAPCD to reduce to the maximum extent feasible particulate emissions
        from construction, grading, excavation, and demolition.
        The City should include PM10 control measures as conditions of approval for subdivision maps,
        site plans, and grading permits. This will assist in implementing the District's PM10 regulation.
        The City should inform developers of the requirements of the District's PM10 regulation when
        they apply for a grading permit.
        Use strategies to minimize soil disturbances including:
        •    Minimize vegetation removal required for fire prevention to the extent compatible with
             public safety considerations. Utilize alternatives to disking, such as mowing, to the extent
             feasible. Where vegetation removal is required for aesthetic or property maintenance
             purposes, encourage or require alternatives to disking.
        •    Condition grading permits to require that graded areas be stabilized from the completion of
             grading to commencement of construction.
1.6.b   Reduce PM 10 and PM 2.5 emissions from City maintained roads to the maximum extent
        feasible.
        Continue the City’s street cleaning program aimed at removing heavy silt loadings from
        roadways which result from sources such as storm water runoff and construction sites.
1.6.c   Require all access roads, driveways, and parking areas in new commercial and industrial
        development to be paved or constructed of other materials that minimize particulate
        emissions.
        City standards currently require all parking areas and driveways to be paved (no gravel) and
        will continue to apply these standards.
Policy SD-1.7
Develop and Implement a Climate Action Plan for the City
Through recent changes in State and Federal law, local governments like the City of Merced have
begun to pay more attention to what can be done regarding Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas
reduction on the local level.
                                                   8-29

Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
Chapter 8--Sustainable Development
 Implementing Actions:
 1.7.a   Complete the development and implementation of a Climate Action Plan for the City of
         Merced.
         In 2009, City staff began preparation of a Climate Action Plan for the City, which is expected
         to be completed by no later than September 2012. The Climate Action Plan will include an
         evaluation of existing City and community programs aimed at reducing greenhouse gas
         emissions; an evaluation of other City programs, that although established for other purposes,
         also have greenhouse gas reduction benefits; an evaluation of greenhouse gas emissions efforts
         of other Cities in the State; a discussion of the legal framework, including State and Federal
         laws; an evaluation of possible available funding sources; a baseline greenhouse gas emission
         inventory for the City; the selection of an Emissions Reduction Target; and finally,
         recommended goals, policies, and actions to reach the selected Emissions Reduction Target.
         The development of the Climate Action Plan will involve a citizens committee and extensive
         involvement of elected officials.
 1.7.b   Once adopted, amend City policies and ordinances as needed to implement the goals,
         policies, and actions of the Climate Action Plan.
         Within one year of adoption of the Climate Action Plan, the City should complete a review of
         its existing policies and ordinances in order to ensure implementation of the Climate Action
         Plan.
 1.7.c   As part of the development of the Climate Action Plan and in the spirit of AB 32, The
         Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, a variety of suggested measures from the
         California Climate Action Team Strategies and the Department of Justice Attorney
         General will be considered and evaluated by the City for possible future implementation.
         The following measures shall be considered although some of the items below have already
         been implemented by the City:
         •    When approving new development, require truck idling to be restricted during
              construction.
         •    Require new development to implement the following design features, where feasible:
         1. Recycling:
              ▪    Design locations for separate waste and recycling receptacles;
              ▪    Reuse and recycle construction and demolition waste;
              ▪    Recover by-product methane to generate electricity; and,
              ▪    Provide education and publicity about reducing waste and available recycling services.
         2. Promote pedestrian, bicycle and transit modes of travel through informational programs
              and provision of amenities such as transit shelters, secure bicycle parking and attractive
              pedestrian pathways.
         3. Large canopy trees should be carefully selected and located to protect the building(s) from
              energy consuming environmental conditions, and to shade 50% of paved areas within 15
              years. Trees near structures act as insulators from weather thereby decreasing energy
              requirements. Trees also store carbon.
         4. Encourage mixed-use and high-density development to reduce vehicle trips, promote
              alternatives to vehicle travel and promote efficient delivery of services and goods.
         5. Impose measures to address the "urban heat island" effect by, e.g. requiring light-colored
                                                    8-30

                                                                        Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
                                                                      Chapter 8--Sustainable Development
          and reflective roofing materials and paint; light-colored roads and parking lots; shade trees
          in parking lots' and shade trees on the south and west sides of new or renovated buildings.
      6. Transportation and motor vehicle emissions reduction:
          ▪ Use low or zero-emission vehicles, including construction vehicles;
          ▪ Create car sharing programs;
          ▪ Create local “light vehicle” networks, such as neighborhood electric vehicle (NEV)
               systems;
          ▪ Provide shuttle service to public transit;
          ▪ During construction, post signs that restrict truck idling;
          ▪ Set specific limits on idling time for commercial vehicles, including delivery and
               construction vehicles;
          ▪ Coordinate controlled intersections so that traffic passes more efficiently through
               congested areas. Where signals are installed, require the use of Light Emitting Diode
               (LED) traffic lights; and,
          ▪ Assess transportation impact fees on new development in order to facilitate and
               increase public transit service.
      7. Water Use Efficiency:
          ▪ Use of both potable and non-potable water to the maximum extent practicable; low
               flow appliances (i.e., toilets, dishwashers, shower heads, washing machines, etc.);
               automatic shut off valves for sinks in restrooms; drought resistant landscaping; “Save
               Water” signs near water faucets;
          ▪ Create water efficient landscapes;
          ▪ Use gray water. (Gray water is untreated household waste water from bathtubs,
               showers, bathroom wash facilities, and water from washing machines); and,
          ▪ Provide education about water conservation and available programs and incentives.
      8. Energy Efficiency:
          ▪ Automated control system for heating/air conditioning and energy efficient appliances;
          ▪ Utilize lighting controls and energy-efficient lighting in buildings;
          ▪ Use light colored roof materials to reflect heat;
          ▪ Take advantage of shade (save healthy existing trees when feasible), prevailing winds,
               landscaping and sun screens to reduce energy use;
          ▪ Install solar panels on carports and over parking areas;
          ▪ Increase building energy efficiency percent beyond Title 24 requirements. In addition
               implement other green building design ((i.e., natural daylighting and on-site renewable,
               electricity generation); and
          ▪ Require that projects use efficient lighting.
1.7.d In addition to the measures described in SD-1.7.c, during the preparation of the City’s
      Climate Action Plan, the City will evaluate and consider additional policies and measures
      for possible future implementation.
      In addition to the measures suggested by the California Climate Action Team and the Attorney
      General, the City will consider during the preparation of the Climate Action Plan, the following
      policies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions (but other measures may also be considered):
      A. In cooperation with other jurisdictions and agencies in the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin,
          take timely and necessary actions to achieve and maintain reductions in greenhouse gas
          emissions in order to limit and prevent potential human caused global climate change and
                                                 8-31

             the related potential detrimental affects upon public health and welfare of present and
             future residents of the City.
         B. Establish and uphold planning criteria and environmental analysis protocols that evaluate
             potential greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from public and private projects and provide
             useful reduction and mitigation strategies through implementation measures including the
             following:
             1. On an ongoing basis, as information becomes available and regulations are adopted by
                  the City and by state and regional agencies, the City shall partner with air pollution
                  control agencies to advise project applicants of greenhouse gas and air pollutant
                  emission significance thresholds, mitigation requirements, and control regulations
                  promulgated by federal, state, regional, and local agencies.
             2. On an ongoing basis the City shall utilize its code enforcement police power to ensure
                  ongoing compliance with requirements for air quality and sustainability measures
                  incorporated into projects design, conditions of approval, and mitigation measures.
         C. Increase efforts to incorporate GHG emission reductions in land use decisions, facility
             design, and operational measures subject to City regulation through implementation
             measures such as the following:
             1. The City shall consider guidance from the Institute for Local Government, California
                  Attorney General's Office, California Air Pollution Control Officers Association, and
                  other sources of technical guidance in determining appropriate and feasible mitigation
                  measures which may be incorporated into land use plans, development projects and
                  City operations to achieve GHG emission reductions.
             2. As information becomes available and regulations and policies are adopted by the City
                  and by state and regional agencies, the City shall provide residents and project
                  applicants with a “toolkit” of understandable feasible measures that can be used to
                  reduce greenhouse gases and criteria pollutants, including educational materials on
                  energy-efficient and “climate-friendly” products.
             3. On an ongoing basis, the City shall continue to evaluate its facility maintenance
                  practices for opportunities to reduce GHGs, looking at facility cleaning and painting,
                  parks maintenance, road maintenance, and utility system maintenance.
             4. As additional technical information becomes available, the City shall consider
                  strengthening its standards for purchasing low polluting and climate friendly goods and
                  services, requiring that emission reductions be achieved by vendors and contractors
                  through City contracts and/or giving preference to those who demonstrate
                  implementation of GHG and criteria air pollution emission reductions in their facilities
                  and operations.
         D. Maintain current levels of achievement for recycling and reuse of all types of waste
             material in the City, and further enhance waste and wastewater management practices to
             further achieve reductions in greenhouse gas emissions through implementation measures
             such as the following:
             1. The City shall continue to require provisions for recyclable material collection and
                  storage areas to be incorporated into all residential development designs, and within
                  one year from adoption of General Plan consider expanding this requirement to all
                  industrial facilities, sizing the recycling area for industrial development according to
                  the anticipated types and amounts of recyclable material generated.
             2. Within a reasonable period of time from adoption of General Plan, the City shall
                                                      8-32

                                                                            Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
                                                                         Chapter 8--Sustainable Development
                consider establishing incentives and a utility rate structure, as consistent with state law,
                to foster increased participation in residential recycling and green waste diversion.
            3. Within a reasonable period of time from adoption of General Plan, the City shall
                consider instituting a program to evaluate major waste generators and to recommend
                recycling opportunities for their facilities and operations.
            4. The City shall continue to partner with the California Integrated Waste Management
                Board to participate in waste diversion and recycling programs such as the tire
                collection and recycling program, and community recycling education.
            5. Within a reasonable period of time from adoption of General Plan, the City shall
                consider instituting a restaurant and institutional food waste segregation and recycling
                program, to reduce the amount of organic material sent to landfills.

1.8.a   Continue implementation of land use, transportation, urban expansion, urban design,
        open space, and public facilities General Plan policies that address air quality goals.
        State law now requires cities and counties in the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin to amend their
        General Plans to include goals, policies, and implementing strategies to improve air quality.
        The San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District has issued Air Quality Guidelines for
        General Plans (June 2005), which contains suggested goals and policies for General Plans.
        When the Merced Vision 2015 General Plan was adopted in 1997, many of the suggested air
        quality policies were included in the General Plan and are still included in this Vision 2030
        General Plan. Many of these policies are presented in the Sustainable Development Chapter,
        but many of these policies are spread throughout the General Plan in the Urban Expansion,
        Land Use, Transportation, Public Facilities & Services, Urban Design, Open Space, and other
        chapters.
        Below is a list of topics addressed along with the General Plan policies found elsewhere in this

Goal Area SD-2: Cultural Resources
GOALS:
     A Diverse And Rich Historic and Cultural Resource Environment
     A Long-Term Community Historic Preservation/Improvement Program
POLICIES:
SD-2.1 Identify and preserve the City's archaeological resources.
SD-2.2 Identify and preserve the City's historic and cultural resources.
SD-2.3 Develop and promote financial incentive programs for historic preservation efforts.
Policy SD-2.1
Identify and Preserve the City's Archaeological Resources.
It is thought that the San Joaquin Valley was inhabited in the late Pleistocene and early Holocene
period, dating from perhaps as early as 12,000 years before the present (B.P.). Prior to Euro-
American arrival, the San Joaquin Valley was occupied by Yokuts Indian populations. The Yokuts
settlement system was characterized by principal villages on terraced areas adjacent to watercourses.
Knowledge of these early inhabitants is limited. It is likely that the streams traversing the Merced
Planning Area served as settlements for Yokuts and it is a State policy to preserve and protect the
archaeological resources of the region.

Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
Chapter 8--Sustainable Development
 Implementing Actions:
 2.1.a   Utilize the inventory of known archeological sites maintained by the Central California
         Information Center for the review of development proposals.
         The Archaeological Inventory shall be used to identify areas within the Merced Planning Area
         subject to preservation practices. For large scale development projects proposed in close
         proximity to a natural water course, or in an area which exhibits potential for containing
         cultural resource material, preliminary cultural resource inventories should be conducted by a
         qualified archaeologist. Information from these site investigations shall be provided to the
         Central California Information Center for recordation.
 2.1.b   Utilize standard practices for preserving archeological materials that are unearthed
         during construction, as prescribed by the State Office of Historic Preservation.
         Cultural resource discoveries are subject to the rules and regulations in State law. The City
         should work closely with the building trades industry to facilitate compliance with these laws
         and to assist where necessary in minimizing the adverse impacts of the implementation of these
         laws on the City’s construction industry.
 2.1.c   If appropriate, consider reconstruction of archaeological sites in City parks, on school
         grounds, in open space areas, or other suitable locations where they can serve an
         educational purpose.
         In order to increase the public’s awareness to the cultural heritage of Merced, the City should
         support the efforts of Native American groups and individuals to develop cultural displays and
         exhibits in local public places.
 Policy SD-2.2
 Identify and Preserve the City's Historic and Cultural Resources.
 The City of Merced contains many fine examples of its early development. Historic buildings, tree
 plantings, and other improvements serve to give the City a special character which is unique in the San
 Joaquin Valley. The City of Merced is dedicated to preserving, protecting and enhancing its historic
 and cultural resources.
 Implementing Actions:
 2.2.a   Expand City cultural and historic information resources.
         Establish and maintain an inventory of cultural, historic, and architecturally significant
         resources within the City and the planning area by expanding and improving the existing
         inventory of the downtown area. Consider a program or support other programs which
         designate historic landmarks and architecturally significant structures in the City.
 2.2.b   Support community groups and individuals working to preserve, protect and enhance the
         City’s Historic and Cultural Resources.
         In accordance with the City's Historic Preservation Ordinance (MMC 17.54) which outline
         procedures and criteria for historic designation, continue to support Historic Preservation
         Commission activities. Support, as feasible, both private and public efforts to preserve and
         rehabilitate historic structures in the City, including the need to protect a site from intrusion of
         surrounding land uses which are uncomplimentary or incompatible.

2.2.c   Review and revise as necessary, the City’s development/construction regulations to
        facilitate the preservation of historic structures.
        Investigate and consider the possibility of using historic overlay zones in conjunction with the
        Historic Preservation Ordinance to control the use or modification of significant historic areas
        in the community, recognizing the limitations of Government Code Section 37361 as it applies
        to church facilities.
2.2.d   Support, as feasible, efforts to promote the preservation of historically or architecturally
        significant structures in the City.
        Support the preservation of the downtown's historically and architecturally significant
        structures. Encourage the design of new developments to be consistent with the design,
        character, and building bulk of the existing downtown. Encourage and support efforts to
        preserve historic structures in the Courthouse Square area, Downtown, Central Merced, and
        throughout the City. The restoration of the Merced Theater is one such current project.
2.2.e   Support efforts to designate historic districts within the City.
        The City should, as appropriate, be supportive of private efforts to establish historic districts
        with appropriate recognition and designation as National Registry Districts or by means of
        some other historic district recognition.
Policy SD-2.3
Develop and Promote Financial Incentive Programs for Historic Preservation
Efforts.
Historic and cultural resources can be a financial liability to private citizens. In many instances, it is
more economical to demolish and build new structures than to rehabilitate historic structures. The
economics of maintaining and improving historic properties have resulted in many building and
structures being lost or allowed to deteriorate to such a degree that preservation is impractical. The
City will assist in the identification of financial resources that can be used by individuals and groups in
the City to preserve, enhance and protect the historic and cultural resources of the City.
Implementing Actions:
2.3.a   Work to identify financial resources which can be used for historic preservation efforts in
        Merced.
        Utilize, where possible, Redevelopment funds to help finance restoration of historic buildings
        and structures in Merced. Identify other sources of historic preservation funds, such as
        Community Development Block Grants, Office of Historic Preservation Grant Funds, tax
        incentives, etc., to be used to finance historic renovation/restoration projects.
2.3.b   Provide access to information on financial resources available to property owners to
        assist in historic preservation/restoration efforts.
        Refer interested property owners to the State Office of Historic Preservation, for information
        regarding tax advantages of National Registry of historic properties, special building code
        standards applicable to historic buildings and structures, and loan and grant programs available
        to finance historic preservation/ renovation.

 Goal Area SD-3: Energy Resources
 GOAL
      Sustainable Energy Resource Use in the City of Merced
 POLICIES
 SD-3.1     Promote the use of solar energy technology and other alternative energy resources.
 SD-3.2     Encourage the use of energy conservation features, low-emission equipment, and alternative
            energy sources for all new residential and commercial development.
 Policy SD-3.1
 Promote the Use of Solar Energy Technology and Other Alternative Energy
 Resources.
 Merced is located in an area that can benefit from the use of solar energy technology and other
 alternative energy resources to lower household heating and cooling costs.
 Implementing Actions:
 3.1.a    Encourage the use of solar energy in design and management of all new construction in
          the City.
          The City should work with members of the building and utility industries in identifying public
          policies and regulations which inhibit the construction of energy efficient development. The
          City should prepare guidelines and standards which can be used by members of the
          construction industry in the design of new building and development projects.
 3.1.b    Require all new subdivisions to maximize, to the extent feasible, proper orientation of lots
          with regard to solar utilization.
          Proper solar orientation of lots often results in inefficient or poor circulation system designs.
          Good subdivision design attempts to maximize the benefits of lot orientation for solar access
          while maintaining the optimum circulation system design. The City planning staff may
          develop a library of subdivision design concepts that have proven effective in furthering energy
          conservation goals in other similarly situated communities and the City of Merced. This
          information should be made available to real estate developers and home builders.
 3.1.c    Encourage developers and builders to properly design all structures on each building lot
          in the City to take fullest advantage of solar use in heating and cooling.
          The City planning staff might develop a library of building design concepts that have proven
          effective in furthering building energy conservation goals in other similarly situated
          communities. This information should be made available to real estate developers and home
          builders.
 3.1.d    Encourage developers and builders to maximize “passive” solar design, such as large
          south-facing windows for winter heat gains and overhangs and shading for summer heat
          protection.
                                                    8-38

                                                                           Merced Vision 2030 General Plan
                                                                        Chapter 8--Sustainable Development
         The City should collect and make available to builders and homeowners design solutions to
         passive solar construction problems and support local the building industry’s efforts to comply
         with State regulations on energy conservation design standards.
3.1.e    Pursue further investigation of potential benefits utilizing building code revision,
         narrower streets, solar access rights, and other energy-saving techniques.
         The City should continue to monitor policy developments at the state level and in other San
         Joaquin Valley communities to determine the most efficient and effective design policies
         which might be applied to new development in the City. Where appropriate, staff should
         recommend changes in policies and standards where it can be demonstrated that such changes
         will appreciably reduce energy consumption.
Policy SD-3.2
Encourage the Use of Energy Conservation Features, Low-Emission Equipment, and
Alternative Energy Sources for All New Residential and Commercial Development.
Natural gas burning appliances used for space heating, water heating, and cooking are a sizable
source of NOx emissions. Consumption of electricity causes pollutant emissions when the power plant
is fueled by fossil fuels. Local efforts to reduce energy consumption can save consumers money and
improve air quality.
Implementing Actions:
3.2.a    Work with the local energy providers on voluntary incentive-based programs to
         encourage the use of energy efficient designs and equipment.
         •   Encourage the incorporation of energy conservation features in the design of all new
             construction and the installation of conservation devices in existing developments.
         •   Encourage energy audits of existing structures, identifying levels of existing energy use
             and potential conservation measures.
         •   Encourage the use of passive design concepts that make use of the natural climate to
             increase energy efficiency.
         •   Encourage new development not to preclude the use of solar energy systems by uses and
             buildings on adjacent properties.
         •   Incorporate the most energy-efficient design consistent with a reasonable rate of return and
             the recognition of the environmental benefits of energy conservation for all local
             government facilities and equipment.
         •   Perform an energy audit of existing public buildings and retrofit where cost-effective.
         •   Develop an energy management system for public buildings.
3.2.b    Cooperate with the local building industry, utilities and the SJVAPCD to promote
         enhanced energy conservation standards for new construction.
         Work with the California Energy Commission (CEC) and local utilities to identify areas of the
         existing state standards that can be enhanced most cost-effectively.
3.2.c    Encourage new residential, commercial, and industrial development to reduce air quality
         impacts from area sources and from energy consumption.
         •   Support the use of weatherization programs for existing residential units and businesses.

         •    Encourage the use of solar water and pool heaters, and energy efficient lighting.
         •    Encourage developers to orient housing units and landscape building sites to maximize
              solar heating and cooling.
         •    Encourage the installation of energy efficient fireplaces and wood stoves in lieu of normal
              open hearth fireplaces.
         •    Establish standards for the provision of natural gas lines or electrical outlets to backyards
              to encourage the use of natural gas or electric barbecues, and electric gardening equipment.
         •    Support the use of electric vehicles, such as golf carts, where appropriate. Provide electric
              recharge facilities for electric vehicles.
         •    Encourage the installation of natural gas hook-ups for washers and dryers in housing units.
 3.2.d   Encourage builders to develop “green” and/or LEED-Certified (or other similar
         programs) buildings.
         The City should consider developing incentives to encourage builders (residential, commercial,
         and industrial) to develop “green” or LEED-certified buildings. The Leadership in Energy and
         Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System, developed by the U.S. Green
         Building Council (USGBC), provides a suite of standards for the environmentally sustainable
         design, construction and operation of buildings and neighborhoods. Since its inception in
         1998, LEED has grown to encompass more than 14,000 projects in the United States and 30
         countries.
 3.2.e   Investigate regulatory changes that will promote the use of wind energy technology.
         The City should review and consider changes to its ordinances to make sure that there are no
         impediments to the use of wind energy technology.

        Through the City’s Village Concept, which calls for the development of compact, mixed-use,
        pedestrian- and transit-friendly developments, the City can help to build a healthier community.
        Policies relating to the Village Concept can be found in the Land Use, Transportation, and
        Urban Design Elements.
4.1.b   Plan neighborhoods with safe and attractive places for recreational exercise.
        The City’s Open Space Element (Chapter 7) has policies that promote neighborhood parks and
        bikeways. The Transportation Element (Chapter 4) has policies that promote the expansion of
        walking and biking facilities throughout the City.
4.1.c   Create a balanced transportation system that provides for all modes of transportation.
        The City’s Transportation Element (Chapter 4) contains policies that promote a balanced
        transportation system that provides for all modes of transportation, including motorized
        vehicles, bicycles, transit, pedestrians, and air and rail transit.
4.1.d   Continue to require tree planting and promote “green buildings.”
        The City’s Open Space Element (Chapter 7) contains policies that promote tree planting along
        streets and in parking areas and the Sustainable Development Chapter contains policies to
        encourage “green buildings.”
Policy SD-4.2
Encourage Increased Physical Activity of Residents and Healthier Food Choices
By providing increased opportunities for walking, biking, and recreation and by encouraging access
to healthier foods, the City can help its residents become healthier.
Implementing Actions:
4.2.a   Increase biking and walking through street design.
        By designing “complete streets” that accommodate all modes of transportation, as required in
        the policies in the Transportation Element (Chapter 4), residents will have access to safe and
        convenient biking and walking facilities. The City’s policy of planting of trees along streets
        between the curb and the sidewalk help create a feeling of safety for pedestrians and handicap-
        accessibility is emphasized. Bike lanes are provided along most streets.
4.2.b   Encourage healthy food choices through the encouragement of farmers markets and
        community gardens.
        The City will review its ordinances to make sure that there are no barriers to creating farmers
        markets and community gardens in the City. The City should also review its standards
        regarding agricultural activities within the City and determine if changes should be made to
        encourage residents to plant their own gardens, but still limiting the keeping of farm animals in
        the City limits, which create other issues. The City’s policies regarding the preservation of
        agricultural land adjacent to the City also promote agricultural activities within the
        community. On December 6, 2010, the City Council adopted Resolution #2010-101
        supporting the City of Merced becoming a Healthy Eating Active Living (HEAL) City.

examined to determine the value of a
specific parcel of land for agricultural
purposes. They include factors found in the

The number of units assisted fell short of what was projected. This was in part, due to the decline in construction of housing in general. However, in
addition, the amount of federal and state funding the City has received has also been reduced, in addition to the loss of Redevelopment Agency funds.
These factors made it difficult to achieve the goals set forth in the previous Housing Element. The “Above Moderate Income” level, which is market
rate housing, was especially hard hit, yet these housing units do not qualify for City affordable housing programs and are hard to incentivize.

The primary age group for purchasing
homes is the 30 to 45-age group. As shown
in Table 9.3.4, there has been little change in
the percentage of the City’s population
within this age range. Due to the cost of
housing and the downturn in the housing
market over the last several years, the
number of people purchasing new homes
has decreased. However, as the economy
rebounds and the housing market picks up,
the demand for both renter and owner-
occupied housing is expected to increase
throughout the planning period as people
feel more comfortable with purchasing
homes for the first time or as an upgrade to
their existing home. In addition UC Merced
continue to attract students, faculty, and staff
that will need additional housing.

with Caltrans, the County, and MCAG in
the future regarding important regional
circulation issues. The Merced Vision

     required to comply with Development
     Standards as set forth in the City’s Zoning
     Ordinance, require a longer processing time,
     and may require an upgrade to typical
     architectural features, the flexibility allowed
     within a Planned Development allows the
     developer to build more units. Because there
     is benefit to both the City and the developer,
     the City does not see the use of Planned
     Development zoning as a constraint.

per unit for multi-family dwellings.
In the City of Merced, it’s estimated that the
current cost to construct a 1,500-square-foot
home would be approximately $218,000.
This includes land and construction costs.
Based on this estimate, development fees are
approximately 17 percent, of the total cost of
development.
The estimate provided for multi-family
development at Table 9.5.8a is based on a
9,860-square-foot building with 8 units.
Again, due to slight differences in some of
the fees between North and South Merced, an
estimate for each area has been provided.
In North Merced, the total development fees
is $172.213 with an average of $21,527 per
unit and in South Merced the fees are
$170,292 with an average of $21,287 per
unit.
The City estimated the current cost of
construction for a multi-family project to be
approximately $125,000 per unit (land and
construction costs). Using the development
fee average per unit for multi-family
development,      development      fees    are
approximately 17 percent which is consistent
with the percentage for single-family
dwellings.

1.1.a Evaluate for Multi-Family Housing Development
The City will update the evaluation of vacant and underutilized parcels throughout the
City based on the vacant sites analysis at Appendix A to determine suitability and
feasibility for potential multi-family development, considering at least, but not limited to,
location, size, circulation, and available infrastructure. Staff will monitor and evaluate
whether the higher density sites are providing realistic development opportunities for
low-income households through the general plan annual review process (Government
Code 65400). In addition, staff will work to educate the public and decision-makers
about affordable housing, especially multi-family developments, to help alleviate
“NIMBYism” when developments are proposed and to ensure decisions regarding
developments are made based on adopted plans and policies. The City will encourage
developments devoted exclusively to Senior housing.
Action:             Update the evaluation annually to identify potential multi-family
                    development sites. Encourage development at a minimum of 80% of
                    the maximum density. Provide brochures and other information at the
                    counter, in the City newsletter, and on the City’s website regarding
                    “NIMBYism” and affordable housing.             Provide information to
                    decision-makers regarding affordable housing and the City’s plans
                    and policies for multi-family development.

                   Bonus Chapter to encourage childcare centers within new
                   developments and streamlines the approval process within RPD’s; and
                   provide the Planning Commission and City Council with more
                   education and information on the benefits of small lot development.
                   Consider the development of a checklist to aid in the evaluation of the
                   quality and benefits of new housing developments. The development of

   Expand the use of mixed-use residential/office/retail developments in the City’s core
   downtown and other appropriate commercial centers to support both affordable housing
   and economic development goals through priority permit processing.             Proposed
   amendments to the City’s Zoning Ordinance would allow residential uses as a principally
   permitted use in Central Commercial (C-C) zone which encompasses most of the
   downtown area and would be consistent with the City’s Downtown Strategy. The City
   will promote development consistent with the “Downtown Strategy.”            In addition,
   proposed changes in the Zoning Ordinance update would reduce the parking requirements
   for residential developments near approved transit stops. The use of other incentives will
   be reviewed.

1.1.d Review and Update the City’s Zoning Ordinance to Assure Compliance with
State Law
At least annually, review changes in State law with reference to housing and update the
City’s Zoning Ordinance for conformity where necessary. The City is working on a
comprehensive Zoning Ordinance Update which is expected to be adopted before end of
2016. The changes in the Public Review Draft (released in September 2015) include:
    1. Allowing emergency shelters in the General Commercial (C-G) zone as a
        permitted use in compliance with Government Code Section 65583. The City will
        amend the zoning ordinance to allow emergency shelters as a permitted use in a
        General Commercial (C-G) Zone. Development standards are also included as
        allowed by Government Code Section 65583 to assist in the development of
        emergency shelters.
    2. Bringing the Density Bonus Ordinance into compliance with state law.
    3. Adding a section dealing with farmworker housing in compliance with Health and
        Safety Code 17021.6.
    4. Allowing transitional and supportive housing in all residential zones in compliance
        with SB 2 which requires that transitional and supportive housing may only be
        subject to those restrictions that apply to other residential uses of the same type in
        the same zone.

    1.1.e Encourage Alternate Housing Types
    Through priority permit processing, encourage the development of alternate housing
    designs that can be built on smaller footprints. The Planning Division will inform
    potential developers of the benefits/cost savings of alternate housing designs and
    smaller footprints fostering a larger return on investment (ROI) with more units per
    acre, thus providing more affordable housing. Priority processing saves developers
    time and money to help keep development affordable and is also important for them to
    meet State and Federal tax credit deadlines. The City’s “Small Lot Design Guidelines”
    have been incorporated in the comprehensive Zoning Ordinance update and setback
    requirements have been increased providing more open space to encourage the public
    to be more accepting of the small lot design concept.            Additionally, staff will
    encourage developments to build 2 and 3-story houses to provide more floor area on a
    smaller lot.
    Action:             Add small lot, affordable housing developments to priority
                        processing program.        Complete adoption of Draft Zoning

that many families who need affordable housing, especially female-headed households,
need childcare on-site (within apartment complexes) or within close proximity to their
home or transit services.

                          Before Starting the CoC Application
           The CoC Consolidated Application is made up of two parts: the CoC Application and the CoC
           Priority Listing, with all of the CoC's project applications either approved and ranked, or rejected.
           The Collaborative Applicant is responsible for submitting both the CoC Application and the CoC
           Priority Listing in order for the CoC Consolidated Application to be considered complete.
            The Collaborative Applicant is responsible for:
           - Reviewing the FY 2015 CoC Program Competition NOFA in its entirety for specific application
           and program requirements.
           - Using the CoC Application Detailed Instructions for assistance with completing the application
           in e-snaps.
           - Answering all questions in the CoC Application. It is the responsibility of the Collaborative
           Applicant to ensure that all imported and new responses in all parts of the application are fully
           reviewed and completed. When doing so, please keep in mind that:
            - This year, CoCs will see that a few responses have been imported from the FY 2013/FY 2014
           CoC Application. Due to significant changes to the CoC Application questions, most of the
           responses from the FY 2013/FY 2014 CoC Application could not be imported.
             - For some questions, HUD has provided documents to assist Collaborative Applicants in filling
           out responses.
            - For other questions, the Collaborative Applicant must be aware of responses provided by
           project applicants in their Project Applications.
           - Some questions require that the Collaborative Applicant attach a document to receive credit.
           This will be identified in the question.
            - All questions marked with an asterisk (*) are mandatory and must be completed in order to
           submit the CoC Application.

                CoC has established committees that meet on an ongoing basis. Veteran
                service providers have been incorporated into committees and have contributed
                their knowledge in ways that have provided perspectives towards ending
                veteran homelessness that may not have happened otherwise which include
                ensuring housing needs and necessary supportive services are met for
                veterans who are ineligible for VA services; identifying inefficiencies, and
                redesigning the process to make it simpler and faster while still meeting
                necessary regulatory requirements; and using Interagency Service Planning
                and Navigators to Address Individual Veterans’ Needs on a weekly basis. Youth
                advocates have also contributed knowledge towards ending youth
                homelessness by helping adopt ways to accurately count youth during
                unsheltered counts; facilitating greater community awareness of issues
                contributing to LGBTQ youth homelessness; and ensuring appropriate housing
                and services are available to address such issues.

            CoC encourages all members to be part of one or more committees that
            address the goals of Opening Doors and each committee recruits appropriate
            members. Specific committees were tasked with ending homelessness among
            veterans, youth and families, and chronically homeless persons. Veteran
            service providers were recruited to be part of one of committees that focus on
            ending veteran homelessness. Such providers include those who are
            instrumental in implementing HUD VASH and SSVF and outreach and
            engagement workers who focus on the chronically homeless and such
            veterans. Youth and family service providers were recruited to be part of
            committees that focusses on ending youth and family homelessness. The
            Planning and Development Committee was tasked with ending homelessness
            among chronically homeless persons and outreach and engagement teams and
            permanent supportive housing providers were specifically recruited for this
            committee.
           1B-4. Explain how the CoC is open to proposals from entities that have
           not previously received funds in prior CoC Program competitions, even if
           the CoC is not applying for any new projects in 2015.
           (limit 1000 characters)
            The CoC conducted a workshop to solicit proposals for the permanent housing
            bonus shortly after HUD released the CoC NOFA and application in esnaps.
            Notices concerning the workshop were sent to all persons and agencies that
            make up the CoC. Most of these agencies do not currently receive CoC funding.
            In addition, a notice was posted on the CoC web site. The factors that were
            used to determine whether to include a new project were identical to the Project
            Quality Thresholds noted in the NOFA regarding new permanent housing
            project applications on pages 29 and 30. A new project review committee
            consisting of members of the CoC Board ensured that these thresholds were
            applied to the new PH Bonus applications. The Board decided that serving all
            chronically homeless persons and not just those with mental illness was an
            important determining factor.
      1B-5. How often does the CoC invite new Quarterly

   to join the CoC through a publicly available

                1C-2. The McKinney-Vento Act, as amended, requires CoCs to participate
                in the Consolidated Plan(s) (Con Plan(s)) for the geographic area served
                by the CoC. The CoC Program interim rule at 24 CFR 578.7(c)(4) requires
                  that the CoC provide information required to complete the Con Plan(s)
                within the CoC’s geographic area, and 24 CFR 91.100(a)(2)(i) and 24 CFR
                   91.110(b)(1) requires that the State and local Con Plan jurisdiction(s)
               consult with the CoC. The following chart asks for information about CoC
               and Con Plan jurisdiction coordination, as well as CoC and ESG recipient

              The CoC consults and collaborates with the City of Merced, which is the only
              Con Plan jurisdiction within the boundaries of the CoC, monthly. The type of
              interactions that occur throughout each month include planning meetings
              (2hours/month), phone calls, (2hours/month), and emails (2hours/month). A
              representative from the City of Merced attends CoC representatives meetings
              and is often on the agenda to give reports and a representative from the City of
              Merced is a CoC Board member. Together, these meetings occur at least once
              a month. The CoC provides homeless count and survey data for the Con Plan
              and other city documents and reports. Also, the City of Merced participates in
              the homeless count and is recruiting staff members as counters for the 2016
              count. The City of Merced also participates in the updates of the 10-year plan to
              end homelessness particularly concerning those recommendations that focus
              on affordable and permanent supportive housing.
             1C-2b. Based on the responses selected in 1C-2, describe how the CoC is
             working with ESG recipients to determine local ESG funding decisions
             and how the CoC assists in the development of performance standards
             and evaluation of outcomes for ESG-funded activities.

              Neither the County nor any of the six cities that make up the County are ESG
              recipients. All of Merced County is eligible for ESG funds directly from the
              California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD). CoC
              representatives have participated in the public comment opportunities provided
              by HCD which has shaped the ESG process. Also, the CoC has set up a
              process in compliance with HCD requirements that consists of having the
              Merced CoC establish local priorities, solicit local applications, review local
              applications, and recommend applications for funding to HCD that consist of
              best practices such as permanent supportive housing, a housing first approach,
              and rapid rehousing. Merced CoC has also made scaling up street outreach
              and engagement workers as a local funding priority.

             housing and services that provide and maintain safety and security.

               If a victim of domestic violence presents to a homeless assistance provider,
               they are able to call Valley Crisis Center (VCC), the local DV agency, 24 hours
               per day to best serve the client(s). Client is given information and services
               offered and able to make own decision about best housing option. VCC gathers
               data for each client as well as case and counseling notes which are locked
               behind two locks for security. All interactions and services are confidential. In
               order to talk about a client specifically with any outside program or individual,
               the client must sign a time banded release of information. If the client chooses
               to work in a coordinated manner between VCC and a homeless assistance
               provider, they must sign a release, and even then only needed information is
               shared. When a DV victim engages with VCC, they are connected with many
               community resources. If they qualify for any government benefits and are not
               enrolled, VCC staff will walk client through this process.

                                        (Coordinated Entry)
           Instructions:
           For guidance on completing this form, please reference the FY 2015 CoC Application Detailed
           Instructions, the CoC Application Instructional Guides and the FY 2015 CoC Program NOFA.
           Please submit technical questions to the HUDExchange Ask A Question.
           CoCs are required by the CoC Program interim rule to establish a
           Centralized or Coordinated Assessment system – also referred to as
           Coordinated Entry. Based on the recent Coordinated Entry Policy Brief,
           HUD’s primary goals for coordinated entry processes are that assistance
           be allocated as effectively as possible and that it be easily accessible
           regardless of where or how people present for assistance. Most
           communities lack the resources needed to meet all of the needs of people
           experiencing homelessness. This combined with the lack of a well-
           developed coordinated entry processes can result in severe hardships for
           persons experiencing homelessness who often face long wait times to
           receive assistance or are screened out of needed assistance. Coordinated
           entry processes help communities prioritize assistance based on
           vulnerability and severity of service needs to ensure that people who need
           assistance the most can receive it in a timely manner. Coordinated entry
           processes also provide information about service needs and gaps to help
           communities plan their assistance and identify needed resources.
           1E-1. Explain how the CoC’s coordinated entry process is designed to
           identify, engage, and assist homeless individuals and families that will
           ensure those who request or need assistance are connected to proper
           housing and services.
           (limit 1000 characters)
            Coordinated entry system is linked to street outreach efforts throughout the CoC
            jurisdiction so that people sleeping on the streets are prioritized for assistance
            in the same way as all other homeless persons. VI-SPDAT is used as an
            outreach tool that helps determine chronicity and medical vulnerability.
            Outreach workers administer VI-SPDAT on the streets, in encampments, and
            out of site areas that identifies best type of support and housing interventions
            that fit their needs including PSH with a Housing First approach and RRH. CoC
            advertises the CE process in various ways that include: 1) leaving business
            cards of outreach workers; 2) leaving flyers that describe the process and
            includes contact information; 3) leaving information at service sites; 4) leaving
            information at public locations; 5) educating mainstream service providers; and
            6) at events that attract homeless persons; 7) seasonal shelter programs; 8) 2-
            1-1 help line; and 9) meal programs at community centers and parks.

               1F-2a. Describe how the CoC considered the severity of needs and

               applications when determining project application priority.
                (limit 1000 characters)
                CoC did consider the severity of needs and vulnerabilities of participants that
                are, or will be, served by the project applications as outlined in its written
                standards. Projects serving those persons with highest needs and greatest
                barriers towards obtaining and maintaining housing on their own were factored
                into the CoC’s review, ranking, and selection process. For example, projects
                serving, and new projects proposing to serve, CH Individuals and Families with
                the Longest History of Homelessness and with the Most Severe Service Needs
                were given weighted performance consideration. This also included history of
                high utilization of crisis services of emergency rooms, jails, and psychiatric
                facilities and significant health or behavioral health challenges and/or functional
                impairments which require a significant level of support in order to maintain
                permanent housing. Projects serving, or proposing to serve, higher
                percentages of persons coming from the streets were also considered.

              The CoC Board nominated and selected a Grant Review Committee of non-
              conflicted CoC members. Each agency requesting renewal funding completed a
              “Letter of Intent to Renew” to state information based on HUD performance
              criteria identified in 2014 and 2015 NOFAs for the committee to review. The
              information was used to make recommendations to the CoC Board for approval
              to reallocate and select and rank renewal and new project in Tier 1 and 2 which
              the CoC Board did. The CoC Board used the ranking and scoring criteria that
              was posted on the CoC’s web site on October 11 and sent to all CoC members
              on October 15.

            (limit 1000 characters)
             The CoC monitors agencies providing services within the CoC. The monitoring
             includes a review of program activities, client eligibility; HMIS grievance
             procedures, posting of privacy notices, HMIS Security, and data sharing
             agreements. The CoC requires program recipients to submit a Letter of Intent
             (LOI) to renew to the CoC. The LOI consists of questions regarding the
             following; LOCCs drawdowns; cost effectiveness; match review; HMIS
             participation; and monitoring findings. The CoC conducts a monthly review of
             data entered in HMIS. The HMIS data review is an assessment of HUD
             performance standards, bed utilization, and data elements. Agencies failing to
             meet performance standards are offered technical assistance.

               months.
               (limit 1000 characters)
                The primary reason for low bed coverage rates for emergency shelter,
                transitional housing, and permanent housing is because of the Rescue
                Mission's lack of participation in HMIS. The Rescue Mission is now willing to
                participate in HMIS. This will mean that 20 ES beds, 34 TH beds, and 53 PH
                beds will be entered into HMIS.

                2C-3. HUD understands that certain projects are either not required to or
                discouraged from participating in HMIS, and CoCs cannot require this if
                 they are not funded through the CoC or ESG programs. This does NOT
                  include domestic violence providers that are prohibited from entering
                   client data in HMIS. If any of the project types listed in question 2C-2
               above has a coverage rate of 85% or below, and some or all of these rates

           The data collected during the PIT count is vital for both CoCs and HUD.
           Communities need accurate data to determine the size and scope of
           homelessness at the local level so they can best plan for services and
           programs that will appropriately address local needs and measure
           progress in addressing homelessness. HUD needs accurate data to
           understand the extent and nature of homelessness throughout the
           country, and to provide Congress and the Office of Management and
           Budget (OMB) with information regarding services provided, gaps in
           service, and performance. This information helps inform Congress'
           funding decisions, and it is vital that the data reported is accurate and of
           high quality.

            Methodology included: 1) prior to the PIT count, the HIC that was submitted to
            HUD in 2014 was updated to include new ES, TH, and overflow beds including
            motel vouchers or deleted any that were no longer in existence; 2) HMIS was
            used to verify the beds of participating programs and the total number of
            occupied beds during the night of the PIT and was used to collect subpopulation
            data; 3) a program survey was completed by
            each non-HMIS participating program that included questions that gathered the
            same information which was gathered through HMIS (the survey was
            administered by staff); 4) HMIS data and extrapolation techniques was used to
            estimate the subpopulation information because of missing HMIS data; and 5)
            data collected through HMIS and the program survey was combined which
            provided the number of sheltered persons and the breakdown of the number of
            persons within each subpopulation. These activities ensured the accuracy of

           The unsheltered PIT count assists communities and HUD to understand
           the characteristics and number of people with a primary nighttime
           residence that is a public or private place not designed for or ordinarily
           used as a regular sleeping accommodation for human beings, including a
           car, park, abandoned building, bus or train station, airport, or camping
           ground. CoCs are required to conduct an unsheltered PIT count every 2
           years (biennially) during the last 10 days in January; however, CoCs are
           strongly encouraged to conduct the unsheltered PIT count annually, at the

            The CoC conducted a PIT count with interviews. The methods involved two
            instruments; the Unsheltered Count Instrument and the Subpopulation Survey.
            The unsheltered Count Instrument was used to count the total number of
            persons; single individuals and members of families and where they were
            located. The Subpopulation survey asked a total of 15 questions that provided
            information needed for all of the subpopulations required by HUD. 50 volunteers
            were divided into teams and each team was assigned a zone which included
            encampments and non-residential service sites. The teams went out from 6:30-
            9:30am and returned the count instruments to deployment center. The next day
            volunteers went out and surveyed unsheltered persons out on the streets and at
            service-based programs for homeless persons. All of the data was inputted onto
            a spreadsheet followed by data cleaning. Any inconsistencies were noted and
            corrected. The data was then tallied and broken out by subpopulations.

           3A-2. Performance Measure: First Time Homeless.
           Describe the CoC’s efforts to reduce the number of individuals and
           families who become homeless for the first time. Specifically, describe
           what the CoC is doing to identify risk factors for becoming homeless for
           the first time.
           (limit 1000 characters)
            A county-wide homeless prevention strategy has been implemented that has
            helped identify specific risk factors based on fact-finding with general
            assistance, mainstream, and prevention assistance providers that include
            unemployment, underemployment, sudden death or illness, and temporary and
            permanent disability. This strategy includes a county-wide homeless RRH
            prevention strategy in conjunction with the CES which was implemented with
            CoC and ESG recipients for individuals and families and provides rental and
            utility cash assistance to households with the highest likelihood of becoming
            homeless. Distinguishing criteria includes household income at or below 30% of
            AMI and whether or not a household has a history of homelessness or not. For
            families who become homeless, short-term shelter is provided as bridge
            housing with low barriers until PH is obtained and families receive ongoing case
            management to help prepare them to maintain their housing after they move in.
           3A-3. Performance Measure: Length of Time Homeless.
           Describe the CoC’s efforts to reduce the length of time individuals and
           families remain homeless. Specifically, describe how your CoC has
           reduced the average length of time homeless, including how the CoC
           identifies and houses individuals and families with the longest lengths of
           time homeless.
           (limit 1000 characters)
            VI-SPDAT has been implemented including questions regarding the length of
            time the client has been on the streets or in ES as part of the CES. Client’s
            length of homelessness, disability status, and chronicity determine the client’s
            ranking on the CES Prioritization list. CoC also uses HMIS to record episodes of
            homelessness by program participants who exit ES, RRH, TH, and PSH
            projects. The current method also uses APRs to monitor participants'
            Destination at Program Exit. This report includes the ability to drill into detailed
            destination data with client name to provide full audit and monitoring
            capabilities. HMIS will be used to generate the percentage of each destination
            data element to ensure how many participants exit to Permanent destination,
            and which agency is performing positive in housing stability. CoC is increasing
            the supply of PSH and RRH as a strategy to reduce LOT homeless.
            Households with the longest LOT homeless are housed first.

            Four implemented strategies include: 1) expanding the number of RRH
            programs through CoC funds, ESG funds, and state funds such as the CA
            Homeless Support Program; 2) providing wrap-around services with case
            management after households obtain PH in order to help maintain housing; 3)
            developing landlord liaison relationships as 1st point of contact for tenant issues
            and serve as mediator as needed; and 4) identifying individuals and families
            who return to homelessness through the CES which is imbedded into HMIS and
            creates a unique identifier upon entry. HMIS reports are run and data is
            reviewed to determine returns to homelessness. The CoC Data and
            Performance committee reviews reports with CoC staff then makes
            observations and recommendations to the CoC Board to help minimize returns
            to homelessness.
           3A-6. Performance Measure: Job and Income Growth.
           Describe specific strategies implemented by CoC Program-funded
           projects to increase the rate by which homeless individuals and families
           increase income from employment and non-employment sources (include
           at least one specific strategy for employment income and one for non-
           employment related income, and name the organization responsible for
           carrying out each strategy).
           (limit 1000 characters)
            Every homeless person entering into a residential component of the CoC is
            assessed for employment as part of a housing first approach. At least one case
            manager identifies and provides the services needed for employable residents
            that include pre-employment supports which likely involve life skills such as
            proper grooming and confidence-building. Other necessary services include job-
            readiness activities such as effective resumes and interview preparation, and
            job searching are obtained through referrals as noted in 3A-6a. Residents that
            are temporarily or not employable are helped with non-employment related
            income through the Merced County Human Services Agency which provides a
            wide-range of cash benefits including CalWorks, CalFresh, General Relief, and
            Medi-Cal. There are several office locations. Case managers help provide
            transportation when necessary, complete necessary paperwork, and assist
            residents with follow-up to ensure benefits are received.
           3A-6a. Describe how the CoC is working with mainstream employment
           organizations to aid homeless individuals and families in increasing their
           income.

            Primary organizations include Worknet which offers training and education
            programs and services that include Employer-site, on-the-job training,
            subsidized wages for employees in training, customized training programs,
            industry-specific education programs, and skills enhancement. Worknet also
            provides various events, workshops, and other technical assistance and training
            activities that also help overcome barriers. There are also specialized programs
            for youth, older workers, people with disabilities, dislocated workers, Veterans.
            The Human Services Agency also has a Welfare to Work Program for CalWorks
            recipients that provides training, counseling, education, etc., counseling and
            referrals for a variety of mental health and substance abuse problems, and a
            child care program that provide child care payments to providers on behalf of
            CalWORKs recipients in approved work or training programs. 80% of TH and
            PSH projects are regularly connecting participants with employment services.
           3A-7. Performance Measure: Thoroughness of Outreach.
           How does the CoC ensure that all people living unsheltered in the CoC's
           geographic area are known to and engaged by providers and outreach
           teams?
           (limit 1000 characters)
            Coordination between outreach teams and housing and homeless assistance
            providers consists of targeted street outreach to all unsheltered individuals and
            families including those who are CH and hardest to reach. Outreach workers
            engage unsheltered persons by entering them into a CES by administering the
            VI-SPDAT which determines chronicity and medical vulnerability of homeless
            persons and helps identify the best type of support and housing interventions
            that fit their needs. For families, placement in shelters as bridge housing only
            occurs when a family's homelessness cannot be immediately prevented. RRH
            assistance is provided as quickly as possible in order to limit their stay in
            temporary housing. For individuals, placement in shelters as bridge housing is
            needed when appropriate PH is not yet available. A housing first approach is
            used so such persons are able to maintain their temporary housing and in order
            to help assure that such persons maintain their housing once obtained.
 3A-7a. Did the CoC exclude geographic areas Yes
   from the 2015 unsheltered PIT count where
         the CoC determined that there were no
       unsheltered homeless people, including
   areas that are uninhabitable (e.g., deserts)?
           3A-7b. What was the the criteria and decision-making process the CoC
           used to identify and exclude specific geographic areas from the CoC's
           unsheltered PIT count?

            Of the six cities that make up the county, five of them participated in the 2015
            homeless count. Efforts were made to include the city that did not participate.
            However, the CoC was unable to recruit volunteers and thus a count was not
            conducted. Efforts will be made regarding the upcoming 2016 count and the
            CoC anticipates recruiting volunteers to in order to ensure that a count is
            conducted in this city.

              Instructions, the CoC Application Instructional Guides and the FY 2015 CoC Program NOFA.
              Please submit technical questions to the HUDExchange Ask A Question.
              Opening Doors, Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness
              (as amended in 2015) establishes the national goal of ending chronic
              homelessness. Although the original goal was to end chronic
              homelessness by the end of 2015, that goal timeline has been extended to
              2017. HUD is hopeful that communities that are participating in the Zero:
              2016 technical assistance initiative will continue to be able to reach the
              goal by the end of 2016. The questions in this section focus on the
              strategies and resources available within a community to help meet this
              goal.

            The total PIT count of sheltered and unsheltered chronically homeless persons
            decreased (-143) between 2014 and 2015 and the unsheltered count of
            chronically homeless persons also decreased (-65) between 2014 and 2015.
            58% of adults counted were chronically homeless in 2014 and only 25% in
            2015. The percentage of adults that had a disability was nearly the same for
            both years. However, the length of time homeless was not. Thus, many persons
            with disabilities in 2015 were not counted as chronically homeless because they
            were not homeless less than one year or not four times in three years.
           3B-1.2. From the FY 2013/FY 2014 CoC Application: Describe the CoC's
           two year plan (2014-2015) to increase the number of permanent supportive
           housing beds available for chronically homeless persons and to meet the
           proposed numeric goals as indicated in the table above. Response should
           address the specific strategies and actions the CoC will take to achieve
           the goal of ending chronic homelessness by the end of 2015.
           (read only)
            The CoC has begun to implement a two year plan that will increase the number
            of PSH beds for CH persons. The plan consists of increasing the number of
            PSH for CH persons by 1) encouraging PSH programs that do not serve 100%
            CH to serve 100% CH; 2) requiring PSH programs to fill vacant beds with CH;
            3) reallocating other CoC funded TH beds to PSH for CH; 4) supporting the
            creation of PSH for CH persons through non-CoC sources of funding. Such
            funds include state, county, and city funding sources. Support will include
            funding for the acquisition, rehabilitation, and new construction of units and
            beds for CH persons; and 5) supporting private investments such as social
            impact bonds or financing and private foundation grants to support the
            operations of a PSH for CH. CoC will offer training workshops as well as on-site
            technical consultation to provide assistance to PSH staff and board members.
            CoC will monitor the action steps noted above throughout the year through the
            CoC ranking and review process.
           3B-1.2a. Of the strategies listed in the FY 2013/FY 2014 CoC Application
           represented in 3B-1.2, which of these strategies and actions were
           accomplished?
           (limit 1000 characters)
            1) encouraging PSH programs that do not serve 100% CH to serve 100% CH
            and 2) requiring PSH programs to fill vacant beds with CH were accomplished
            as the result in changes in project policies. Also, CoC did offer training
            workshops as well as on-site technical consultation to provide assistance to
            PSH staff and board members and the CoC monitored the action steps in 3B1-2
            throughout the year through the CoC ranking and review process.
              3B-1.3. Compare the total number of PSH beds (CoC Program and non-
                 CoC Program funded) that were identified as dedicated for use by
              chronically homeless persons on the 2015 Housing Inventory Count, as
                compared to those identified on the 2014 Housing Inventory Count.

                  through assertive street outreach and engagement into areas and
                  encampments where CH persons are known to live; 2) engaging CH
                  households through the coordinated entry system to help link them to the
                  appropriate PSH provider and level of supportive services; 3) increasing
                  resources to provide bridge housing for CH households who need a short-term
                  stay while awaiting permanent housing availability that includes low barrier
                  shelter and vouchered stays in motels; 4) connecting CH households to
                  mainstream resources including Medi-Cal and behavioral health services while
                  awaiting PSH placement; 5) connecting CH households to community
                  resources such as food, transportation, money management, housing
                  counseling services, etc. to ensure they maintain their housing; and 6)
                  emphasizing a consumer-driven mindset that is choice-based.

              (limit 1000 characters)
               The CoC's plan to rapidly rehouse every family that becomes homeless within
               30 days of becoming homeless on the street or entering shelter includes: 1)
               providing bridge housing or shelter for no more than 30 days while case
               managers ready families to obtain housing through rapid rehousing assistance.
               Case management assistance will occur at least once a month to help families
               maintain their housing. For families who become homeless for the first time,
               rapid rehousing assistance will be provided to divert them from the shelter
               system if possible. There are two raid rehousing programs for families that did
               not exist more than a year ago. These programs are operated by the County's
               Human Services Agency and the Merced County Rescue Mission.
               3B-2.3. Compare the number of RRH units available to serve families from
                                                      the 2014 and 2015 HIC.

                 3B-2.4. How does the CoC ensure that emergency shelters, transitional
               housing, and permanent housing (PSH and RRH) providers within the CoC
                  do not deny admission to or separate any family members from other
                   members of their family based on age, sex, or gender when entering
                                 shelter or housing? (check all strategies that apply)
CoC policies and procedures prohibit involuntary family separation:
                                                                                                       X
There is a method for clients to alert CoC when involuntarily separated:
CoC holds trainings on preventing involuntary family separation,
at least once a year:                                                                                  X

              3B-2.5a. Explain the reason(s) for any increase, decrease or no change in
              the total number of homeless households with children in the CoC as
              reported in the 2015 PIT count compared to the 2014 PIT count.
              (limit 1000 characters)
               The increase was in sheltered households with children which was due to a new
               shelter program that did not exist in 2014. The new program, Room at the Inn
               had 12 members of households with children in 2015.
                   3B-2.6. Does the CoC have strategies to address the unique needs of
               unaccompanied homeless youth (under age 18, and ages 18-24), including
                                                             the following:

                 CoC and school district liaisons work together to develop safeguards to protect
                 students from discrimination based on homelessness by having local education
                 stakeholders on committees who are involved in strategic planning activities
                 regarding homelessness and children. As a result, there is a joint process to
                 identify families experiencing, or at risk of homelessness that often happens
                 while complying with the immediate enrollment mandate because of the lack of,
                 or inaccurate, paperwork. Efforts to confirm the student’s living situation are
                 grounded in sensitivity and respect bearing in mind the best interest of the
                 student. Thus, verifying the living status of students through landlords and law
                 enforcement is not practiced. Relationships have been established with shelters
                 and transitional housing programs to assist in identifying students in ways not to
                 create barriers and not embarrass families by conducting minimal investigation
                 to verify the living situation and conditions.

           3B-2.11. How does the CoC make sure that homeless participants are
           informed of their eligibility for and receive access to educational
           services? Include the policies and procedures that homeless service
           providers (CoC and ESG Programs) are required to follow. In addition,
           include how the CoC, together with its youth and educational partners
           (e.g. RHY, schools, juvenilee justice and children welfare agencies),
           identifies participants who are eligible for CoC or ESG programs.
           (limit 2000 characters)
            The CoC has regular meetings with local school district liaisons and mutually
            provide information and resources. Together, they work with CoC and ESG
            funded programs to identify homeless children and youth through the
            coordinated entry system. Once placed in a CoC and ESG funded program,
            program representatives’ work with liaisons through designated staff to ensure
            the identification of homeless youth and children. They also work together to
            inform homeless families of eligibility for McKinney-Vento education services
            which includes ensuring that families are aware of educational rights through
            regular school mailings and handouts at the beginning of the school year. Such
            materials are provided in English and Spanish and reviewed orally between
            families, children, youth, case managers, and liaisons. More specifically, they
            assure families receive a letter verifying eligibility for services, ensure
            transportation (bused to their school of origin if possible); formally reviews
            educational rights with parents; posts Educational Rights at program sites;
            provide mutual advocacy when educational rights are violated, have access to
            academic tutoring and counseling, and incorporate education in exit planning
            with clients. If possible, they help ensure every homeless child and youth
            remain enrolled in the school of their original residence prior to becoming
            homeless. When necessary, they give families and youth access to shelters and
            transitional housing programs closet to the school where they are enrolled.
            Also, when necessary, they work together to help enroll children escaping
            Domestic Violence in a school of their choice within the district and establish
            procedures to protect their safety and rights. CoC and ESG funded programs
            inform liaisons when children have exited their programs to help ensure their
            education continues uninterrupted.

              For guidance on completing this form, please reference the FY 2015 CoC Application Detailed
              Instructions, the CoC Application Instructional Guides and the FY 2015 CoC Program NOFA.
              Please submit technical questions to the HUDExchange Ask A Question.
              Opening Doors outlines the goal of ending Veteran homelessness by the
              end of 2015. The following questions focus on the various strategies that
              will aid communities in meeting this goal.
                  3B-3.1. Compare the total number of homeless Veterans in the CoC as
              reported by the CoC for the 2015 PIT count compared to 2014 (or 2013 if an
                                    unsheltered count was not conducted in 2014).
                                              2014 (for unsheltered
                                               count, most recent                  2015                  Difference

Universe: Total PIT count of sheltered                              84                          88                     4
 and unsheltered homeless veterans:

veterans:
              3B-3.1a. Explain the reason(s) for any increase, decrease or no change in
              the total number of homeless veterans in the CoC as reported in the 2015
              PIT count compared to the 2014 PIT count.
              (limit 1000 characters)
               The slight increase in the total number of homeless veterans is due to the
               concentrated efforts to identify veterans who are homeless than in past years
               due to the CoCs efforts to end homelessness by the end of 2015. Such efforts
               are described in this section under 3.2, 3.3, and 3.5a.
              3B-3.2. How is the CoC ensuring that Veterans that are eligible for VA
              services are identified, assessed and referred to appropriate resources,
              i.e. HUD-VASH and SSVF?

               Several ways include: 1) having street outreach teams create a community-wide
               list of veterans that includes CH and hardest-to-reach; 2) implementing a CES
               in which street outreach workers and other homeless services staff enter
               veterans into the system, via the list, that helps match them to appropriate
               housing and services; 3) sharing the community-wide list of veterans across
               agencies that prioritize veterans eligible for VA housing programs; 4)
               coordinating an interagency group that meets weekly to implement action plans
               for veterans on the list who have been determined to be eligible for VA services;
               5) assigning veterans to housing navigators that help identify housing, including
               bridge housing if needed, and help veterans obtain and maintain PH; 6)
               implementing a Housing First approach that moves veterans into PH as quickly
               as possible with right level of services; and 7) ensuring right level of services
               including connections to employment and legal services if needed.
              3B-3.3. For Veterans who are not eligible for homeless assistance through
              the U.S Department of Veterans Affairs Programs, how is the CoC
              prioritizing CoC Program-funded resources to serve this population?
              (limit 1000 characters)
               An action plan for veterans who are determined to be ineligible for VA services
               is initiated by the interagency group and assigned to housing navigators who
               implement a housing first approach. The primary housing resources include
               Shelter+Care program and PSH units. The total number of shelter+care
               certificates is 8 and the total number of PSH units is 149. Approximately, 20% of
               the total number of PSH units and units subsidized by S+C turnover annually.
               CoC Program-funded projects prioritize veterans and their families who cannot
               be effectively assisted with VA services. When it is determined a veteran cannot
               be effectively assisted with VA housing and services and has the same level of
               need as a non-veteran (as determined using a standardized assessment tool)
               the veteran receives priority. In addition to the CoC Program-funded resources
               noted above, other such resources include Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher
               Program; HOPWA, and HOME Program tenant-based rental assistance.
                3B-3.4. Compare the total number of homeless Veterans in the CoC AND
                      the total number of unsheltered homeless Veterans in the CoC, as
                   reported by the CoC for the 2015 PIT Count compared to the 2010 PIT
                    Count (or 2009 if an unsheltered count was not conducted in 2010).

            In addition, to the strategies and resources noted in 3B-3.2 and 3B-3.3,
            maximization includes 1) connecting veterans with mainstream resources
            outside of VA system for veterans ineligible for VA benefits and services and
            veterans who do but VA benefits can be supplemented; 2) communicating and
            integrating VA services with non-VA community-based organizations including
            CoC members in order to provide resources that VA services do not provide, or
            provide but supplement VA services, which include food, transportation, child
            care, housing counseling services, financial planning, etc.; 3) increasing
            resources to provide bridge housing for veterans who need a short-term stay
            while awaiting permanent housing availability that includes low barrier shelter,
            vouchered stays in motels, and low barrier transitional housing programs; and
            4) increasing resources to help veterans with furnishing permanent housing that
            includes furniture and other household items.

                                        Ranking and Scoring Criteria
                            for the Merced City and County Continuum of Care
                                    2015 Continuum of Care Application
All renewal and new projects must pass HUD’s eligibility and threshold requirements to be funded. It is
anticipated that all renewal projects will be submitted to HUD as part of the 2015 CoC application and
that one new project application for the Permanent Housing Bonus will also be submitted. The following
guidelines can also be found on www.MercedCoC.com.
        Renewal Projects:
The Merced CoC Board will rank and score renewal projects in accordance with the following Project
Renewal Thresholds that are noted on pages 32 and 33 of the HUD issued CoC 2015 NOFA:
f. Project Renewal Threshold. A CoC must consider the need to continue funding for projects expiring in
CY 2016. Renewal projects must meet minimum project eligibility, capacity, timeliness, and performance
standards identified in this NOFA or they will be rejected from consideration for funding.
(1) When considering renewal projects for award, HUD will review information in LOCCS; Annual
Performance Reports (APRs); and information provided from the local HUD CPD Field Office, including
monitoring reports and A-133 audit reports as applicable, and performance standards on prior grants,
and will assess projects using the following criteria on a pass/fail basis:
(a) Whether the project applicant’s performance met the plans and goals established in the initial
application as amended;
(b) Whether the project applicant demonstrated all timeliness standards for grants being renewed,
including that standards for the expenditure of grant funds have been met;
(c) The project applicant’s performance in assisting program participants to achieve and maintain
independent living and record of success, except HMIS-dedicated projects are not required to meet this
standard; and
(d) Whether there is evidence that a project applicant has been unwilling to accept technical assistance,
has a history of inadequate financial accounting practices, has indications of project mismanagement, has
a drastic reduction in the population served, has made program changes without prior HUD approval, or
has lost a project site.
(2) HUD reserves the right to reduce or reject a funding request from the project applicant for the
following reasons:
(a) Outstanding obligation to HUD that is in arrears or for which a payment schedule has not been agreed
upon;
(b) Audit finding(s) for which a response is overdue or unsatisfactory;
(c) History of inadequate financial management accounting practices;
(d) Evidence of untimely expenditures on prior award;
(e) History of other major capacity issues that have significantly affected the operation of the project and
its performance;
(f) History of not reimbursing sub-recipients for eligible costs in a timely manner, or at least quarterly;
and
(g) History of serving ineligible program participants, expending funds on ineligible costs, or failing to
expend funds within statutorily established timeframes.

g. Resolution of Outstanding Civil Rights Matters Threshold. In order for a project application to be eligible
for rating and ranking by HUD, the project applicant and the proposed sub-recipient must meet the civil
rights threshold requirements in Section III.C.2.b. of the FY 2015 General Section.
Scoring will be based on the responses in the Letter of Intent to Renew provided by agencies seeking to
renew their projects. Scores will be based on a 100 points and will be broken down as follows:
     1. Performance Measures (20 pts)
     2. Financial Reporting and Claims Submission (10 pts)
     3. HMIS Participation and Data Quality (20 pts)
     4. Independent Audit (10 pts)
     5. Match (5 pts)
     6. Leveraging (5 pts)
     7. Housing Quality Standards (5 pts)
     8. Review CoC Membership Involvement (20 pts)
     9. Participation in Centralized/Coordinated Entry System (no assigned points)
     10. HEARTH Act Compliance (5 pts)
         New Projects
The Merced CoC Board will evaluate new project applications in accordance with the following New
Project Thresholds that are noted on pages 32 and 33 of the HUD issued CoC 2015 NOFA:
e. Project Quality Threshold. HUD will review all new project applications to determine if they meet the
following project quality threshold requirements with clear and convincing evidence. Any project
requesting renewal funding will be considered as having met these requirements through its previously
approved grant application unless information to the contrary is received (e.g., monitoring findings,
results from investigations by the Office of Inspector General, consistently slow draws from LOCCS,
consistently late APRs) and if the renewal project has compliance issues which results in the project not
operating in accordance with 24 CFR part 578. These projects are required to meet the requirements
outlined in this section of this NOFA. The housing and services proposed must be appropriate to the needs
of the program participants and the community. A determination that a project meets the project quality
threshold is not a determination by HUD that a recipient is in compliance with applicable fair housing and
civil rights requirements.
(1) To be considered as meeting project quality threshold, new permanent housing–permanent
supportive housing and rapid re-housing–project applications must receive at least 3 out of the 5 points
available for the criteria below. New permanent housing project applications that do not receive at least
3 points will be rejected.
(a) Whether the type, scale, and location of the housing fit the needs of the program participants (1 point);
(b) Whether the type and scale of the supportive services fit the needs of the program participants–this
includes all supportive services, regardless of funding source (1 point);
                                                                                                             2

(c) Whether the specific plan for ensuring program participants will be individually assisted to obtain the
benefits of the mainstream health, social, and employment programs for which they are eligible to apply
meets the needs of the program participants (1 point);
(d) Whether program participants are assisted to obtain and remain in permanent housing in a manner
that fits their needs (1 point); and,
(e) Whether at least 75 percent of the proposed program participants come from the street or other
locations not meant for human habitation, emergency shelters, safe havens, or fleeing domestic violence
(1 point).
                                                                                                          3

                                      Process for Reallocation
                                  for Merced City and County CoC
All renewal projects are reviewed by the CoC Board to determine if a project should be
considered for reallocation.
Through the reallocation process, the CoC ensures that projects submitted with the CoC
Collaborative Application best align with the HUD CoC funding priorities and contribute to a
competitive application that secures HUD CoC dollars to address and end homelessness in
Merced County. The CoC will make decisions based on alignment with HUD guidelines,
performance measures, and unspent project funds. Reallocated projects will be encouraged to
seek funders that will support the contributions these projects make to the CoC.
The recommendation for reallocation is based on any one of the following HUD criteria:
1) Outstanding obligation to HUD that is in arrears or for which a payment schedule has not been
agreed upon;
2) Audit finding(s) for which a response is overdue or unsatisfactory;
3) History of inadequate financial management accounting practices;
4) Evidence of untimely expenditures on prior award;
5) History of other major capacity issues that have significantly impacted the operation of the
project and its performance;
6) Timeliness in reimbursing sub recipients for eligible costs. HUD will consider a project applicant
as meeting this standard if it has drawn down grant funds at least once per month; or
7) History of serving ineligible persons, expending funds on ineligible costs, or failing to expend
funds within statutorily established timeframes.
HMIS Data Quality. The CoC evaluates all programs on their HMIS quality for the operating year.
It is expected that programs will have no greater than 10% of missing values for any of the
universal data elements; programs are able to correct incomplete data to improve the
percentages. Data quality outcomes are collected via the monthly Performance Report Cards and
APRs generated for each project.
                         Merced City and County Continuum of Care
                                       Governance Charter
In accordance with the Interim Rule of the Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition
to Housing Act of 2009 (HEARTH Act) which was enacted into law on May 20, 2009, the Merced
City and County Continuum of Care (Merced County CoC) in consultation with the collaborative
applicant (as described in Section VIII.b) and the HMIS Lead Agency (as described in Section IX.b)
as required by the Interim Rule, has developed, followed, and will “update annually a governance
charter, which will include all procedures and policies needed to comply with subpart B of this
part and with HMIS requirements as prescribed by HUD; and a code of conduct and recusal
process for the board, its chair(s), and any person acting on behalf of the board” as described in
§ 578.7(a)(5) Responsibilities of the Continuum of Care.
Subpart B of the Interim Rule is noted in Appendix A: Subpart B of the Interim Rule and a code of
conduct and recusal process for the board, its chair(s), and any person acting on behalf of the
board is noted in Appendix B: Conflict of Interest.
    I.     Name:
The name of the organization is Merced City and County Continuum of Care (hereinafter referred
to as the “Merced County CoC).”
    II.    Geographic Boundaries:
The Merced County CoC is responsible for the area that the U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development (HUD) has designated for CA-520 Merced City and County CoC which is the
boundaries of the County of Merced hereinafter referred to as the “geographic area”.
    III.   Purpose:
The Merced County CoC serves as the HUD-designated primary decision-making group whose
primary purpose and scope is to implement the Continuum of Care program which is authorized
by subtitle C of title IV of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11381-11389).
The program is designed to:
         a. Promote communitywide commitment to the goal of ending homelessness;
         b. Provide funding for efforts by nonprofit providers, States, and local governments to
            quickly rehouse homeless individuals (including unaccompanied youth) and families,

             while minimizing the trauma and dislocation caused to homeless individuals, families,
             and communities by homelessness;
        c. Promote access to and effective utilization of mainstream programs by homeless
             individuals and families; and
        d. Optimize self-sufficiency among individuals and families experiencing homelessness.
as noted in § 578.1 Purpose and scope of the Interim Rule of the Homeless Emergency Assistance
and Rapid Transition to Housing Act of 2009 (HEARTH Act).
As described in the Interim Rule, HUD:
            “uses the term Continuum of Care to refer to the organizations that carry out
            the duties and responsibilities assigned to the collaborative applicant, with
            the exception of applying to HUD for grant funds. The clarification is
            necessary in this rule because Continuums of Care are not required to be
            legal entities, but HUD can enter into contractual agreements with legal
            entities only.”
The Continuum of Care is furthered described:
            “to mean the group that is organized to carry out the responsibilities required
            under this part and that is composed of representatives of organizations” as
            noted in Section V: Membership below.
    IV.   Meetings
The Merced County CoC will conduct meetings of the full membership with published agendas at
least four times a year. Meetings will be held at the Merced Civic Center unless otherwise noticed
in advance.
    V.     Representatives:
    1. There shall be two categories of Representatives: Organization Representatives and
        Community-At-Large Representatives.
                                                                                                 2

Organization Representatives:
Membership is defined as representatives from relevant organizations participating in the
responsibilities of the Merced County CoC through active participation in its board, committees
and working groups.

                                     Appendix B: Conflict of Interest
§ 578.95 Conflicts of interest (of the Interim Rule of the Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid
Transition to Housing Act of 2009 (HEARTH Act).
(a) Procurement. For the procurement of property (goods, supplies, or equipment) and services, the
recipient and its subrecipients must comply with the codes of conduct and conflict-of-interest
requirements under 24 CFR 85.36 (for governments) and 24 CFR 84.42 (for private nonprofit
organizations).
(b) Continuum of Care board members. No Continuum of Care board member may participate in or
influence discussions or resulting decisions concerning the award of a grant or other financial benefits
to the organization that the member represents.
(c) Organizational conflict. An organizational conflict of interest arises when, because of activities or
relationships with other persons or organizations, the recipient or subrecipient is unable or
potentially unable to render impartial assistance in the provision of any type or amount of assistance
under this part, or when a covered person’s, as in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, objectivity in
performing work with respect to any activity assisted under this part is or might be otherwise
impaired. Such an organizational conflict would arise when a board member of an applicant
participates in decision of the applicant concerning the award of a grant, or provision of other
financial benefits, to the organization that such member represents. It would also arise when an
employee of a recipient or subrecipient participates in making rent reasonableness determinations
under § 578.49(b)(2) and § 578.51(g) and housing quality inspections of property under § 578.75(b)
that the recipient, subrecipient, or related entity owns.
(d) Other conflicts. For all other transactions and activities, the following restrictions apply:
(1) No covered person, meaning a person who is an employee, agent, consultant, officer, or elected
or appointed official of the recipient or its subrecipients and who exercises or has exercised any
functions or responsibilities with respect to activities assisted under this part, or who is in a position
to participate in a decision-making process or gain inside information with regard to activities assisted
under this part, may obtain a financial interest or benefit from an assisted activity, have a financial
interest in any contract, subcontract, or agreement with respect to an assisted activity, or have a
financial interest in the proceeds derived from an assisted activity, either for him or herself or for
those with whom he or she has immediate family or business ties, during his or her tenure or during
the one-year period following his or her tenure.
(2) Exceptions. Upon the written request of the recipient, HUD may grant an exception to the
provisions of this section on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the cumulative
effects of the criteria in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, provided that the recipient has
satisfactorily met the threshold requirements of paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section.
(i) Threshold requirements. HUD will consider an exception only after the recipient has provided the
following documentation:
                                                                                                        18

(A) Disclosure of the nature of the conflict, accompanied by a written assurance, if the recipient is a
government, that there has been public disclosure of the conflict and a description of how the public
disclosure was made; and if the recipient is a private nonprofit organization, that the conflict has
been disclosed in accordance with their written code of conduct or other conflict-of-interest policy;
and
(B) An opinion of the recipient's attorney that the interest for which the exception is sought would
not violate State or local law, or if the subrecipient is a private nonprofit organization, the exception
would not violate the organization’s internal policies.
(ii) Factors to be considered for exceptions. In determining whether to grant a requested exception
after the recipient has satisfactorily met the threshold requirements under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this
section, HUD must conclude that the exception will serve to further the purposes of the Continuum
of Care program and the effective and efficient administration of the recipient's or subrecipient’s
project, taking into account the cumulative effect of the following factors, as applicable:
(A) Whether the exception would provide a significant cost benefit or an essential degree of expertise
to the program or project that would otherwise not be available;
(B) Whether an opportunity was provided for open competitive bidding or negotiation;
(C) Whether the affected person has withdrawn from his or her functions, responsibilities, or the
decision-making process with respect to the specific activity in question;
(D) Whether the interest or benefit was present before the affected person was in the position
described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section;
(E) Whether undue hardship will result to the recipient, the subrecipient, or the person affected,
when weighed against the public interest served by avoiding the prohibited conflict;
(F) Whether the person affected is a member of a group or class of persons intended to be the
beneficiaries of the assisted activity, and the exception will permit such person to receive generally
the same interests or benefits as are being made available or provided to the group or class; and
(G) Any other relevant considerations.
                                                                                                       19

                                HMIS Policies and Procedures
    A. Background
In 2001, Congress directed the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) data
and analysis on the extent of homelessness. HUD requires each Continuum of Care (CoC) to
have a Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) designed to facilitate data
collection.
Below are HUD funded programs required to participate in the HMIS:
       Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG)
       Housing Opportunities for People with AIDS (HOPWA)
       Continuum of Care Program (comprises the Supportive Housing Program, Shelter
        Plus Care Program, and the Single Room Occupancy Program)
Programs that receive other sources of funding are not required to participate in the HMIS, but
are strongly encouraged by HUD to do so in order to contribute to a better understanding of
local homelessness.
Merced HMIS is a response to the HUD mandated implementation of a Homeless Management
Information System (HMIS) database. Merced HMIS is an online database used by homeless and
at-risk service providers that records demographic and service usage data and produces an
unduplicated count of the people using those services.
    B. Mission Statement
Merced HMIS will use HMIS to advance the provision of quality services for homeless and at risk
of becoming homeless persons, improve data collection, and promote more responsive policies
to prevent and end homelessness in the County of Merced.
    C. Vision
Merced HMIS is dedicated to providing the best possible, highest quality regional HMIS to
enhance the delivery of services for persons who are homeless or at risk of homelessness.
Specifically, Merced HMIS will:
       Facilitate the coordination of service delivery for homeless and at risk homeless
        persons;
       Enable agencies to track referrals and services provided, report outcomes, and manage
        client data using an accessible, user-friendly and secured technology; and
       Enhance the ability of policy makers and advocates to gauge the extent of homelessness
        and plan services appropriately throughout Merced County.

                                                                                     7
                                        Merced Continuum of Care (CoC):
                     Written Standards for Providing Continuum of Care Assistance
The Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing (HEARTH Act): Continuum
of Care Program (24 CFR Part 578) describes in § 578.7 Responsibilities of the Continuum of Care,
subsection (a) Operate the Continuum of Care (9), the Continuum of Care must
           “In consultation with recipients of Emergency Solutions Grants program funds within the
           geographic area, establish and consistently follow written standards for providing
           Continuum of Care assistance.”1
This subsection also states that at a minimum, written standards must include “policies and
procedures for evaluating individuals’ and families’ eligibility for assistance” for
           1. permanent supportive housing;
           2. rapid rehousing; and
           3. transitional housing.
However, written standards for the Merced CoC will also include:
           4.  coordinated assessment;
           5.  seasonal shelter;
           6.  year-round shelter;
           7.  bridge housing; and
           8.  homeless prevention.
These written standards will be developed as HUD provides more guidance.
This subsection also states that written standards must also include
           “polices and procedures for determining and prioritizing which eligible individuals and
           families will receive” transitional housing, rapid rehousing, and permanent supportive
           housing assistance.
I. Determining Written Standards for Permanent Supportive Housing
      A. Background information
1
  The Interim Rule for the Emergency Solutions Grant Program does not provide information concerning transitional
housing beyond the Interim Rule for the HEARTH Act Continuum of Care program because in order for a transitional
facility to receive ESG funds, the facility cannot require occupants to sign leases or occupancy agreements whereas
CoC funded transitional housing programs must require occupants to sign leases or occupancy agreements.

In regards to rapid rehousing, § 578.7 Responsibilities of the Continuum of Care (a) (9) of the
HEARTH Act Interim Rule notes that
        In consultation with recipients of Emergency Solutions Grants program funds within the
        geographic area, establish and consistently follow written standards for providing
        Continuum of Care assistance. At a minimum, these written standards must include:
               Policies and procedures for evaluating individuals’ and families’ eligibility for
                assistance under this part;
               Policies and procedures for determining and prioritizing which eligible individuals and
                families will receive permanent supportive housing assistance.
Permanent supportive housing is considered permanent housing. HUD’s regulatory definition of
“permanent housing” states:
        “The term ‘permanent housing’ means community-based housing without a designated
        length of stay, and includes both permanent supportive housing and rapid re-housing.”
HUD also states
        “Additionally, in the regulatory definition of “permanent housing,” HUD clarifies that to be
        permanent housing, “the program participant must be the tenant on a lease for a term of at
        least one year that is renewable and is terminable only for cause. The lease must be
        renewable for terms that are a minimum of one month long. HUD has determined that
        requiring a lease for a term of at least one year that is renewable and terminable only for
        cause, assists program participants in obtaining stability in housing, even when the rental
        assistance is temporary. These requirements are consistent with Section 8 requirements.”
    B. Eligible clients
As stated in the 2014 CoC NOFA under Beds Dedicated to the Chronically Homeless
        “The total number of permanent supportive housing beds in the CoC’s geographic area
        that are dedicated specifically for use by the chronically homeless, per 24 CFR 578.3, as
        reported in the CoC’s Housing Inventory Count (HIC). For permanent supportive housing
        beds, when a participant exits the program, the bed must be filled by another chronically
        homeless participant unless there are no chronically homeless persons located within the
        CoC’s geographic area. This concept only applies to permanent supportive housing
        projects. (see p. 18)”
Also stated in the 2014 CoC NOFA under Non-Dedicated Permanent Supportive Housing Beds
        “Permanent supportive housing beds within a CoC’s geographic area that are not
        currently dedicated specifically for use by the chronically homeless. CoCs and projects are
                                                                                                      2

        strongly encouraged to prioritize the chronically homeless in non-dedicated permanent
        supportive housing beds as they become available through turnover. This concept only
        pertains to permanent supportive housing projects (see p. 19).”
Eligible clients must also meet eligibility criteria as defined in the NOFA under which the program
was funded.
    C. Prioritizing Permanent Supportive Housing
On July 28, 2014, HUD published Notice: CPD-14-012 “Notice on Prioritizing Persons Experiencing
Chronic Homelessness and Other Vulnerable Homeless Persons in Permanent Supportive
Housing and Recordkeeping Requirements for Documenting Chronic Homeless Status.”
HUD stated that to “ensure that all PSH beds funded through the CoC Program are used as
strategically and effectively as possible, PSH needs to be targeted to serve persons with the
highest needs and greatest barriers towards obtaining and maintaining housing on their own–
persons experiencing chronic homelessness (see p. 2).”
HUD also stated that “CoCs are strongly encouraged to adopt and incorporate into the CoC’s
written standards and coordinated assessment system” that are consistent with the order of
priority established by HUD in the notice concerning CoC Program-funded Permanent Supportive
Housing and Permanent Supportive Housing Beds Not Dedicated or Prioritized for Persons
Experiencing Chronic Homelessness (see pages 2 and 3).
Thus, with “adoption by CoCs and incorporation into the CoC’s written standards, all recipients
of CoC Program-funded PSH must then follow this order of priority, consistent with their current
grant agreement, which will result in this intervention being targeted to the persons who need it
the most (see p. 3).
HUD’s “Order of Priority in CoC Program-funded Permanent Supportive Housing” is as follows:
       First Priority–Chronically Homeless Individuals and Families with the Longest History of
        Homelessness and with the Most Severe Service Needs.
       Second Priority–Chronically Homeless Individuals and Families with the Longest History
        of Homelessness.
       Third Priority–Chronically Homeless Individuals and Families with the Most Severe Service
        Needs.
       Fourth Priority–All Other Chronically Homeless Individuals and Families.
HUD’s “Order of Priority in Permanent Supportive Housing Beds Not Dedicated or Prioritized for
Persons Experiencing Chronic Homelessness” is as follows:
       First Priority–Homeless Individuals and Families with a Disability with the Most Severe
        Service Needs.
                                                                                                  3

       Second Priority–Homeless Individuals and Families with a Disability with a Long Period of
        Continuous or Episodic Homelessness.
       Third Priority–Homeless Individuals and Families with Disability Coming from Places Not
        Meant for Human Habitation, Safe Havens, or Emergency Shelters.
       Fourth Priority–Homeless Individuals and Families with a Disability Coming from
        Transitional Housing.
Details of both sets of order of priority can be found on pages 6 – 10 of the notice.
A glossary of key terms for this notice can be found on pages 3 – 5.
The notice also requires “Recordkeeping Requirements for Documenting Chronic Homeless
Status.” HUD stated that this notice “establishes recordkeeping requirements for all recipients of
CoC Program-funded PSH that are required to document a program participant’s status as
chronically homeless as defined in 24 CFR 578.3 and in accordance with 24 CFR 578.103. Further,
HUD expects that where CoCs have adopted the orders of priority in Section III. of this Notice into
their written standards, the CoC as well as recipients of CoC Program-funded PSH, will maintain
evidence of implementing these priorities.”
A. CoC Records
In addition to the records required in 24 CFR 578.103, it is recommended that the CoC should
supplement such records with the following:
     1. Evidence of written standards that incorporate the priorities in Section III. of this Notice,
        as adopted by the CoC;
     2. Evidence of a standardized assessment tool;
     3. Evidence that the written standards were incorporated into the coordinated assessment
        policies and procedures.
Details for 1 -3 can be found on pages 11 – 12 of the notice.
B. Recipient Recordkeeping Requirements
In addition to the records required in 24 CFR 578.103, recipients of CoC Program-funded PSH that
is required by grant agreement to document chronically homeless status of program participants
in some or all of its PSH beds must maintain the following records:
     1. Written Intake Procedures;
     2. Evidence of Chronically Homeless Status
        a. Evidence of homeless status
        b. Evidence of the duration of the homelessness:
            o Evidence that the homeless occasion was continuous, for at least one year;
                                                                                                   4

             o Evidence that the household experienced at least four separate homeless
                 occasions over 3 years;
             o Evidence of diagnosis with one or more of the following conditions: substance use
                 disorder, serious mental illness, developmental disability (as defined in Section
                 102 of the Developmental Disabilities Assistance Bill of Rights Act of 2000 (42
                 U.S.C. 15002), post-traumatic stress disorder, cognitive impairments resulting
                 from brain injury, or chronic physical illness or disability.
Details for 1 -2 can be found on pages 11 – 12 of the notice.
    D. Written Standards
Written Standard #1: No Designated Length of Stay
       Program participants are provided housing without a designated length of stay that
        permits them to live as independently as possible.
In Program Components and Eligible Costs (Subpart D) of the Preamble of the HEARTH Act (see
p. 25) the following is noted:
        “Consistent with the definition of permanent housing in section 401 of the McKinney-
        Vento Act and § 578.3 of this interim rule, the permanent housing component is
        community-based housing without a designated length of stay that permits formerly
        homeless individuals and families to live as independently as possible. The interim rule
        clarifies that Continuum of Care funds may be spent on two types of permanent housing:
        permanent supportive housing for persons with disabilities (PSH) and rapid rehousing that
        provides temporary assistance (i.e., rental assistance and/or supportive services) to
        program participants in a unit that the program participant retains after the assistance
        ends.”
Written Standard #2: Lease Agreement
       The program participant must be the tenant on a lease for a term of at least one year that
        is renewable and is terminable only for cause. The lease must be renewable for terms that
        are a minimum of one month long.
On page 12 of the Preamble of the HEARTH Act Interim Rule,
        “HUD clarifies that to be permanent housing, “the program participant must be the tenant
        on a lease for a term of at least one year that is renewable and is terminable only for cause.
        The lease must be renewable for terms that are a minimum of one month long. HUD has
        determined that requiring a lease for a term of at least one year that is renewable and
        terminable only for cause, assists program participants in obtaining stability in housing, even
                                                                                                      5

        when the rental assistance is temporary. These requirements are consistent with Section 8
        requirements.”
Also, § 578.77 Calculating occupancy charges and rent (a) states the following about occupancy
agreements:
        “(a) Occupancy agreements and leases. Recipients and subrecipients must have signed
        occupancy agreements or leases (or subleases) with program participants residing in
        housing.”
Written Standard #3: Restricted Assistance and Disabilities
       Permanent supportive housing can only provide assistance to individuals with
        disabilities and families in which one adult or child has a disability.
§ 578.37 Program components and uses of assistance (a) (1) (i) states that
        “Permanent supportive housing for persons with disabilities (PSH). PSH can only provide
        assistance to individuals with disabilities and families in which one adult or child has a
        disability. Supportive services designed to meet the needs of the program participants
        must be made available to the program participants.”
Written Standard #4: Supportive Services
       Supportive services designed to meet the needs of program participants must be made
        available to the program participants.
§ 578.37 Program components and uses of assistance (a) (1) (i) states that
        “Permanent supportive housing for persons with disabilities (PSH). PSH can only provide
        assistance to individuals with disabilities and families in which one adult or child has a
        disability. Supportive services designed to meet the needs of the program participants
        must be made available to the program participants.”
Written Standard #5: Duration of Supportive Services Assistance
       Supportive services to enable program participants to live as independently as
        possible must be provided throughout the duration of their residence
§ 578.53 Supportive services (b) (2) states that
        “Permanent supportive housing projects must provide supportive services for the
        residents to enable them to live as independently as is practicable throughout the
        duration of their residence in the project.”
                                                                                                 6

Written Standard #6: One Person per Bedroom
      Two individuals in a shared housing situation must have their own lease and their own
       bedroom unless the two individuals are presented together as a household
Information received from HUD Exchange on February 9, 2015 is as follows:
       “Under the CoC Program, all housing that is leased with Continuum of Care program
       funds, or for which rental assistance payments are made with Continuum of Care program
       funds, must meet the applicable Housing Quality Standards (HQS) under 24 CFR 982.401
       of this title, except that 24 CFR 982.401(j) applies only to housing occupied by program
       participants receiving tenant-based rental assistance.
       HQS dictates that, at a minimum, the unit must have a living room, a kitchen, and a
       bathroom. HQS requirements also dictates that the bathroom must be contained within
       the unit, afford privacy (usually meaning a door, although no lock is required), and be for
       the exclusive use of the occupants. Additionally, the unit must have suitable space and
       equipment to store, prepare, and serve food in a sanitary manner. This includes a
       requirement for an oven and stove or range, a refrigerator of appropriate size for the
       family, and a kitchen sink with hot and cold running water. Hot plates are not acceptable
       substitutes for stoves or ranges. However, a microwave oven may be used in place of a
       conventional oven, stove, or range if the oven/stove/range are tenant supplied or if
       microwaves are furnished in both subsidized and unsubsidized units in the building or
       premises.
       The CoC Program also allows for shared housing/roommate situations in projects with
       leasing or rental assistance funds. Each household must have the bedroom size that fits
       their household size. In other words, 2 individuals in a shared housing situation must
       have their own lease, and their own bedroom. The only situation where 2 people would
       be sharing one bedroom would be if they presented together as a household.
       For more information about Housing Quality Standards, please refer to Chapter 10 of
       the HCVP Guidebook:
       www.hud.gov/offices/adm/hudclips/guidebooks/7420.10G/7420g10GUID.pdf.”
Written Standard #7: Program Income
      Program income generated from rent and occupancy charges may be collected from
       program participants and added to funds committed to the project by HUD and used
       for eligible program activities
§ 578.97 Program income includes the following:
       “(a) Defined. Program income is the income received by the recipient or subrecipient
       directly generated by a grant-supported activity.
                                                                                                 7

        (b) Use. Program income earned during the grant term shall be retained by the recipient,
        and added to funds committed to the project by HUD and the recipient, used for eligible
        activities in accordance with the requirements of this part. Costs incident to the
        generation of program income may be deducted from gross income to calculate program
        income, provided that the costs have not been charged to grant funds.
        (c) Rent and occupancy charges. Rents and occupancy charges collected from program
        participants are program income. In addition, rents and occupancy charges collected from
        residents of transitional housing may be reserved, in whole or in part, to assist the
        residents from whom they are collected to move to permanent housing.”
Also, § 578.49 Leasing (b) (7) states the following about program income
        “Program income. Occupancy charges and rent collected from program participants are
        program income and may be used as provided under § 578.97.”
Written Standard #8: Calculating Occupancy Charges and Rent
       if occupancy charges are imposed, they may not exceed the highest of: 1) 30 percent of
        the family’s monthly adjusted income (adjustment factors include the number of
        people in the family, age of family members, medical expenses, and child-care
        expenses); 2) 10 percent of the family’s monthly income; or 3) If the family is receiving
        payments for welfare assistance from a public agency and a part of the payments
        (adjusted in accordance with the family’s actual housing costs) is specifically designated
        by the agency to meet the family’s housing costs, the portion of the payments that is
        designated for housing costs.
§ 578.77 Calculating occupancy charges and rent (b) (1) (2) (3) notes the following about
occupancy agreements
        “(b) Calculation of occupancy charges. Recipients and subrecipients are not required to
        impose occupancy charges on program participants as a condition of residing in the
        housing. However, if occupancy charges are imposed, they may not exceed the highest
        of:
        (1) 30 percent of the family’s monthly adjusted income (adjustment factors include the
        number of people in the family, age of family members, medical expenses, and child-care
        expenses);
        (2) 10 percent of the family’s monthly income; or
        (3) If the family is receiving payments for welfare assistance from a public agency and a
        part of the payments (adjusted in accordance with the family’s actual housing costs) is
        specifically designated by the agency to meet the family’s housing costs, the portion of
        the payments that is designated for housing costs.”
                                                                                                 8

Written Standard #9: Examining Program Participant’s Initial Income
      a program participant’s initial income must be examined at least annually to determine
       the amount of the contribution toward rent payable by the program participant and
       adjustments to a program participant’s contribution toward the rental payment must
       be made as changes in income are identified.
§578.77 Calculating occupancy charges and rent (c)(2) states that
       “Recipients or subrecipients must examine a program participant’s income initially, and
       at least annually thereafter, to determine the amount of the contribution toward rent
       payable by the program participant. Adjustments to a program participant’s contribution
       toward the rental payment must be made as changes in income are identified.”
§578.103 Recordkeeping requirements (7) (i) (ii) states that the recipient or subrecipient must
keep records for each program participant that document:
       “(i) The services and assistance provided to that program participant, including evidence
       that the recipient or subrecipient has conducted an annual assessment of services for
       those program participants that remain in the program for more than a year and
       adjusted the service package accordingly, and including case management services as
       provided in § 578.37(a)(1)(ii)(F); and
       (ii) Where applicable, compliance with the termination of assistance requirement in §
       578.91.”
Written Standard #10: Verifying Program Participant’s Initial Income
      each program participant must agree to supply the information or documentation
       necessary to verify the program participant’s income.
§578.77 Calculating occupancy charges and rent (c)(3) states that
       “As a condition of participation in the program, each program participant must agree to
       supply the information or documentation necessary to verify the program participant’s
       income. Program participants must provide the recipient or subrecipient with information
       at any time regarding changes in income or other circumstances that may result in
       changes to a program participant’s contribution toward the rental payment.”
§578.103 Recordkeeping requirements (6) (i) (ii) (iii) and (iv) states that the following
documentation of annual income must be kept by recipient or subrecipient:
       “(i) Income evaluation form specified by HUD and completed by the recipient or
       subrecipient; and
                                                                                               9

       (ii) Source documents (e.g., most recent wage statement, unemployment compensation
       statement, public benefits statement, bank statement) for the assets held by the program
       participant and income received before the date of the evaluation;
       (iii) To the extent that source documents are unobtainable, a written statement by the
       relevant third party (e.g., employer, government benefits administrator) or the written
       certification by the recipient’s or subrecipient’s intake staff of the oral verification by the
       relevant third party of the income the program participant received over the most recent
       period; or
       (iv) To the extent that source documents and third-party verification are unobtainable,
       the written certification by the program participant of the amount of income that the
       program participant is reasonably expected to receive over the 3-month period following
       the evaluation.”
Written Standard #11: Recalculating Occupancy Charges and Rent
      if there is a change in family composition (e.g., birth of a child) or a decrease in the
       resident’s income during the year, the resident may request an interim reexamination,
       and the occupancy charge will be adjusted accordingly.
§ 578.77 Calculating occupancy charges and rent (b) (4) notes the following about recalculating
occupancy charges and rent
       “(4) Income. Income must be calculated in accordance with 24 CFR 5.609 and 24 CFR
       5.611(a). Recipients and subrecipients must examine a program participant’s income
       initially, and if there is a change in family composition (e.g., birth of a child) or a decrease
       in the resident’s income during the year, the resident may request an interim
       reexamination, and the occupancy charge will be adjusted accordingly.”
Written Standard #12: Supportive Services Agreement
      program participants may be required to take part in supportive services that are not
       disability-related services (including substance abuse treatment services) provided
       through the project as a condition of continued participation in the program. However,
       HUD tends to believe that these kind of requirements can be barriers and should be rare
       and minimal if used as all.
§ 578.75 General operations (h) states that
       “Recipients and subrecipients may require the program participants to take part in
       supportive services that are not disability-related services provided through the project
       as a condition of continued participation in the program. Examples of disability-related
       services include, but are not limited to, mental health services, outpatient health services,
       and provision of medication, which are provided to a person with a disability to address
                                                                                                     10

        a condition caused by the disability. Notwithstanding this provision, if the purpose of the
        project is to provide substance abuse treatment services, recipients and subrecipients
        may require program participants to take part in such services as a condition of continued
        participation in the program.”
From “HOUSING FIRST IN PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING” (see www.hudexchange.info/
resources/ documents/Housing-First-Permanent-Supportive-Housing-Brief.pdf)
        “Supportive services are voluntary, but can and should be used to persistently engage
        tenants to ensure housing stability - Supportive services are proactively offered to help
        tenants achieve and maintain housing stability, but tenants are not required to participate
        in services as a condition of tenancy. Techniques such as harm reduction and motivational
        interviewing may be useful. Harm reduction techniques can confront and mitigate the
        harms of drug and alcohol use through non-judgmental communication while
        motivational interviewing may be useful in helping households acquire and utilize new
        skills and information.”
Written Standard #13: Termination of Assistance
       Assistance may be terminated to a program participant who violates program
        requirements or conditions of occupancy by providing a formal process that recognizes
        the due process of law.
On page 37 of the Preamble of the HEARTH Act, the following is stated concerning termination
of assistance:
        “The interim rule provides that a recipient may terminate assistance to a participant
        who violates program requirements or conditions of occupancy. The recipient must
        provide a formal process that recognizes the due process of law. Recipients may resume
        assistance to a participant whose assistance has been terminated.
        Recipients that are providing permanent supportive housing for hard-to-house
        populations of homeless persons must exercise judgment and examine all circumstances
        in determining whether termination is appropriate. Under this interim rule, HUD has
        determined that a participant’s assistance should be terminated only in the most severe
        cases. HUD is carrying over this requirement from the Shelter Plus Care program.”
II. Determining Written Standards for Rapid Rehousing
        A. Background information
                                                                                                 11

In regards to rapid rehousing, § 578.7 Responsibilities of the Continuum of Care (a) (9) of the
HEARTH Act Interim Rule notes that
        In consultation with recipients of Emergency Solutions Grants program funds within the
        geographic area, establish and consistently follow written standards for providing
        Continuum of Care assistance. At a minimum, these written standards must include:
                Policies and procedures for evaluating individuals’ and families’ eligibility for
                 assistance under this part;
                Policies and procedures for determining and prioritizing which eligible individuals
                 and families will receive rapid rehousing assistance;
                Standards for determining what percentage or amount of rent each program
                 participant must pay while receiving rapid rehousing assistance;
Rapid rehousing is considered permanent housing. HUD’s regulatory definition of “permanent
housing” states:
        “The term ‘permanent housing’ means community-based housing without a designated
        length of stay, and includes both permanent supportive housing and rapid re-housing.”
HUD also states
        “Additionally, in the regulatory definition of “permanent housing,” HUD clarifies that to be
        permanent housing, “the program participant must be the tenant on a lease for a term of at
        least one year that is renewable and is terminable only for cause. The lease must be
        renewable for terms that are a minimum of one month long. HUD has determined that
        requiring a lease for a term of at least one year that is renewable and terminable only for
        cause, assists program participants in obtaining stability in housing, even when the rental
        assistance is temporary. These requirements are consistent with Section 8 requirements.”
Types of rapid rehousing assistance include:
       Rental assistance;
       Case management;
       Supportive services;
       security deposits.
        B. Eligible Clients
Eligible clients must meet HUD’s Category 1 definition of homelessness which is:
Individuals and families who lack a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence:
                                                                                                  12

       An individual or family with a primary nighttime residence that is a public or private place
        not designed for or ordinarily used as a regular sleeping accommodation for human
        beings, including a car, park, abandoned building, bus or train station, etc.
       An individual or family living in a supervised publicly or privately operated shelter
        designated to provide temporary living arrangements (including congregate shelters,
        transitional housing, and hotels and motels paid for by charitable organizations or by
        federal, state, or local government programs for low income individuals); or
       An individual who is exiting an institution where he or she resided for 90 days or less and
        who resided in an emergency shelter or place not meant for human habitation
        immediately before entering that institution.
For information on HUD’s other homeless categories, eligible for other CoC funds, visit:
www.onecpd.info/resources/documents/HEARTH_HomelessDefinition_FinalRule.pdf
Eligible clients must also meet eligibility criteria as defined in the NOFA under which the program
was funded.
        C. Prioritizing Rapid Rehousing
Recently, HUD provided guidance for rapid rehousing in terms of prioritizing subpopulations.
HUD noted in a SNAPS In Foucs: Rapid Re-Housing As a Model and Best Practice, August 6, 2014,
that
        “Rapid re-housing can be effective for many populations, such as families with children,
        youth aging out of foster care, domestic violence survivors, single adults, and veterans,
        but should be targeted to those households that would not be able to get out of
        homelessness without the assistance. It is particularly a key strategy for achieving the
        Opening Doors goal of ending family, youth, and child homelessness by 2020.
        Rapid re-housing should prioritize people with more challenges, including those with no
        income, poor employment prospects, troubled rental histories, and criminal records.
        Providers should link participants with community resources that will help them achieve
        longer-term stability and well-being. Now is the time for communities to be working
        together to establish written standards for administering rapid re-housing and thinking
        strategically about how this type of assistance will be used most effectively within the
        CoC.”
Recently, HUD also noted on www.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/Rapid-Re-Housing-
Brief.pdf that
        “Rapid re-housing is an effective intervention for many different types of households
        experiencing homelessness, including those with no income, with disabilities, and with
        poor rental history. The majority of households experiencing homelessness are good
        candidates for rapid re-housing. The only exceptions are households that can exit
                                                                                                  13

       homelessness with little or no assistance, those who experience chronic homelessness
       and who need permanent supportive housing, and households who are seeking a
       therapeutic residential environment, including those recovering from addiction.”
Thus, the Merced CoC will prioritize the following subpopulations:
      families with children;
      youth aging out of foster care;
      domestic violence survivors;
      single adults;
      and veterans
that can exit homelessness with little or no assistance, those who experience chronic
homelessness and who need permanent supportive housing, and households who are seeking a
therapeutic residential environment, including those recovering from addiction.
       D. Written Standards
Written Standard #1: Lease Agreement
      The program participant must be the tenant on a lease for a term of at least one year that
       is renewable and is terminable only for cause. The lease must be renewable for terms that
       are a minimum of one month long.
On page 12 of the Preamble of the HEARTH Act Interim Rule,
       “HUD clarifies that to be permanent housing, “the program participant must be the tenant
       on a lease for a term of at least one year that is renewable and is terminable only for cause.
       The lease must be renewable for terms that are a minimum of one month long. HUD has
       determined that requiring a lease for a term of at least one year that is renewable and
       terminable only for cause, assists program participants in obtaining stability in housing, even
       when the rental assistance is temporary. These requirements are consistent with Section 8
       requirements.”
Written Standard #2: Rental Assistance
      Program participants may receive short-term (up to 3 months) and/or medium-term
       (for 3 to 24 months) tenant-based rental assistance
§ 578.37 Program components and uses of assistance (a) (1) (ii) states that
       “Continuum of Care funds may provide supportive services, as set forth in § 578.53, and/or
       short-term (up to 3 months) and/or medium-term (for 3 to 24 months) tenant-based rental
       assistance, as set forth in § 578.51(c), as necessary to help a homeless individual or family,
                                                                                                    14

       with or without disabilities, move as quickly as possible into permanent housing and achieve
       stability in that housing.”
Written Standard #3: Amount of Rental Assistance
      Standards for determining the share of rent and utilities costs that each program
       participant must pay, if any, will be based on the following guidelines:
            o The maximum amount of rent that a participant will pay can be up to 100% of
                the rental amount;
            o The maximum percentage of income paid by participants towards rent at
                program completion shall be no more than 50%. However, in certain
                circumstances, on a case-by-case basis, there may be participants whose rental
                share may exceed 50% of the rent based on their financial circumstances. In
                general, the goal will be that participants pay generally no more than 50% of
                their income in rent;
            o 100% of the cost of rent in rental assistance may be provided to program
                participants. However to maximize the number of households that can be served
                with rapid re-housing resources, it is expected that the level of need will be
                based on the goal of providing only what is necessary for each household to be
                stably housed for the long term;
            o Rental assistance cannot be provided for a unit unless the rent for that unit is at
                or below the Fair Market Rent limit, established by HUD;
            o The rent charged for a unit must be reasonable in relation to rents currently
                being charged for comparable units in the private unassisted market and must
                not be in excess of rents currently being charged by the owner for comparable
                unassisted units.
§ 578.37 Program components and uses of assistance (a) (1) (ii) (F) states that a Continuum of Care
       “May set a maximum amount or percentage of rental assistance that a program
       participant may receive, a maximum number of months that a program participant may
       receive rental assistance, and/or a maximum number of times that a program participant
       may receive rental assistance. The recipient or subrecipient may also require program
       participants to share in the costs of rent. For the purposes of calculating rent for rapid
       rehousing, the rent shall equal the sum of the total monthly rent for the unit and, if the
       tenant pays separately for utilities, the monthly allowance for utilities (excluding
       telephone) established by the public housing authority for the area in which the housing
       is located.”
Written Standard #4: Duration of Assistance
                                                                                                  15

      Program participants may receive up to 24 months of rental assistance. However, it is
       expected that program participants will only receive the level of assistance necessary
       to be stably housed for the long-term.
§ 578.37 Program components and uses of assistance (a) (1) (ii) states that
       “Continuum of Care funds may provide supportive services, as set forth in § 578.53, and/or
       short-term (up to 3 months) and/or medium-term (for 3 to 24 months) tenant-based rental
       assistance, as set forth in § 578.51(c), as necessary to help a homeless individual or family,
       with or without disabilities, move as quickly as possible into permanent housing and achieve
       stability in that housing.”
Written Standard #5: Security Deposits including Last Month’s Rent
      Program participants may receive funds for security deposits in an amount not to exceed
       2 months of rent.
§ 578.51 Rental assistance (a) (2) states that
       “Grant funds may be used for security deposits in an amount not to exceed 2 months of
       rent. An advance payment of the last month’s rent may be provided to the landlord, in
       addition to the security deposit and payment of first month’s rent.”
Written Standard #6: Receiving Rental Assistance through Other Sources
      Rental assistance cannot be provided to a program participant who is already receiving
       rental assistance, or living in a housing unit receiving rental assistance or operating
       assistance through other federal, State, or local sources.
§ 578.51 Rental assistance (a) Use states that
       “Grant funds may be used for rental assistance for homeless individuals and families.
       Rental assistance cannot be provided to a program participant who is already receiving
       rental assistance, or living in a housing unit receiving rental assistance or operating
       assistance through other federal, State, or local sources.”
Written Standard #7: Case Management
      Program participants must meet with a case manager not less than once per month to assist
       the program participant in ensuring long-term housing stability.
§ 578.37 Program components and uses of assistance (a) (1) (ii) (F) states the following requirement
                                                                                                  16

        “Require the program participant to meet with a case manager not less than once per
        month to assist the program participant in ensuring long-term housing stability. The
        project is exempt from this requirement if the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (42
        U.S.C. 13925 et seq.) or the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act (42 U.S.C. 10401
        et seq.) prohibits the recipient carrying out the project from making its housing
        conditional on the participant’s acceptance of services.”
Written Standard #8: Supportive Services
       Program participants may receive supportive services as set forth in § 578.53 (see
        Appendix A)
§ 578.37 Program components and uses of assistance (a) (1) (ii) states that
        “Continuum of Care funds may provide supportive services, as set forth in § 578.53, and/or
        short-term (up to 3 months) and/or medium-term (for 3 to 24 months) tenant-based rental
        assistance, as set forth in § 578.51(c), as necessary to help a homeless individual or family,
        with or without disabilities, move as quickly as possible into permanent housing and achieve
        stability in that housing.”
Written Standard #9: Duration of Supportive Services
       Program participants may receive supportive services for no longer than 6 months after
        rental assistance stops
§ 578.37 Program components and uses of assistance (a) (1) (ii) (F) states that the Continuum of Care
“May provide supportive services for no longer than 6 months after rental assistance stops.”
Written Standard #10: Re-evaluation
       Program participants must be re-evaluated, not less than once annually, in order to
        determine whether program participants lack sufficient resources and support
        networks necessary to retain housing without Continuum of Care assistance and the
        types and amounts of assistance that the program participant needs to retain housing.
§ 578.37 Program components and uses of assistance (a) (1) (ii) (E) states that the Continuum of
Care
“Must re-evaluate, not less than once annually, that the program participant lacks sufficient
resources and support networks necessary to retain housing without Continuum of Care
assistance and the types and amounts of assistance that the program participant needs to retain
housing. The recipient or subrecipient may require each program participant receiving assistance
to notify the recipient or subrecipient of changes in the program participant’s income or other
circumstances (e.g., changes in household composition) that affect the program participant's
                                                                                                   17

need for assistance. When notified of a relevant change, the recipient or subrecipient must
reevaluate the program participant’s eligibility and the amount and types of assistance that the
program participant needs.”
III. Determining Written Standards for Transitional Housing
        A. Background Information
This section proposes written standards for transitional housing based upon information
provided in the HEARTH Act.
Under § 578.3 Definitions of the HEARTH Act, the following is stated:
        “Transitional housing means housing, where all program participants have signed a lease
        or occupancy agreement, the purpose of which is to facilitate the movement of homeless
        individuals and families into permanent housing within 24 months or such longer period
        as HUD determines necessary. The program participant must have a lease or occupancy
        agreement for a term of at least one month that ends in 24 months and cannot be
        extended.”
        B. Eligible Clients
Eligible clients must meet HUD’s Category 1 definition of homelessness which is:
Individuals and families who lack a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence:
       An individual or family with a primary nighttime residence that is a public or private place
        not designed for or ordinarily used as a regular sleeping accommodation for human
        beings, including a car, park, abandoned building, bus or train station, etc.
       An individual or family living in a supervised publicly or privately operated shelter
        designated to provide temporary living arrangements (including congregate shelters,
        transitional housing, and hotels and motels paid for by charitable organizations or by
        federal, state, or local government programs for low income individuals); or
       An individual who is exiting an institution where he or she resided for 90 days or less and
        who resided in an emergency shelter or place not meant for human habitation
        immediately before entering that institution.
For information on HUD’s other homeless categories, eligible for other CoC funds, visit:
www.onecpd.info/resources/documents/HEARTH_HomelessDefinition_FinalRule.pdf
Eligible clients must also meet eligibility criteria as defined in the NOFA under which the program
was funded.
                                                                                                  18

          C. Prioritizing Transitional Housing
Domestic violence survivors and youth ages 18 – 24 will be prioritized for transitional housing if
they are not assessed as chronically homeless.2 All chronically homeless individuals and families
will not be served through transitional housing.3 Such households will be served by permanent
supportive housing through a Housing First approach. Also, eligible single veterans and veterans
with families, will be served by permanent supportive housing through the HUD VASH voucher
program or the Supportive Services for Veteran Families program.
          D. Written Standards
Written Standard #1:
The program participant must have a lease or occupancy agreement for a term of at least one
month that ends in 24 months and cannot be extended” unless a “homeless individual or family
may remain in transitional housing for a period longer than 24 months, if permanent housing
for the individual or family has not been located or if the individual or family requires additional
time to prepare for independent living” as noted in § 578.79 Limitation on transitional housing.
Under § 578.51 Rental assistance, (l) Leases (2) Initial lease for transitional housing, the following
is required:
          “Program participants in transitional housing must enter into a lease agreement for a
          term of at least one month. The lease must be automatically renewable upon expiration,
          except on prior notice by either party, up to a maximum term of 24 months.”
Written Standard #2:
2 In the HEARTH Act, chronically homeless is defined as (1) An individual who: (i) Is homeless and lives in a place not
meant for human habitation, a safe haven, or in an emergency shelter; and (ii) Has been homeless and living or
residing in a place not meant for human habitation, a safe haven, or in an emergency shelter continuously for at
least one year or on at least four separate occasions in the last 3 years; and (iii) Can be diagnosed with one or more
of the following conditions: substance use disorder, serious mental illness, developmental disability (as defined in
section 102 of the Developmental Disabilities Assistance Bill of Rights Act of 2000 (42 U.S.C. 15002)), post-traumatic
stress disorder, cognitive impairments resulting from brain injury, or chronic physical illness or disability; (2) An
individual who has been residing in an institutional care facility, including a jail, substance abuse or mental health
treatment facility, hospital, or other similar facility, for fewer than 90 days and met all of the criteria in paragraph
(1) of this definition, before entering that facility; or (3) A family with an adult head of household (or if there is no
adult in the family, a minor head of household) who meets all of the criteria in paragraph (1) of this definition,
including a family whose composition has fluctuated while the head of household has been homeless.

  Chronically homeless households are no longer considered chronically homeless once they become residents of
transitional housing programs. As a result, such households are no longer eligible for permanent supportive housing
programs that are restricted to serve only chronically homeless households. In addition, HUD strongly encourages
permeant supportive housing providers to fill vacant beds with chronically homeless households.
                                                                                                                       19

The lease with program participant “must be automatically renewable upon expiration, except
on prior notice by either party, up to a maximum term of 24 months.”
Under § 578.37 Program components and uses of assistance, subsection (2), transitional housing
is further described in the HEARTH Act as follows:
        “Transitional housing facilitates the movement of homeless individuals and families to PH
        within 24 months of entering TH. Grant funds may be used for acquisition, rehabilitation,
        new construction, leasing, rental assistance, operating costs, and supportive services.”
Written Standard #3:
In order to facilitate the movement of program participants to PH within 24 months of entering
TH, grant funds may be used for all of the following activities: acquisition, rehabilitation, new
construction, leasing, rental assistance, operating costs, and supportive services.
Under § 578.53 Supportive services (b) Duration, the following is also noted:
        (1) “For a transitional housing project, supportive services must be made available to
        residents throughout the duration of their residence in the project.”
        (3) “Services may also be provided to former residents of transitional housing and current
        residents of permanent housing who were homeless in the prior 6 months, for no more
        than 6 months after leaving transitional housing or homelessness, respectively, to assist
        their adjustment to independent living.”
Written Standard #4:
Supportive services must be made available to program participants “throughout the duration
of their residence” and such services “may also be provided to former residents of transitional
housing and current residents of permanent housing who were homeless in the prior 6 months,
for no more than 6 months after leaving transitional housing or homelessness, respectively, to
assist their adjustment to independent living.”
Under § 578.77 Calculating occupancy charges and rent, the following guidelines are provided:
        “(a) Occupancy agreements and leases. Recipients and subrecipients must have signed
        occupancy agreements or leases (or subleases) with program participants residing in
        housing.
        (b) Calculation of occupancy charges. Recipients and subrecipients are not required to
        impose occupancy charges on program participants as a condition of residing in the
        housing. However, if occupancy charges are imposed, they may not exceed the highest
        of:
                                                                                                20

               (1) 30 percent of the family’s monthly adjusted income (adjustment factors
               include the number of people in the family, age of family members, medical
               expenses, and child-care expenses);
               (2) 10 percent of the family’s monthly income; or
               (3) If the family is receiving payments for welfare assistance from a public agency
               and a part of the payments (adjusted in accordance with the family’s actual
               housing costs) is specifically designated by the agency to meet the family’s housing
               costs, the portion of the payments that is designated for housing costs.
               (4) Income. Income must be calculated in accordance with 24 CFR 5.609 and 24
               CFR 5.611(a). Recipients and subrecipients must examine a program participant’s
               income initially, and if there is a change in family composition (e.g., birth of a child)
               or a decrease in the resident’s income during the year, the resident may request
               an interim reexamination, and the occupancy charge will be adjusted
               accordingly.”
Written Standard #5:
Recipients and subrecipients of funding for transitional housing “are not required to impose
occupancy charges on program participants as a condition of residing” in transitional housing.
“However, if occupancy charges are imposed, they may not exceed the highest of:
               (1) 30 percent of the family’s monthly adjusted income (adjustment factors
               include the number of people in the family, age of family members, medical
               expenses, and child-care expenses);
               (2) 10 percent of the family’s monthly income; or
               (3) If the family is receiving payments for welfare assistance from a public agency
               and a part of the payments (adjusted in accordance with the family’s actual
               housing costs) is specifically designated by the agency to meet the family’s
               housing costs, the portion of the payments that is designated for housing costs.
               (4) Income. Income must be calculated in accordance with 24 CFR 5.609 and 24
               CFR 5.611(a). Recipients and subrecipients must examine a program
               participant’s income initially, and if there is a change in family composition (e.g.,
               birth of a child) or a decrease in the resident’s income during the year, the
               resident may request an interim reexamination, and the occupancy charge will
               be adjusted accordingly.
Under § 578.79 Limitation on transitional housing, the following is stated:
       “A homeless individual or family may remain in transitional housing for a period longer
       than 24 months, if permanent housing for the individual or family has not been located
       or if the individual or family requires additional time to prepare for independent living.
                                                                                                     21

         However, HUD may discontinue assistance for a transitional housing project if more than
         half of the homeless individuals or families remain in that project longer than 24 months.”
Written Standard #6:
Assistance for a transitional housing project may be discontinued “if more than half of the
homeless individuals or families remain in that project longer than 24 months.”
As noted on page 1, § 578.7 Responsibilities of the Continuum of Care, subsection (a) Operate
the Continuum of Care (9), states that written standards must also include
         “polices and procedures for determining and prioritizing which eligible individuals and
         families will receive” transitional housing, rapid rehousing, and permanent supportive
         housing assistance.
Prioritizing which eligible individuals and families will receive transitional housing has been the
focus of a few HUD publications during the past few years. On September 18, 2013, “What about
Transitional Housing” was the emphasis of SNAPS Weekly Focus.
         “It is time for CoCs to look at transitional housing programs with a critical eye – look at
         recent research, review each program’s eligibility criteria, analyze outcomes and
         occupancy rates, and make sure the services offered (and paid for) actually match the
         needs of people experiencing homelessness within the CoC. Many transitional housing
         programs may need to change their program design or serve a different population. For
         example, some may need to remove strict eligibility criteria that result in those families
         that really need intensive services being screened out (often resulting in low occupancy).
         In other cases, the best course of action is to reallocate the transitional housing program
         in favor of a more promising model.
         For many years, using HUD funds for transitional housing was the only funding alternative
         for serving families and individuals that did not need permanent supportive housing. With
         rapid re-housing now eligible under both the CoC Program and the Emergency Solutions
         Grants (ESG) program, there is an alternative and promising option for families with low-
         barriers that need shorter interventions. Rapid re-housing can be done with a lower cost
         per household – increasing the total number of households that can be served with the
         same amount of funding. If the majority of households served in your CoC's transitional
         housing are families with lower barriers, you should consider reallocating those projects
         into new rapid re-housing projects for families.
         Similarly, as CoCs move to a more direct Housing First approach, eligible households with
         disabilities that will need long-term assistance likely do not need an interim stay in
         transitional housing. For example, a CoC that has a high number of people in transitional
         housing waiting for placement into permanent supportive housing should consider
         reallocating those transitional housing units into new permanent supportive housing.
                                                                                                   22

We know that there are families and individuals who need more assistance than rapid re-
housing offers but who do not qualify for permanent supportive housing. Transitional
housing should be reserved for those populations that most need that type of
intervention – programs that serve domestic violence survivors and youth and those that
provide substance abuse treatment come to mind first – rather than being used either as
a holding pattern for those that really need permanent supportive housing or those that
need less intensive interventions.”
                                                                                     23

           Things to Remember
            - The Priority Listing ranks the projects in order of priority all new project applications created
           through Reallocation and the Permanent Housing Bonus as well as renewal project applications
           and identifies any project applications rejected by the CoC.
            - Collaborative Applicants are strongly encouraged to list all project applications on the FY2015
           CoC Ranking Tool located on the HUD Exchange to ensure a ranking number is used only once.
           The FY 2015 CoC Ranking Tool will assist the Collaborative Applicant during the ranking
           process among the four Project Listings.
            - Any project applications rejected by the Collaborative Applicant must select the reason for
           rejection.
            - Collaborative Applicants should notify all project applicants no later than 15 days before the
           application deadline regarding whether their project applications will be included as part of the
           CoC Priority Listing submission.
            - If the Collaborative Applicant needs to amend a project for any reason after ranking has been
           completed, the ranking of other projects will not be affected; however, the Collaborative
           Applicant must be sure to rank the amended project once it is returned to the CoC Project Listing
           and verify that the rank number assigned has not been assigned to another project on a different
           Project Listing.
               Only 1 CoC Planning project can be ranked on the CoC Planning Project Listing.
            Only 1 UFA cost project can be ranked on the UFA Cost Project Listing.

              forms. The last field "Remaining Reallocation Balance" should equal '0'. If

              a negative balance remaining, this means that more funds are being
              requested for the new reallocated project(s) than have been reduced or
              eliminated from other eligible renewal projects.

DRAFT INITIAL STUDY #16-11/NEGATIVE DECLARATION FOR THE
2016 HOUSING ELEMENT FOR THE CITY OF MERCED
CHAPTER ONE – INTRODUCTION
 1.1     Purpose and                 The proposed project for which this Initial Study/Negative
         Authority                   Declaration has been prepared is the approval of a Housing
                                     Element of the General Plan for the City of Merced. This
                                     document has been prepared in accordance with the
                                     California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), Public
                                     Resources Code 21000 et. Seq. The City of Merced will act
                                     as the lead agency for this project pursuant to CEQA.
 1.2     Determination               On the basis of the Initial Study it has been determined that
                                     the project will have no significant effect on the
                                     environment. Therefore, a Negative Declaration is proposed
                                     for adoption.

CHAPTER TWO – PROJECT SUMMARY
 2.1     Project Location            The City of Merced is located approximately 104 miles
                                     southeast of Sacramento, 53 miles northwest of Fresno, and
                                     112 miles south of San Francisco, in the Central Valley of
                                     California.
 2.2     Project Description         The proposed project includes the certification and adoption
                                     of the City of Merced’s Housing Element of the General
                                     Plan, 2016. Policies to be adopted under the Housing
                                     Element will include those to facilitate the procurement of
                                     housing and financing, to improve older areas of the town,
                                     to provide assistance for maintenance and construction of
                                     housing units, to diversify available housing, to encourage
                                     reductions in energy usage, and to protect the existing
                                     quality of life. (All development will be in accordance with
                                     General Plan policies and EIR mitigation in the General Plan
                                     EIR and applicable Project EIR’s.) Adoption of the Housing
                                     Element will not include the approval of any specific
                                     projects. A determination has also been made that there is
                                     adequate residential land to accommodate the Regional
                                     Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) and no land use changes
                                     will result from implementation of the element. Further,
                                     when specific actions are undertaken they will receive
                                     environmental review. Projects proposed as a result of the
                                     Element’s adoption will be evaluated for specific impacts
                                     before their approval and development.

The environmental factors checked below would be potentially affected by this project,
involving at least one impact that is a "Potentially Significant Impact" as indicated by the
checklist on the following pages.

DETERMINATION: (To be completed by the Lead Agency)
On the basis of this initial evaluation:
           I find that the proposed project COULD NOT have a significant effect on the
           environment, and a NEGATIVE DECLARATION will be prepared.
           I find that although the proposed project could have a significant effect on the
           environment, there will not be a significant effect in this case because revisions in the
           project have been made by or agreed to by the project proponent. A MITIGATED
           NEGATIVE DECLARATION will be prepared.
           I find that the proposed project MAY have a significant effect on the environment, and
           an ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT is required.
           I find that the proposed project MAY have a "potentially significant impact" or
           "potentially significant unless mitigated" impact on the environment, but at least one
           effect: 1) has been adequately analyzed in an earlier document pursuant to applicable
           legal standards, and 2) has been addressed by mitigation measures based on the earlier
           analysis as described on attached sheets. An ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT

           is required, but it must analyze only the effects that remain to be addressed.
           I find that although the proposed project could have a significant effect on the
           environment, because all potentially significant effects (a) have been analyzed
           adequately in an earlier EIR or NEGATIVE DECLARATION pursuant to applicable
           standards, and (b) have been avoided or mitigated pursuant to that earlier EIR or
           NEGATIVE DECLARATION, including revisions or mitigation measures that are
           imposed upon the proposed project, nothing further is required.
                                                                            April 28, 2016

EVALUATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS:
1)      A brief explanation is required for all answers except "No Impact" answers that are
        adequately supported by the information sources a lead agency cites in the parentheses
        following each question. A "No Impact" answer is adequately supported if the referenced
        information sources show that the impact simply does not apply to projects like the one
        involved (e.g., the project falls outside a fault rupture zone). A "No Impact" answer
        should be explained where it is based on project-specific factors as well as general
        standards (e.g., the project will not expose sensitive receptors to pollutants, based on a
        project-specific screening analysis).
2)      All answers must take account of the whole action involved, including off-site as well as
        on-site, cumulative as well as project-level, indirect as well as direct, and construction as
        well as operational impacts.
3)      Once the lead agency has determined that a particular physical impact may occur, then
        the checklist answers must indicate whether the impact is potentially significant, less than
        significant with mitigation, or less than significant. "Potentially Significant Impact" is
        appropriate if there is substantial evidence that an effect may be significant. If there are
        one or more "Potentially Significant Impact" entries when the determination is made, an
        EIR is required.
4)      "Negative Declaration: Less Than Significant With Mitigation Incorporated" applies
        where the incorporation of mitigation measures has reduced an effect from "Potentially
        Significant Impact" to a "Less Than Significant Impact." The lead agency must describe
        the mitigation measures, and briefly explain how they reduce the effect to a less than

        significant level (mitigation measures from Section 17, "Earlier Analyses," may be cross-
        referenced).
5)      Earlier analyses may be used where, pursuant to the tiering, program EIR, or other CEQA
        process, an effect has been adequately analyzed in an earlier EIR or negative declaration.
        Section 15063(c)(3)(D). In this case, a brief discussion should identify the following:
        a)      Earlier Analysis Used. Identify and state where they are available for review.
        b)      Impacts Adequately Addressed. Identify which effects from the above checklist
                were within the scope of and adequately analyzed in an earlier document pursuant
                to applicable legal standards, and state whether such effects were addressed by
                mitigation measures based on the earlier analysis.
        c)      Mitigation Measures. For effects that are "Less than Significant with Mitigation
                Measures Incorporated," describe the mitigation measures which were
                incorporated or refined from the earlier document and the extent to which they
                address site-specific conditions for the project.
6)      Lead agencies are encouraged to incorporate into the checklist references to information
        sources for potential impacts (e.g., general plans, zoning ordinances). Reference to a
        previously prepared or outside document should, where appropriate, include a reference
        to the page or pages where the statement is substantiated.
7)      Supporting Information Sources: A source list should be attached, and other sources used
        or individuals contacted should be cited in the discussion.
8)      This is only a suggested form, and lead agencies are free to use different formats;
        however, lead agencies should normally address the questions from this checklist that are
        relevant to a project's environmental effects in whatever format is selected.
9)      The explanation of each issue should identify:
        a)      the significance criteria or threshold, if any, used to evaluate each question; and
        b)      the mitigation measure identified, if any, to reduce the impact to less than
                significance

 (1997) prepared by the California Dept.
 of Conservation as an optional model to
 use in assessing impacts on agriculture
 and farmland. Would the project:
 a) Convert Prime Farmland, Unique
 Farmland, or Farmland of Statewide
 Importance (Farmland), as shown on the
 maps prepared pursuant to the Farmland
 Mapping and Monitoring Program of the
 California Resources Agency, to non-
 agricultural use?
 Response: The adoption of the City’s Housing Element will implement policies and programs
 supporting improvements to housing conditions in the city. It will not result in a conversion of
 farmland, a conflict with zoning, or a conversion of agricultural land to non-agricultural use
 beyond that analyzed in the adopted General Plan.
 b) Conflict with existing zoning for
 agricultural use, or a Williamson Act
 contract?
 Response: See Response 2a).
 c) Involve other changes in the existing
 environment which, due to their location
 or nature, could result in conversion of
 Farmland, to non-agricultural use?
 Response: See Response 2a).

 land uses or planned uses for which
 permits have been granted)?
 Response: As indicated in the Housing Element of the General Plan, the City of Merced relies
 on groundwater as its only water supply for the city. Twenty wells with a combined capacity of
 46,500 gallons per minute (gpm) provide the City’s total water supply. The City’s distribution
 system consist of four elevated storage tanks and the piping system. Currently, all wells are
 active production wells. The groundwater basin underlying the City of Merced is part of the
 larger San Joaquin Valley groundwater basin. The District has adequate water supply to meet
 the growing demands over the next twenty years. (Merced Urban Water Management Plan)
 c) Substantially alter the existing
 drainage pattern of the site or area,
 including through the alteration of the
 course of a stream or river, in a manner
 which would result in substantial erosion
 or siltation on- or off-site?
 Response: Adoption of the Housing Element will not result in an alteration of drainage
 patterns. Individual project sites will be assessed according to their potential to alter drainage
 prior to their approval. (Project Description.)
 d) Substantially alter the existing
 drainage pattern of the site or area,
 including through the alteration of the
 course of a stream or river, or
 substantially increase the rate or amount
 of surface runoff in a manner which
 would result in flooding on- or off-site?
 Response: See Response 8c).
 e) Create or contribute runoff water
 which would exceed the capacity of
 existing or planned storm water drainage
 systems or provide substantial additional
 sources of polluted runoff?

                                                            Incorporation
 Response: The City of Merced Housing Element, 2016, included additions to and
 improvements of infrastructure in order to insure the continued availability of storm water
 capacity. The adoption of the Housing Element will not result in an increase of runoff water.
 Individual projects will be assessed for their contribution to excessive and polluted runoff.
 f) Otherwise substantially degrade water
 quality?
 Response: There are no aspects of the proposed project that would conceivably degrade water
 quality. Specific projects proposed after the Element’s adoption will be evaluated for potential
 impacts to water quality. (Project Description.)
 g) Place housing within a 100-year flood
 hazard area as mapped on a federal Flood
 Hazard Boundary or Flood Insurance
 Rate Map or other flood hazard
 delineation map?
 The City’s storm water disposal system is mainly composed of Merced Irrigation District
 (MID) facilities, including water distribution canals and laterals, drains, and natural channels
 that traverse the area. The Draft City of Merced Storm Drain Master Plan, April 2002,
 provides additional information including phasing and priorities and mitigation of storm water
 quality along with proposed locations for detention basins required of new developments.
 Projects proposed as a result of this adoption of the Housing Element will be based on their
 location in these areas and the construction limitations associated with the areas.
 h) Place within a 100-year flood hazard
 area structures which would impede or
 redirect flood flows?
 Response: See Response 8g).
 i) Expose people or structures to a
 significant risk of loss, injury or death
 involving flooding, including flooding as
 a result of the failure of a levee or dam?
 Response: See Response 8g).

 j) Inundation by seiche, tsunami, or
 mudflow?
 Response: Two major categories of flooding hazard affect the City of Merced. The greatest
 risk is from storm runoff, particularly in the urban areas located within the Merced floodplain.
 The second hazard is the remote risk of failure of one of the local or adjacent counties’ dams.
 Impacts from dam failure could affect virtually every urban area within the City.
 Each project or building permit is now reviewed under the City’s “Flood Damage Prevention
 Ordinance” (Section 17.48 of the Merced Municipal Code) to ensure that new construction in
 these areas is properly designed to minimize hazard to life and property.
 9. LAND USE AND PLANNING -
 Would the project:
 a) Physically divide an established
 community?
 Response: The Housing Element proposes to adopt plans and policies to improve existing
 housing quality, to construct new housing, to increase housing affordability and availability,
 and to reduce energy consumption. Adoption and implementation of these plans will not result
 in the division of an existing subdivision. (Project Description.)
 b) Conflict with any applicable land use
 plan, policy, or regulation of an agency
 with jurisdiction over the project
 (including, but not limited to the general
 plan, specific plan, local coastal
 program, or zoning ordinance) adopted
 for the purpose of avoiding or mitigating
 an environmental effect?
 Response: The proposed Housing Element upholds the policies set forth in the General Plan
 and therefore will not interfere with other plans or policies. (General Plan.)
 c) Conflict with any applicable habitat
 conservation plan or natural community
 conservation plan?
City of Merced                                                                          May 2016

                                                           Incorporation
 Response: The City’s Housing Element is in compliance with the General Plan and will not
 conflict with a habitat or natural community conservation plan.)
 10. MINERAL RESOURCES -- Would
 the project:
 a) Result in the loss of availability of a
 known mineral resource that would be of
 value to the region and the residents of
 the state?
 Response: Adoption of the Element’s plans and policies for improving existing housing
 conditions, reducing energy consumption, and making information and housing assistance
 readily available will not affect any mineral resources. Projects proposed as a result of the
 Element’s adoption will be evaluated for the presence of mineral resources and recovery sites
 on the project site. (Project Description.)
 b) Result in the loss of availability of a
 locally-important mineral resource
 recovery site delineated on a local
 general plan, specific plan or other land
 use plan?
 Response: See Response 10a).
 11. NOISE Would the project result in:
 a) Exposure of persons to or generation
 of noise levels in excess of standards
 established in the local general plan or
 noise ordinance, or applicable standards
 of other agencies?
 Response: The Housing Element is in compliance with the General Plan and proposes to
 improve existing housing and living conditions in the City. Individual projects will be assessed
 according to the policies set forth in the General Plan concerning their compatibility and
 environmental effects on surrounding land uses. Thus, conflicts of land uses resulting in
 increased ambient noise levels will be minimal. (Project Description.)

 12. POPULATION AND HOUSING --
 Would the project:
 a) Induce substantial population growth
 in an area, either directly (for example,
 by proposing new homes and businesses)
 or indirectly (for example, through
 extension of roads or other
 infrastructure)?
 Response: Adoption of the policies will support improvements to existing housing, and the
 provision of housing to accommodate the expected population growth, and will not induce
 substantial unpredicted population growth. (Project Description.)
 b) Displace substantial numbers of
 existing housing, necessitating the
 construction of replacement housing
 elsewhere?
 Response: The proposed project includes plans for improving housing conditions and will not
 result in the displacement of housing or people. (Project Description.)
 c) Displace substantial numbers of
 people, necessitating the construction of
 replacement housing elsewhere?
 Response: See Response 12b).

          Police protection?
          Schools?
          Parks?
          Other public facilities?
 Response: The City’s law enforcement is provided by the City of Merced Police Department,
 and its fire protection is provided through the City of Merced Fire Department, using the
 Central Station concept. The City’s public schools are operated by school districts, which are
 autonomous governmental agencies separate from the City. They have their own elected
 officials and source of funding. Merced College, one of the California community colleges,
 provides educational development to the Merced County residents. The plans to be adopted
 include those to improve housing conditions and economics of the City. Land is currently
 available for the construction of new schools, and law enforcement and fire protection are
 sufficient in the City and supporting areas to protect the projected growth with the addition of
 new facilities as needed. (City of Merced Vision 2030 General Plan.)
 14. RECREATION --
 a) Would the project increase the use of
 existing neighborhood and regional parks
 or other recreational facilities such that
 substantial physical deterioration of the
 facility would occur or be accelerated?
 Response: Local recreational facilities in the City of Merced include regional parks,
 community parks, neighborhood parks, greenways/bikeways, and mini parks. Adoption of the
 City’s Housing Element will not affect the use of or demand for existing recreational facilities.
 Specific projects proposed after the Element’s adoption will be evaluated with respect to their
 effect on recreational facilities. (City of Merced Vision 2030 Plan.)
 b) Does the project include recreational
 facilities or require the construction or
 expansion of recreational facilities which
 might have an adverse physical effect on

 Response: There are no recreational facilities included in the proposed project. (Project
 Description.)
 15. TRANSPORTATION/TRAFFIC --
 Would the project:
 a) Cause an increase in traffic which is
 substantial in relation to the existing
 traffic load and capacity of the street
 system (i.e., result in a substantial
 increase in either the number of vehicle
 trips, the volume to capacity ratio on
 roads, or congestion at intersections)?
 Response: The City’s street system is developed around a one-mile grid system of a major
 north-south roadways which include Highway 59, “R” Street, “G” Street and Parsons Avenue.
 This north-south network distributes traffic throughout the community. East-west arterials
 carry traffic to convenient north-south major arterials on expressway connection for access to
 community destinations, or to Highway 99 and regional destinations.
 Plans and studies are underway that would provide adequate roadways to accommodate the
 growth. (City of Merced Vision 2030 General Plan.)
 b) Exceed, either individually or
 cumulatively, a level of service standard
 established by the county congestion
 management agency for designated roads
 or highways?
 Response: See Response 15a).
 c) Result in a change in air traffic
 patterns, including either an increase in
 traffic levels or a change in location that
 results in substantial safety risks?

 d) Substantially increase hazards due to a
 design feature (e.g., sharp curves or
 dangerous intersections) or incompatible
 uses (e.g., farm equipment)?
 Response: The proposed project is for the adoption of plans and policies to improve housing
 conditions. There will be no redesign of roadways to introduce dangerous features. (Project
 Description.)
 e) Result in inadequate emergency
 access?
 Response: Accessibility will not be affected by the Element’s plans supporting housing
 improvements as there are no changes in road design or layout involved in the project.
 (Project Description.)
 f) Result in inadequate parking capacity?
 Response: Adoption of the plans supporting housing improvements will not result in
 inadequate parking capacity. (Project Description.)
 g) Conflict with adopted policies, plans,
 or programs supporting alternative
 transportation (e.g., bus turnouts, bicycle
 racks)?
 Response: The Element’s plans for improvements to housing, financing, and energy
 consumption will not interfere with any alternative transportation plans. (Project
 Description.)

 Response: The design capacity of the City’s wastewater treatment plant is 12 million gallons
 per day (M&D). This facility, located in the southwest part of the City about two miles south
 of the airport, can be expanded and upgraded to meet the City’s needs. The City has plans to
 expand its wastewater treatment plant as growth occurs. This expansion is expected to serve
 the projected SOI population of 150,000 as well as new businesses and industries. Therefore,
 implementation of the Element’s plans and policies will not exceed the capacity of wastewater
 treatment facilities or requirements. (Final EIR, Merced Vision 2030 General Plan.)
 b) Require or result in the construction of
 new water or wastewater treatment
 facilities or expansion of existing
 facilities, the construction of which could
 cause significant environmental effects?
 Response: See Responses 16a) and 16c).
 c) Require or result in the construction of
 new storm water drainage facilities or
 expansion of existing facilities, the
 construction of which could cause
 significant environmental effects?
 Response: Merced’s Vision 2030 General Plan EIR indicates several measures, including
 diversion structures, retention basins, and other crossings and culverts that provide a
 reduction of the impacts of storm water flow. Merced’s Vision 2030 General Plan EIR holds as
 one of its policies the improvement of infrastructure within the City for the better handling of
 storm water flows. Thus, there is adequate capacity of the City’s storm water drainage system
 to handle additional flows resulting from the Housing Element’s adoption and implementation.
 (City of Merced Vision 2030 Plan.)
 d) Have sufficient water supplies
 available to serve the project from
 existing entitlements and resources, or
 are new or expanded entitlements
 needed?
 Response: See Response 8a) and 8b).

 e) Result in a determination by the
 wastewater treatment provider which
 serves or may serve the project that it has
 adequate capacity to serve the project’s
 projected demand in addition to the
 provider’s existing commitments?
 Response: See Response 16a).
 f) Be served by a landfill with sufficient
 permitted capacity to accommodate the
 project’s solid waste disposal needs?
 Response: The City of Merced is served by the Highway 59 landfill, which is operated by the
 County. The County of Merced has expanded its operation with an additional 91 acres, and
 124 acres set aside for future growth. This has produced a thirty year landfill capacity. The
 proposed project will not result in the creation of solid waste. Individual projects proposed
 after the Element’s adoption will be evaluated based on their potential for creation of solid
 waste. (City of Merced Vision 2030 General Plan.)
 g) Comply with federal, state, and local
 statutes and regulations related to solid
 waste?
 Response: See Response 16f).
 17. MANDATORY FINDINGS OF
 SIGNIFICANCE --
 a) Does the project have the potential to
 degrade the quality of the environment,
 substantially reduce the habitat of a fish
 or wildlife species, cause a fish or
 wildlife population to drop below self-
 sustaining levels, threaten to eliminate a
 plant or animal community, reduce the
 number or restrict the range of a rare or
 endangered plant or animal or eliminate
 important examples of the major periods

 of California history or prehistory?
 Response: The adoption of the City’s Housing Element will have no effect on the environment
 through the reduction of habitat or impacts to biological resources. Individual projects
 proposed as a result of the Element’s adoption will be assessed for their potential impacts to
 biological resources prior to approval. (Project Description.)
 b) Does the project have impacts that are
 individually limited, but cumulatively
 considerable? ("Cumulatively
 Considerable" means that the
 incremental effects of a project are
 considerable when viewed in connection
 with the effects of past projects, the
 effects of other current projects, and the
 effects of probable future projects?)
 Response: The adoption of the City’s Housing Element will result in the eventual approval of
 projects for improvements to existing housing, construction of new housing, improvements to
 accessibility of housing and financing, reduction of energy usage, and creation of a population
 and housing database. According to the City’s General Plan and Conservation Element,
 existing infrastructure is sufficient to accommodate the predicted growth. Specific projects
 proposed as a result of the Element’s adoption will be assessed based on their potential
 impacts to services and conditions of the City.
 c) Does the project have environmental
 effects that will cause substantial adverse
 effects on human beings, either directly
 or indirectly?
 Response: The project will result in the adoption of plans to improve the living conditions of
 the citizens of Merced and will not result in any adverse impacts to human beings. (Project
 Description.)
 18. GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS -
 a) Would the project generate
 greenhouse gas emission, either directly
 or indirectly, that may have a significant
 impact on the environment?

 Response:
 The issue of project-generated Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions is a reflection of the larger
 concern of Global Climate Change. While GHG emissions can be evaluated on a project level,
 overall, the issue reflects a more regional or global concern. CEQA requires all projects to
 discuss a project’s GHG contributions. However, from the standpoint of CEQA, GHG impacts
 on global climate change are inherently cumulative. The quantity of GHGs that it takes to
 ultimately result in climate change is not precisely known; however, it can safely be assumed
 that existing conditions do not measurably contribute to a noticeable incremental change in
 the global climate.
 The adoption of the City’s Housing Element would not result in immediate construction of a
 project, and will therefore, not generate greenhouse gas emissions, either directly or
 indirectly. Individual projects proposed as a result of the Element’s adoption will be assessed
 for their potential impacts to greenhouse gas emissions prior to approval. (Project
 Description.)
 b) Would the project conflict with an
 applicable plan, policy, or regulation
 adopted for the purpose of reducing the
 emissions of greenhouse gases??
 Response: The adoption of the City’s Housing Element will result in the eventual approval of
 projects for improvements to existing housing, construction of new housing, improvements to
 accessibility of housing and financing, reduction of energy usage, and creation of a population
 and housing database. The proposed Housing Element would not conflict with an applicable
 plan, policy, or regulation adopted for the purpose of reducing the emissions of greenhouse
 gases. Future construction based on the Housing Element would be subject to further
 environmental review prior to construction.
