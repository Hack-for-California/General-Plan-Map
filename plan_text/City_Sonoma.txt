recreation, an optional topic. Because issues in So-
noma associated with open space, conservation, and
recreation are interwoven, they are combined in this
section of the General Plan. The high value placed on
environmental resources in and around Sonoma pro-
vides the foundation for the goals, policies and imple-
mentation measures in the Environmental Resources
Element. The following objectives related to environ-
mental issues have been expressed consistently by the
community during the General Plan update process:

   maintaining the agricultural greenbelt surrounding
   the city. Other policies and implementation measures
   in this element seek to preserve open space and ag-
   riculture and regulate hillside development—means
   by which the long-term maintenance of the greenbelt
   may be accomplished.
   Open Space
   Open space includes land in a variety of categories.
   In Sonoma, open space is composed of agricultural
   land, hillsides, creeks, riparian corridors, parks, and
   small pockets of land with less intensive uses, includ-
   ing small vineyard, garden, grazing, and horse pas-
   ture areas. Much of the open space outside the city
   consists of larger parcels in agricultural use. Although
   these lands, along with most of the hillsides viewed     Fryer Creek, at West MacArthur Street
   from Sonoma, are not within the City’s jurisdiction,
   they are of primary importance because they pro-         private and public open space, and cooperating in

   means of reducing the number of vehicle trips on the
