Auburn
The Setting
H Police Station/Civic Center
jM^ajestic views of the American River Canyon, vistas of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, wooded hills and ravines, and streams winding through small valleys characterize the site of the City of Auburn. From its origins in the 1850s, Auburn has emerged as a community of strong historic character, yet serves as a growing economic center.

1	he older homes along tree-lined streets evokememories of an earlier era. The styles of the late 1800s and early decades of the 1900s are represented. Modified Victorian, Eastlake, Queen
Ann/Eastlake,
Craftsman and California Bungalow architectural styles are found in the older areas of town.
Auburn Neighborhoods
9{pvemfar 3, 1993
H Episcopal Church
Landmark buildings from the past provide a sense of permanency-the County Courthouse rises over a part of the City as a sentinel of government and order. The old Episcopal Church on Orange Street, and the Catholic Church on Lincoln Way are reminders of more gentle times.
r

■ Old Town
ife Old Town shops and restaurants provide a focal point for Auburn's turn of the century character. Narrow sidewalks, old facades, the steep steps up to Lawyers Row, and the historic Courthouse, all provide a glimpse into the past.
A visit to the center of downtown, at the intersection of Lincoln Way and High Street, is to experience a circa 1930 commercial place. The old Masonic Hall, mercantile buildings and small store fronts around this triangle intersection provide a backdrop of an earlier time.

■ Bernhard Museum
Images captured along Auburn-Folsom Road through the center of Auburn are those of trees, vistas and a winery. The Bernhard Home - now a museum - and its long white picket fence set the tone for this central area of Auburn. The tree-shaded areas of Recreation Park, the view to the north over the Auburn Ravine watershed, and houses on hills in the distance are all the essence of the area.
[PlacerHigh School
The discovery of gold in 1848 in a ravine in the center of what is now Old Town led to the Anglo settlement in Auburn. The town gradually shifted from miners to lawyers, bankers and shopkeepers.
Through the early decades of the 1900s,
Auburn served as a place of growing commerce, a gov-
ernment seat, home of Placer High School and a service center for travelers. As the foothills began to be populated, services along the old Highway 40 (now Interstate 80) and Highway 49 expanded. The foothill environs of Auburn have grown steadily in the last few decades. Today, Auburn is the center of a large resident and commuter population.

Highway 49, passing through the center of Auburn, is California's famous mother lode route. The Southern Pacific Railroad traverses the older area of Auburn from the northeast to southwest. Interstate 80 follows a generally similar route, replacing the old Lincoln Way. All three of these remain transcontinental routes.
Auburn offers its residents a quality environment above the fog with clean waters and wooded foothills. Occasional winter snowstorms provide a brief, but spectacular, panorama. One of California's most scenic rivers, the North Pork of the American River, spills out of the Sierra, passing along the edge of Auburn on its way to the Pacific.
H County Courthouse
Auburn is not only an historic community - it is a unique town settled on rugged terrain. Auburn is indeed a sense of place as well as a fine town. The purpose of the General Plan presented in the following chapters is to lead this historic community into the twenty-first century, while preserving all of its graceful ambience, its unique character and its sense of history.

INTRODUCTION
Downtown Auburn
1, TFfo© General Plan
Beginning in 1971, changes in California legislation regarding the role and nature of a general plan have increased its importance significantly. Today a general plan is no longer a "wish list" or an ambiguous vision of the future physical development of a community. The general plan has evolved into a clear guide for rational decision making regarding a city’s or county’s long-term physical development.
The City of Auburn General Plan sets forth the goals and policies that will guide future growth in the Auburn area. The Plan will be used by City staff and City decision makers to review new development in order to ensure that future development will contribute to

9{pvcm£tr 3, 1993

r

retaining and improving the character of Auburn as a unique and readily identifiable foothill community.
The General Plan is a dynamic document because it is based on community values and an understanding of existing and projected conditions and needs, all of which continually change. Any adjustments to the General Plan require an amendment. Local governments may not amend any one of the mandatory elements of the General Plan more than four times in one calendar year {Government Code Section 65358(b). With all amendments, local governments must follow the procedures outlined in Government Code Sections 65350 et seq.
Organization of the General Plan
This Plan is organized into a combination of text, tables, and figures. The plan is presented in eight components referred to as Elements. Each Element is presented in a Chapter, The eight elements are:
Land Use
Circulation
Housing
Open Space/Conservation
Noise
Safely
Economic
Historic
The final chapter of the plan is the implementation program. A glossary is provided to assist the reader. A list of the resource documents and contacts is provided.
Under separate cover, but a part of the General Plan, are the supporting documents and the adopted Master Plans and Specific Plans.
Each element follows a similar format with goals and policies presented first, existing conditions presented next, and future needs or recommendations presented last. The goals and policies are listed first because they provide the vision of the community for which all future actions will be directed and against which all actions are judged. The goals and policies are presented by topic and sequential order, not by order of priority.

Physical Characteristics
The location of the City of Auburn is important in order to understand the relationship between growth and development in the foothill terrain and physical limitations. The City is located on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada Range at elevations between 1*000 and 1,400 feet. Within the city limits, the terrain is relatively gentle but the City is surrounded by several severe constraints to development. To the south, the American River Canyon provides a sharp boundary to urban growth and also an opportunity for regional open space. The Placer County line, a boundary with El Dorado County, is also located within the canyon. The canyon provides a natural boundary to city expansion along a north-south corridor.
Within the City limits and the sphere of influence, oak trees, riparian vegetation, wetlands, creeks, erosive soils, and sensitive wildlife habitats also constrain development. This physical setting is not conducive to many types of urban development. Therefore, the General Plan has developed land use designations with supporting policies to help protect sensitive or hazardous areas and allow for development where it is warranted.
8. Geoeral Pktn Background
This document supersedes the 1978 Auburn General Plan and the 1985 Auburn Housing Element. The plan covers the area within the city limits of Auburn and within a revised sphere of influence, which includes an approximate 4,830-acre increase over the 1979 sphere of influence. Lands within the sphere of influence have been given a land use designation in anticipation that annexation of these lands will occur within the 20-year life span of the plan. Limited land use information within the sphere resulted in single land use designations being applied to large areas. As these areas are annexed, the City will review development plans to provide more specific detail as to the land use designations.
Administration op the General Plan
This General Plan includes implementation programs for each element. Under Government Code Section 65400(b) the City of Auburn Community Development Department is required to report annually to the City Council regarding the status of the General Plan. Therefore, the implementation program has been set up to provide a checklist of the implementation measures. This checklist includes the implementation measure, the responsible agency, and implementation timing. By using the checklist, the Community Development Department will be able to update the City Council on the implementation of the General Plan when requested.

Public Participation
The City recognizes the importance of public participation in formulating a general plan. State law specifies that "During the preparation or amendment of the general plan, the planning agency shall provide opportunities for the involvement of citizens, public agencies, public utility companies, and civic, education, and other community groups, through public hearings and any other means the city or county deems appropriate."
The Auburn General Plan update has utilized a process of community consensus building to create a future vision for the city. Techniques to gain public input have included public workshops, formulation of an advisory committee, newsletters and public hearings. The following text and chart summarizes the process.
Citizens Advisory Committee
A General Plan Citizens Advisory Committee was appointed by the City Council. The committee, composed of eight citizens, two council persons, two planning commissioners, and a representative of the Auburn Recreation District, met regularly to formulate the plan. This committee was responsible for developing the land use alternatives and eventually the draft preferred land use plan.
The committee meetings were open to the public allowing for public comment at the end of each meeting. The committee held 33 meetings, three of which were joint meetings held with the Placer County Auburn/ Bowman Community Plan Citizens Advisory Committee to receive their comments about land uses outside the current city limits. The committee held a public workshop to receive public input on the Historic Element. These meetings were productive and provided valuable information to the committee as they formulated the General Plan
Workshops
The City has conducted public workshops, held joint meetings of the City Council/ Planning Commission, joint meetings with the City Council/Planning Commission/ Citizens Advisory Committee and joint meetings of the Placer County/Auburn Citizen Committees.
The public workshop held on August 29, 1990 with the City Council, Planning Commission, City staff and representatives of the consultant, Harland Bartholomew & Associates focused on the general planning process and goals for the city to be used as the focal point of the plan. Twenty-four goals were formulated as a result of this effort.

Public Hearings
The Planning Commission held nine public hearings on the General Plan. The last six meetings were hearings on the General Plan and EIR The Planning Commission, by Resolution, forwarded the General Plan, with recommended modifications, to the City Council on June 1, 1993.
The City Council held six public hearings on the General Plan and EIR. Ihe EIR was certified and General Plan adopted on November 29, 1993 by the City Council. The hearings held on the General Plan are summarized on the previous page.
Newsletters
The City of Auburn in conjunction with Placer County prepared several newsletters to inform citizens of the General Plan progress. These newsletters contained schedules and articles on the preparation of the General Plan and informed readers of future important dates for meetings or public hearings.
4, Amendments to the General Plan
At least once every five years, each local planning agency should thoroughly review its entire general plan and revise the document as necessary. State law actually requires every city and county to evaluate its housing element as frequently as necessary and to revise the element, as appropriate, no less than every five years.
Local governments may not amend any one of the mandatory elements of the general plan more than four times in one calendar year (Government Code Section 65358(b)). However, this limitation does not apply to:
(1)	optional elements:
(2)	amendments requested and necessary for affordable housing (Government Code Section 65358(c));
(3)	any amendment necessary to comply with a court decision in a case involving the legal adequacy of the general Plan (Government Code Section 65358(d)(1));
(4)	amendments after January 1, 1984, to bring a general plan into compliance with an airport land use plan (Government Code Section 65302.3);
(5)	amendments needed in connection with adoption of a comprehensive development plan under the Urban Development Incentive Act (Health and Safety Code Section 56302(d)); or

Government Code Section 65358(b) provides that each amendment may include more than one change to the general plan. Earlier case law has established that each of the permitted amendments within a calendar year can encompass several different changes (Karlson v. City of Camanllo(lQ80} 100 Cal.App.3d789.

1.	Assumptions
The following assumptions were used by the consultant and the Citizens Advisory Committee during the development of the General Plan:
1 „	Residents often locate in Auburn because of its small-town atmosphere and rural
environment.
2.	Auburn will grow at a moderate rate.
3.	Significant growth will occur outside of the current city limits.

9i(pvem£er 3, 1333
flf-l

4.	Single-family residential development will continue to be dominant, with some increases in multi-family development.
5.	Higher densities will locate where urban services are available.
6.	Automobile transportation will be dominant.
7.	The Highway 49 corridor, Downtown Auburn, Old Town Auburn, and the Interstate 80/Lincoln Way area will be the primary commercial centers of the City.
8.	Some public service and facility improvements are needed for existing Auburn residents.
9.	New growth will increase demands for public services and facilities.
10.	Growth in the area will require the conversion/use of natural resources—land, water, and habitat.
11.	There is insufficient information on the Auburn Dam and Route 102 for a determination to be made as to their affect on the General Plan.
2,	Hssucs
The General Plan is intended to address the following issues:
1.	Highway 49 bypass location or route segments.
2.	Annexation of areas to the north, east on Interstate 80, and to the south.
3.	Residential density and zoning changes—transfer of density and multi-family tradeoffs.
4.	Opposition to high-density housing.
5.	Equity immigrants, those persons who sell their homes at a high price in one region and buy more house for less money in another region, impact affordable housing. (Opportunities for builders lie in upscale housing.)
6.	Preservation and demolition of historic buildings and sites.
7.	Need for major shopping facilities.
8.	Industrial development.
9.	The provision of sewer, water, police, fire, ambulance, educational, and recreational services to new residences.

12.11 It is the policy of the City that the individual school district’s facilities master plans, financing plans, and other adopted facility guidelines are utilized as a guide to the City’s school related policies and issues.
S, feMtog Conditions
Auburn is located on terrain that places significant constraints on urban development. Development on the rolling Sierra Foothills requires considerable site preparation for most types of urban uses. Growth to the southeast is prevented by the American River Canyon. Rugged terrain limits growth to the south and west. Thus, the Auburn community has expanded to the north and northeast, taking advantage of access provided by Highway 49 and Interstate 80 (Figure IV-1). Table IV-1 summarizes the amount of land covered by this plan.
TABLE TV-1 PLANNING AREA SIZE

Proposed Sphere of Influence	17,700	27.7
SOURCE: Harland Bartholomew & Associates, Inc.		
There are major physical limitations on growth and development in the Auburn area. Man-made limitations such as Interstate 80 and the railroad tracks limit access or restrict urban uses. The Auburn Airport limits high-density residential, but has encouraged industrial development. The topography requires significant grading. There are additional environmental constraints such as wetlands, riparian habitat, erosive soils, and high fire hazards. These constraints affect the density and type of urban development that can occur. A detailed discussion of the constraints is contained in the Open Space and Conservation Element.
Existing Land Use Pattern
The City limits, in 1992, include 4,830 acres. Due to the City’s terrain, over half of the area is vacant and undeveloped. A survey of existing land uses conducted as a part of the General Plan Update indicates that a total of 1,880 acres are used for urban uses as shown in Table IV-2.

SOURCE: Harland Bartholomew & Associates, Inc,		
Although 61 percent of land within the Auburn City limits is considered vacant, the developable land potential is relatively small due to development constraints such as topography and difficulty in access. It has been estimated that the buildout of remaining residential land in the city would result in the addition of approximately 13,000 people.
Residential uses are the predominant land uses in the City of Auburn, with the highest percentage being single family residential.
Commercial uses in Auburn are concentrated in several major areas including: Downtown Auburn, Old Town, the Highway 49 corridor, and the Aubum/Bowman area along Interstate 80. Auburn is atypical in that commercial is not scattered throughout the Ciiy as it is in many communities.
Auburn’s industrial areas are also concentrated, with industrial uses occurring along Borland Avenue adjacent to the railroad tracks, at the Auburn Airport Industrial Park, along Nevada Street adjacent to the railroad tracks and along Sacramento Street adjacent to the railroad tracks.
Airport
The airport, which is an important transportation facility for the Auburn area, also provides for a large part of Auburn’s industrial land. This land use should be maintained given the need for additional industrial development in Auburn. In order to protect the airport and the industrial land around it, the land use requirements of the airport’s Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUP) should be followed.

Schools
The school districts serving the Auburn area maintain Facility Master Plans, financial plans, and guidelines. Please refer to the General Plan Supporting Documentation and Master Plans/Specific Plans.
The Auburn area has the following school districts:
•	Auburn Union School District
•	Placer Union High School District
•	Ackerman Elementary School District
Table IV-3 displays each district’s student enrollment and capacity.

As Table IV-3 shows, Auburn area school districts are currently above their student capacities. Additional school facilities are required to meet the growing demand. According to the Placer County Office of Education the following school facilities will be needed over the next five to fifteen years:
•	Auburn Union School District--Four school sites:
•	Ackerman Elementary School District—One school site: and
•	Placer Union High School District-Two school sites.
These additional school sites are required to meet growing demand. State law requires that new schools not be located within a two-mile radius of the airport. School sites are also constrained by railroads, natural gas lines, major power lines, topography, Highway 49 and Interstate 80. These constraints limit opportunities in the Auburn Area for schools. Future school sites will have to be located farther away from the developed areas of Auburn requiring longer bus and auto trips to transport students.

Parks
The City of Auburn contracts with the Auburn Recreation District for park and recreation services. The Auburn Recreation District also serves the area outside of the Auburn City limit including Christian Valley, Meadow Vista and Bowman.
Figure IV-2 displays the primary parks serving Auburn, which include the following:
1.	Auburn Recreation Park
2.	Regional Park (out of the City)
3.	Ashford Park
4.	Fair Park
5.	Railhead Park (to be developed)
6.	Skyridge Park
In addition to these parks, four schools have been developed with turf areas for recreational purposes. These schools include:
1.	Alta Vista School
2.	E.V. Cain School
3.	Skyridge School
4.	Placer High School Additional small parks include the following:
1.	Bicentennial
2.	Chana
3.	Herschel Young
And County parks in the Auburn Recreation District are:
1.	Christian Valley Park
2.	Meadow Vista Park
3.	Placer Hills Park and Pool
In addition to the parks listed above, a number of trails, existing and proposed, meander throughout the area. A discussion is provided in the Open Space and Conservation Element of this plan and shown on the Auburn Park Conservancy Non-Auto Circulation Plan, Figure VII-9.
Land Use Plan
Figure IV-3 displays the land use plan for the City of Auburn (a full-size copy of this figure is available for public review or purchase at the City of Auburn Community Development Department). This figure depicts land uses within the proposed sphere of influence through the year 2012. The boundary lines between land use designations are
3, 1993
Vagt [V-U


f
delineated as specifically as possible, generally following roads and parcel lines. Proposed school and park locations shown on the land use plan are conceptual, not parcel specific.
The following sections describe the land use designations contained in the land use plan and the standards of population density and building intensity for the various land use designations. Residential building densities are stated as the allowable range of dwelling units per gross acre. Dwelling units per acre are implemented by the Zoning Ordinance and are often indicated by ranges, i.e., Medium Density Residential—up to 10 units per acre. An adjustment to the allowable dwelling unit per acre can be achieved by several techniques allowable in the Zoning Ordinance.
1.	Planned Unit Development— allows units to be clustered, tiered, or otherwise grouped as long as the maximum allowable units per total acres are not exceeded.
2.	Transfer of Development Rights—allows a city (or other) to purchase development rights with an agreement that the property involved will remain in agriculture, open space, or other non-urban use. The purchasing entity may then transfer or sell those rights to a developer with a property which has a density designation but is located where a higher density is permissible.
3.	Density Bonus—is allowed where a developer who agrees to provide some amenity to the city which would otherwise be difficult and/or costly for the city to develop.
Population density can be derived by multiplying the number of units by the average number of persons per dwelling unit. The assumed average number of 2.27 persons per dwelling unit for the Auburn area was obtained from the Sierra Planning Organization.
Non-residential building intensities are stated as maximum Floor Area Ratios (FARs). A FAR is equivalent to the gross building square footage permitted on a lot divided by the net square footage of the lot. Net acreage is the total acreage less any streets or buildings.

CIRCULATION ELEMENT
1. totoducUoa
The Auburn Circulation Element is an infrastructure plan for existing and proposed facilities for the circulation of people and goods including sewer, water, and power. The Circulation Element is consistent with the Land Use Element and coordinated with the Regional Transportation Plan developed by the Placer County Transportation Commission (Congestion Management Agency), and any state transportation plans. Cooperation is necessary between all city, county, and state entities to develop a comprehensive circulation and transportation system. The Circulation Element is a mandatory element required by Government Code Section 65302(b).

Conditions
This section provides an assessment of the adequacy of existing facilities. The discussion addresses the following transportation system components:
•	Street System;
•	Transit Service;
•	Rail Transportation;
•	Air Transportation;
•	Pedestrian and Bicycle Transportation; and
•	Public Facilities.
Street System
Roadways
Auburn’s street system is predominately a two-lane road network reflecting the rural environment of this foothill community. Only Interstate 80, Highway 49, Elm Avenue and Auburn Folsom Road provide four or more travel lanes.
Figure V-l shows the functional classification of the road network according to the following classifications:
•	Freeways—Limited access highways.
Tage V-4
____________)

9(ovtmSer 3, 1993
Auburn general Tian

•	Highways—Limited access regional roadways.
•	Arterials—Major streets providing through service to industrial and commercial areas and between cities.
•	Collectors—Streets that collect traffic from local streets within residential areas.
•	Locals—Streets whose primary purpose is to provide access to individual properties.
Interstate 80 and Highway 49 are the two main routes through the City. Interstate 80 bisects the City in a northeasterly—southwesterly direction while Highway 49 bisects the City in a northwesterly—southeasterly direction. Interstate 80 has six lanes to the east and west of Auburn and up to eight lanes through the City. Highway 49 is a two-lane highway through Auburn except for a four-lane section from Lincoln Way to Dry Creek Road in north Auburn. Auburn Folsom Road also functions as a thoroughfare for traffic in the southern portion of Auburn and varies from two to four lanes.
In order to analyze the existing conditions for the roadway system, procedures and methodologies from the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM), Special Report 209, Transportation Research Board, 1985, were used. HCM techniques generate daily roadway capacities adjusted to incorporate factors that influence theoretical roadway capacity. These capacities were then compared to 1990 roadway volumes to determine a level of service (LOS). Level of service describes traffic flow conditions and varies qualitatively from LOS A to LOS F as described below in Table V-l.
TABLE V-l LEVEL OF SERVICE DESCRIPTION	
	
A	Represents free flow. Individual users are virtually unaffected by the presence of others in the traffic stream.
B	Stable flow, but the presence of other users in the trcffic stream begins to be noticeable.
C	Stable flow, but marks the beginning of the range of flow in which, the operation of individual users becomes significantly effected by interactions with others in the traffic stream.
D	Represents high density, but stable flow.
E	Represents operating conditions at or near the capacity level.
F	Represents forced or breakdown flow.
SOURCE: Highway Capacity Manual, Special Report 209, Transportation Research Board. 1985.	
Average daily traffic counts (ADTs) provided by the City of Auburn Public Works Department and Caltrans are shown on Figure V-2. These volumes were compared to the LOS criteria capacities to determine existing LOS. These capacities were generated using the Highway Capacity Manual techniques discussed above and are contained in the Supporting Documents, Transportation Evaluation Criteria (Table A-1). Figure V-3 shows the level of service results.

Intersections
In order to assess peak hour traffic operations, selected intersections were analyzed to determine peak evening hour LOS. Intersection analysis is important because it reveals peak hour operational problems that might not be evident in analyzing daily volumes.
Intersections were also analyzed using Highway Capacity Manual techniques and procedures. Tables A-2 and A-3 of the Transportation Evaluation Criteria in the Supporting Documentation define the analysis criteria for the intersections. Figure V-4 shows the peak hour LOS of each analysis intersection.
Truck Routes
Figure V-5 shows the truck routes through Auburn. These routes are designed to allow truck traffic to pass through the City with minimal impact on local vehicular and pedestrian traffic. Through truck traffic is also permitted on State Highway 49 through downtown Auburn.
Roadway Design Standards
Currently, Auburn’s Municipal Code contains roadway design standards. The standards provide a limited level of detail for the necessary features within the right-of-way. Revisions to these standards are necessary for the following reasons:
1.	The application of the standards should be based on functional classification of the roadway, not the type of zoning proposed adjacent to the street. This ensures route continuity and provides safer operating conditions by minimizing the changes to driver expectation.
2.	The current standards do not require bike lanes. Provision of bike lanes enhances recreational activities, enhances air quality and provides safer operating conditions for motorists and bicyclists.
3.	The standards should detail all features including striped lane widths, onstreet parking, bike lanes and pavement section requirements.
Parking Standards
Article 9 of the Auburn Municipal Code defines the standards for off-street parking and loading. Items such as the number of required spaces, design standards and maintenance are well-defined in this article. There currently are no guidelines for the circumstances in which on-street parking is allowed or disallowed.

Transit Service
Public Facilities
Auburn Transit, Placer County Transit (PCT), and the Consolidated Transportation Services Agency (CTSA) combine to provide public transit service in the Auburn area. Auburn Transit, better known as the Auburn Mini-Bus, currently operates two passenger buses on a deviated route schedule. Service is provided six days a week and both buses are lift-equipped to serve elderly and handicapped patrons.
Placer County Transit operates a combination fixed route/route deviation bus service. The deviation service allows for a diversion of up to one mile from the fixed route to serve patrons who have requested the service at least 24 hours in advance. In the Auburn area, PCT service has eight buses available for service five days a week. The buses carry a maximum of 30 passengers with an average bus size of 18 to 19 passengers. Figure V-6 shows the PCT routes and the transit service area of the Auburn Mini-Bus.
The Consolidated Transportation Service Agency (CTSA) Is an independent nonprofit organization that provides transportation services to over 300 individuals within Placer County who are disabled or seniors. As part of their service, CTSA also provides transportation services to the Association for Retarded Citizens within Placer County. Both CTSA and the Auburn Transit coordinate their activities on an ongoing basis by providing notice of new or expanded transportation services that may affect each operation and an opportunity to participate in planning for the provision of service.
Service quality of the Auburn Mini-Bus ranks well according to a June 1989 performance audit of the Auburn Mini-Bus. Audit authors made the conclusion that the service adequately met the transit needs of Auburn residents. Further, the combined efforts of the Auburn Mini-Bus, PCT, and CTSA have initiated a well-coordinated public transportation system which inherently meets the transportation needs of most Auburn area residents. Nevertheless, the Placer County Regional Transportation Plan recommends a comprehensive transit demand and needs analysis to be performed by the Placer County Transportation Commission that determines the overall demand for transit and paratransit services and that determines if all of the transit needs are being met within the region.
Caltrans offers a different type of transit service, that of ridesharing. Caltrans provides a commuter matching service and operates park-and-ride lots in the Auburn area (pers. comm. 9/21/92). The commuter matching service allows commuters to contact other commuters living in the same vicinity to arrange ride-sharing activities. In 1990, 259 commuters from the Auburn area requested matching information from the Caltrans Rideshare office. Caltrans officials estimate that about 25 percent of those expressing interest actually participate in ridesharing. Comparing this percentage with statistics regarding park-and-ride lot use in the Auburn area, this would seem to be a reasonable

estimate. Table V-2 contains ridesharing use statistics for three Auburn area park-and-ride lots.

Private Facilities
Auburn’s private transit facilities include two different types of services. One private company, Greyhound Lines, provides intrastate and interstate bus service. Other private companies provide charter bus service along the Interstate 80 corridor between Reno and San Francisco, with stops in Auburn.
Private van service to the airport and the Bay Area is available as is taxi and limo services.
Rail Transportation
Facilities/Services
Rail facilities in Auburn include two sets of Southern Pacific tracks that run through Auburn. (See Figure V-7.) One set of tracks is used for eastbound trains and the other set of tracks serve westbound trains. Auburn is one of the last locations in the nation where separate parallel double sets of tracks exist to serve directional train traffic. Although the tracks exist, freight and passenger rail services are not currently available in Auburn due to the absence of a passenger and/or freight rail station.
In the recent Placer County Commuter Rail Feasibility Study, Auburn is listed as a potential station site. Initiation of a commuter rail route with an Auburn station could occur within the time frame of the Auburn General Plan.

AIR TRANSPORTATION
This section summarizes the existing conditions discussion prepared in the Auburn Municipal Airport Master Plar\ (AMAMP), 1989.
Facilities
The City of Auburn Municipal Airport is the only public airport within the General Plan study area. The airport is currently zoned as an industrial-use design control district. Typical land uses associated with this zoning are aviation-related manufacturing, sales, and services along with general industrial and commercial land uses. The City owns and operates the airport, with the City Manager responsible for airport management.
The Auburn Municipal Airport is located approximately four miles north of Downtown Auburn and one-half mile east of Highway 49. Access to the airport is via Airport Road, a two-lane, north-south paved road between Bell Road and the airport. Bell Road is connects to both Highway 49 and Interstate 80. The airport covers 210 acres and has an airfield elevation of 1,523 feet above mean sea level. Figure V-8 shows the location of the airport.
Existing facilities at the airport include the following:
Airfield
•	One paved runway, Runway 7-25, which is 3,100 feet long and 60 feet wide with an effective upward gradient of 1.7 percent to the east. Pavement type is asphalt and its gross weight strength is rated at 30,000 pounds for single-wheel landing gear aircraft. Pavement and runway markings, according to the master plan, are in fair condition. The runway also includes medium intensity runway and threshold lights.
•	One 30-foot-wide parallel, asphalt taxiway located 150 feet (centerline-to-centerline) from the runway with one exit near mid-point, in addition to the connections at each end. The taxiway also has medium intensity edge lights.
Aircraft Parking and Hangars
•	187 open tiedowns, 40 port-a-port hangars, 14 T-hangars, 10 aircraft shelters, and seven other conventional hangars.
Other Facilities
* Two 8,000-gallon underground fuel tanks for storage to 80 octane and 100 octane aviation fuel.
Miscellaneous industrial and commercial businesses including one restaurant within the City Limits.

■
Services
Air transportation services at the Auburn Municipal Airport are referred to as Fixed-Base-Operators (FBOs). FBOs at the Auburn Airport provide flight instruction, charter service, pilot supplies, avionics sales and service, aircraft sales, rental salvage, fuel, and maintenance.
Use
As of August 1986, there were 195 single-engine and 11 twin-engine aircraft at the Auburn Airport for a total of 206 based aircraft. For 1990, airport officials estimate 210 based aircraft occupy aircraft parking facilities. In 1986, the 206 based aircraft were responsible for 35,000 "local" operations where the aircraft took off and landed at the Auburn Airport. An additional 33,000 "itinerant" operations were generated at Auburn by aircraft taking off at one airport and landing at another airport. The 1990 estimate for total operations was approximately 65,000, which represents little change from the 1986 total of 68,000 operations.
The decline in total operations seems to indicate a leveling off compared to increases in aviation activity at the Auburn Municipal Airport experienced from 1980 to 1986. During this six-year time period, based aircraft at Auburn increased from 105 to 206, a 96 percent increase. According to the AMAMP, based aircraft is expected to increase reaching 360 total based aircraft by 2007. Operations are also expected to increase, reaching 79,000 by 2007. Nevertheless, since 1986, Auburn’s aviation growth has not materialized. Therefore, current aircraft parking and operations capacity is sufficient to meet current demand. If demand increases as predicted in the AMAMP, however, expansion or improvement of airport facilities may be required.
Pedestrian and Bicyclist Transportation
Facilities
Bike routes and pedestrian walkways are typical examples of pedestrian and bicycle transportation facilities. Bike routes are divided into three categories as follows:
Class I Provides a completely separated facility designed for the exclusive use of bicycles and pedestrians with cross flows by motorists minimized.
Class II Provides a restricted right-of-way designated for the exclusive or semi-exclusive use of bicycles with through travel by motor vehicles or pedestrians prohibited, but with vehicle parking and crossflows by pedestrians and motorists permitted.

SOURCE: Placer County Regional Transportation Plan, 1988.
In Auburn, plans and studies such as the Auburn Park Conservancy Non-Auto Circulation Plan and the Auburn Ravine Trail Master Plan have identified locations for bike routes and pedestrian walkways. Placer County has also designated bike routes andpedestrian walkways in and around Auburn through the Regional Transportation Plan and the Placer County Bikeways Master Plan.
Use
Although bicycle and pedestrian facilities are planned for in Auburn, existing bike routes are limited. As for pedestrian walkways, sidewalks and pedestrian crossings are provided throughout Auburn, but trails or paths separated from vehicular traffic are almost nonexistent. Nevertheless, pedestrians and bicyclists can be found using Auburn’s street system. The most apparent examples of pedestrian activity on the street system are near attractions such as parks and shopping centers. Examples include Ashford Park on Auburn Ravine Road, Recreation Park on Recreation Drive and Auburn Town Center on Elm Street. Therefore, the current facilities do not adequately meet the bicyclist and pedestrian needs.
Public Facilities
Water Service
Water service is provided to the City of Auburn by the Placer County Water Agency (PCWA). The agency serves 28,000 customers who utilize either well-water, treated water or both. PCWA purchases raw water from Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) that comes from the Yuba-Bear System. Under the current contract between PCWA and PG&E, a maximum annual amount of 100,000 acre-feet can be purchased by the Agency, Within the sphere of influence the Nevada Irrigation District (NID) also provides water service. NID serves approximately 1,800 customers in the area west of Highway 49.
PCWA provides water from the Bowman and Auburn Water Treatment plants. The combined production capacity of these two plants is 10 million gallons per day (MGD). Maximum demand in 1990 was 11.2 MGD. In order to alleviate existing capacity problems and to provide additional capacity, which will accommodate growth in the Auburn area, the PCWA has developed a Master Plan, This plan outlines four alternatives to effectively solve existing problems and to provide for future growth. Further, this plan will include water demand forecasts that are based upon the land use information contained in the City of Auburn General Plan and the Auburn/ Bowman Community Plan in order to provide accurate forecasts of demand.

NID operates one treatment plant at Locksley Lane, north of Auburn. The plant’s current capacity is 3.0 MGD, but is to be expanded to a minimum capacity of 4.5 MGD. Expansion is expected during 1993. With the anticipated expansion, NID has indicated that it has more than sufficient water rights to provide for planned growth in its service area north of Auburn (Auburn/Bowman Community Plan Public Services/Public Facilities Study, 1991).

The actual capacity for wet weather flows of the City’s plant is 2,2 mgd. Accommodating current peak flows and future flows will require expansion of the existing plant.
Treatment plant expansion proposals may allow the annexation of 2,329 acres extending northeast along T80 and east to the county line. The City has also tentatively scheduled a collector system master plan study for 1992. Additional expanded capacity is provided under the Master Plan to accommodate growth and annexations projected in the 1990-
r

2012 General Plan. This General Plan envisions about 4,500 acres of annexed land beyond that projected in the existing General Plan.
Auburn’s current monthly rate for residential service is $8.25. An increase in these rates is projected to finance plant expansion in order to supplement existing enterprise fund cash reserves. Development fees for wastewater facilities financing are currently $1,400 per residential unit.
Cify officials are currently developing a master plan for the Auburn Wastewater Treatment Plant to meet projected growth. The adoption of the master plan and EIRwill provide for a consolidation of wastewater treatment for the City’s sphere of influence. This will provide a more efficient and economical operation to serve the Auburn area, which is currently served by both the County Sanitation Maintenance District (SMD) # 1 and the City. The master plan will also provide a 5-year capital improvement program.
Drainage Facilities
The City of Auburn is served by two major drainage courses; Auburn Ravine and the American River. The drainage divide runs along East Lincoln Way and the SPRR tracks south to Maidu Drive then west along Indian Hill Road. All land to the east and south of the divide drains to the American River and the remainder drains to Auburn Ravine.
The City of Auburn has been subject to localized flooding in the Historic Old Town district and in the Auburn Ravine adjacent to Daily Road in the north Auburn area. City officials have developed master plans to determine stormwater flow deficiencies and provide for capital improvements in these two areas. The objective of these master plans is to provide for 100-year flood protection to all structures including flood proofing, and to ensure that future development is responsible for mitigation of site-specific stormwater runoff to predevelopment flows. A Capital Improvement Program will be developed as part of the master plans.
Natural Gas Facilities and Electrical Transmission Facilities
Figure V-9 shows the major natural gas and electrical transmission facilities serving the Cify of Auburn. Some electric transmission facilities enter into substations and then feed into PG&E’s electric distribution system and therefore appear to just end.
The 115kV electric line at Luther Road continues over the summit where a line feeds northwest across Bell Road to the Rock Creek Reservoir and then loops back to the main line. The Lincoln Way 60kV electric line ends at a substation in El Dorado County. The HP 6" gas line ends at Mt. Vernon Road and feeds into the distribution system of the City of Auburn. The 60kV electric lines, feeding from north and south, connect at the Placer substation southwest of Fulweiler Avenue. The 115kV electric line along Pacific Avenue ends in a PG&E substation.
r
According to PG&E officials, these facilities do not require upgrading or expansion to serve current development.
4L Needs Assessment and Recommended Umpnwements
EXTSTDVG NEEDS and kecommeivded Improvemeivts
This section of the element identifies the deficiencies of the existing transportation system within the City limits and the improvements necessary to mitigate the deficiencies.
Street System
Roadways
Based on the results of the level of service analysis, all City maintained roadways analyzed currently operate at or better than LOS D. There are, however, other design problems which significantly affect the safety and capacity of a roadway. Improvements recommended on state highways will require coordination with Caltrans.
•	Streets which do not meet the recommended design standards should be widened to accommodate safe and efficient travel.
•	The on-street parking allowed on Nevada Street significantly reduces its capacity and level of service. On-street parking on this street should be eliminated.
•	Although Highway 49 operates at LOS C over the course of the day, peak hour operations suffer significantly. Improvements such as signal system coordination and median-divided access control would substantially enhance peak hour operations.
Intersections
Of the intersections analyzed, the following operate at or exceed LOS D during the evening peak hour. Improvements recommended on state highways will require coordination with Caltrans.
• Elm Street at High Street operates at LOS E during the evening peak hour due to heavy eastbound and northbound left turning volumes. This intersection should be restriped to include a double left turn lane and a combination through/ right lane for the northbound approach. The eastbound approach should also be restriped to include an exclusive left turn lane, a combination left/through lane and an exclusive right turn lane. This improvement, along with adjusted signal timings, will improve operations to LOS C.

•	Marguerite Mine Road at Highway 49 operates at LOS F during the evening peak hour due to a heavy eastbound left turning movement and high through volumes on Highway 49. The City should restripe the eastbound approach to include an exclusive left turn lane and a combination left, through, and right lane. This improvement, along with adjusted signal timings, will improve the operation to LOS C.
•	Indian Hill Road at Auburn Folsom Road operates at LOS D during the evening peak hour due to a heavy eastbound left turning movement. Operations would be improved with signalization, but signal warrants are not currently met. The City should continue to monitor the volumes at this intersection for future signalization based on the warrant criteria set forth in the Transportation Evaluation Criteria in the Supporting Documentation.
It should be noted that only a few major intersections were selected for General Plan analysis. Additional analysis should be performed for other intersections within the City to determine operating conditions and potential improvements. Under the Implementation Section of the Circulation Element Program (CMP), a program is outlined that would include annual analysis of major intersections and identification of improvements.
Truck Routes
Truck traffic passes through the city limits using 1-80 or Highway 49, Elm Avenue and a portion of Lincoln Way have been designated truck routes to allow Highway 49 traffic to pass through the City without going through downtown. These are the only truck routes on city-maintained streets.
Roadway Design Standards
Current roadway design standards do not take into, consideration the functional classification of the street. They also do not delineate the necessary features within the right-of-way. Figure V-10 shows the recommended roadway design standards for arterial and collector streets while the standards for local streets are shown on Figure V-ll. These are provided as guidelines for development of specific standards for roadway designs.
Parking Standards
Current provisions for off-street parking are adequate to define parking design standards and maintenance. However, direction is necessary for the circumstances in which onstreet parking is allowed or disallowed and the following guidelines are provided:

•	On-street parking can be allowed on residential collectors and local streets under the provisions of the roadway design standards displayed on Figures V-10 andV-11.
•	For the Local C and D roadway design standards displayed on Figure V-l 1, four off-street parking spaces per unit shall be provided because these street design standards do not provide on-street parking.
transit Service
Since no current deficiencies were identified, no improvements are recommended.
Rail Transportation
A Rail Station is being considered by the Placer County Transportation Commission for the City of Auburn. This facility could increase local tourism activity because of easy pedestrian access to Old Town Auburn. The trip would be ideal for one-day or weekend visitors from the Bay area. This facility would also provide convenient access from the Auburn Central Business District to the Bay Area for business or pleasure. It is recommended that the City strongly promote efforts to secure a rail station for Auburn.
Air Transportation
Since no current deficiencies were identified, no improvements are recommended.
Pedestrian and Bicycle Transportation
According to the 1988 Placer County Regional Transportation Plan, bicycling and walking are increasing in popularity due to social, economic, and environmental factors. It is anticipated this trend will continue. However, Auburn has limited facilities for pedestrians and bicyclists. The Auburn Park Conservancy has updated the recommended trail system. The results of this work are incorporated into this element.

Since no current deficiencies were identified, no improvements are recommended.
Future Needs and recommended Improvements
Future circulation needs and improvements will be based on the impacts of the land use plan for the entire planning area. The land use plan was developed after reviewing circulation impacts associated with three land use alternatives. The Citizens Advisory Committee in conjunction with City planning staff reduced land use density throughout the planning area in order to improve future circulation operation conditions.
Street System
In order to identify the future needs of the street system, demand was forecast using the MINUTP travel demand model developed by Placer County for the Aubum/Bowman Community Plan. Figure V-12 shows the forecasts for the land use plan and the three land use alternatives (see Supporting Documentation, General Plan Alternative Analysis Table) used to develop the plan. These forecasts assume a buildout of each land use plan. Specific improvements for the land use plan are described below.

State Highways
Two state routes, Highway 49 and Interstate 80, traverse the Auburn area. The State of California has jurisdiction over the operation and performance of these routes. However, land use decisions made by the City and County will affect the operation and performance of these routes.
Highway 49 and Interstate 80 through the Auburn area will carry a significant amount of regional and local traffic in the future. Given the existing laneage, operations on these routes at buildout of the General Plan (2012) are expected to reach LOS F.
Traffic generated from the implementation of the Auburn land use plan will contribute to the poor levels of service. This is especially true along the Highway 49 corridor where a significant amount of land is designated for commercial and mixed uses. Caltrans has begun preliminary planning work to expand Highway 49 through Auburn to six lanes.
This expansion will provide some relief for congested traffic conditions and it is expected that Highway 49 will operate above LOS D with six lanes from Luther Road south to Interstate 80. Highway 49 at six lanes from Luther Road north to Bell Road, however, will operate worse than LOS D.
The lower levels of service along Highway 49 between Luther Road and Bell Road is in part attributable to Placer County’s proposed land uses for the Dewitt Center. This area is being planned by the County for a high density mixed-use development which is assumed to reduce reliance on the automobile. Due to a lack of data regarding trip reduction from such a development, the travel demand model forecasts for the Auburn General Plan assumed no trip reduction as a worst case scenario.
Recent legislation requires the development of congestion management plans for urban areas. These plans set level of service standards for major roadways within the urban area. According to preliminary information regarding the Placer County Congestion Management Plan (CMP), LOS F has tentatively been selected as the acceptable LOS for Highway 49. Therefore, widening Highway 49 to six lanes will more than adequately meet the LOS requirement set in the CMP.
Intersections
Increased traffic will affect intersection operations. Each intersection is unique and requires specific attention. Therefore, through the Transportation System Management (TSM) program required by Policy 1,3, annual traffic counts should be conducted at major intersections in Auburn in order to perform capacity calculations and to review intersection control warrants (criteria for both types of analysis are contained in the Supporting Documentation). The annual analysis of intersection operation and traffic projections will provide the detailed information needed to design improvements.

Truck Routes
Truck routes should be designated to avoid low overcrossings and prevent through truck traffic on residential streets. Routes should be clearly signed and identified on local and regional maps. Based on the planned commercial and industrial locations located in the Land Use Diagram, additional truck routes should not be required.
Roadway Design Standards
The recommended roadway design standards shown in Figure V-10 and Figure V-ll should be implemented on all future roadway improvements. These standards were developed based on roadway functional classification and Auburn’s topographical constraints.
Parking Standards
Future off-street parking requirements are addressed in the Auburn Municipal Code. On-street parking on many of Auburn’s narrow streets impacts roadway capacity and therefore, where through traffic movement is desired on future roadways, on-street parking should be prohibited.
transit Service
Public Facilities
The Auburn Mini-Bus operates efficiently when compared to other similar services. Therefore, no operating improvements are recommended. The transit service areas should be increased as urban development occurs in new areas. This extension of service should be addressed in the long range transit plan required by Policy 3.6 of the Circulation Element.
Private Facilities
Private transportation facilities in Auburn do not accommodate a large volume of Auburn’s daily traffic. The Interstate 80 corridor bus routes from San Francisco to Reno, however, do provide an important regional transportation service. This service should be used to the fullest extent during winter and summer recreation periods to help alleviate traffic congestion on Interstate 80.	'

Rail Transportat/on
According to the Placer County Commuter Rail Feasibility Study, 1990, rail transportation from Auburn to Sacramento and San Francisco may become possible during the life of this General Plan. This study estimated the patronage for one-way trips between Auburn and Sacramento at 33,800 per year in 2012. Although this commuter rail line is not expected to accommodate a large percentage of the roadway demand, rail transportation in Auburn would provide a transportation mode that is not currently available. The addition of a new transportation mode could result in improved air quality and decreased dependence on the automobile, while also providing greater accessibility and mobility to citizens who do not own automobiles or who cannot operate an automobile.
air Transportation
According to the Auburn Municipal Airport Master Plan, the potential exists for significant increases in operations and aircraft parking. Although these increases have not been evident over the past five years, the City of Auburn should be prepared to make the improvements identified in the Master Plan that will be required to accommodate additional aviation activity.
PEDESTRIAN AND BICYCLE TRANSPORTATION
Figure V-14 shows the trails identified by the Auburn Park Conservancy for the General Plan update (a full-size copy of this figure is available for public review at the City of Auburn Community Development Department). This map and the Auburn Ravine Trail Master Plan, should be implemented in order to provide recreational and transportation opportunities for Auburn residents.

Water Service
The Placer County Water Agency has prepared the PCWA Master Plan which outlines alternatives to effectively provide water service for future growth. The City of Auburn should work closely with PCWA to ensure service availability concurrently with new development.

Plan project alternatives assumed an annual growth rate of 7% to accommodate a potential worst-case scenario.
The majority of local growth was divided between the area along Auburn-Folsom Road in south Auburn and the area between Bell and Luther Roads north of the City. Plans are currently in progress to develop 267 acres in the Baltimore Ravine area east of the wastewater facility. Annexation of 2,329 acres extending northeast along Interstate Highway 80 (T80) is currently under City consideration. All of these areas are, or are anticipated to be, serviced by the Auburn Wastewater Treatment Facility.
The treatment plant service area includes the entire incorporated City of Auburn and the portions of its proposed sphere of influence that can feasibly gravity-feed (flow without the significant assistance of pumping) to the existing treatment site. Once these portions of the sphere of influence are annexed, they are eligible to be serviced by the treatment facility. The remainder of the sphere of influence north of the City (Bell Road area), where gravity-feed is unfeasible, will be serviced by the Placer County wastewater treatment facilities located at Dewitt.
Stage 3 expansion capacity is based on an estimated maximum population of 55,000; this is a worst-case population estimate for the year 2012. Therefore, the City’s future sewer demands should be met through implementation of the Sewer Master Plan.
Drainage Facilities
Auburn’s drainage system is currently at capacity. Each new development that adds impervious surfaces has the potential to impact Auburn’s drainage system. In the past, the City has required that projects retain storm drainage on-site. This method prevented any net increase in drainage flows to the different drainage basins. As the City grows and expands, additional facilities will be required to accommodate drainage flows. The City is currently studying the impacts of development on the drainage system and will make recommendations for alleviating drainage problems.
The Auburn Ravine drainage, which includes the Dairy Road, Lincoln Way, and Brewery Lane tributaries, has been studied to identify existing deficiencies and recommend improvements and mitigation measures for new development. The Old Town Drainage Study investigated the Lincoln Way and Brewery Lane tributaries and made recommendations for improvements to accommodate the 100 year flood. The Dairy Road Watershed Master Plan studied Auburn Ravine from Highway 49 upstream to Luther Road and made recommendations to mitigate impacts from new development.
The Old Town Drainage Study has recommended improvements to the existing drainage system to accommodate a 100 year flood. As an interim measure, all new development, which is tributary to the drainage system in Old Town, must provide mitigation measures which reduce post development runoff to predevelopment conditions.

The analysis conducted for the Dairy Road watershed concludes that the existing facilities are inadequate to accommodate the 100 year flood flow. However, improvements to eliminate flooding problems are prohibitively expensive. Therefore, the Ciiy should require detention basins which will mitigate impacts of new development.
The City of Auburn has adopted the Placer County Flood Control and Water conservation District’s Stormwater Management Manual. The purpose of this manual is to provide consistent, specific guidance and requirements for stormwater management, including regulation of the development process, to achieve stormwater management objectives. The manual presents policy guidelines, and specific criteria for the development and management of natural resources, facilities and infrastructure for stormwater management.
Natural Gas Facilities
PG&E is planning to construct an additional transmission line to serve the Auburn area. The construction of this line will provide adequate supply for the foreseeable future according to PG&E officials. However, there is an economic feasibility issue regarding the cost of providing gas to all areas in the sphere of influence. In some areas, neither PG&E nor potential customers would be able to absorb the high cost of delivering gas. As the urban area of Auburn continues to develop, PG&E will provide natural gas when feasible.
Electrical Transmission Facilities
The substation facilities that serve the greater Auburn area are currently being upgraded to accommodate future growth projections. According to PG&E officials, electric demand in the Auburn area has increased at about 4.5 megawatts per year for the last few years. This trend is expected to continue for the next three to five years. PG&E officials anticipate no problems in meeting the projected needs of the community during this time. Electric supply levels are not an issue as PG&E’s grid system is designed to provide adequate service. As development plans mature, PG&E will review its forecast of energy requirements needed to adequately provide reliable energy sources to the public.
These programs relate to the adopted goals and policies. The implementation and completion of the programs represent the means by which progress in carrying out the Goals and Policies will be measured.

HOUSING ELEMENT
1.	Introduction
Contents of the Housing Element
The Housing Element of the General Plan is a comprehensive statement by the City of Auburn of its current and future housing needs and proposed actions to facilitate the provision of housing to meet those needs at all income levels. The policies contained in this element are an expression of the statewide housing goal of “attaining decent housing and a suitable living environment for every California family,” as well as a reflection of the unique concerns of the community. The purpose of the Housing Element is to establish specific goals, policies, and objectives relative to the provision of housing, and to adopt an action plan toward this end. In addition, the element identifies and analyzes housing needs, and resources and constraints to meeting those needs.
The Auburn Housing Element is based on six strategic goals:
1)	Provide a range of housing choices that meet the needs of all Auburn residents in terms of type, density, and cost.
2)	Encourage the maintenance, improvement, and rehabilitation of the City's existing housing stock and residential neighborhoods.
3)	Conserve the existing stock of affordable rental housing.
January 2014

4)	Encourage energy efficiency in both new and existing housing.
5)	Promote equal opportunity to secure safe, sanitary, and affordable housing for all members of the community regardless of age, race, religion, sex, marital status, national origin, or color.
6)	Implement a Housing Element that is in compliance with state law and the requirements of the California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD).
In accordance with state law, the Housing Element is to be consistent and compatible with other General Plan elements. Additionally, Housing Elements are to provide clear policy and direction for making decisions pertaining to zoning, subdivision approval, housing allocations, and capital improvements. State law (Government Code Sections 65580 through 65589) mandates the contents of the Housing Element. By law, the Housing Element must contain:
• An assessment of housing needs and an inventory of resources and constraints relevant to meeting those needs.
•	A statement of the community’s goals, quantified objectives, and policies relevant to the maintenance, improvement, and development of housing.
•	A program that sets forth a five-year schedule of actions that the local government is undertaking or intends to undertake to implement the policies and achieve the goals and objectives of the Housing Element.
The housing program must also: identify adequate residential sites available for a variety of housing types for all income levels; assist in developing adequate housing to meet the needs of very low, low-, and moderate-income households; address governmental constraints to housing maintenance, improvement, and development; conserve and improve the condition of the existing affordable housing stock; and promote housing opportunities for all persons.
Although, by nature of the state mandate, the Housing Element tends to focus on the affordability and availability of housing for low- and moderate-income households and families, the element must also address the housing needs and related policy issues for the entire community and be consistent with the adopted policies of the rest of the General Plan. For these reasons, the focus of the updated Housing Element will be on policies and programs that can balance the desire of residents to maintain the character of residential neighborhoods, manage traffic, and minimize visual and other impacts of new development while addressing the needs of low- and moderate-income households and special needs groups (such as seniors and individuals with disabilities).
This balance will require the City to examine strategies to accommodate higher-density housing, mixed-use projects in commercial zones, infill developments, and second units without sacrificing other legitimate community goals.

2.	Review of 2008 Housing Element
An important aspect of the Housing Element is an evaluation of achievements under the policies and implementation programs included in the previously adopted Housing Element. The evaluation provides valuable information on the extent to which programs have been successful in achieving stated objectives and addressing local needs, and to which these programs continue to be relevant in addressing current and future housing needs in Auburn. The evaluation also provides the basis for recommended modifications to policies and programs and the establishment of new objectives in the Housing Element.
The following is a summary of accomplishments of the City’s 2008 Housing Element.
Implementation -Measure	Accomplishments	Coiitimie/Modify/Delcte
A.	The City of Auburn is currently in the process of adopting a Specific Plan for the Baltimore Ravine (BRSP) area of the City with formal action anticipated to occur in mid-2009. Approximately 45 acres are zoned for high density multifamily residential use at an assumed density up to 20du/ac. The developer has agreed to comply with the SACOG Affordability Compact that provides a 10 percent affordable housing goal. Development standards will be adopted with the BRSP that will provide greater flexibility to increase project densities. The City expects that affordable housing projects in the BRSP will meet the following requirements: A minimum density of 20 units per acre for multifamily; A minimum of 16 unils constructed per site for multifamily; and Owner occupied and multi-family rental residential uses are allowed by right. Responsibility: Community Development Time Frame; Construction is anticipated to begin within the next 2-3 years. Funding:	Minor administrative cost to the City.	The City adopted the BRSP in February 2011 which meets all of the “by-right” requirements identified in program A of the 2008 Housing Element. The BRSP allows for an additional 725 units, of which a minimum of 72 units will be provided at a density appropriate to accommodate a portion of the City’s lower-income RHNA, Approval of the BRSP included a development agreement which will help insure provision of the affordable units. The City’s land use is set up in such a way as to provide a range, in this case 10-20 du/ac, not a fixed density (i.c., exactly 20 du/ac and exactly “X” units). So for the BRSP approval, the parcels involved could provide up to 300 unils at the 20 du/ac standard.	Delete.
B.	The City shall pursue available and appropriate state and federal funding sources to support efforts to meet new construction needs of extremely low-, very low-, low-, and moderate-income households and assist in addressing the needs of households overpaying for housing costs and/or living in an overcrowded	In April 2011 the City was awarded HOME funds for a First Time Homebuyer Program ($487,500) and Owner Occupied	Continue.

situation. Appropriate sources of funding will be determined on a case-by case basis. The City will collaborate with nonprofit organizations and agencies such as the Placer County Housing Authority. Potential funding sources for this program will include the CDBG and HOME programs (federal funds administered by the Stale of California for non-entitlement cities and counties), the Multifamily Housing Program, California Housing Finance Agency programs, tax exempt bond financing, low-income housing tax credits, the Federal Home Loan Bank Affordable Housing Program, and various other HUD programs for special needs groups.
In addition the City will market housing opportunities and assist developers with construction of affordable housing through the following actions:
The City will continue to provide financial assistance for the construction of affordable housing to the extent that Redevelopment Housing Set-aside Funds are available.
The City will continue to provide Density Bonuses through the City’s Density Bonus Program which is in accordance with sections 65915 through 65918 of the California Government Code.
The City will continue to consider fee reductions or defer fees. The amount of fee reduction or deferral will be based on the financial needs of each development.
The City will continue to negotiate alternative development standards such as alternative parking standards, street improvements standards, maximum density, and lot coverage.
The City will continue to offer assistance in accessing local, state, and federal funding for affordable housing by applying for such funding on behalf of the affordable-unit developer or providing technical assistance or documentation necessary to support an application for funding. As a result of this Program, the City expects to produce approximately 100 new units affordable to extremely low, very low, and low-income households and 149 units affordable to moderate-income households.
Information regarding availability of housing assistance funds to lower- and moderate-income households will continue to be made available at the Auburn
Rehabilitation Program ($292,500).
In 2010 the City applied for HOME funds for a Housing Rehabilitation Program ($292,500) and First Time Homebuyer Program ($487,500).
In 2010 the Auburn Urban Development Authority (AUDA) indicated its intent to commit $400,000 to the Mercy Auburn Senior Community apartments project. This is a 60-unit project with a 48-unit density bonus. With the dissolution of redevelopment, there was no formal commitment in which the AUDA could provide them with funding.
In 2009 the City applied for HOME Investment Partnership Program funds for Mercy Auburn senior apartments but was not awarded the grant.
The City collaborated with Mercy Housing for the Mercy Auburn Senior Community apartment project.
While the City would consider fee reductions or deferrals, there were no opportunities.
The City negotiated alternative development standards on the Mercy project. Il was approved as a Planned Unit Development which included the 400% density bonus, enabled apartments in an RI zone, authorized a 50% parking reduction, and allowed a building height variance of 10’ (from 30’ to 40’).

5.	Auburn Urban Development Authority
On June 28, 2011, companion bills Assembly Bill IX 26 (AB 26) and Assembly Bill IX 27 (AB 27) were enacted as part of the 2011-2012 State of California budget bill and dissolved the Auburn Urban Development Authority (AUDA), unless the City of Auburn elected to participate in the Alternative Voluntary Redevelopment Program established by AB 27 and pay an annual community remittance payment to the County of Placer. On July 18, 2011, a Petition for Writ of Mandate was Filed in the Supreme Court of the State of California in the matter of California Redevelopment Association, et al. v. Ana Matosantos, et al., Case No. SI94861 (Legal Action), which challenged the constitutionality of AB 26 and AB 27 on behalf of cities, counties, and redevelopment agencies. On December 29, 2011, the court issued its opinion in the Legal Action, upholding AB 26, invalidating AB 27, extending certain statutory deadlines under Health and Safety Code Sections 34170 through 34191, and dissolving all redevelopment agencies throughout the state, effective February 1, 2012.
At the time the State dissolved the Auburn Urban Development Authority, the AUDA maintained a Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund, which had ±$900,000 in reserves.
In 2009, the City issued a resolution indicating its intent to provide assistance ($400,000) to the Mercy Auburn Senior Apartment project from the Low/Mod Fund. The Mercy project is a 60-unit apartment project affordable to low- and very low-income seniors. The City was not able to provide that assistance, as the City had not formally allocated the funding to the project prior to the dissolution of the AUDA.

7.	Efforts To Achieve Citizen Participation
State law requires cities and counties to make a diligent effort to achieve participation by all segments of the community in preparing a Housing Element. Section 65583[c] [6] of the California Government Code specifically requires that:
• The local government shall make a diligent effort to achieve public participation of all economic segments of the community in the development of the Housing Element, and the program shall describe this effort.
The diligent effort required by state law means that local jurisdictions must do more than issue the customary public notices and conduct standard public hearings prior to adopting a Housing Element. State law requires cities and counties to take active steps to inform, involve, and solicit input from the public, particularly low-income and minority households that might otherwise not participate in the process.
To meet the requirements of state law, the City of Auburn has completed the public outreach and encouraged community involvement as described below:
Public Meetings and Hearings
The City of Auburn held a Housing Element stakeholder meeting and a public workshop on October 17, 2012 to solicit public input and encourage public participation in the Housing Element update. E-mail notification and flyers of the meeting were sent to a number of non-profit organizations, government agencies, faith based organizations, health delivery organizations and the educational sector. Written comments were encouraged for those that could not attend the meeting and attendees at the meeting were also told they could submit written comments to supplement verbal comments.
The afternoon meeting was attended by City of Auburn staff, the City Historian and a representative from the Sacramento Housing Alliance and included a round-table discussion of housing and service needs throughout the community. Unfortunately no one attended the evening workshop.
After the meeting, Janice Critchlow, the Nevada-Placer Continuum of Care Coordinator, was contacted in an effort to gather additional homeless information. This information was incorporated into the needs assessment of this document.
The Housing Element was also posted on the City’s website with a request for public comment.
Public Comment
The City appreciates the efforts of citizens, agencies and organizations that have taken the time to participate in the Housing Element update. To date the City has not received any public comments.

8.	Consistency with Other General Plan Elements
State law requires that the Housing Element contain a statement of “the means by which consistency will be achieved with other general plan elements and community goals” (California Government Code, Section 65583[c] [7]). There are two aspects of this analysis: 1) an identification of other General Plan goals, policies, and programs that could affect implementation of the Housing Element; and 2) an identification of actions to ensure consistency between the Housing Element and affected parts of other General Plan elements.
The 1993 General Plan contains several elements with policies related to housing. The City has reviewed the policies included in the other elements and has concluded that none of these policies will impede the City’s achievements of, or be inconsistent with, the policies of this Housing Element. Housing Element policies primarily relate to housing assistance, housing rehabilitation, equal housing opportunities, residential energy conservation, and other topics not directly affected by policies in the other General Plan elements. Residential energy conservation policies contained in the Housing Element will help contribute to the achievement of General Plan policies for resource conservation. The City will comply with Government Code Section 65583 (c)(7) to maintain General Plan consistency.

APPENDIX A: HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
Introduction
The Housing Needs Assessment analyzes population and housing characteristics, identifies special housing needs among certain population groups, evaluates housing conditions, and provides other important information to support the goals, policies, and programs to meet the needs of current and future Auburn residents.
The United States Census, completed every ten years, is an important source of information for the Housing Needs Assessment. Results from the 2010 Census were used in the preparation of this document. The data presented in the Housing Needs Assessment will not only guide the development of housing goals and policies, but will also be integrated into the body of the Housing Element to present the current status of housing and housing-related issues in the City of Auburn. Definitions of various US Census terms used throughout this document are provided in Appendix B for clarification.
The needs assessment is organized into four data sections. The first section focuses on demographic information, such as population trends, ethnicity, age, household composition, income, employment, housing characteristics, general housing needs by income, and housing needs for special segments of the population. This first section outlines the characteristics of the community, and identifies those characteristics that may have significant impacts on housing needs in the community.
The second section identifies the City's resources, and the historic development patterns and housing opportunities in the community. It also discusses the City’s existing housing stock and the potential areas for future housing development.

Appendix A: Housing Needs Assessment
The third section discusses the governmental and non-governmental constraints to housing development in Auburn. The City has planning, zoning, and building standards that guide and affect residential development patterns and influence housing availability and affordability. There are also environmental and housing market conditions that affect the location, availability, affordability, and type of housing that is constructed in Auburn. The non-governmental influences include such factors as: the availability and cost of Financing, land, and materials for building homes; natural conditions that affect the cost of preparing and developing land for housing; and the business decisions of individuals and organizations in home building, Finance, real estate, and rental housing that impact housing cost and availability.
The Final section of the Housing Needs Assessment discusses opportunities for energy conservation, which can reduce costs to homeowners and infrastructure costs to the City. With a reduction in basic living costs through energy savings, more households will be better able to afford adequate housing.
Summary Findings
The following is a summary of Findings from the Housing Needs Assessment.
Population Trends
•	The 2010 Census reported Auburn’s population as 13,330 persons. Between 2007 and 2010, the California Department of Finance estimates the City’s population has grown by 2 percent. Auburn’s population is expected to grow steadily, continuing the demand for a variety of housing types and costs. The Sacramento Area Council of Governments (SACOG) Metropolitan Transportation Plan projects that the City of Auburn will experience a 29 percent growth rate between 2005 and 2035 (4,043 persons).
•	Auburn’s ethnic composition in 2010 was primarily Non-Hispanic White (89 percent) and Hispanic or Latino (10 percent).
•	The City of Auburn has a slightly lower percentage of persons under 18 and a slightly higher percentage of persons 65 years and over than the countywide and statewide averages. Family households represented 60 percent of all households in Auburn in 2010, compared to 71 percent countywide. Of the 3,474 family households in the city, the majority did not have children (2,000 family households or 58 percent of the total family households).
Income and Poverty
•	Residents of Auburn and Placer County have similar income characteristics. In 2010, the median family income in Auburn ($84,424) was roughly 95 percent of the countywide median family income ($89,196). Sixty-seven percent of the total households county wide earn $50,000 or more compared to 58 percent of the total households in Auburn.
•	As defined by the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) income limits, an extremely low-income household earns 30 percent or less of the median income; a very low-income household earns 50 percent or less than the county median income; a low-income household earns between 51 and 80 percent of the county median income; a moderate-income household earns between 81 and 120 percent of the county median income; and an above moderate-income household earns 121 percent or greater of the county median income. Based on HUD Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) Data for 2005-2009, approximately 21 percent of Auburn’s

households are extremely low income, 18 percent are very low income, 12 percent are low income, and 49 percent are moderate income and above moderate-income.
•	Based on HUD income limits, the 2012 median income for a family of four in Placer County, including the City of Auburn, is $76,100.
•	The poverty rate for Auburn was nearly 9 percent, whereas for Placer County the rate was 7 percent in 2010. Although American Indian and Alaska Native, and female-headed households with children represent a small percentage of the total population in Auburn, they had the highest poverty rates at 51 percent and 18 percent, respectively. Residents 65 years of age or older had relatively higher poverty rates at 10 percent.
Employment Trends
•	Based on the 2010 Census, there are 6,804 persons in the labor force; 56 percent commuted to work.
•	According to the Placer County Economic and Demographic Profile, there are nearly 125,000 jobs in Placer County.
•	The 2012 Placer County Economic and Demographic Profile indicates that the wages for about two-thirds of the occupational categories in the Sacramento region have wages that fall below the low-income categories.
Special Needs
•	Persons age 65 and over represent 19 percent of Auburn’s total population. The housing needs among older adults are: 1) home repair/maintenance/modification; 2) affordable housing; and 3) in-home assistance.
•	Individuals with disabilities also have financial and physical needs. Housing and supportive service needs among the disabled population include: 1) accessible housing; 2) affordable housing; and 3) housing located in close proximity to service and commercial centers.
•	Female-headed households represent nearly 10 percent of all households in Auburn, and of these households 368, or 6 percent, were female-headed households with children under age 18. Poverty rates among female-headed households are generally higher than the general population, and femaleheaded households with children under age 18 in Auburn have the second highest poverty rate of any population group (13 percent). Many female-headed householders have extremely low incomes and they will continue to require significant financial assistance or subsidized rental housing. Single mothers with children face additional challenges in finding affordable child care.
•	Large-family households in Auburn represent approximately 6 percent (368 households) of all households. Forty-three percent of these large-family households are renters and large-family renters typically experience higher rates of overcrowding and overpayment.
•	The 2013 Placer County Point-in-Time Homeless Survey identified a total estimated homeless population of 594 individuals in the County. Since the City of Auburn’s population comprises 4 percent of the total County population, the City of Auburn’s homeless population is estimated to be 24 persons (4 percent of the total homeless count). Based on available information and contacts with service providers, the level of, and need for, homelessness services in the city is increasing on a region-wide basis. The homeless continue to need affordable housing and supportive services. It can be assumed that those most at risk for becoming homeless are those paying more than 50 percent of

their income for housing costs. These households are not likely to have reserve funds in case of an illness, job loss, or other factors and are at risk of becoming homeless.
Housing Characteristics
■ The majority of the city’s housing stock consists of single-family detached homes (68 percent). According to the 2010 Census, 59 percent of households are homeowners and 41 percent are renters.
•	Most of Auburn's housing stock—over 58 percent—is greater than 30 years old. Only 24 percent of the city’s housing was constructed since the 1990s.
•	Of the city’s occupied housing units, approximately less than 1 percent was overcrowded. Overcrowding occurred in rental housing (1 percent) but not in owner-occupied housing (0 percent).
Housing Costs and Affordability
•	In 2012, 80 percent of all rental housing in Auburn was affordable to very low-income households, and 100 percent was affordable to low-income households. However, the existence of lower-cost units does not mean that such units are actually available to lower-income households. Currently, seven apartment complexes (336 units) in the city have some type of rental subsidy (see Table A-27).
•	The majority of rental units in Auburn are one- and two-bedroom units.
•	Approximately 34 percent of all households within the City are overpaying (spending over 30 percent of their income on housing in Auburn.) for housing. Of the households overpaying, 12 percent are extremely low-income households, 15 percent are very low-income households, and 8 percent are low-income households
•	Between July 2012 and December 2012, the median price for resale homes in Auburn was $303,908.
•	Based on resale of single-family homes in Placer County in 2012, 1.4 percent of homes sold were in an affordability range for persons within the extremely low- and very low-income groups, while 77.8 percent of homes were in the affordability range to persons in the low-income group and 18.5 percent were in an affordability range for moderate-income groups.
Opportunities and Constraints
•	SACOG has determined that Auburn has a housing construction need of 308 units for the planning period 2013-2021. Of the total 308 units, 24 percent (or 74 units) should be affordable to very low-income households, 16.9 percent to low-income households, 18.5 percent to moderate-income households, and 40.6 percent to above moderate-income households.
•	The city's vacant land within residential districts can accommodate its regional allocation of new dwelling units at densities potentially affordable to low- or very low-income households.
•	Auburn’s zoning regulations and development permit processes do not create unreasonable restrictions to the city’s ability to accommodate affordable housing. The time required in the City of Auburn for development approval is not generally a constraint or substantial cost to housing developers.

Population Characteristics
Population Trends
Since 2007, the City of Auburn’s population has grown by 2 percent according to California Department of Finance estimates. Auburn’s growth rate is significantly lower than Placer County’s growth which is estimated to be 7 percent (Table A-l). In comparison to other cities located in south Placer County, Auburn has not experienced the same growth and has retained a small town atmosphere.

The SACOG Metropolitan Transportation Plan projects the city will grow by 29 percent between 2005 and 2035. According to SACOG projections, the City of Auburn is expected to reach a population of 17,985 by 2035.
Since the 2000 Census the number of persons per household has dropped slightly from an average household size of 2.31 to 2.282 based on 2012 Department of Finance estimates.
The number of households in the City of Auburn increased from 5,302 in 2000 to 5,759 in 2010 according to the Department of Finance estimates, an 8 percent increase. The number of households has increased at a faster rate than the City’s population since 2000, due to the decrease in the household size.
Ethnicity
According to the 2010 Census, Auburn’s population was predominately White, Non-Hispanic, at 89 percent. Less than 1 percent of the population was Black, 1 percent was Native American, 1.9 percent was Asian/Pacific Islander, 4 percent consisted of two or more races, and 10 percent were of Hispanic origin.
Age of Population
Overall, the City of Auburn has an older population, with a median age of 46 compared to 40 for all of Placer County and 35 for all of California. Individuals 20 to 34 years of age account for 16 percent of the city’s population, 35 to 54 years of age account for 27 percent of the population, 55 to 64 years of age make up 16 percent of the population, and seniors 65 and older account for 19 percent of the population. Nineteen years and under account for 22 percent of the population.

Household Type and Composition
Further insight into the characteristics of the city’s population is explored by examining household size. Of the 5,759 households in 2010, Table A-3 shows that Auburn’s highest percentage consisted of one-and two-person households (32 and 37 percent respectively). The next largest percentage was three-person households (14 percent).

In addition to household size, household composition provides important indicators of population characteristics and trends (Table A-4), The 2010 Census reported that 60 percent of all households in Auburn were family households and, of that, 75 percent were married-couple households. Compared to the countywide population, Auburn has a slightly lower percentage of family households and families with children. Although most people lived in family households, 40 percent of households in Auburn were non-family households, primarily single adults (including seniors), but also other unrelated individuals. The 2010 Census records persons living within group quarters separately and considers them

Income Characteristics
Household Income
According to the 2010 Census, the median household income in the City of Auburn was $60,756, while the median family income was $84,424 (Table A-5). In comparison, the median household income in Placer County was $74,447 and the median family income was $89,196. This indicates that incomes in Auburn were roughly 80 to 90 percent of the countywide income. In 2010, 27 percent of Auburn households had incomes above $100,000, compared to 35 percent countywide.

For the purpose of evaluating housing affordability, housing need, and eligibility for housing assistance, income levels are defined by guidelines adopted each year by the California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD). For Placer County, the area median income (AMI) for a family of four in 2013 was $76,100.
•	Extremely Low: less than 30 percent of the area median income.
•	Very Low: less than 50 percent of the area median income.
•	Low: between 51 and 80 percent of the area median income.
•	Moderate: between 81 and 120 percent of the area median income.

Extremely Low-Income Households
The 2010 median income for a household of four in Placer County is $73,100. Households that earn 30 percent or less than the county’s median income are considered “extremely low-income.” (Note: The City used 2010 income limits to stay consistent with 2010 household data). To estimate the number of households in the extremely low income category, the City looked at the total number of households that fell into the extremely low-income range, which was $0 - $21,950 (based on a household of four in 2010). Because the income ranges in the 2010 Census do not match up identically with the extremely low-income range, the City looked at the number of households earning less than $24,999. Based on this, it was determined that there are approximately 1,235 (20.7 percent of all households) existing extremely low-income households in Auburn. Of those, 265 (21.5 percent) are owner-occupied households and 970 (78.5 percent) are renter-occupied households. Because the City had to include all households within the $20,000 to $24,999 income range, it is safe to assume that the extremely low-income household number is higher than it would have been if the income range was cut off at $21,950.

Overpayment
State and federal housing law defines overpayment as a household paying more than 30 percent of gross income for housing expenses. Housing overpayment is especially problematic for lower-income households that have limited resources for other living expenses.
According to the 2005-2009 Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) Data, 12 percent of the total households overpaying in the City of Auburn (635 households) are categorized as extremely low income; 18 percent (810 households) are categorized as very low income; and 8 percent of total households (420 households) are categorized as low income.
Typically lower-income households, especially those categorized as extremely low and very low, experience a higher percentage of housing problems (including cost burden) than do higher-income households. Very low-income renters, as well as extremely low-income renters and owners, experience a high percentage of housing problems.

Poverty
The poverty level of income is a federally defined measure of the minimum income needed for subsistence living. The poverty level is an important indicator of severe financial distress, and the rate of poverty in a community (proportion of the population with poverty level incomes or less) provides important information about individuals and families in greatest financial need.
According to the 2010 Census, approximately 3 percent of all families, 13 percent of female-headed households, and 9 percent of individuals were below the poverty level.

Special Needs
To ensure provision of adequate housing for all people, this section evaluates the special housing needs of seniors, persons with disabilities, female heads of households, large families, farmworkers, and the homeless within the City of Auburn.
Seniors
According to the 2010 US Census there are 2,532 seniors, or persons age 65 or older. Seniors account for 19 percent of the city’s population. Approximately 69 percent of seniors are homeowners and 31 percent are renters. Although seniors in general have lower income, the 2010 Census reports only 236 seniors (9 percent) are at or below the poverty level.
Seniors also face housing challenges related to physical disabilities. Many of the disabilities are age-related, including declining mobility and self-care issues that interfere with the ability to remain independent. Seniors have a variety of housing options, including:
•	Independent living—Seniors reside in their home or apartment with little support or care.
•	Assisted living facilities—The senior person maintains a level of independence, resides in an apartment, and receives varied levels of support and assistance such as light housekeeping, meals, transportation and/or medication, etc.
•	Residential care facilities—Typically a smaller licensed facility, often six or fewer residents, which provides services similar to those provided by assisted living facilities.
•	Intermediate care or skilled nursing facilities—A licensed facility that provides a higher, continuous level of professional care.
Although there are a variety of housing options for seniors, and all housing options are available in the City of Auburn, facilities providing supportive services and a higher level of care are expensive. Most affordable senior housing is independent living and does not provide supportive services. Lower-income seniors cannot afford to take advantage of many of the housing options and consequently remain in independent living situations struggling with self-care issues.
Seniors First is a nonprofit corporation located in Placer County that provides a link to a variety of senior programs, referral services, housing options, and in-home services and serves as an advocate for seniors within the community. The Area 4 Agency on Aging 2012-2016 Area Plan identifies and prioritizes the needs of seniors in Placer and other counties in the Sacramento region. The top Five pressing needs identified by and for seniors in Placer County are:
1)	Getting transportation for errands or medical appointments.
2)	Paying for housing and other housing needs.
3)	Getting minor home repairs and/or modifications.
4)	Paying for medical care or medicines.
5)	Finding a reliable person to do in-home care.

Appendix A: Housing Needs Assessment
Persons with Disabilities
There are a variety of disabilities, including sensory, physical, mental, and self-care limitations that may result in the need for special housing accommodations or financial assistance. The 2000 US Census identifies approximately 21 percent (2,486 persons) of the City of Auburn’s population 5 years and older as having some type of disability, and approximately 48 percent are seniors age 65 and older, who have developed disabilities due to aging. It is difficult to determine how many of these cases may directly pose special needs in housing. Service providers who advocate on behalf of the disabled identify a serious lack of affordable housing targeted to lower-income households as the most pressing problem for the disabled population.
Placer Independent Resource Services (PIRS) is the primary resource for disabled persons in Placer County, including the City of Auburn. PIRS advocates for the rights of people with disabilities, educates the community about disability issues, and provides services to persons with disabilities to live independent, productive lives.
Persons with mental health disabilities range from those that can live and work within the community to those with severe mental illness that require special housing accommodations, constant medical attention, and supportive services. Placer County Adult System of Care (ASOC) provides a variety of services to the mentally ill. ASOC identifies housing as a constant struggle for the severely mentally ill. Mental health clients are typically low income; in addition, their illnesses have resulted in rental histories or credit histories that do not meet typical rent requirements and limit their housing options.
Residential care facilities and single-room occupancy (SRO) units provide additional housing options for the disabled. These housing types can house persons with similar disabilities, assist with case management efforts, and provide an environment where residents support one another. The City currently allows for SRO units in the Regional Commercial (C-3) zone as a conditionally permitted use.
In 2013, the City amended the Zoning Code to provide a procedure for reasonable accommodations. The Reasonable Accommodation procedure provides a process for individuals with disabilities to make requests for reasonable accommodation in regard to relief from the various land use, zoning, or rules, policies, practices and/or procedures of the City.
As a result of the 1988 Federal Fair Housing Law, newly constructed multi-family units are to be built to accommodate the disabled population of the community. Some apartments and condominiums are now required to be equipped with special features such as ramps, oversized halls, entryways, and bathrooms to increase accessibility for disabled persons. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires access for the physically disabled in all public buildings, including residential complexes. The City's Building Department reviews building plans for compliance with these and similar statutes.
In summary, disabled persons generally do not have the financial capacity to pay for needed accommodations or modifications to their homes. In addition, disabled persons need housing in close proximity to public services and public infrastructure and facilities that are accessible with special design features that accommodate the disability.

Persons with Developmental Disabilities
Senate Bill (SB) 812 requires the City to include in the special housing needs analysis needs of individuals with a developmental disability within the community. According to Section 4512 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, a "developmental disability" means a disability that originates before an individual attains age 18 years; continues or can be expected to continue indefinitely; and constitutes a substantial disability for that individual which includes mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and autism. This term shall also include disabling conditions found to be closely related to mental retardation or to require treatment similar to that required for individuals with mental retardation, but shall not include other handicapping conditions that are solely physical in nature.
Many developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently within a conventional housing environment. More severely disabled individuals require a group living environment where supervision is provided. The most severely affected individuals may require an institutional environment where medical attention and physical therapy are provided. Because developmental disabilities exist before adulthood, the first issue in supportive housing for the developmentally disabled is the transition from the person’s living situation as a child to an appropriate level of independence as an adult.
The California Department of Developmental Services (DDS) currently provides community-based services to approximately 243,000 persons with developmental disabilities and their families through a statewide system of 21 regional centers, four developmental centers, and two community-based facilities. The Alta California Regional Center is one of 21 regional centers in the State of California that provides point of entry to services for people with developmental disabilities. The center is a private, nonprofit community agency that contracts with local businesses to offer a wide range of services to individuals with developmental disabilities and their families.
The following information from the Alta California Regional Center, charged by the State of California with the care of people with developmental disabilities, defined as those with severe, lifelong disabilities attributable to mental and/or physical impairments, provides a closer look at the disabled population in the greater Auburn area.

Families with Female Heads of Households
Female-headed households are considered a special needs group because of the higher incidence of poverty in these types of households as compared with all families. Most female-headed households are either single women over the age of 65, or single women (mothers or other female relatives) with minor children.
Of the 5,759 households in the City in 2010, 604 were female-headed households, or 10 percent of the total households in Auburn. Of these households 368, or 6 percent, were female-headed households with minor children. Ninety-three (13 percent) of these female-headed households were classified as living below the poverty level. Comparatively, only 3 percent of all families in Auburn had household incomes below the poverty level.
It may be assumed that lower-income, female-headed households are overpaying for housing (i.e., more than 30 percent of their income), or are experiencing other unmet housing needs. As a result of poverty, female heads of households often spend more on immediate needs such as food, clothing, transportation, and medical care than on home maintenance, which results in living units falling into disrepair. Femaleheaded households have a greater need for affordable housing, located in areas near child care, schools, parks, transportation, shopping, and other services.
Large Families
Large families are defined by HUD as family households with five or more persons. The 2010 US Census reports that 6 percent of the total households, or 368 households, in the City of Auburn are large families; approximately 57 percent of the large families (208 households) live in owner-occupied housing units and 43 percent (160 households) live in rental units. Large families tend to have higher rates of overcrowding and overpaying for housing.
There are approximately 3,685 units (58 percent) in the city with three or more bedrooms, an amount that exceeds the current and projected large-family housing need (Table A-l 1).

Farmworkers
Farmworkers tend to have low incomes due to the lower-paying nature of their work. Farmworkers who are permanent residents, particularly those who are part of large-family households, face many of the same difficulties in obtaining suitable affordable housing as other low-income families. Therefore, finding sound, affordable housing of sufficient size to accommodate their families is a high priority need among farmworkers. Farmworkers who migrate on a seasonal basis face the issue of finding suitable, short-term housing.
The Auburn area does not contain any farmlands. The 2010 Census indicates that less than 1 percent (32 employed persons 16 years and older) of workers in the City of Auburn were engaged in the occupations of farming, forestry, fishing, hunting, and mining. Because there are no manual labor crops harvested in the east Placer County and Auburn areas that utilize migrant workers, the City has no plans for providing migrant farmworker housing. It is anticipated that any farmworkers who are permanent residents will obtain housing through affordable housing programs targeted to all lower-income families.
Homeless
Homelessness is a complex issue that has become a significant social concern in recent years. The number of homeless persons has increased dramatically in the last decade for a number of reasons, including the decrease in federal housing funds, the high cost of available housing, the increasing number of mentally ill individuals living on their own, persons with substance abuse problems, women and children fleeing family violence, and the lack of family support networks in today's fast-paced society.
Many individuals and families move in and out of homelessness over the course of a year. A lack of affordable housing can make it difficult for families to move from shelters and transitional housing into permanent housing and puts many low-income families with housing at risk of becoming homeless. It is difficult to estimate the number of individuals and persons in families with children who are at risk of becoming homeless; however, the Corporation for Supportive Housing estimates that 5 to 10 percent of low-income households in a community may experience homelessness at some point during a 12-month period. It can be assumed that those most at risk of becoming homeless are lower-income households paying more than 50 percent of their income for housing costs, and are thus not likely to have reserve funds in case of an illness, job loss, or other factors.
The City of Auburn does not provide homeless services, but participates with Placer County, other Placer County cities, service agencies, and faith-based organizations to support and work as part of a cooperative effort through the Placer Collaborative Network (PCN) and the Placer Consortium on Homelessness (PCOH) to address homeless needs and provide comprehensive services on a regional basis.
PCOH conducts point-in-time counts annually to identify the number of sheltered and unsheltered homeless in Placer County and utilizes the information in the preparation of the Placer County Continuum of Care. The count is only a snapshot reflecting those persons identified as homeless on the day of the point-in-time count. Both shelter providers and PCOH members emphasized the fact that the homeless are nomadic and it is difficult to identify them with a specific city. The results of the 2013 point-in-time survey, summarized in Table A-12, identified a total estimated homeless population of 594 individuals in the County. Since the City of Auburn’s population comprises 4% of the total County population, the City of Auburn’s homeless population is estimated to be 24 persons (4% of the total homeless count).

It should be noted that because of the regional, cooperative effort between Placer County jurisdictions and service providers, the City of Auburn homeless are able to avail themselves of shelters and housing services on a countywide basis. Conversely, homeless located in other cities within the county can avail themselves of services located within the City of Auburn.	
Placer County homeless resources strive to meet the multiple needs of the homeless and provide integrated coordinated services such as motel vouchers, assistance with utilities, security deposits and past due rent, emergency shelters, transitional housing, and supportive services. For a complete listing of homeless resources available in Placer County, see Appendix C.
The 2013 Nevada-Placer Continuum of Care Housing Inventory Chart (HIC) provides a point-in-time survey of emergency, transitional, and supportive housing available in Placer County. The 2013 HIC identified three emergency housing facilities in Placer County providing 98 year round beds, including 40 year round family beds and 58 year round individual beds. Sixteen (16) facilities in the County provide transitional housing to families and individuals, including 185 family beds and 68 individual beds. A total of nine (9) supportive housing facilities provide 161 supportive housing beds with 50 family beds and 111 individual beds.

Housing Stock Characteristics
This section describes the housing characteristics and conditions that affect housing needs in Auburn. Important housing stock characteristics include housing type, tenure, vacancy rates, age, condition, cost, and affordability.
Housing Composition
The number of housing units increased from 5,457 in 2000 to 6,139 in 2010, a 12 percent increase according to the US Census. The City of Auburn has not experienced the same population growth and housing unit construction as experienced in the larger cities in Placer County during the first part of the decade. The SACOG 2035 Metropolitan Transportation Plan projects the number of housing units will total 7,868 by the year 2035.
The 2010 Census reports the majority of housing units in the City of Auburn are single-family, detached structures, 68 percent of all housing units. Five percent were single-family attached housing units, 15 percent were multi-family dwellings in structures of five or more units, 12 percent were multi-family units in structures of two to four units, and there were no mobile homes.

Housing Tenure
Housing tenure (owner versus renter) can be affected by many factors, such as housing cost (interest rates, economics, land supply, and development constraints), housing type, housing availability, job availability, and consumer preference. Table A-14 details housing tenure for the City of Auburn, according to the 2010 Census.

Housing Supply
According to the 2010 Census, of the 6,139 year-round dwelling units reported, 5,759 units (94 percent) were occupied and 380 units (6 percent) were vacant. According to the 2006-2010 American Community Survey, the City of Auburn’s homeowner vacancy rate was 2.4% and the rental vacancy rate was 0.6%.

Homeownership
In 2000, homeownership among Auburn households was below that of households countywide. The homeownership rate for the City in 2000 was 58 percent, while countywide homeowners represented 73 percent of all households. By comparison, the 2010 Census reported homeownership rates slightly increased in the City, although it is still below the countywide rate, which remained static at 73 percent. In 2010, homeowners in Auburn represented 59 percent of the occupied housing units, while renters represented 41 percent.
Table A-16 breaks down homeownership rates among the different ethnic groups as identified by the US Census in 2010. Ownership rates reveal that there were more owners than renters among the different ethnic groups, except for Blacks, Hispanics, “two or more races,” and the race category “other” (US Census terms), who altogether comprise approximately 13 percent of the Auburn population. As a percent of the total population, persons of Hispanic origin comprise 7 percent of the population and have an ownership rate of 42 percent. This ownership rate is 16 percent below that of the ownership rate for the population as a whole (59 percent). Rental rates among the different ethnic groups are comparable to the rental rates overall for the entire population, with the exception again of Blacks, Hispanics, “two or more races,” and the race category “other.”

An analysis of homeownership rates by age reveals that persons age 65 to 74 have the highest ownership rates in the city (Table A-17). The majority of the age groups in Table A-17 have homeownership rates equal to or above the ownership rate for Aubum’s population as a whole (59 percent), with exceptions being the very young. Persons age 15 to 24 have a 90 percent rental rate. Persons age 25 to 34 also have a low ownership rate (25 percent). This is to be expected as persons of these ages are living with their parents or just becoming established and generally do not have the means necessary to purchase their own home. On the other end of the spectrum, persons age 75 and older have homeownership rates just higher than Aubum’s population as a whole. This is evidence that persons of this age in Auburn still live in their own homes and not in elderly care facilities.

Age and Condition of Housing Stock
The age and condition of the housing stock provides additional measures of housing adequacy and availability in many communities. Although age does not always correlate with substandard housing conditions, neighborhoods with a predominance of homes more than 30 years old are more likely than newer neighborhoods to have a concentration of housing with deferred maintenance and in need of updating of utilities or interior amenities, rehabilitation, or replacement. Homes with deferred maintenance usually exhibit signs of aging, such as peeling or faded paint, cracked siding, or missing or broken shingles or shakes, which suggest a need for repair or replacement of those components in the near future. Homes in need of rehabilitation require immediate repair or replacement of components in disrepair to avoid health and safety problems. Homes in need of replacement require repair or replacement of so many components that it may be more cost effective to completely reconstruct the home or demolish the home and construct a new dwelling.
Less than half of Auburn’s housing stock“58 percent—is greater than 30 years old (Table A-18), Only 24 percent of the city’s housing was constructed since the 1990s.

Sources: US Census Bureau, 2006-2010 American Community Survey.
In 2008 the City conducted a housing condition survey in which 2,289 parcels were surveyed. The 2008 survey identified the following:
•	27.4% of units were in excellent condition
•	34.2% were in sound condition
•	28.9% had minor issues
•	8% had moderate issues
•	1.5% had substantial issues
Based on the age of the housing stock and the results from the 2008 housing condition survey, approximately 30 percent of the housing units in Auburn need deferred maintenance or rehabilitation.

Overcrowding
Overcrowding is defined as more than one person per room in a housing unit. The US Census includes living rooms, dining rooms, bedrooms, kitchens, finished attics and basements, recreation and family rooms, permanently enclosed porches and rooms used for offices in the definition of “room.” Generally, overcrowding reflects the household’s inability to secure a larger unit at an affordable cost. Overcrowding accounts for less than 1 percent of the total households in the City of Auburn.
According to the 2010 US Census the City of Auburn has 29 households living in an overcrowded situation. Approximately 100 percent of these 29 households are rental housing units, and zero percent are owner-occupied units.
Table A-19 summarizes the incidence of overcrowding in the city based upon 2010 Census information. Table A-19:	Persons per Room in All Occupied Housing Units
Persons Per Room	Owner Households		Renter Households		Total Households

Overcrowding does not appear to be a significant problem in the City of Auburn. However, it can be assumed that those households living in an overcrowded situation are most likely lower income, given that extremely low and very low-income households cannot afford to rent market rate, adequate-sized units that meet their space needs.
Housing Costs
Rental Apartments
Table A-20 shows the apartment rental price ranges in Auburn and surrounding cities for October 2012. Searches for the City of Auburn found rental apartments in the one-, two-, and three-bedroom categories. The median rental price in the City of Auburn for a one-bedroom apartment is $875, while a two-bedroom is $936, and the three-bedroom units had a median rental price of $1,385. Roseville and Rocklin median apartment rents are higher than those in Auburn, higher rents most likely to be attributed to newer, more modem amenities available in Roseville and Rocklin. According to HUD’s 2012 Federal Register, the Placer County area fair market rents are listed between $736 and $1,689.

Lower Income Households Overpaying
As stated previously, there are five income categories typically used for comparative purposes based on the median countywide income: extremely low income (0 to 30 percent of median income); very low income (31 to 50 percent of median income), low income (51 to 80 percent of median income), moderate income (81 to 120 percent of median income) and above moderate income (greater than 120 percent of median income).
A standard measure of housing affordability is that average housing expenses should not exceed 30 percent of a household’s income. Those who pay 30 percent or more of their income on housing may experience difficulty in affording other basic necessities. However, individual circumstances that can affect the ability to afford housing vary, such as other long-term debt payments, the number of household members, and other large ongoing expenses (such as medical bills). Since it is impossible to consider each household’s individual circumstances, the 30 percent rule provides a general measure of housing affordability for the average household.
The Consolidated Plan and Continuum of Care Planning Tool online database (CPD Map) data illustrates that overpayment remains a critical need for lower-income households in the city. Approximately 34 percent of all lower income households in the City of Auburn pay over 30 percent of annual household income on housing. Table A-24 illustrates how these homes are dispersed throughout owner-occupied and renter-occupied households.

Affordability Trends
Housing affordability refers to the relationship between total household income and total household expenditure for housing, including mortgage, taxes, insurance, and utilities. This relationship is typically expressed as the percentage of total household income allocated to housing expenditures. The actual percentage will naturally vary from household to household reflecting individual choices regarding the allocation of income.
Notwithstanding the fact that individual households may choose to spend more or less for their housing needs, it is necessary to have some guidelines as to what a household should expect to spend on housing in relation to other expenditures. This is particularly necessary for households in lower-income categories where the expenditure for housing is likely to directly affect the amount of money available for other basic needs.

Appendix A: Housing Needs Assessment
For many years, the standard guideline for determining whether a housing unit was “affordable” to a prospective renter or purchaser was that the total housing cost should not exceed 25 percent of the household's gross income. In 1990, this guideline was raised to 30 percent (Health and Safety Code Section 50052.5 and 50053). This standard is applied to most federal and state housing programs; however, the use of higher ratios of income to monthly payments, as much as 40 percent, has become standard in the industry.
Extremely low-income households are dependent on the approximate 296 (28 percent) apartment units set aside and subsidized by various local, state and federal subsidy programs including HUD Project-Based Housing Choice Vouchers (formerly known as Section 8).
Very low-income households are eligible to rent the estimated 296 subsidized units in the city. However, very low-income households must compete with the extremely low-income households for the available subsidized housing units. Unlike extremely low-income households, some very low-income households are able to afford some of the market rate units in the city.
Low-income households have more housing options, as there are subsidized and market-rate apartments in the city with units available to low-income households. Local market rate rents were primarily within the range of affordability of households in the upper end of the low-income range (70-80 percent of median income) and moderate-income households.
Table A-25 provides an estimate of the number of affordable rental units at each income level. The percentage of apartments affordable within the extremely low-, very low-, low- and moderate-income groups is cumulative and includes the percentage from the previous income group.

A household can typically qualify to purchase a home that is two and one-half to three times its annual income, depending on the down payment, the level of other long-term obligations (such as a car loan), and interest rates. In practice, the interaction of these factors allows some households to qualify for homes priced at more than three times their annual income, while other households may be limited to purchasing homes no more than two times their annual income.

Based on sale prices of homes sold in Auburn in 2011, those extremely low- and very low-income households earning 50 percent or less of the median income were able to afford only a small percentage of homes for sale in Auburn. Table A-26 shows that 1.41 percent of homes sold in Placer County were affordable to persons within the extremely low- and very low-income groups, while 77.83 percent of homes were affordable to persons in the low-income group. Moderate-income households were able to afford 18.51 percent of homes in Placer County in 2012, as shown in the table below. Homebuyer assistance programs that provide down payment assistance and/or below market-rate interest rates may allow homebuyers to qualify for houses up to four times their incomes.

Assisted Housing Projects
In 1989, the California Government Code was amended to include a requirement that localities identify and develop a program in their housing elements for the preservation of assisted, affordable multi-family units. Subsequent amendments have clarified the scope of the analysis to include units developed pursuant to inclusionary housing and density bonus programs. In the preservation analysis, localities are required to provide an inventory of assisted, affordable units that are eligible to convert to market rate housing within ten years. As part of the analysis, an estimation of the cost of preserving versus replacing the units is to be included, as well as programs designed to preserve the affordable units.
Assisted Rental Housing Eligible for Conversion
Table A-27 lists the seven assisted rental projects in the City of Auburn, their funding sources, subsidy expiration date, and level of risk of conversion to market rate. The cost of conserving the assisted units is estimated to be significantly less than that required to replace the units through new construction. Conservation of assisted units generally requires subsidizing the difference between market-rate and assisted rents. Since land prices and land availability are generally the limiting factors to development of low-income housing, it is estimated that subsidizing rents to preserve assisted housing is more feasible and economical than new construction. However, federal, state and local resources must be available to assist with the preservation of the units.

Preservation and Replacement Options
Overview
The City works to preserve existing assisted units or facilitate the development of new units on an as-needed basis. Depending on the circumstances of the at-risk projects, different options may be used to preserve or replace the units, such as: 1) preserve the existing assisted units or 2) facilitate the construction of new units to take the place of any converted projects. Preservation options can include transfer of project to nonprofit ownership, provision of rental assistance to tenants using non-federal funding sources, or the purchase of affordability covenants. For replacement, the most direct option is the development of new affordable multi-family units. These options are described in more detail below.
Rental Assistance
The project can also be maintained using rental subsidies from non-federal (state, local, or other) funding sources. The feasibility of providing rental assistance is highly dependent upon the availability of other funding sources necessary to make rent subsidies available and the willingness of property owners to accept the City rental vouchers. As indicated in below, the total cost of subsidizing the rents for all 150 at-risk units is estimated at $42,750 per month or $513,000 annually.

3.	Affordable cost = 30% of household monthly income minus estimated utility allowance of $100 for a one-bedroom unit. Purchase of Affordability Covenants
Another option to preserve the affordability of at-risk projects is for the City to provide an incentive package to the owners of the assisted units to maintain the projects as affordable housing. Incentives could include writing down the interest rate on the remaining loan balance and/or supplementing the Section 8 subsidy received to market levels. The feasibility of this option depends on whether the complex is too highly leveraged. By providing lump sum financial incentives or ongoing subsidies in the form of rents or reduced mortgage interest rates to the owner, the City can ensure that some or all of the units remain affordable.

Appendix A: Housing Needs Assessment
Construction of Replacement Units
The construction of new affordable housing units is a more permanent solution to replace at-risk units before conversion to market-rate units. The cost of developing new multi-family housing depends on the number of bedrooms, location, land costs, and type of construction. Assuming an average construction cost of $200 per unit, and an average size of 800 square feet per unit, the approximate cost per unit would be $160,000. In total, it would cost approximately $24 million (excluding land costs) to construct 150 new affordable units. Even excluding land costs, the total costs to develop replacement units far exceeds the cost of the other two alternatives.
Nonprofit Entities
There are several nonprofit organizations active in the Placer County region that have the managerial capacity to own and manage assisted rental housing. Table A-28 lists these organizations.

Housing Resources and Opportunities
Future Housing Needs
State law (California Government Code Section 65584) requires that each city and county plan to accommodate a fair share of the region’s housing construction needs. In urban areas, state law provides for councils of governments to prepare regional housing allocation plans that assign a share of a region’s housing construction need to each city and county. In the six-county greater Sacramento region (comprising the counties of Sacramento, Placer, El Dorado, Yolo, Sutter, and Yuba), SACOG is the entity authorized to determine the future housing needs for the region. SACOG adopted a regional housing allocation plan in September 2012, called the "Regional Housing Needs Plan” (RHNP). This plan covers the period from January 1, 2013, through October 31, 2021.
Existing need is evaluated based on overpayment and overcrowding by lower-income households. The housing allocation also includes an "avoidance of impaction" adjustment to further reduce the concentration of low-income households in jurisdictions that have more than the regional average.
SACOG’s methodology is based on regional population and housing forecasts developed for its transportation model. The numbers of housing units assigned in the plan to each jurisdiction are goals that are intended to address the minimum new housing construction need from anticipated population growth in the region.
The housing units allocated in the plan to each city and county are considered minimum needs. Most, if not all, jurisdictions have existing unmet housing needs that should be considered during the preparation of a housing element, and which may result in housing construction objectives that exceed the regional allocation. The City must however use the numbers allocated under the RHNP to identify measures (policies and ordinances) that are consistent with these new construction goals. While the City must also show how it will provide adequate sites for construction of the required units, it is not obligated to build any of the units itself or Finance their construction.
According to the RHNP, the City of Auburn has a total housing construction need of 308 units, which equates to an annual need of approximately 41 units. Table A-29 shows the City of Auburn’s 2013-2021 planning period allocation, as determined by SACOG.

Future Development Potential
Areas with Potential for Residential Development
The future housing needs for the City of Auburn will be provided through a combination of development in the City’s numerous infill sites as well as the land provided in the Baltimore Ravine Specific Plan (BRSP). The City of Auburn estimates that there are an additional 338 acres of undeveloped residentially zoned infill land available within the city which can provide at least 900 units. In addition, the BRSP, a master planned community located in south Auburn, adopted in 2011 which meets all of the “by-right” requirements identified in program I of the 2008 Housing Element, provides a total of 725 units on 277 acres, including a minimum of 72 units affordable to very low-, low-, and moderate- income families consistent with the SACOG compact. Appendix D contains a complete listing of the vacant parcels and Appendix E contains the vacant land maps.
Historically, developers in the City of Auburn have built at densities below what the City’s Zoning Ordinance allows. Calculation of the potential number of new dwelling units within each residential district was based on the average densities of projects constructed over the past 15 years. For purposes of calculating potential future single-family dwelling units on vacant land, the City assumes projects will, on average, be built out at 65 percent of the maximum permitted density allowed by the Zoning Ordinance.
The City evaluated the affordable higher-density residential developments that developed over the last 20 years (see below).The resulting project densities, ranging between 10.4 and 30 units per acre with an average density of approximately 15.7 units per acre, are appropriate to meet the needs of lower-income households. The smallest parcel developed with affordable high-density residential was the Cherry Avenue project where four units were constructed on a .33-acre site. The Valley Oaks and Mercy Senior Apartment projects included approval of density bonuses. The multi-family affordable housing projects
constructed in the City include:			
•	Valley Oaks (1993-94)	60 senior assisted units	30 units/acre
•	Cherry Avenue (1994-95)	4 assisted units	12 units/acre
•	Palm Terrace Apartments (2003)	80 assisted units	10,4 units/acre
•	Mercy Senior Apts (-2013)	60 senior assisted units	20 units/acre
City of Auburn Vacant Infill Land
The following is a description of the available infill vacant land in the City and the number of units that could potentially be accommodated in low-, medium-, and high-density districts. To determine the capacity of each site the City used the lower end of the density range.
•	Auburn has approximately 12,29 acres of land, consisting of 27 infill sites, zoned for high-densities (9-15 units per acre) that could accommodate between 111 and 184 new dwelling units. These sites are located in the City’s multi-family zone district (R-3).
•	Auburn has approximately 25.51 acres of land, consisting of 25 infill parcels, zoned for medium-densities (1-10 units per acre) that could accommodate 102-113 new dwelling units. These medium-density sites are associated with the City’s R-2, Rl-5, Rl-7, and Rl-8.5 zone districts.

Please note: Table A-30 does not include parcels in the Baltimore Ravine Specific Plan Area.
1 The potential number of new units is based on a combination of historical densities of projects developed in Auburn over the last 20 years and an assumption that future projects will be built out at 65 percent of the masimum permitted density in the low-density residential zone.
Baltimore Ravine Specific Plan Area
As noted, the Baltimore Ravine Specific Plan is a 277-acre master planned community located in south Auburn. The BRSP provides a total of 725 units in a variety of densities, and includes a minimum of 72 units affordable to very low-, low-, and moderate- income families. The provision of affordable units is consistent with the housing compact by the Sacramento Area Council of Governments (SACOG).
The BRSP includes a mix of residential land uses, with densities ranging between 1 to 20 dwelling units per acre (du/ac). The BRSP also includes development of a mixed-use core in a central Village Center that would support up to 90,000 square feet of mixed-use space with commercial, office, business professional and residential uses. This Village Center provides opportunities for the creation of localserving goods and services supporting the residential community.

Residential Uses
Almost 120 acres of the BRSP area are designated for residential uses, for a total allocation of 725 dwelling units. Three residential land use designations are provided on the Land Use Plan: low-, medium-, and high-density residential (LDR, MDR, HDR, respectively). The LDR uses are assumed to develop at an average density of 1 to 4 du/ac. For the MDR areas, the project is assumed to develop at an average density of 8 to 9 du/ac. HDR areas are assumed to develop with densities up to 20 du/ac, with density bonuses adding additional units on affordable projects.
LDR areas are envisioned to accommodate single-family detached homes on conventional lots, which may be relatively large in some areas of the community due to existing site topography. Medium-density areas are also envisioned to accommodate single-family detached homes, but on smaller lots. All HDR areas will support attached housing units within the prescribed density range to encourage and facilitate development of housing for lower-income households. A variety of housing types could ultimately be supported which could include standard or alley-loaded lots, courtyard lots, green court lots, auto courts, alley clusters, zero-lot lines, z-shaped lots, duet/halfplex homes, townhomes, condominiums, or multifamily housing. Mass grading within the BRSP, a practice that has not typically been allowed in the past, will allow for development to occur at densities higher than those historically seen in the city.

Available Public Facilities and Services, Infrastructure
The City charges appropriate development impact fees to ensure those water lines, sewer lines, roads, and other necessary infrastructure to serve new residential development can be extended in a timely manner. All public facilities, including water and sewer capacity, are available to accommodate Auburn’s share of the regional housing need for the City’s infill projects, and adequate capacity is available for the buildout of the BRSP.
There are no major transportation or road improvements that constrain infill development. Where off-site problems may occur, the City will require a traffic study, intersection analysis, or other appropriate studies to be completed prior to the issuance of building permits. Individual traffic or access problems can only be determined at the time of site plan review.

To comply with Senate Bill 1087, upon adoption, the City will immediately forward its adopted Housing Element to its water and wastewater providers so they can grant priority for service allocations to proposed developments that include units affordable to lower-income households.
Accommodating the City’s Housing Need
Based on the above land discussion, the City has sufficient land to accommodate its 2013-2021 regional housing need. Table A-32 below compares the City of Auburn’s RHNA to its land inventory capacity. The City has a surplus of 174 units available to lower-income households (including extremely low-, very low-, and low-), 350 units available to moderate-income households, and 641 units available to above moderate-income households, a total surplus of 1,165 units.

Constraints
The Government Code, as it relates to the Housing Element, requires an analysis of both governmental and non-governmental constraints to the development of affordable housing. Auburn has identified various constraints to housing production in an effort to address as many barriers as possible. Removal of these constraints must be balanced with other health, safety, and welfare concerns.
Non-Governmental Constraints
Land Costs
Land costs are one of the major components of housing development costs. While land prices increased rapidly two planning periods ago, current land prices reflect the decline in land values attributed to the economic recession during the last planning period. . These lower land costs will help to keep the costs reasonable for some new housing in the next several years. Declining land costs should give developers more options in serving the affordable housing market segment.
Data gathered from Trulia.com and Realtor.com in February 2013 indicates that land in Auburn ranges from $45,800 for 0.5 acre to $399,000 for 17 acres. See the listings below.
Lot Size	Listing Price	Lot Size	Listing Price
0.5 acre	$54,800	2.14 acres	$229,000
0.72 acres	$119,000	8.3 acres	$199,000
1.3 acres	$80,000	17 acres	$399,000
Construction and Labor Costs
Many factors can affect the cost of building a house, including the type of construction, materials, site conditions, finishing details, amenities, and structural configuration.
An internet source of construction cost data (www.building-cost.net), provided by Craftsman Book Company, estimates the per square foot cost of a single-story home in the Auburn area, including construction materials and labor, ranges from $115 to $145 per square foot, depending on the size of the home. Excluding land costs, the Craftsman Book Company calculator estimates that a small three-bedroom tract house of 1,800 square feet would have a minimum cost of approximately $239,000 (including direct job costs, permits and utilities, plans and specs, and contractor markup). Based on the information above and including land costs, the minimum cost to produce a 1,800-square-foot tract home in Auburn would cost approximately $473,000.
The cost of raw land is $10,000 to $769,000 a unit. The cost variation is impacted by lot sizes, primary infrastructure needed for the area, and improvements to collector streets including landscaping, sound walls, and additional lanes.

Appendix A: Housing Needs Assessment
The Cost and Availability of Financing
The City believes there are no local constraints to the availability or cost of financing for home purchases or rehabilitation. Even in the city’s older neighborhoods, there are no barriers to obtaining financing for home purchase, improvement, or construction (other than customary underwriting considerations by lenders).
Financing for housing development is generally outside the influence of local government. Lending institutions operating in Placer County maintain branches in Auburn, but as with all other mortgage finance organizations, the interest rates they offer follow market conditions. In times of high interest rates, financing problems have been viewed as a major factor in housing constraints. The lack of financing at reasonable rates eliminates major segments of the population from securing housing.
The primary factor related to home finance affecting housing affordability and availability is the cost of borrowing money, i.e., interest rates. Historically, substantial changes in interest rates have correlated with swings in home sales. When interest rates decline, sales increase. The reverse has been true when interest rates increase. Over the past two decades, there has been a dramatic growth in alternative mortgage products, such as graduated mortgages and variable rate mortgages. These types of loans allow homeowners to take advantage of lower initial interest rates and qualify for larger home loans. Even during periods of high interest rates, these alternative products allow more buyers to qualify for homeownership, thus minimizing the swings in home sales that accompany changes in interest rates.
Nevertheless, the fixed interest rate mortgage remains the preferred type of loan, especially during periods of low, stable interest rates. Most governmental programs that seek to increase homeownership among low- and moderate-income households rely on loan products that provide fixed interest rates below prevailing market rates, either for the principal loan or for a second loan that provides part of the down payment for home purchase. Many programs offer deferred second loans to facilitate homeownership. Table A-33 shows interest rates for 15- and 30-year fixed loans in the Auburn area at various financial institutions. Interest rates change on a daily basis and those reflected in Table A-33 represent the rates on November 20, 2012. Annual percentage rates for a 15-year fixed loan based on an average loan amount of $300,000 ranged from 3.49 percent to 3.72 percent, while the interest rate for a 30-year fixed loan ranged from 3.57 percent to 4.03 percent.

Environmental Constraints
Most of the vacant parcels that are scattered throughout the city are surrounded by existing development and could be classified as infill. In addition, due to the topography of the city, vacant land could possibly have constraints that might include limited access, wetlands, native trees, and geologic conditions.
The City has historically been able to deal with these constraints and still provide affordable housing. For example, Palm Terrace includes 80 units of affordable housing built on 16.7 acres, of which nine of these acres are dedicated to open space due to the topography of the site, preservation of wetland habitat, and the protection of native oak trees.
The City included the effect of environmental constraints on the Baltimore Ravine Specific Plan area as it ascertained the residential development capacity to accommodate the City’s Regional Housing Needs Allocation. The adopted specific plan retained natural open space areas such as the Baltimore Ravine, which has steep topography and dense woodlands, and has located the higher-density developments (i.e., the MDR and HDR parcels) on the flatter and more open portions of the site. Mass grading is feasible for these MDR and HDR parcels, thereby helping to reduce development costs.

Appendix A: Housing Needs Assessment
Governmental Constraints
Governmental constraints include land use controls, building codes and their enforcement, site improvements, fees, exactions required of developers, and local processing and permit procedures. Land use controls may limit the amount or density of development, while building codes may set specific building standards that add material costs or limit building space on a site, thus increasing the cost of housing per unit.
Land Use Controls
The General Plan and Zoning Ordinance regulate land use in Auburn. All residential land use classifications pose a constraint to residential development in the sense that various conditions, building requirements, and limitations restrict a pure free market ability to construct housing. Land use regulations also have the potential of adding costs to construction, which indirectly may constrain housing. These impacts are measured against the general health and public safety served in adopting such regulations. The City’s zoning standards for single-family and multi-family development are no more restrictive than those of surrounding jurisdictions and have been determined by the City to establish minimum constraints in order to provide for adequate separation of buildings for fire protection, air and light between structures, and the intensity of development. The cumulative effect of the City’s implementation of these standards has not resulted in a serious constraint in providing housing to the various income levels, especially with the City’s demonstrated flexibility in allowing density bonuses and relaxed parking standards for affordable projects such as the Palm Terrace Apartments and the Mercy Auburn Senior Apartments.
Table A-35 provides a summary of Auburn’s residential zoning regulations, including building setback, height, and parking requirements for single-family and multi-family residential districts. The following is a description of the residential districts in the city and the allowable densities according to the city’s municipal code.
1.	Single-Family Residential District (R-l). Designates areas for single-family homes. Density ranges from zero to four units per acre.
2.	Two-Family Residential (Duplex) District (R-2). Designates areas for more intense residential uses. Appropriate land uses include higher-density single-family homes such as duplexes. Density ranges from zero to 10 units per acre.
3.	Medium-Density Multiple-Family Residential District (R-3). Designates areas for intense multifamily residential land uses. Density ranges from five to 15 units per acre.
Planned Unit Development
The Planned Unit Development (PUD) (Auburn Zoning Ordinance, § 159.080 et seq.) is intended to encourage innovations in residential development ahd renewal so that the growing demands for housing may be met by greater variety in the type, design, and layout of dwellings and by the conservation and more efficient use of open space. PUDs can be applied to the following types of residential uses:
• Single-family dwellings
January12014
City of Auburn Housing Element
A—40
Appendix A: Housing Needs Assessment
•	Two-family dwellings
•	Multiple (three or more) family dwellings
The combination of uses should be compatible with the intent of the General Plan of the City and result in a balanced and stable environment.
PUDs are approved under a use permit by the Planning Commission, with any appeals brought to the City Council for review. A PUD is not intended for properties that are less than one acre in size, unless the applicant can prove a hardship exists on the property that supports approval of a PUD. Such hardships include topographic constraints, preservation of natural features, or the construction or rehabilitation of existing housing for very low-, low-, and moderate-income persons. Standards for PUDs are identified below in Table A-34; they are used only as a guide and are not meant to be mandatory.

The City of Auburn encourages and facilitates the use of PUDs through the following incentives:
•	Density bonus
•	Modified site plan standards (e.g., reduced setbacks)
•	Variation in parking requirements
•	Use of clustering to increase density and reduce development costs
Planned Development combining districts encourage residential development at the upper end of the allowed density range within the applicable districts by allowing developers to vary from the stricter application of the development standards of the base zoning districts. This flexibility provides for and can promote cluster housing, zero lot lines, townhomes, and similar housing types that can be more difficult to develop with typical setbacks and lot coverage.

Development Standards
The City of Auburn regulates the type, location, and scale of residential development primarily through its Municipal Code. Zoning regulations are designed to protect and promote the health, safety, and general welfare of residents, as well as preserve the character and integrity of neighborhoods. The City does provide for flexibility and negotiates alternative development standards on a case-by-case basis. For example, the Mercy Senior Housing project (built in 2013) was approved as a Planned Unit Development which included a 400 percent density bonus, enabled apartments in an RI zone, authorized a 50 percent parking reduction, and allowed a building height variance of 10 feet (from 30 feet to 40 feet). The City’s development standards are not seen as a constraint to the development of housing.

Permitted Uses in Residential Zoning Districts
The Auburn Municipal Code designates permitted, non-permitted, and conditional uses for all developable use types in the city in relation to the City’s zoning categories (Table A-36).
•	Single-family dwellings are permitted in all residential districts.
•	Duplexes are permitted in the R-2 and R-3 districts; multi-family dwellings are permitted in R-3.
•	Second residential units are permitted by right in the R-l and AR zone .
•	Manufactured homes are permitted on a permanent foundation in the single-family residential (R-l) district. Manufactured homes located outside a mobile home park must conform to all residential use development standards for the R-l zoning district.
•	Small residential care facilities (up to six persons) are permitted in all residential districts. The City does not impose additional requirements for the use of such providers, nor do providers require a business license.
•	Dwelling groups (i.e., residential care facilities of seven or more persons) and boardinghouses are allowed in the R-3 zone with approval of a use permit. Use permits are reviewed and acted on by the Planning Commission. Typical processing time for a use permit is 12-16 weeks, though if there are no significant issues associated with the home, the time frame could be reduced to 8-12 weeks. No extra processing time is required and no extra processing fee (other than standard use permit fees) is required. In addition the City provides, without an application fee, an application for reduction or waiver of fees that is approved through the City Council.
•	Mobile home parks are allowed through a Conditional Use Permit in the R-l, R-2, and R-3 districts.
•	Transitional and supportive housing are permitted in the R-3 zone district as residential uses and are subject to the same restrictions that apply to similar housing types in the same zone.
•	Emergency shelters are permitted in the M-2 zone by right and without discretionary action.

Second Residential Unit Requirements
A second residential unit, often referred to as a “granny” unit, is a second living unit located on an existing residential lot. The purpose of a second residential unit is to provide a small, self-contained living unit that can be used by a family member or as a rental unit. A second residential unit is permitted on any lot that is zoned for single-family residential use (R-l) if there is an existing single-family dwelling. The second units are permitted by right, subject to administrative staff review for conformance with applicable zoning standards.

Manufactured Homes and Mobile Home Park Standards
Manufactured homes are permitted on a permanent foundation in the single-family residential (R-l) district. Manufactured homes located outside a mobile home park must conform to all residential use development standards for the R-l zoning district.
According to the Auburn Zoning Ordinance, a manufactured home should conform to the following criteria.
•	Conforms to all requirements for single-family structures in the R-l district.
•	Certified under the National Home Construction and Safety Act of 1974.
•	Size is at least 1,200 square feet.
■ Meets the standards of Title 24, California Energy Commission requirements.
•	Roof pitch is a minimum of 3.5 to 12, exterior siding is wood, floor joists are 18 inches from finished grade, and eave overhang is a minimum of 12 inches.
•	Occupancy is limited to single-family residential use only.
Mobile home parks are permitted subject to a use permit in any residential district when the mobile home park meets the provisions of Sections 159.058 and 159.059 in the City’s Municipal Code and any additional provisions that the Planning Commission may impose as part of the use permit process.
Supportive and Transitional Housing
Transitional housing means housing with supportive services that is exclusively designated and targeted for homeless persons. Transitional housing includes self-sufficiency development services, with the ultimate goal of moving homeless persons to permanent housing as quickly as possible. Assistance in the Supportive Housing Program is provided to help homeless persons meet three overall goals: 1) achieve residential stability; 2) increase their skill levels and/or incomes; and 3) obtain greater self-determination (i.e., more influence over decisions that affect their lives). The City will regulate supportive housing as a residential use, provided supportive services are ancillary to the primary use.
The City permits transitional and supportive housing types in the R-3 zone district as residential uses which are only subject to the same restrictions that apply to similar housing types in the same zone. To further comply with state law requirements, the City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to allow transitional and supportive housing types in all zones that allow for residential development (Program M).
Emergency Shelters for the Homeless
Emergency shelters are defined as “housing with minimal supportive services for homeless persons that is limited to occupancy of six months or less by a homeless person. No individual or households may be denied emergency shelter because of an inability to pay.”
The City permits permanent emergency shelters in the Regional Commercial - Emergency Shelter (C-3-ES) zone district by right (i.e. without discretionary action). The C-3-ES zone includes eight sites for a total of 9.2 acres, which is made up of nine parcels ranging in size from 0.14 to 2.35 acres, which may be
January 2014
City of Auburn Housing Element
A-45
Appendix A: Housing Needs Assessment
suitable for an emergency homeless shelter. These sites include one vacant lot, two under-developed lots, and five developed sites. The sites comprising the C-3-ES zone are centrally located near the City’s commercial core, include existing public improvements (e.g. curb, gutter, sidewalk), and have convenient access to transportation and other services. The use types allowed in the C-3-ES zone include a variety of commercial uses including retail, office, services, apartments and rental housing, hotels/motels, and large residential care facilities.
Off-Site Improvement Requirements
The City requires typical off-site improvements (e.g., curb, gutter, and sidewalk) for residential development to ensure public health and safety. Typical street widths are 43 feet for the right-of-way and 34 feet curb face to curb face with 4-foot-wide sidewalks, 6-inch curbs, and 18-inch gutters. Exceptions to these standards are allowed depending on certain factors. If the project contains topographic constraints, then the City has allowed for a reduction in street width and/or may only require a sidewalk on one side of the street. If a project is an infill development, a sidewalk may not be required if it’s not already present in the area. In the new Baltimore Ravine Specific Plan area, sidewalks will only be provided on one side of the street in some residential neighborhoods. The City’s off-site standards are not any more restrictive than those of surrounding jurisdictions and the City does not believe the off-site standards act as an impediment to the production of housing for lower-income households.
Water service is provided by Placer County Water Agency which establishes off-site improvement standards. Connection to City sewer is required for all single and multi-family projects if they are within 400 feet of existing sewer lines.
Building Codes
Building codes regulate the physical construction of dwellings and include plumbing, electrical, and mechanical divisions. The purpose of the building code and its enforcement is to protect the public from unsafe conditions associated with construction. The City of Auburn enforces the State Building Code standards (Title 24) for existing units, new construction, and residential rehabilitation. Housing-related complaints are dealt with on a case-by-case basis with the Building Department (i.e., the building inspector) becoming involved if the nature of the complaint involves building code issues.
State law affords local government some flexibility when adopting the uniform codes. The building codes can be amended based on geographical, topological, or climatic considerations. Further, state housing law provides that local building departments can authorize the use of materials and construction methods other that those specified in the uniform code if the proposed design is found to be satisfactory and the materials or methods are at least equivalent to that prescribed by the building codes. A review of the City’s amendments to the uniform codes (Chapter 150 of the Auburn Municipal Code) indicates that the amendments do not have a substantial impact on the cost of residential development. Auburn’s amendments to the State Building Code standards primarily concern a minimum 20-pound snow load required for roofs and “contributory areas” and weight loads on rafters. Areas less than 600 square feet which normally get reductions per the State Building Code due to application of contributory areas do not get this reduction in the City of Auburn.

Appendix A: Housing Needs Assessment
Code Enforcement
The City of Auburn Code Enforcement Officer works with the Police Department, Fire Department, Building Department, and Community Development Department to investigate reported violations of laws relating to nuisances and zoning, which typically includes illegal home occupations, illegal second units, dangerous structures, fence violations, illegal signs, graffiti, debris, and weeds, as well as inoperable and illegal vehicles. The code enforcement process is typically initiated in the following three ways: (1) observation by City staff; (2) as a consequence of an action (i.e., an application for a building permit or a request for a zoning variance); or (3) in response to a complaint by an individual. The City relies on residents to help identify the majority of the code violations.
Development Fees
The financing of public facilities and services for new development in Auburn, as in most California jurisdictions, is funded in part by exactions and fees levied against development projects in proportion to the anticipated fiscal impact on the community. In all instances, the fees are determined based on a proportional share of the cost necessary to fund capital improvements. In this sense, they are fixed overhead costs that cannot be reduced by policy. Although these fees are necessary to meet City standards, they can have substantial impact on the cost of housing, particularly affordable housing. Auburn charges a number of permit and development impact fees to cover the cost of processing development requests and providing public facilities and services to new developments. In creating a development fee structure, Auburn carefully balanced the need to offset the cost of public services with a level of fees that do not inhibit residential development. See Appendix F for a complete fee schedule and comparative fee schedules of surrounding jurisdictions. This comparison demonstrates that the City’s residential development fees (single family and multi-family) do not act as a constraint against building affordable housing and, as a result, fees have not affected the City’s competitiveness for affordable housing with neighboring jurisdictions.
Permit Processing Procedures
Applications for residential subdivisions are processed within a three- to four-month period; however, applications that are more complex may take 6 to 8 months because of project pre-planning, site constraints, and environmental review. Processing time is largely determined by the availability of staff time as well as the number and/or significance of project-related issues. The City of Auburn meets state-required timelines for the approval of development permits (Table A-37). Table A-38 provides the typical processing procedure by project type. The time required for development approval is not generally a constraint or substantial cost to housing developers.

To expedite permit processing procedures, City staff encourages pre-application development conferences to provide upfront feedback on proposed projects in order to increase approval certainty for applicants. Also, informational checklists detailing submittal requirements are provided to facilitate and streamline permit processing. Residential building permit information is on the City’s website as well.

Appendix A: Housing Needs Assessment
Land use and zoning designations for single-family and multi-family parcels are detailed in the General Plan and the Zoning Ordinance, which serve to make the permit processing procedure clear, certain, and predictable. Project applications requiring discretionary approvals by the Auburn Planning Commission and the Auburn City Council have been reviewed using specified criteria from the General Plan and the Zoning Ordinance. Over the previous housing cycle, the Planning Commission’s review and consideration of projects has been prompt and has not imposed an undue burden on development (e.g., through excessive processing delays or adding costs to development projects).
Design review and discretionary review runs concurrently to avoid project time delays. The design review process is deemed complete once a builder has fulfilled the necessary steps on the City’s Design Review Submittal Checklist. The submittal checklist streamlines the process and provides objective guidelines for the developer on the process and promotes approval certainty. The Old Town and Downtown design review districts maintain the aesthetic character of each area without requiring special or costly construction materials for compliance. New multi-family projects are subject to design review approval, though new single-family projects are not. Again, no special/costly building materials or presentation materials are required for compliance with the design review process.
The City’s permit processing, permit procedures, and design review have not been found to negatively impact a project or hold up the processing of an application.
Use Permit Process
Chapter 159.405 et seq. of the Auburn Municipal Code regulates the issuance of use permits. Applications are reviewed by the Planning Commission, which has the authority to approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove the application. The Planning Commission meets on the first and third Tuesdays of each month. Processing time for a Use Permit varies from two to four months depending on project complexity, issues, and whether additional environmental review is needed. Application fees for Use Permits range from $415 to $1,443. The focus of the Use Permit typically relates to neighborhood compatibility (i.e., architectural design, setbacks, parking, orientation, etc.). In the event that an applicant or any other interested party is not satisfied with the Planning Commission’s actions of a use permit, an action can be appealed to the City Council for review.
Following a public hearing, a use permit is subject to Findings by the Planning Commission, such as:
•	The proposed use is substantially similar in characteristic to a use or uses currently within the district.
•	The proposed use would be appropriate in the district applicable to the property as a permitted or conditional use.
•	The proposed use would not be detrimental to the health, safety, peace and morals, comfort, and general welfare of the community.
The Use Permit process addresses impacts of the use, not the user. This process does not act as a constraint to the development of affordable housing because:
•	It does not add significant time or delay to the approval of projects.
•	The Planning Commission addresses the findings that are described in Chapter 159.408 of the Municipal Code.
January 2014
City of Auburn Housing Element
A-49
Appendix A: Housing Needs Assessment
• The City’s Use Permit application packet provides clear direction on the process and standards for review.
If it is determined that a developer would need a Use Permit to proceed with City approvals, it is the City’s policy to provide as much information as possible. The City’s website (www.aubum.ca.gov) is a resource where project applicants can go to obtain further information and City contact phone numbers.
Housing for Persons with Disabilities
As noted in the Special Needs section of this Housing Needs Assessment report, persons with disabilities have a number of housing needs related to accessibility of dwelling units, access to transportation, employment, and commercial services, and alternative living arrangements that include on-site or nearby supportive living services.
The City ensures that new housing developments comply with California building standards (Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations) and federal ADA requirements for accessibility. Sites zoned for Medium and High Density Residential uses are typically located along arterial streets and transportation corridors to facilitate access and accessibility for persons with disabilities.
Procedures for Ensuring Reasonable Accommodations
The City of Auburn has established procedures to ensure that reasonable accommodations are made for persons with disabilities. In conjunction with plan check review, individuals with disabilities can request special accommodation or variance from building codes due to a disability. The City also ensures equal facilitation during the planning process as part of design review. For example, an apartment project located in the city was required to provide fixtures for ground-floor units that would accommodate persons with disabilities or that could easily be converted to accommodate such persons. The City’s reasonable accommodation procedures are separate from a variance or Conditional Use Permit and requests are approved administratively.
Efforts to Remove Regulatory Constraints for Persons with Disabilities
The State of California has removed any City discretion for review of small group home projects (six or fewer residents). The City does not impose additional zoning, building code, or permitting procedures other than those allowed by state law. There are no City-initiated constraints on housing for persons with disabilities caused or controlled by the City.
The City also allows residential retrofitting to increase the suitability of homes for persons with disabilities in compliance with ADA requirements. Such retrofitting is permitted under Chapter 11 of the 2007 Uniform Building Code. The City works with applicants who need special accommodations in their homes to ensure that application of building code requirements does not create a constraint. The City’s Zoning Ordinance has been reviewed for Chapter 11 compliance and determined to be compliant.
January 2014
City of Auburn Housing Element
A-50
Appendix A: Housing Needs Assessment
Information Regarding Accommodation for Zoning, Permit Processing, and Building Codes
The City implements and enforces Title 24 of the 2010 California Code, which is very similar to ADA. The City provides information to applicants or those inquiring of City regulations regarding accommodations in zoning, permit processes, and application of building codes for persons with disabilities.
Zoning and Other Land Use Regulations
The City of Auburn periodically conducts comprehensive reviews of its zoning laws, policies, and practices for compliance with fair housing law. The City has not identified zoning or other land use regulatory practices that could discriminate against persons with disabilities and impede the availability of such housing for these individuals.
Examples of the ways in which the City facilitates housing for persons with disabilities through its regulatory and permitting processes are:
•	The City allows some variation from the application of its parking standards. For example, a reduction in the parking requirements for a unique use such as a senior housing project can be approved by processing a variance or a use permit (for a planned unit development).
•	Similarly, Section 159.169. Facilities: Minimum Dimensions provides the Community Development Department with the authority to establish and approve parking stalls and maneuvering areas other than those set in the ordinance. An example would be a reduction in the width of a drive aisle when associated with vehicle overhang into a landscape area.
•	All of the City’s commercial zones allow group homes. The City has no authority to approve or deny group homes of six persons or fewer, except for compliance with building code requirement, which are also governed by the State of California.
•	The City does not restrict occupancy of unrelated individuals in group homes.
•	The City permits housing for special needs groups, including for individuals with disabilities, without regard to distances between such uses or the number of uses in any part of the city. The Land Use Element of the General Plan does not restrict the siting of special needs housing.
•	The City provides for reasonable accommodations
Permits and Processing
The City does not impose special permit procedures or requirements that could impede the retrofitting of homes for accessibility. The City’s requirements for building permits and inspections are the same as for other residential projects and are fairly simple and straightforward. City officials are not aware of any instances in which an applicant experienced delays or rejection of a retrofitting proposal for accessibility to persons with disabilities.
City of Auburn Housing Element
January 2014
A-51
Appendix A: Housing Needs Assessment
As discussed above, the City allows group homes of six or fewer persons by right, as required by state law. No Use Permit or other special permitting requirements apply to such homes.
The City does not impose special occupancy permit requirements for the establishment or retrofit of structures for residential use by persons with disabilities. If structural improvements were required for an existing group home, a building permit would be required. If a new structure were proposed for a group home use, design review would be required as for any other new residential structure. To the City’s knowledge, its design review process has not been used to deny or substantially modify a housing project for persons with disabilities to the point where it is no longer feasible.
Design review is not required for single-family residential development. All multi-family residential projects in Auburn require design review by the Planning Commission. The design review process typically takes three to four months. The hearing process for group homes and special needs housing for persons with disabilities is the same as for other residential projects.
Building Codes
The City provides reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities in the enforcement of building codes and the issuance of building permits through its flexible approaches to retrofitting or converting existing buildings and construction of new buildings that meet the shelter needs of persons with disabilities. The City of Auburn adopted and implemented the 2010 California Building Code Volumes 1 and 2, including Appendix Chapters B and C, which are mandated by the state. The only additions to the uniform code that the City has adopted are:
•	No reductions are permitted under Table 16c for slope and area or structural members of tributary loading under 600 square feet.
•	A bedroom is redefined as “room with a bed or a closet, whether built-in or free-standing.”
•	Wood shakes and shingles are not allowed in new construction.
•	Minimum roof coverings for all types of construction.
•	Permit fees are to be established by City Council resolution.
•	Ground snow load equals 20 pounds per square foot.
Universal Design Element
Universal design is mainly customer-driven for single-family residential, while the Building Code has provisions for the inclusion of universal design in multi-family projects. The City promotes universal design by encouraging developers of senior housing, persons with disabilities, and other persons and families applying for building permits to consider universal design in their construction.
Conclusion
In light of current and proposed planning policies and zoning regulations, the City believes that it has mitigated any potential constraints to the availability of housing for persons with disabilities.

Appendix A: Housing Needs Assessment
Parking Requirements
Section 159.165 describes the parking requirements for residential uses in the city. A permit is required for the establishment of any off-street parking area other than for single- or two-family dwellings (Section 159.166). Single-family (R-l) and multiple-family (R-2 and R-3) dwelling units require two off-street parking spaces per dwelling unit (garages are not required). The off-street parking space required for any lot in which a single- or multi-family dwelling is built may not be provided in the required front or street side yard area (Section 159.171). Rooming houses require one parking space for every two guest rooms or four beds for guests, whichever requires the greater number of parking spaces. Nursing and convalescent homes require one parking space for every two patient beds. Parking requirements in the city are not considered excessive or a constraint on residential development. The City, on a case-by-case basis regularly provides for parking flexibility. Most recently, the Mercy Senior Housing (built in 2013) project was developed with a 50 percent parking reduction.
Design Review
Section 159.110 et seq. of the Auburn Municipal Code describes the process for design review in the city. Design review ensures that new development will be consistent with the City’s General Plan policies for the proper protection, enhancement, and use of places, sites, buildings, and structures. The City’s Municipal Code is explicit as to the guidelines and procedures that must be followed during the design review process. This clarity of language gives the applicant certainty that if the guidelines and procedures in the Municipal Code are followed correctly, a successful design review process will be the outcome.
The City’s Municipal Code and Design Review application packet are explicit as to the guidelines, procedures, and filing deadlines that must be followed throughout the design review process. The City’s design review process does not act as a constraint to the overall supply and affordability of housing in Auburn because:
•	Design review does not add significant time or delay to project approval.
•	Design review does not add to or modify development standards in Section 159.110 of the Municipal Code or standards in the applicable General Development Plan.
•	Design review criteria are explicit and understandable.
The City does not take an excessive amount of time in processing design review applications, nor does the City require costly building materials. The City also encourages design review to be conducted concurrently with other processing procedures to expedite the development permit process even further. The City believes that sufficient design review principles are in place to process and facilitate the full spectrum of affordable, moderate, and higher-income housing.
To protect Auburn’s stock of historic and architecturally significant structures in the Old Town and Downtown historic areas, the City adopted a Historic Preservation Ordinance in November 2004. The ordinance applies to multi-family structures within the Historic Design Review District as well as singlefamily residential structures that have been voluntarily designated a historic resource by the property owner. Activities subject to historic design review include:
•	Construction of all new buildings or structures.

Appendix A: Housing Needs Assessment
•	Alterations, remodeling, or additions to existing structures.
•	Replacement of building materials with different materials (including re-roofing of buildings).
•	Painting of buildings if the color(s) used are not similar to the existing colors.
•	Sign permits.
•	Modifications to existing Historic Design Review Permits.
The Historic Design Review Commission is the reviewing authority for Historic Design Review Permits. The commission includes the Planning Commission members and four at-large members (one architect, one member of the historical society, one real property owner from the Downtown Historic District, and one real property owner from the Old Town Historic District).
Some projects located in the Historic Design Review District do not require a Historic Design Review Permit and are instead reviewed administratively by the Community Development Director. Qualifying projects include minor modifications to existing site improvements (i.e. parking lot re-striping), exterior painting on buildings or structures if the color(s) are similar to existing colors, replacement of building materials with similar materials, sidewalk replacement, landscaping, temporary signs for special events, and projects delegated by the Planning Commission.
A Design Review Permit takes 12 to 16 weeks; administrative design review takes one to three weeks, while historic design review takes two to four weeks. Applicants are strongly encouraged by the City to meet with members of the Public Works and Fire Departments during the pre-application process to identify pertinent issues. If the applicant or any other interested party is not satisfied with the action of the Planning Commission or the Historic Design Review Commission, an action to appeal can be filed to be brought before the City Council.
Pre-development Review
In order to facilitate the design review process, the City of Auburn offers applicants the opportunity for preliminary design review through submittal of a pre-development application. The pre-development application is not a prerequisite for formal submittal of an application, but is provided to facilitate City comments on a development request prior to preparation of detailed plans for formal design review. The City's pre-development review focuses on identifying basic design issues, appropriateness and intensity of intended development, and unique project-related conditions likely to affect development. Any comments generated for pre-development review are intended to supersede more detailed comments generated during the normal design review process. The time frame for completing pre-development review is typically two to four weeks, depending on the nature of the request. Written comments are provided as part of pre-development review and are generally valid for 180 days, except where modifications to ordinances or adopted policies may occur.

Energy Conservation Opportunities
The opportunities for energy conservation stem primarily from the fact that most of the future residential development will occur on land that is not constrained by existing roads and infrastructure. Energy conservation can be achieved, therefore, through site development planning to reduce the need for vehicular trips by:
•	Providing pedestrian access to commercial and recreational facilities.
•	Providing mixed-use development.
•	Providing for higher densities that would make public transit economically feasible.
•	Requiring landscaping to control solar gain in buildings and on pavement, channel wind, and provide comfortable microclimates that limit dependence on artificial heating and cooling systems.
•	Providing allowances for mass site grading in the Baltimore Ravine Specific Plan to allow for an increase in the densities actually developed, higher than those historically seen in the city.
•	Providing higher density housing in the Baltimore Ravine Specific Plan: 1) along transit corridors; 2) close to jobs; 3) and close to services and amenities.
Energy conservation features are incorporated into the design of residential structures in the City of Auburn due to the requirements of Title 24. These measures include low-flow plumbing fixtures, efficient heating and cooling opportunities, dual pane windows, and adequate insulation and weather stripping. Incorporating new technology within residential developments offers developers a chance to design projects that allow for maximum energy conservation opportunities.
General Design Standards
There are many opportunities for conserving energy in new and existing homes. New buildings, by design, can easily incorporate energy-efficient techniques into the construction. According to the Department of Energy, the concept of energy efficiency in buildings is the building envelope, which is everything that separates the interior of the building from the outdoor environment: the doors, windows, walls, foundation, roof, and insulation. All the components of the building envelope need to work together to keep a building warm in the winter and cool in the summer.
Constructing new homes with energy conserving features, in addition to retrofitting existing structures, will result in a reduction in monthly utility costs. There are many ways to determine how energy efficient an existing building is and, if needed, what improvements can be made. Examples of energy-conservation opportunities include installation of insulation and/or storm windows and doors, use of natural gas instead of electricity, installation or retrofitting of more efficient appliances and mechanical or solar energy systems, and building design and orientation which incorporates energy-conservation considerations.
Many modem building design methods are used to reduce residential energy consumption and are based on proven techniques. These methods can be categorized in three ways:
1.	Building design that keeps natural heat in during the winter and keeps natural heat out during the summer. Such design reduces air conditioning and heating demands. Proven building techniques in this category include:
January 2014
City of Auburn Housing Element
A-55
Appendix A: Housing Needs Assessment
•	Location of windows and openings in relation to the path of the sun to minimize solar gain in the summer and maximize solar gain in the winter.
•	Use of “thermal mass,” earthen materials such as stone, brick, concrete, and tiles that absorb heat during the day and release heat at night.
•	Use of window coverings, insulation, and other materials to reduce heat exchange between the interior of a home and the exterior.
•	Location of openings and the use of ventilating devices that take advantage of natural air flow (particularly cool evening breezes).
•	Use of eaves and overhangs that block direct solar gain through window openings during the summer but allow solar gain during the winter.
•	Zone heating and cooling systems, which reduce heating and cooling in the unused areas of a home.
2.	Building orientation that uses natural forces to maintain a comfortable interior temperature. Examples include:
•	North-south orientation of the long axis of a dwelling.
•	Minimizing the southern and western exposure of exterior surfaces.
•	Location of dwellings to take advantage of natural air circulation and evening breezes.
3.	Use of landscaping features to moderate interior temperatures. Such techniques include:
•	Use of deciduous shade trees and other plants to protect the home.
•	Use of natural or artificial flowing water.
•	Use of trees and hedges as windbreaks.
In addition to natural techniques, a number of modem methods of energy conservation have been developed or advanced during the present century. These include:
•	Use of solar energy to heat water.
•	Use of radiant barriers on roofs to keep attics cool.
•	Use of solar panels and other devices to generate electricity.
•	High efficiency coating on windows to repel summer heat and trap winter warmth.
•	Weather-stripping and other insulation to reduce heat gain and loss.
•	Use of natural gas for dryers, stovetops, and ranges.
•	Use of energy-efficient home appliances.
•	Use of low-flow showerheads and faucet aerators to reduce hot water use.
Natural space heating can be substantially increased through the proper location of windows and thermal mass. Use of solar panels can generate 1,000 watts of electricity on a sunny day. This can constitute more than enough power for daily residential operations.

APPENDIX B: GLOSSARY
U.S. Census Terms
The following terms have been defined by the U.S. Census for interpreting data found in Census reports and tables. These definitions are generally current. For reports based on earlier surveys, especially those published before 1990, the user should consult the printed reports for those years. As reports and surveys continue to evolve, definitions may also alter to accommodate these changes. These definitions can be further examined on the U.S. Census website at www.census.gov.
Own Children - A child under 18 years old who is a son or daughter by birth, marriage (a stepchild), or adoption. For 100-percent tabulations, own children consist of all sons/daughters of householders who are under 18 years of age. For sample data, own children consist of sons/daughters of householders who are under 18 years of age and who have never been married, therefore, numbers of own children of householders may be different in these two tabulations.
Related Children - Includes all people in a household under the age of 18, regardless of marital status, who are related to the householder. Does not include householder's spouse or foster children, regardless of age.
Ethnic Origin or Race - Ethnic origin refers to an individual’s self-identification of their origin or descent, “roots,” heritage, or place where the individual or his/her parents or ancestors were bom. Respondents could report their ethnic group regardless of the number of generations removed from their place of origin. Responses to this question reflected the groups with which respondents identified and not necessarily the degree of attachment or association the individual had with the particular group(s).
Family - A group of two or more people who reside together and who are related by birth, marriage, or adoption.
Family household (Family) - A family includes a householder and one or more people living in the same household who are related to the householder by birth, marriage, or adoption. All people in a household who are related to the householder are regarded as members of his or her family. A family household may contain people not related to the householder, but those people are not included as part of the householder’s family. Thus, the number of family households is equal to the number of families, but family households may include more members than do families. Not all households contain families since a household may comprise a group of unrelated people or one person living alone.
Group Quarters - The Census Bureau classifies all people not living in housing units as living in group quarters. There are two types of group quarters: institutional group quarters (for example, correctional facilities for adults, nursing homes, and hospice facilities) and noninstitutional group quarters (for example, college/university student housing, military quarters, and group homes,).
Household - A household includes all the people who occupy a housing unit as their usual place of residence.
Householder - The person, or one of the people, in whose name the home is owned, being bought, or rented. If there is no such person present, any household member 15 years old and over can serve as the householder. Two types of householders are distinguished: a family householder and a nonfamily householder.

Appendix B: Glossary
A family householder is a householder living with one or more people related to him or her by birth, marriage, or adoption. The householder and all people in the household related to him are family members.
A nonfamily householder is a householder living alone or with nonrelatives only.
Mean Income - Mean income is the amount obtained by dividing the total income of a particular statistical universe by the number of units in that universe. Thus, mean household income is obtained by dividing total household income by the total number of households. For the various types of income, the means are based on households having those types of income.
Median Income — The median income divides the income distribution into two equal groups, one having incomes above the median, and other having incomes below the median..
Marital Status - Adults are generally classified as being married, never married, separated, divorced or widowed.
Poverty - Following the Office of Management and Budget’s (OMB’s) Directive 14, the Census Bureau uses a set of money income thresholds that vary by family size and composition to determine who is in poverty. If the total income for a family or unrelated individual falls below the relevant poverty threshold, then the family (and every individual in it) or unrelated individual is considered in poverty.
Race - The data on race were derived from answers to the question on race that was asked of all people. The U.S. Census Bureau collects race data in accordance with guidelines provided by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and these data are based on self-identification. The racial categories included in the census questionnaire generally reflect a social definition of race recognized in this country, and not an attempt to define race biologically, anthropologically, or genetically. In addition, it is recognized that the categories of the race item include racial and national origin or socio-cultural groups.. Tenure - Refers to the distinction between owner-occupied and renter-occupied housing units.
Units in Structure - A structure is a separate building that either has open spaces on all sides or is separated from other structures by dividing walls that extend from ground to roof. In determining the number of units in a structure, all housing units, both occupied and vacant, are counted.
Unmarried Partner - An unmarried partner is a person age 15 years and over, who is not related to the householder, who shares living quarters, and who has an intimate relationship with the householder. Same-sex spouses are included in this category for tabulation purposes and for public use data files.

APPENDIX F: 2013 FEE SCHEDULE
Community Development Department Residential
Development Fee Schedule
The following is the criteria upon which building permit amounts are based and the procedure followed in arriving at the cost of a permit for a new single-family or multi-family residences within the Aubum city limits. While fees represent a substantial part of residential construction costs, Auburn’s fees are in line with or lower than those charged in neighboring jurisdictions. The City has some of the lowest planning fees within the region. Auburn’s fees do not act as a constraint to the construction of affordable housing and have not affected the City’s competitiveness with neighboring communities in producing affordable housing.
Valuation - Single Family
The following amounts are used by the Building Department to arrive at the valuation of a single-family structure. Each figure is multiplied by the square footage of the specified area.
•	$101.90 per square foot-Dwelling
•	$ 39.06 per square foot - Garage
•	$ 17.57 per square foot - Deck/Covered Patio/Carport
2,000 square foot house x $101.90 =	$203,800
500 square foot garage x $ 39.06 =	$19,530
200 square foot deck x $17.57	=	$3.514
Total Value $226,844
•	Building permit fee is 1 percent of the valuation, in this case $2,268.44
•	A plan check fee is collected when plans are brought in and is based on 65 percent of the building permit fee. (Ex: 65 percent of $2,268.44= $1,474.49 for the plan check.)
Valuation - Multi-Family
The following amounts are used by the Building Department to arrive at the valuation of a multi-family unit. Each figure is multiplied by the square footage of the specified area.
•	$101.90 per square foot - Dwelling
•	$17.57 per square foot - Deck/Covered Patio/Carport
1,040 square foot unit x $101.90 =	$105,976
85 square foot deck x $ 17.57 =	$1,493.45
Total Value $107,469.45
•	Building permit fee is 1 percent of the valuation, in this case $1,074.69.
•	A plan check fee is collected when plans are brought in and is based on 65 percent of the building permit fee. (Ex: 65 percent of $1,074.69= $698.55 for the plan check.)

OPEN SPACE/CONSERVATION
Auburn Ravine
1. Mwductta
The purpose of the City of Auburn’s Conservation and Open Space Element is to develop policies and programs for the efficient management of natural resources and any areas of land which are essentially unimproved and devoted to open space. Although the conservation and natural resource elements can be prepared as separate documents, for this update of the City of Auburn General Plan they have been combined in a single element. Nevertheless, the legally required content of each element has been included in this document as required by Government Code Sections 65302(d) and 65302(e). This element was prepared by the Placer County Resource Conservation District in cooperation with the City of Auburn and Placer County.

Required Content of the Conservation and Open Space Element
The content of a conservation element is set forth in California Code Section 65302(d). This statute requires that the element contain proposals for the conservation, development, and use of natural resources, including, "... water and its hydraulic force, forests, soils, rivers and other waters, fisheries, wildlife, minerals and other natural resources.” Additionally, the law requires coordination with any county wide water agency and with all districts and city agencies which develop, serve, control or conserve water for any purpose within the area covered by the plan. The law lists several additional subjects which may be in the element, including:
•	the reclamation of land and water;
•	prevention and control of pollution of streams and other waters;
•	regulation of the use of land in stream channels and other areas required for the accomplishment of the Conservation Plan;
•	prevention, control and correction of soil erosion;
•	protection of watersheds; and
•	the location, quantity and quality of rock, sand and gravel resources.
The preparation of an open space element is also mandated by law (Government Code Section 65302(e)). The purpose of an open space element is to identify policies and proposals for any area of land or water which is essentially unimproved and devoted to an open space use. The law further defines open space land as any of the following:
•	Open space for the preservation of natural resources, including areas required for the preservation of plant and animal life; areas required for ecologic and other scientific study purposes; rivers, streams, lake shores, banks of rivers and streams, and watershed lands.
•	Open space for outdoor recreation, including areas of outstanding scenic, historic and cultural value; areas suited for park and recreation purposes, including access to lake shores and rivers and streams; and areas which provide links between major recreation and open space areas, including utility easements, banks of rivers and streams, trails, and scenic highway corridors.
•	Open space for public health and safety, including areas which require special management or regulation because of hazardous or special conditions such as earthquake fault zones, unstable soil areas, floodplains, watersheds, high fire risk areas, areas required for the protection of water quality, and areas required for the protection and enhancement of air quality.

Natural Resources
Soils
The rate and amount of soil formed are a function of the soil’s parent material, climate, slope, biological activity, drainage and time. In combination, these components are the principle factors which determine a soil’s unique characteristics.
Because soil types have different properties, they present a broad range of opportunities and limitations for future development. A particular soil’s suitability for use will vary
3, 1993

r

depending upon its slope, depth, fertility, available water holding capacity, texture, erosion potential and other physical and chemical attributes.
The USDA Soil Conservation Service (SCS) has developed a soil classification system which assigns soils to one of eight capability classes. The highest quality soils (classes I and n) are those which present few limitations when used for field crops, pose a low risk of damage and respond well to standard agricultural treatment. The soils that are best for agriculture are also best for urban uses because they offer few limitations for construction activities and provide the best medium for septic disposal systems.
There are few prime soils in the study area. The absence of Class I and II soils, however, is not considered a predetermination that agricultural uses are unimportant economically or less important than urban uses. Rather, the absence of these soils means that contention for "best use" Is highly competitive and only generally determined by soil limitation.
Soil limitations (physical and chemical) are typically recognized as constraints to urban development and generally include the following considerations:
Water features and relationships:
Engineering properties:
Sanitary waste absorption properties:
Properties to support wildlife: and
Properties to support woodland, rangeland, agriculture.
Information for each of these limitations is included in Placer County’s Soil Survey and discussed in general terms by the Soil Conservation Service. For the Auburn General Plan update, the 52 individual soil types found in the planning area were summarized from the Soil Survey by the series within which each soil type occurs. (See Supporting Documentation.) The characteristics of each soil series were described along with selected constraints, including erosion hazard, water quality related to accelerated erosion, slope, vegetation loss, and agricultural resources. The soils map is included as Figure VII-1 (please note that a full-size copy of this figure is available for public review at the City of Auburn Community Development Department).
Erosion Hazard
Accelerated erosion is a problem in much of the study area. It is important to remember that erosion potential is always present and occurs when soils are disturbed and protective vegetative cover is removed. A number of complex factors are considered by the SCS when they assign erosion hazard ratings to predict how soils will erode in relation to specific kinds of land uses and treatment.

Table VII-1 lists each of the soils in the plan area by their propensity to erode. Figure VII-2, Erosion Hazards, shows that very high ratings have been given to those soils in the American River Basin (please note that a full-size copy of this figure is available for public review at the City of Auburn Community Development Department). These particular soils are Aubum-Sobrante Rock outcrop complex and are within the administrative jurisdiction of the Bureau of Reclamation. Soils with high erosion potential within watersheds of Auburn Ravine and North Ravine are Auburn and Boomer Series and are generally in the western portion of these watersheds. The headwaters of the Dry Creek Basin contain Josephine and Mariposa, as well as Auburn and Boomer Series soils that have high erosion potential. An outcropping of Henneke Rock Outcrop complex occurs just north of the Auburn Airport within the basin.

It is within hydraulic basins that overgrazing, road construction, shaping of building pads, grading for transportation systems, and construction for utilities are responsible for accelerating erosion. Accelerated erosion is of concern because movement of eroded soil will lead to destruction of wildlife habitat, change the capacity of streams to provide for proper flood control, cany pollutants to streams and rivers thereby reducing water quality, and reduce agricultural and timber production. Figure VII-6, shown later in the text, has been prepared to show major drainage basins and sub-basins. Those areas which have a predominance of high and moderate erosion hazard potential can be readily seen by comparing Figure VII-2 with Figure VEf-6.	*

Slope
Figure VII-3 shows various slope categories in the planning area. Accelerated erosion has occurred on all slopes and the rate of soil loss varies by percent of slope and soil type (please note that a full-size copy of this figure is available for public review at the City of Auburn Community Development Department). The correlation between moderate and high erosion hazard potential and slopes of 15 to 30 percent and over 30 percent is evident. When combined, the effects of accelerated soil loss may rapidly change the ability of streams to maintain proper channel capacity for flood flows. Slopes over 30 percent can cause additional problems of stability, slumps and slides. Surfacing septic drainage has led to specific requirements for review of proposed rural subdivisions.
High erosion hazard with slopes over 30 percent leads to constraints for urban development which affect water quality, soil loss and leach field limitations.
AGRICULTURAL RESOURCES
The northwest and northeast portions of the planning area remain in grazing where large parcels still exist and rural residential encroachment is limited. Most grazing lands consist of Class IV and VI soils. Some properties are also subject to the Williamson Act. There are 18 Williamson Act contracts in the planning area constituting 1,323 acres. (See Figure VII-4.)
In addition, the planning area contains soils of statewide or local importance, and unique farmlands devoted to agricultural commodities such as oranges, apples, truck crops, pears, Christinas trees, or irrigated pasture.
Only about 40 acres in the planning area are classified as prime soils. This small area of Sierra sandy loam (class i) is located north of Oak Road and has little significance in terms of agriculture potential. Table VII-2 lists prime and statewide important soils.

Forestry
Forestry begins with an understanding of the soils on which trees grow. Some soils are very suitable for growing wood crops while others barely support tree cover. The probability of seedling survival, the danger of erosion, the resistance of trees to wind, and the problems of equipment use are some of the management items that can be inferred from soils information. These interpretations are expressed as ratings. They can be developed for each of these management considerations on a soil unit.
Simply expressed, productivity potential is the ability of a soil to produce a wood crop; in this case, the most suitable species for the Auburn area is Ponderosa pine (Pinus Ponderosa). The productivity of a particular soil is obtained by determining the site index (a numeric expression of the potential height of a tree at a given age, usually 100 years). The higher the site index the more productive the soil. It can also be interpreted in terms of board feet per acre, cords per acre, or cubic feet per acre.
A more generalized method of expressing productivity is the Site Classification System. It is widely used by the California Department of Forestry and the private forestry sector. Site Classes range from Class I (the most productive) to Class V (essentially, economically nonproductive) and are determined from the site indices.
Soils in the planning area suitable for timber production include the Boomer, Mariposa, and Sites series. They are located in the north and eastern portions of the planning area. The principal timber species is Ponderosa pine, which is also the principle component of the montane hardwood-conifer vegetation communiiy. From a timber productivity standpoint, these soils are Site Class in and IV. Some of these soils with north or eastern aspects may fall into Site Class n, but their acreage is limited.
As overall urban growth continues, these timber soils will continue to be very desirable areas for urbanization and rural living. Their value for aesthetics and open space far exceeds their timber production value.
Geology
As shown in Figure VII-5, the study area lies within the Mother Lode Belt of the Sierra Nevada foothills (a full-size copy of this figure is available for public review at the City of Auburn Community Development). The geologic structure consists mostly of metamorphic rock units that dip nearly vertical and trend 20 to 30 degrees west-of-north. The majorily of the rock consists of hard metavolcanic flows, commonly called "greenstone", that contain numerous thin discontinuous bands of soft metavolcanic tuffs and soft-to-hard metasedimentary beds. The latter, which occur mostly in the vicinity of Auburn and Clipper Gap, consists of metasandstone, metashale, cherty limestone, and slate.
A highly irregular zone of serpentine extends from Auburn along Highway 49. The zone, which has an average width of one mile, consists of two to five bifurcating branches of hard serpentine that enclose irregular lens-shaped areas of metavolcanic flows and

metasedimentary beds. The serpentine appears to have been intruded parallel to the metamorphic structure along an ancient vertical fault zone.
Granitic rock units occur in the northeast and southwest comers of the planning area. Sugar Pine Mountain is an oval area composed of granodiorite. The granitic rock in the southwest consists of quartz diorite that is part of the large granitic mass that underlies Loomis Basin and extends north to Mount Pleasant.
Sedimentary rock units consist of the Mehrten Conglomerate, a channel gravel of an ancestral American River that has been cemented, weathered, and extensively eroded since it was uplifted to its present position. Only a few remnants of the river channel remain north of Auburn. The major deposit extends from Skyridge along Indian Ridge to Newcastle. Remnants occur as caprock, locally overlainby Mehrten Mudflow Breccia, on hills and ridges in and bordering the Loomis Basin.
Surficial deposits consist of Stream Channel Deposits of gravel along Bear River and the North Fork of the American River; Terrace Deposits of sand and gravel that indicate former higher stands of streams that drain the area; and Landslide Deposits that mostly are inactive and occur along the steep canyon slopes of the American River.
The planning area is bordered on the north by the 200- to 400-foot deep canyon of the Bear River. Canyon slopes are steep in the vicinity of Sugar Pine Mountain and moderately steep near the Highway 49 bridge. The North Fork of the American River forms the southeastern border of the plan area. The canyon is entrenched 800 to 1,000 feet below the surrounding upland and canyon slopes are steep to very steep.
The metamorphic terrain between the two river canyons slopes gently southwest from a high elevation of 2,100 feet in the northeast to 1,100 feet in the southwest near Newcastle. Drainage is well integrated to a few major streams that flow generally westward across the metamorphic structure. Most of the former elongated northwest-southeast ridges have been dissected into isolated irregular hills, peaks and knobs. Bald Hill and Duncan Hill in the southwest and the irregular ridge south of Dry Creek are examples.
In general, the hills slope directly to an adjacent stream or drainage channel without any intervening floodplain. The streams are eroding bedrock in their downcutting stage; stream channel deposits of sand and gravel are therefore sparse and insufficient as a resource. Floodplains are very narrow, on the order of 8 to 20 feet, and generally well-marked. Terrace deposits of sand and gravel that mark an ancient higher stand of the stream are sparse and very narrow except in some locations where houses are constructed on them as along Millertown Road near a tributary to North Ravine; adjacent to Dry Creek for two miles downstream from Halsey Afterbay; and in a few areas along Orr Creek as it runs through Christian Valley.	t

Geologic Hazards
Landslides
Geologic hazards within the planning area are presently limited to small slumps, block slides, and landslides within metamorphic rock; slumps, occasional block slides, and erosional gullying within weathered granitic rock; and slumps or small slides within the intensely fractured serpentine. The occurrence of these features will increase as land values increase and more and more building sites are excavated on natural hillsides. The deeper the excavations, the more the weaknesses of underlying rock masses are exposed for potential failure.
Active Faults and Earthquakes
The San Andreas Fault in San Francisco and the Hayward Fault in the east Bay area are 100 and 94 miles, respectively, from Auburn. Maximum credible earthquakes along these faults projected at magnitude 8.25 for the San Andreas and 7.5 for the Hayward, would produce barely perceptible shock and bedrock acceleration at Auburn (less than 0.05g). The closest identified "potentially active" faults (where movement has occurred within the past two million years), are the Bear Mountain Fault and the Melones Faults, which are situated approximately three to four miles westerly and easterly from Auburn. The closest identified "active fault" (where movement has occurred within the past 11,000 years) is the Cleveland Hills Fault, situated approximately 36 miles northwesterly of Auburn. Most recently, the Cleveland Hills fault was the source of the 1975 Oroville earthquake (Richter Magnitude: 5.7). Active faults located between 50 and 100 miles of the site include the Mohawk Valley Fault, the Stampede Valley Fault, and the Fort Sage Fault; all located northeast of Auburn. Given the relationship to these various active faults, there is a high potential that the area will be subject to at least moderate earthquake shaking one or more times over the next centuiy.
HYDROLOGY
Ground Water
Rural residential uses in the northern and western portion of the planning area generally depend on groundwater for domestic needs. Ground water in sufficient quantities to supply domestic requirements occurs only along open fractures within metamorphic and granitic rock units. Terrace deposits are of insufficient occurrence to provide a significant ground water supply, although there may be a few water wells producing from these surficial deposits along Dry Creek.
The sedimentary rock unit is of insufficient extent to provide a ground water resource in this area. Permeability is very low because of high cementation of particles. The volcanic rock unit is impermeable and contains no ground water. Surface water does penetrate to the underlying conglomerate along open vertical joints that occur within this mudflow.

Vagi Vfr-Z3

r
The predominant rock type in the planning areas is metamorphic. The depth at which ground water flows occur in metamorphic rock varies significantly. About 25 percent of domestic wells are completed at less than 90 feet and 75 percent at less than 160 feet. The fact that significant flows are reported for a few wells (less than io percent), at depths greater than 160 feet, indicates that there is reason for drilling deeper when the occurrence of additional water has been predicted and the need is sufficiently high. The average production figure reported is 14-15 gallons per minute (gpm).
There is also a significant amount of granitic rock in the plan area. The most common depth intervals at which ground water is encountered in the granitic rocks are 60 to 70 feet. The average production for granitic rock well within the planning area is 9 to 10 gpm.
In general, well water in the area is of moderate to high quality. The only problem areas encountered have been in serpentine rock where ground water can be salty and brackish. Competent assistance regarding well location and construction should be obtained by individuals planning to use wells as a domestic water source.
Sur/hce Supplies
The Placer County Water Agency (PCWA) supplies surface water to the planning area for domestic purposes. Water is supplied to treatment plants at Bowman and Auburn. The PCWA staff has presented a report outlining the need for new treatment capacity to serve expected growth which includes alternatives for system expansion.
Water Quality
Surface water flows around and through the area from the Bear River on the north, American River on the south, Orr, Dry, and Rock Creek in the middle portion of the area and Auburn and North Ravine in the southern portion of the plan area. Surface water quality has decreased due to impacts from mans’ activities, which include increased sedimentation, improper use of herbicides, pesticides and fertilizers, as well as inadequate filtration of septic tank leach field systems.
Occurrence and quality of groundwater is greatly variable due to the complex geology in the plan area. There are no aquifers due to shallow soils and dense bedrock. Groundwater is found in surface fractures and cracks in the bedrock. Quality of groundwater varies with location and tends to be more mineralized when extracted from serpentine soils. An example of such mineralization can be found in the Green Valley area near Lone Star Road. Geology in the Auburn Valley Country Club area consists of "greenstone" and is generally known to contain low water yields.
The Placer County Environmental Health Department currently lacks a complete data base for identifying and monitoring yield and water quality problems. The County cannot identify major groundwater-bearing formations and has not established a classification system for determining safe water yield in geologic formations. The absence of a data

base prohibits analysis of quality using such indicators as nitrates, coliform, and mineral quality.
Hooding and Drainage
There are four major hydrologic units in the planning area: Auburn Ravine, Orr Creek, Diy Creek, and Rock Creek. These streams flow under roads and in proximity to numerous structures. Due to the interface of these streams with human improvements, drainage and flood control could become a major concern if the characteristics of these waterways were changed significantly. The watershed map is shown as Figure VII-6 (a full-size copy of this figure is available for public review at the City of Auburn Community Development Department). Flooding that occurred during the 1986 storm event caused culverts and road crossings to wash out and affected structures close to all streams in the planning area. Well known examples of flooding that occurred include the KOA campground near Rock Creek and Old Town Auburn near Auburn Ravine.
Floodplains have not been adequately delineated since the February 1986 storm. Urban development could cause unknown effects on the ability of existing streams to contain future storm water flows. (See 1991 Hydrology and Drainage study.) Policies relating to flooding are included in the Safety Element.
Vegetation
Habitats
Vegetation in the planning area can be described in terms of vegetative habitats which share common characteristics. These vegetative habitats include valley-foothill riparian, annual grassland, pasture, orchard/vineyard, blue oak woodland, blue oak-Digger pine, montane hardwood, montane hardwood-conifer, mixed chaparral, urban and barren.
These vegetation types are described in the "Guide to the California Wildlife Habitat Relationship System" (WHR). Figure VII-7 shows the distribution of these vegetation types in the planning area (please note that a full-size copy of this figure is available for public review at the City of Auburn Community Development Department). Included in the Supporting Documentation is a summary of each vegetative habitat.
ErSH AND WILDLIFE
A diversity of animals, birds, fish, and reptiles, Including numerous game species, are supported by the vegetation communities and numerous waterways located within the planning area. The major habitat areas are described in the Supporting Documentation.

Important Wildlife Species
According to the California Department of Fish and Game’s Natural Diversity Data Base, there are no recorded threatened or endangered wildlife species in the planning area. There are, however, several sensitive status species which should be expected in the vegetation communities which are represented in the City of Auburn planning area. These species include the following: California red-legged frog, Foothill yellow-legged frog. Cooper’s hawk, sharp-skinned hawk, golden eagle, bald eagle, northern harrier, black-shouldered kite, prairie falcon, long-eared owl, Pacific fisher, and valley elderberry longhorn beetle. There are also several other species inhabiting the planning area which are worthy of protective measures. These are:
1.	Deer—Deer within the planning area have been identified as non-migratory Columbian Black-Tailed Deer. These deer live in the same area year-round and do not have wintering and summering areas. Deer have been observed throughout the planning area and are numerous in some locations.
2.	Wild Turkey—The Department of Fish and Game has introduced wild turkeys to Placer County because of the excellent habitat. The original introductions were made in the Coon Creek drainage near Garden Bar Road. This introduction was determined successful and a viable population has been established. The birds have spread along different water courses and continue to be observed in new areas. The primary habitat types which are suitable for turkeys include hardwoods (deciduous oaks, live oak, and madrone), and woodland-grass (hardwoods associated with herbaceous elements).
Wild turkey sightings have been reported in the planning area and the area has a huntable population of turkeys although the exact number of birds is not known.
3.	California Quail—California quail are common. Preferred habitat for these game birds is woodland-brush areas interspersed with grassy areas. Quail numbers vary from area to area depending upon the amount, quality, and distribution of food, water and cover. Excellent habitat occurs in the berry-covered areas.
4.	Band-tailed Pigeon—Band-tailed Pigeons are very common. Flocks numbering in the hundreds have been observed during the fall at various locations. Many of these flocks have been in the process of feeding and resting during their migration to southern California and Mexico. Large flocks also spend the winter on ridges along the American and Bear River drainage channel and in Old Town Auburn.
The presence of pine-oak woodlands and other mast producing trees determine the abundance of Band-tailed Pigeons. Nearby chaparral stands are also important as they provide seeds and berries.

Mourning Dove—The Mourning Dove is a common upland game species. Numbers are generally high until cold weather occurs in the fall when most migrate south.
Doves live principally on weed seeds and grain that has fallen to the ground. These birds have proven over the years to be an adaptable species.
6.	Raptors—The Golden Eagle and the Bald Eagle use both the American River
and Bear River canyons for wintering areas, and nesting sites may exist in both drainages. There are many additional species identified in the habitat descriptions in the Supporting Documentation.
Open Space
Open space can serve a variety of purposes. It can be used as the focal point of a community in the form of local and regional parks or as a means or preserving significant features in the area. This plan recognizes that open space enhances a sense of well being, good health, and a balanced quality of life. In order to use open space in community design, it must first be recognized. Once recognized, it should be incorporated into programs for the preservation of natural resources, managed for the production of resources, used for outdoor recreation, and set aside, where appropriate, for public health and safety.
Open Space for the Preservation of Natural Resources
These areas should Include lands for the preservation of plant and animal life including habitat for fish and wildlife species. Protective corridors are recommended along all major streams in the planning area as a means to eliminate the encroachment of development in these environmentally sensitive areas. These corridors will also help to preserve the water quality of these major waterways.
The majority of the oak woodlands are also proposed for protection for their historical, aesthetic and wildlife values.
Open Space for Managed Resource Production
Agricultural Land
Agricultural resources in the planning area are limited. Although foothill grasslands have long been used for cattle grazing, the value of land near Auburn for urban and rural residential uses makes grazing increasingly infeasible from an economic standpoint. The major area remaining for large scale grazing is in the northwest portion of the planning area where land remains in 20-acre or larger zoned parcels in recognition of existing land use and grazing potential.

Npvtm&er 3, 1993

J
r

On smaller rural home sites surrounding Auburn, the foothill grasslands provide a portion of the feed needed for cattle, horses and other animals kept on individual parcels. On most such rural home sites, the natural growth of grasses is not sufficient to provide animal feed and supplements such as hay and grain are required. There is a limited amount of irrigated pasture in the planning area.
There remain limited and isolated parcels in irrigated crop land, primarily in orchards, including oranges, apples, truckcrops, and pears. These orchards will likely be converted to urban or rural residential uses in the long term.
There are 18 Williamson Act contracts in the planning area constituting 1,323 acres, (see Figure vn-4.) All of the contracts are within the unincorporated area and are administered by Placer County. The Williamson Act allows a farmer or rancher to receive lower properly tax assessments in exchange for keeping the land in exclusive agricultural use for a minimum 10-year period.
Mineral Resources
The California Division of Mines and Geology (CDMG) has classified lands in the Auburn area for their mineralized potential. Map and text information is in a document titled "Mineral Land Classification of the Auburn 15’ Quadrangle, El Dorado and Placer Counties, California."
According to the CDMG study, the following major mineral resources can be found in the Auburn area: lode and placer gold, chromite, copper, asbestos, zinc, talc and limestone. Known deposits of each of these mineral resources are identified on the Mineral Land Classification Maps provided with the CDMG study.
In addition, the planning area contains surficial deposits of stream channel deposits of gravel along the Bear River and North Fork of the American River, terrace deposits of sand and gravel that indicate former higher stands of streams that drain the area, and landslide deposits which, for the most part are inactive and occur along the steep canyon slopes of the American River. In general, the hills in the plan area slope directly to an adjacent stream or drainage channel without any intervening floodplain. The streams are eroding bedrock in the downsettling stage; therefore, stream channel deposits of sand and gravel are sparse and insufficient for a resource.
Open Space for Recreation
Scenic Routes
The Auburn area is blessed with a wide variety of landscapes and scenic resources which provide passive recreational opportunities for residents and visitors alike. Chief among these scenic resources are the views available from many roadways to surrounding open areas as well as to vistas of the foothills and mountains. Scenic routes should be protected from development which could destroy the scenic quality along the corridor.

Important viewsheds are shown on Figure VII-8 (please note that a full-size copy of this figure is available for public review at the City of Auburn Community Development Department). Scenic routes include:
•	Highway 49. This route includes all of Highway 49 located in Placer County. The current alignment begins at the Placer/El Dorado County line at the American River and proceeds up the American River Canyon through the City of Auburn and north to the Placer/Nevada County line at the Bear River. This route is an important link in the "Golden Chain" which winds through the historic Mother Lode country and is included in the State Scenic Highway Master Plan. Within the planning area, Highway 49 Is characterized by urban landscapes both in the city and county, and rural, native landscapes north of Joeger Road to the Nevada County line.
•	Interstate 80. The portion of 1-80 within the planning area begins just east of the Dry Creek Road interchange and continues through the City of Auburn to just east of Newcastle.
•	Bell Road. Bell Road from 1-80 west to Joeger Road is recommended as a scenic route. This is one of the more scenic routes in the planning area.
•	Auburn Ravine Road. This route begins at Highway 49 near Elm Street and following Auburn Ravine Road to 1-80. The riparian areas along the ravine are quite attractive and provide valuable habitat.
•	Foresthill Road. Only a small portion of this route is within the planning area. It is included as a scenic route as it leads to some very scenic areas along the Foresthill Divide. It also includes the Foresthill Bridge across the American River which has overlook areas at both ends of the bridge providing views of the American River Canyon.
•	Indian Hill Road. This route begins at its intersection with 1-80 near Newcastle and extends easterly to Auburn Folsom Road. The scenic resources include foreground views of small ranches and background views of Folsom Lake and the Sacramento Valley.
•	Auburn Folsom Road. Auburn Folsom Road starts within the City of Auburn and continues south into the Loomis Basin. The scenery includes rural pastoral scenes and a panoramic view of Folsom Lake at the northern end of the route.
•	Borland-Pacific Connector. Borland Avenue proceeds south from Lincoln Way at Highway 49 and dead ends, at Lubeck. The Borland connector is intended to proceed south from Lubeck and connect to Pacific Avenue. The total route then would be Borland Avenue from Highway 49 to Pacific Avenue and Pacific Avenue to Auburn Folsom Road. A part of this route passes the Auburn Dam Overlook.

• Sacramento Street. This route begins in "Old Town Auburn" at Lincoln Way and terminates at Auburn Folsom Road. This route is included because of the historic district.
Recreation Trails
Also included in this open space category is an improved trail system which provides linkages to regional trails as well as to components of the urban bikeways plan in the City of Auburn. Figure VII-9 shows the existing and proposed trails system (please note that a full-size copy of this figure prepared by the Auburn Park Conservancy is available for public review at the City of Auburn Community Development Department).
Land ownership interests affecting the development of future trail corridors could consist of private property owners including but not limited to: the State of California, the County of Placer, the City of Auburn, Pacific Gas & Electric Company, the Placer County Water Agency, the Nevada Irrigation District, and the Southern Pacific Railroad. These identified land ownership interests would be affected when trail corridors are developed along stream corridors, public streets and highways, utility transmission easements, canal banks and rights-of-way, and railroad rights-of-way.
The feasibility of developing trail corridors within a reasonable time frame (five to ten years) will be contingent upon the cooperation between all parties having a fee or an easement interest. It will therefore be incumbent upon the City to carefully monitor proposals which may jeopardize the completion of future trail corridors.
The goal of achieving the optimum use of a trail is one which cannot be met unless considerations are made in trail design and construction standards which meet user needs. The identification of trail routes, support facilities and adequate access must also take into account user’s needs, including those of the physically disabled (compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act is necessary). Potential user needs are:
1.	Pedestrian trails should address individual and family walkers, jogging loops, and long-distance runners. Throughout the state, hikers and joggers generally use equestrian or bicycle trails which can create conflicts. Pedestrian trails should include a physical separation from cyclists where possible and should have a natural surface.
2.	Equestrians prefer scenic trails on a natural dirt surface with variations in terrain. These trails are usually six to eight feet in width and should be kept free from motor vehicles and bicycle traffic. Equestrians also require staging areas that include adequate access/parking for vehicles and trailers.
3.	Non-mountain-bike cyclists require wide trails and a smooth surface to accommodate a number of users, wide ranges of speed and often long distances. An all-weather surface should be provided which can also accommodate the needs of disabled individuals.

In the final planning stages for a trails system, the needs of all recreational users must be kept in mind when designating trail corridors.
Parks
The Auburn Recreation District (ARD) includes the City of Auburn and the communities of Christian Valley, Meadow Vista and Bowman. The District is generally bounded by the American River on the east and south, the Bear River on the north, and a staggered boundary line on the west which excludes the communities of Newcastle and Ophir. The District is a mixture of residential and rural areas.
Pursuant to the Quimby Act, the City of Auburn has adopted ordinances requiring the payment of park and recreation fees as a condition to the approval of any final subdivision or parcel map (Auburn Municipal Code 9-3.2301 et seq.). The City ordinance requirements have been in effect for over ten years and essentially mirror the requirements of the State Quimby Act (Government Code 66477).
The ARD relies upon park mitigation fees for 15 percent of their budget. An agreement with the City of Auburn (Resolution No. 90-169) directs a minimum of 50 percent of the city park mitigation fees for projects within the City limit. The Quimby Act specifically provides that "if park and recreational services and facilities are provided by a public agency other than a city or county, the amount and location of land to be dedicated or fees to be paid shall, ... be jointly determined by the City or County having jurisdiction and such public agency." Subdivision approval under the Quimby Act may be conditional upon providing park and recreation areas. This exaction must be based upon an assessment of needs contained in the General Plan and that the project is in accordance with definite principles and standards contained in the plan.
The City’s policy for this General Plan is five acres of parkland for eveiy 1,000 population. In 1988, the ARD provided only 3.2 acres of park facilities per 1,000 population district-wide, indicating a serious shortage of parkland based upon the adopted standards. The population has increased since 1988 and made the shortage of parks even more pronounced. Eight new park sites have been proposed in order to meet or exceed park standards.
The City requires dedication of natural habitat open space in addition to parklands when approving planned unit developments. This has resulted in substantial acreages being set aside for open space. In order to protect these areas from future development, the zoning is changed to "open space." This open space acreage has not been included in parkland calculations.
The City has in the past required linkages between the open space areas within and those < outside the City boundaries. The City has also required construction of trails which provide access to open areas and adjacent subdivisions. These measures provide the City with passive recreational areas, protect natural habitat, and provide essential open space.

Open Space for Health and Safety
Fire Hazard
In 1981, Senate Bill 78 required the California Department of Forestry to map the degree of fire hazard in California. The continuation of the drought conditions in El Dorado, Placer and Nevada Counties makes the area particularly susceptible to wild land fires from surrounding counties as well as from within Placer County. This hazard is based on the combination of highly flammable vegetation, steep terrain, extremely dry climate and the presence of structures.
The State Department of Forestry has identified potential sources of fuel in the planning area as grasslands, timber, woodland, and brush. These fuel types, combined with factors of humidity, precipitation and wind conditions, influence the behavior of wild land fires. These ratings generally describe a burning index which identifies the potential for the rate of fire spread and the spotting distance. Spotting distance is the distance a fire may jump or ’’spot” from the parent body. The Safety Element contains further discussion of fire hazards and identifies potential fire hazard areas.
Constraints
The natural and open space resources identified in this report present various levels of constraints to urban and rural development. The absence or reduced existence of natural features in many areas also presents the opportunity for development with the least potential for environmental impact. A composite map of constraints was prepared by the Placer County Resource Conservation District and is available for review at the City of Auburn Community Development Department. The constraints mapped and level of development restriction are as follows:
1.	High Erosion Hazard. Areas of high erosion hazard are susceptible to accelerated erosion from subdivision roads, cuts and fills, driveways, foundations, utility lines, and sheet erosion from storm runoff. Development in high erosion hazard areas must minimize the amount of soil disturbance and vegetation removal. If development is allowed in high erosion hazards areas, careful consideration must be given to erosion control measures for compliance prior to the rainy season.
2.	Slopes of 15-30%. On slopes of 15-30%, there is concern for soil slumping and slough due to over irrigation and resulting soil saturation. Other concerns include road construction, vegetation removal and wildland fire hazard. Development on slopes of 15-30% should be recommended only for large lot residential or higher density clustered development.
3.	Serpentine Formation. Fractures within the Serpentine Formation allow water seeps which can lead to shrink-swell problems for building foundations. Poor permeability and low well water yields are also

r
characteristic of the Serpentine Formation. As a result, individual wells and septic systems should be discouraged.
4.	Williamson Act Lands. Lands subject to a Williamson Act Contract present an absolute restriction to development for a minimum 10 year period. If notice of non-renewal is filed, urban development may be permitted according to adopted plans once the contract expires in 10 years,
5.	Foothill Valley Riparian Vegetation. Several policies of the plan encourage setbacks to protect riparian vegetation areas as well as flood zones along stream and creeks in the planning area. While some development of riparian vegetation areas may be permitted, the "no net loss" philosophy would require replacement of the riparian vegetation in another location.
Some of the constraints, such as Williamson Act lands and riparian vegetation, imply that development is not appropriate and should be avoided in these areas. Other constraints would also limit development but could allow development after careful attention to site planning and mitigation monitoring.
Some other constraints are not shown on the map but would be considered in any development proposal. These include wetlands, which are closely correlated with riparian vegetation areas; fire hazard areas which are correlated with steep slopes; and hydric soils, which are not considered a development constraint in themselves, but which present the greatest opportunity for land banking for riparian and wetland vegetation.
The policies listed earlier and included in the implementation section have been carefully developed to promote the protection of sensitive environmental areas and to concentrate development where feasible.
These programs relate to the adopted goals and policies. The implementation and completion of the programs represent the means by which progress in carrying out the Goals and Policies will be measured.

2,	Goals and Micies
The goals and policies in this report were developed in conjunction with the Citizen Advisory Committee for the City of Auburn General Plan Update. These goals and policies are presented by topic and sequentially, not by priority.
Goal 1:	Protect City residents from the harmful and annoying effects of
exposure to excessive noise.
Policy 1.1	Where proposed non-residential land uses are likely to produce noise levels
exceeding the performance standards of Table VIII-l at existing or planned noise-sensitive uses, an acoustical analysis shall be required as part of the environmental review process so that noise mitigation may be included in the project design. (Requirements for the content of an acoustical analysis are given by Table VIII-2.)
Policy 1.2 The feasibility of proposed projects with respect to existing and future transportation noise levels shall be evaluated by comparison to the Land Use Compatibility Guidelines for Development.
Goal 2:	Protect the . economic base of the City by preventing
incompatible land uses from encroaching upon existing or planned noise-producing uses.
Policy 2.1	New development of noise-sensitive uses shall not be allowed where
the noise level due to non-transportation noise sources will exceed the noise level standards of Table VUI-1, as measured immediately within the property line of the new development, unless effective noise mitigation measures have been incorporated into the development design to achieve the standards specified in Table VIII-1.
Policy 2.2 Noise created by new proposed non-transportation noise sources shall be mitigated so as not to exceed the noise level standards of Table VIII-l as measured immediately within the property line of lands designated for noise-sensitive uses. This policy does not apply to noise sources associated with agricultural operations on lands zoned for agricultural uses.

Policy 2.6 Where noise mitigation measures are required to achieve the standards of Tables VIII-1 and VHI-3, the emphasis of such measures shall be placed upon site planning and project design. The use of noise barriers shall be considered a supplemental means of achieving the noise standards after all practical design-related noise mitigation measures have been integrated into the project.
8O	Exiting Conditions
The State Office of Planning and Research (OPR) Noise Element Guidelines require that major noise sources be identified and quantified by preparing generalized noise contours for current and projected conditions. Significant noise sources include traffic on major roadways and highways, railroad operations, airports and heliports, and representative industrial activities and fixed noise sources.
Noise modeling techniques, noise measurements and use of existing noise measurement data were used to develop generalized Ldn noise contours for the major roadways, railroads and fixed noise sources in the study area for existing conditions.
Noise modeling techniques use source-specific data including average levels of activity, hours of operation, seasonal fluctuations, and average levels of noise from source operations. Modeling methods have been developed for a number of environmental noise sources including roadways, railroad line operations, industrial plants and airports. Such methods produce reliable results as long as data inputs and assumptions are valid. The modeling methods used in this report closely follow recommendations made by the State Office of Noise Control, and were supplemented where appropriate by field-measured noise level data to account for local conditions. The noise exposure contours are based upon annual average conditions. Because local topography, vegetation or intervening structures may significantly affect noise exposure at a particular location, the noise contours should not be considered site-specific.
A community noise survey was conducted to describe existing noise levels in noise-sensitive areas within the Plan Area so that noise level performance standards could be developed to maintain an acceptable noise environment.
ROADWAYS
The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Highway Traffic Noise Prediction Model (FHWA-RD-77-108) was used to develop Ldn contours for all highways and major roadways in the Study Area. The FHWA Model is the analytical method presently favored for traffic noise prediction by most state and local agencies, including Caltrans. The current version of the model is based upon California noise emission factors (CALVENO) for automobiles, medium trucks, and heavy trucks, with consideration given to vehicle volume, speed, roadway configuration, distance to the receiver and the acoustical characteristics of the site. The FHWA Model predicts hourly Leq values for free-flowing traffic conditions, and is generally considered to be accurate within 1.5 dB. To predict
n 1

r
values, it is necessary to determine the hourly distribution of traffic for a typical 24-hour day and to adjust the traffic volume input data to yield an equivalent hourly traffic volume.
BBA conducted short-term (15 minute) traffic noise measurements and concurrent traffic counts adjacent to the major roadways in the Plan Area. In addition, continuous (24-hour) noise measurements were conducted by BBA adjacent to 1-80 and Highway 49. BBA also made use of available traffic noise level measurement data which was collected for various recent projects in the Plan Area. The noise measurements were made to evaluate the noise exposure due to traffic on all major roadways in the Plan Area. The locations of the traffic noise measurement sites are shown on Figure VID -1.
Instrumentation used for the traffic noise measurements-included Bruel & Kjaer (B&K) Type 2218 and Larson Davis Laboratories (LDL) Model 700 and 800 precision integrating sound level meters which were calibrated in the field before measurements with matched acoustical calibrators to ensure measurement accuracy.
The purpose of the traffic noise level measurements was to determine the accuracy of the FHWA model in describing the existing noise environment within the Plan Area. Noise measurement results were compared to the FHWA model results by entering the observed traffic volumes, speed and distance as inputs to the FHWA model. The results of the traffic noise measurements are summarized in Table VIII-4.
The differences between measured and predicted noise levels were primarily due to the presence or lack of shielding of traffic noise by intervening topography. Topography in the Plan Area varies considerably, sometimes alternating from flat to hilly along relatively short roadway segments. Due to the size and topographic complexity of the Plan Area, it was not possible to evaluate the effects of topography on the propagation of traffic noise for every possible topographic configuration. Where it is necessary to generally evaluate the effects of topography on the propagation of traffic noise at a location not represented by the noise measurements in Table VKI-4, the following information may be useful.
Table VHI-4 shows that the FHWA Model generally overpredicted noise exposure at all of the measurement locations within the Plan Area, with the exception of locations which were basically at grade with the roadways being measured. This is consistent with BBA experience with the model, and is probably due mostly to the fact that the predicted levels do not account for excess ground attenuation, shielding, or atmospheric absorption over distance. The greatest amount of overprediction occurred in areas which were shielded from view of all or part of the roadway by intervening topography.
Traffic data representing annual average traffic volumes for existing conditions and the future Preferred Alternative scenarios were obtained from Placer County Department of Public Works and HBA. These data are summarized in the Supporting Documents. The future scenario is based on City of Auburn assumptions for future development. Day/ night traffic distribution and truck mix were based upon Caltrans data and BBA file data. Using these data and the FHWA methodology, traffic noise levels as defined by Ldn were calculated for existing (1988) and future traffic volumes. Distances from the centerlines

Figure VIII-5, prepared using the FHWA Model, may he used to estimate the distance to the existing 60 dB Ldn contour for projected volumes of arterial traffic on the roadways not included in this analysis. For arterial traffic, the predicted distance to the 60 dB Ldn contour is determined by the Average Daily Traffic Volume (ADT) and the posted speed limit. Ldn contours derived from Figure VHI-5 are only indicators of potential noise conflicts, requiring more detailed analysis to determine traffic noise levels at any given location.
Table VHI-6 has been prepared to serve as a guide when applying the traffic noise exposure contour information presented in this section to areas with varying topography. The table is used by adding the correction factor to the noise level predicted at a given distance. It should be noted that the adjustment factors presented ih Table VDI-6 are intended to provide conservative (worst-case) results, and that complex situations should be evaluated by an acoustical consultant where the potential for significant noise impact exists.

RAILROADS
Railroad activity in the Plan Area includes freight and passenger activity on the eastbound and westbound Southern Pacific Transportation Company (SPTCo) trackage.
SPTCo officials from the Roseville Dispatcher’s Office report that approximately 12 freight and 2 passenger train operations per day occur on SPTCo tracks in the study area. The freight trains are distributed equally on the eastbound and westbound tracks on a random basis throughout the day. Passenger train operations are scheduled to pass through the study area during daytime hours.
The new Capitol Corridor passenger rail service, operated by Amtrak, currently runs between San Jose, Oakland, and Sacramento. In the future, Capitol Corridor passenger service will likely be extended to Auburn. The number of daily Capitol Corridor trains which will likely extend to the Auburn area is not specifically known at this time, but will likely be a function of demand, the approved location for a passenger rail terminal is near the intersection of Nevada Street and Blocker Drive. There is insufficient data at this time to fully analyze the potential impacts of this expanded passenger service. However, because the noise emissions of freight train operations are substantially louder than passenger train operations, 5 additional passenger operations would be required to increase existing railroad noise levels by 1 dB.
Noise measurements were conducted by BBA at various locations within the Plan Area to determine the contribution of SPTCo railroad operations to the area noise environment. The monitoring locations are shown on Figure VIII-6. Instrumentation consisted of B&K and sound level meters. The systems were calibrated before use with B&K and LDL acoustical calibrators.
The purpose of the noise level measurements was to determine typical sound exposure levels (SEL), number of daily operations, and existing Ldn values for railroad line operations in the Plan Area, accounting for the effects of local topography, climate, train
r

speed and other factors which may affect noise generation. The results of the continuous railroad noise measurements are shown on Figure VHI-7.
To determine the distance to the 60 dB railroad Ldn contour, it was necessary to calculate the Ldn for typical freight and passenger train operations. This was done using the SEL data collected during the railroad noise measurements and the above-described number and distribution of daily freight and passenger train operations. The Ldn contribution may be calculated as follows:
Ldn = SEL + 10 log Ncq - 49.4 dB, where:
SEL is the mean SEL of the event, Neq is the sum of the number of daytime events (7 a.m. to 10 p.m.) per day plus ten times the number of nighttime events (10 p.m. to 7 a.m.) per day, and 49.4 is ten times the logarithm of the number of seconds per day. The measured railroad noise levels and predicted Ldn values at the measurement sites are shown in Table VIII-7.

The railroad noise levels measured at site 6 were less than the levels measured at the other locations due to slow train speeds and topographic shielding. At site 2, the railroad tracks were elevated approximately 20 feet relative to the noise measurement site. The elevated tracks reduced the effects of ground absorption, and the measured noise levels were therefore higher than at the other railroad noise measurement sites.
Table VHI-8 may be used to estimate railroad noise levels at existing or proposed noise sensitive developments. The railroad noise contour information provided in Table VHI-8 is based on the railroad noise measurement results of Table VIII-7, and assumes that the tracks are approximately at grade with the development and that there is no shielding of railroad noise by intervening topography.

The noise levels provided in Table VOT-8 should be increased by 3 dB where warning horns are used. The railroad noise exposure will differ from these values where the tracks are significantly elevated or shielded relative to the receiver location.
FIXED NOISE SOURCES
The production of noise is a result of many industrial processes, even when the best available noise control technology is applied. Noise exposures within industrial facilities are controlled by Federal and State employee health and safety regulations (OSHA), but exterior noise levels may exceed locally acceptable standards. Commercial, recreational and public service facility activities can also produce noise which affects adjacent sensitive land uses.
From a land use planning perspective, fixed-source noise control issues focus upon two goals: to prevent the introduction of new noise-producing uses in noise-sensitive areas, and to prevent encroachment of nois'e sensitive uses upon existing noise-producing facilities. The first goal can be achieved by applying noise performance standards to proposed new noise-producing uses. The second goal can be met by requiring that new

noise-sensitive uses in proximity to noise-producing facilities include mitigation measures to ensure compliance with noise performance standards.
The following descriptions of existing fixed noise sources in the Plan Area are intended to be representative of the relative noise impacts of such uses, and to identify specific noise sources which should be considered in the review of development proposals. These sources were identified through recommendations by City and County staff and by BBA observations.
California Department of Forestry Helipad:
Contact: Steve Taylor
The California Department of Forestry (CDF) operates a helipad near the intersection of Lincoln way and Rhodes Krueger Drive, northeast of the I-80/Bowman Road interchange. The CDF Helipad location is shown on Figure Vin-8. According to CDF staff, the helipad is used by the CDF, United States Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), California Highway Patrol (CHP), UC Davis LifeFlight, Reno CareFlight and Stockton MediFlight.
The CDF operates a Bell 204B helicopter, capable of carrying 9 passengers and equipment. CDF staff reported that the CDF operates a Bell 204B helicopter (Huey) at the helipad during the Summer months when there is a fire in the immediate vicinity of the CDF station. Because the CDF refuels the helicopter near the fire operations, the helicopter is seldom operated from the helipad. The majority of the fire-related operations occur at the fire site, where it is fueled and loaded with staff and equipment. CDF staff reported that the helicopter was used once a day at the helipad during the "49’er" fire of 1988.
CDF staff further reported that helicopters using the helipad typically approach and depart perpendicular to T80, over the canyon area east of the helipad. However, pilots may deviate from that pattern in response to safety concerns.
The California Highway Patrol (CHP) operates a Bell 206 Jet Ranger in the Auburn area, and uses the helipad infrequently when necessary to provide medical support to accident victims or other governmental agencies. The Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) stations a Hughes 500 helicopter at the helipad during the period of September through November. The DEA helicopter is reportedly used for aerial search and observation of marijuana growing areas. DEA operations are reported to be two arrivals and departures per day during those months.
For medical emergencies in the Auburn area, UCD Lifeflight and Reno CareFlight operate Alouette helicopters, and Stockton MediFlight operates an A-Star. These organizations typically use the CDF helipad only when it is not possible to land nearer to situations requiring aerial evacuation of persons in need of immediate and/or specialized medical attention.
Noise levels generated by the regular DEA helicopter operations at the CDF helipad were calculated using noise level data reported by the FAA for the Hughes 500 helicopter,

assuming 4 operations per day. An ^dn of 50 dB was computed at a distance of 1000 feet from the helipad directly under the flight path.
Auburn Truss & Lumber:
Contact: Wayne Larson
Auburn Truss & Lumber, located at 14002 Musso Road, manufactures trusses. Typical hours of operation are from 7 am - 3:30 pm, Monday through Friday. The facility reportedly does not operate on weekends, but may operate until 6 pm during periods of high demand. Noise producing equipment used at this facility includes forklifts, staple guns, air compressors, saws and a crane (boom truck). Heavy truck usage at the facility consists of 4 flatbed trucks per day and 1-2 heavy lumber trucks per week. BBA noise measurements conducted at the site indicated that saws generated 77 dB at a distance of 25 feet. There are currently no plans for future expansion of the facility.
Chevreaux Concrete:
Contact: Joe Chevreaux
The Chevreaux Concrete company is located east of the intersection of Marguerite Mine Road and State Route 49. Typical hours of operation are reportedly 6 am to 6 pm with occasional operations during early morning and evening hours as demand dictates. Noise is generated at this facility by the concrete batch plant and by front loaders and cement and gravel trucks. BBA conducted noise measurements at the plant on August 19, 1991 to quantify typical plant noise levels. An average noise level of 77 dB was measured at a distance of 75 feet from the concrete batch plant during normal operations. There does not appear to be any noise sensitive land use in the immediate plant vicinity. Plant noise is attenuated to the east by steep topography.
Public Address Systems/Drive up Window Speakers:
Source: Brown-Buntin Associates, Inc.
Public address systems and drive up window speakers are used extensively in the Aubum/Bowman Community Plan Area. The most prevalent usage of these systems is at car dealerships and fast food restaurants. Studies have shown that people are more highly annoyed by amplified speech or music than by continuous noise sources of similar intensity such as highway traffic. Noise generated by these systems depends primarily on the amplifier setting, and is therefore highly variable. BBA conducted noise measurements of the public address system at Goldrush Chevrolet and of the drive-up window speaker at Burger King to quantify typical noise emissions for these types of uses. BBA measured levels of 78 dB at 12 feet from the PA speaker, and 65 dB at a distance of 5 feet from the drive-up window speaker.
Airport Industrial Area:

Uses identified in this area include Century Lighting, Coherent Industries, Doug Spense Construction, Pacific Bell, Mussetter Distributing Inc., RJT Construction, Auburn Foothill
9fyoem6ar 3, 1993



Quality Door, Harris & Ruth Contractors, Nella Oil Company, the Skunk Works, advanced ceramics, and various aviation maintenance facilities. The most notable noise sources associated with these operations were operation and/or maintenance of medium and heavy commercial truck fleets. Although there does not appear to be any noise sensitive development in the immediate vicinity of the airport industrial area, the potential for noise generation in this area should not be overlooked if neighboring noise sensitive developments are considered.
Aubura Container Company:
Contact: Arthur Moorehouse
The Auburn Container company is located on the east side of State Route 49, between the Southern Pacific Railroad tracks and Luther Road. According to the plant manager, normal operating hours are from 7 am to 3:30 pm, Monday through Friday. The plant occasionally operates on Saturday from 7 am to 12 noon. Equipment used at the plant consists of resaws, cutoff saws, a ripsaw, a molder, a cleat machine, cyclones, and a chipper. The cyclones are located about 30 feet above ground level at the plant building. The chipper is located at ground level near the east property line of the plant. The chipper normally operates the entire time the plant is in operation. In addition to the aforementioned noise sources, there are 5 diesel trucks per day entering and leaving the plant.
BBA noise measurements indicate that the exterior noise level due to the plant cyclones is approximately 69 dB at a distance of 100 feet. The 50 dB Leq noise contour for the plant would be located approximately 850 feet from the plant.
Community Plan Area Parks and Schools:
Source: Brown-Buntin Associates
Parks are often considered noise sensitive uses due to the passive recreation which takes place there. However, such uses may also be significant noise producers during active recreation activities such as basketball and softball games. The amount of noise generated by such uses varies with age of participants, event size and location, as well as the hour during which the activity takes place. To some degree, the noise generated by such uses can be controlled by enforcing curfews, and by locating noise generating activities away from existing or proposed noise sensitive land uses.
Schools are similar to parks in that active recreation at outdoor playing fields of the schools could result in significant noise levels. School buses also add to the facility noise levels. Future land use planning should consider the potential for noise generation at the playing fields, and noise sensitive land uses should be discouraged adjacent to those areas.

Motorcycle Races - Auburn Fairgrounds Contact: Hank Maul
Motorcycle races at the Auburn Fairgrounds occur on Friday nights from May to September. Approximately 24-30, 4-lap sprint races take place on a typical Friday evening during the race season, and all racing is completed by 11 pm. BBA conducted noise measurements of typical motorcycle races on September 13, 1991, The measurements were conducted at three locations in the vicinity of the racing. The first location was the southeast comer of the Fairgrounds at the access road. Average and maximum noise levels of 68.5 dB and 77 dB, respectively, were measured at that location. Site 2 was located 100 feet east of site 1. Average noise levels at that location ranged from 59 dB to 65 dB, and maximum noise levels ranged from 66 to 68 dB at site 2. Site 3 was located at Pleasant Avenue, at the residence nearest the riding arena. BBA measured average noise levels of 61 to 63 dB at that location, with maximum noise levels ranging from 66 to 68 dB during the races.
Auburn Placer Disposal
Contact: Eileen Dominguez
Auburn Placer Disposal is located on Shale Ridge Road, east of S.R. 49. The facility serves as a refuse disposal transfer station and recycling center. The facility is open to the public between 8 am and 5 pm, but garbage trucks start leaving the facility at 4 am. Approximately 40 heavy truck trips are generated by the facility daily. Noise is also generated by use of the compactor and maintenance operations at the facility. BBA conducted noise measurements at the facility on September 23, 1991 to document typical operating noise levels. An average noise level of 63 dB was measured at 100 feet from the opening of the transfer building. Noise generated by heavy truck passages was not included in the measurement sample.
AIRPORT NOISE
The Auburn Municipal Airport is situated on 210 acres in the northwest section of the City 1 /2 mile east of Highway 49, one mile north of Bell Road. The Airport is a Basic Utility, Stage I categoiy facility which can handle 75% of small general aviation aircraft (12,500 pounds gross weight maximum). The existing paved runway, Runway 7-25, is 3,100 feet long and 60 feet wide.
An Airport Master Plan and Environmental Impact Report are currently in progress for the Auburn Municipal Airport. The existing and worst-case future Airport noise contours which were prepared for these documents are reproduced in Figures VIII-9 and VHT10, respectively. According to these contours the noise sensitive use most affected by airport operations is the Rock Creek Mobile Home Park, located west of Highway 49 between Bell and Dry Creek Roads. The contours indicate that the Mobile Home Park is currently exposed to aircraft noise levels between 60 and 65 dB CNEL.

BBA conducted continuous aircraft noise measurements at the Rock Creek M.H.P. from June 27-30, 1991 to gather single event noise level data and to compute the aircraft CNEL at that location. A Metrosonics dB-604 Environmental Noise Analyzer was used for the aircraft noise level measurements. The equipment was calibrated before use with a Bruel & Kjaer Type 4230 acoustical calibrator, and meets all pertinent specifications of the American National Standards Institute for Type I Sound level measurement systems.
In order for an aircraft to register as a single event, the noise level generated by the aircraft had to remain above 60 dB for a minimum of 10 seconds. These thresholds were set in order to filter out non-aircraft events such as passing cars. The results of the aircraft noise level measurements are shown in Table VHI-9, and are displayed graphically on Figure VHI-11.
TABLE VUI-9
AIRCRAFT NOISE MEASUREMENT RESULTS ROCK CREEK M.H.P - JUNE 27-30, 1991

June 29	Saturday	53	64-79	81	49
June 30	Sunday	83	62-81	81	53
The Table VUI-9 data indicate that the apparent number of daily operations on the 27th and 30th closely approximates the number of existing daily operations reported in the Airport EIR. The decrease in number of apparent operations on the 28th and 29th was probably caused by a shift in wind direction, resulting in departures to the east. Because the Rock Creek M.H.P. is located west of the airport, the eastern departures would probably not register as single events based on the aforementioned single event thresholds.
Although a considerable number of aircraft single events were logged on June 27th and 30th, the computed CNEL values for those days were 50 and 53 dB, respectively. The measured CNEL values on those days were approximately 10 lower than the values illustrated on the EIR noise contour maps.

COMMUNITY NOISE SURVEY
A community noise survey was conducted to document noise exposure in areas of the community containing noise sensitive land uses. For that purpose, noise sensitive land uses in the Plan Area were considered to include residential areas, parks and schools. Noise monitoring sites were selected to be representative of typical noise sensitive locations within the Plan Area.
Short-term noise monitoring was conducted on July 17-18, 1991. Each site was monitored three different times during the day and night so that estimates of Ldn could be prepared. Two long-term noise monitoring sites were established in the Plan Area to record day-night statistical trends. The data collected included the Leq and other statistical descriptors. Noise monitoring sites, measured noise levels and estimated Ldn values at each site are summarized in Table Vin-10. Monitoring sites are shown by Figure Vni-12.
Community noise monitoring systems were calibrated with acoustical calibrators in the field prior to use. The systems comply with all pertinent requirements of the American National Standards Institute for Type I sound level meters.
The community noise survey results indicate that typical noise levels in noise sensitive areas of the Plan Area are in the range of 43 dB to 58 dB L^. Traffic on local roadways, railroad and aircraft operations, and neighborhood activities are the controlling factors for background noise levels in the majority of the Plan Area. Noise from industrial uses was audible during the evening and nighttime hours at residential uses adjacent to some industrial areas. In general, the areas of the Plan Area which contain noise sensitive uses are relatively quiet.
The Lqq values shown in Table VIII-10 represent background noise levels, where there are typically no identifiable local noise sources. The values represent median noise levels. The Leq values in Table VIII-10 represent the average noise energy during the sample periods, and show the effects of brief noisy periods. The Leq values were the basis of the estimated Ldn values. values show the maximum noise levels observed during the samples, and are typically due to passing cars or small aircraft overflights. The results of the continuous ambient noise measurements are shown on Figure VIII-13.

The following noise prediction methodologies are approved for use in acoustical analyses submitted to the City of Auburn. Other methodologies may be used if approved by the City Planning Department after review of supporting technical justification.

Traffic Noise:
1.	The Federal Highway Administration Highway Traffic Noise Prediction Model (FHWA RD-77-108) is the preferred traffic noise prediction methodology. The CALVENO standardized noise emission factors must be used (published in FHWA-CA-TL-84/13, "California Vehicle Noise Emission Levels"). Any form of the FHWA Model may be used, such as manual calculation and versions for programmable calculators and computers, including STAMINA.
2.	Noise barrier insertion loss shall be calculated using the FHWA Model methodology. The effective center frequency of the noise sources shall be assumed to be 550 Hz. Source heights of 0, 2 and 8 feet above roadway centerline shall be assumed for autos, medium trucks and heavy trucks, respectively.
3.	Noise sensitive receiver locations are assumed to be the back yards of single-family dwellings, and the patios and balconies of multi-family dwellings. The exterior receiver height shall be assumed to be 5 feet above back yard or patio elevation for ground-floor receivers, and 4 feet above balcony elevation for upper-floor receivers. The exterior ground-floor receiver shall be placed 10 feet from the building facade. The exterior upper-floor receiver shall be placed midway from the building facade to the edge of the balcony, and a correction factor of +2 dB shall be applied to account for reflections from the building facade.
4.	For multi-family developments, common outdoor activity areas are also considered to be noise sensitive receiver locations. The assumed exterior receiver height is 5 feet above ground level, and the assumed receiver location is normally in the center of the recreation area.
5.	Traffic noise attenuation with distance for ground level receivers should be consistent with an acoustically "soft" site, at 4.5 dB attenuation per doubling of distance. Noise attenuation for receivers and building facades at upper floors, and for receivers overlooking the roadway, should be consistent with an acoustically "hard" site, at 3 dB attenuation per doubling of distance. These assumptions may be modified on the basis of on-site noise measurements at proposed receiver locations and elevations.
6.	Noise measurements for traffic noise analyses should include at least one 15-minute sample of daytime traffic noise levels (including the Leq value) under free-flowing traffic conditions, with a concurrent traffic count. Nighttime traffic noise levels may be estimated from 24-hour noise measurement data or published hourly traffic distribution data. For major arterials and highways, continuous hourly noise measurements over a 24-hour period are recommended to describe the effective day/night traffic distribution and to supplement the 15-minute sample(s). Noise measurement sites should be selected to represent proposed receiver locations and representative sound propagation conditions.

Existing traffic volume, truck mix and day/night distribution should be obtained from the City of Auburn, Placer County Department of Public Works or Caltrans as appropriate. Projected future traffic volume may be obtained from those agencies or the project traffic consultant. Traffic speed shall be assumed to be the posted or projected design speed, unless shown otherwise by observation or noise measurements. Typical traffic data for the Community Plan area are shown by the FHWA Model input data listed in the Noise Element handbook.
Railroad Noise:
1.	The preferred method of predicting railroad noise exposure is to calculate U values at the proposed receiver locations based upon on-site single event and cumulative noise level measurements, assuming noise attenuation of 4.5 dB per doubling of distance for all receiver elevations. Alternative methods include the "Simplified Procedure for Developing Railroad Noise Exposure Contours," prepared by Jack W. Swing of the California Office of Noise Control, and the more detailed procedures prescribed in the Assessment of Noise Environments Around Railroad Operations, Wyle Research Report No. WCR 73-5. In the Community Plan area, variations in site topography, railroad grade and use of warning horns may require adjustments to the modeling assumptions. For this reason, on-site noise measurements and observations are preferred. The Noise Element handbook lists railroad noise measurement results in the Community Plan area.
2.	Noise barrier insertion loss for railroad noise sources should be calculated using standard methods, such as those described by the FHWA Model or in Noise and Vibration Control, by Leo Beranek. Receiver locations for railroad noise exposures are the same as for traffic noise exposures. To account for differences in source heights and frequency content, it may be necessary to determine the relative contribution of different noise sources, such as wheel/rail interaction, locomotives or horns. For a generalized railroad noise source on smooth rails, the effective center frequency of the source may be assumed to be 1000 Hz with a source height of 10 feet above the rail bed. Other assumptions may be used as supported by published data or experimental results.
3.	Day/night distribution of railroad freight operations may be assumed to be uniform over a 24-hour day, unless otherwise indicated by noise measurements or information from the railroad company. Passenger train operations should be distributed according to the published schedules. The numbers and distribution of freight operations may be obtained from the railroad company dispatcher. Refer to the Noise Element handbook for typical railroad operations in the Community Plan area.
4.	Railroad noise measurements should include a representative number of single event noise levels from freight and passenger operations. Noise levels recorded over a 24-hour period are normally sufficient. The data collected should include the Sound Exposure Level (SEL) and maximum sound level (L^J due to the

r
passage of the train, and a notation of whether a warning hom or whistle was used. The noise levels due to bells at rail crossings should also be described.

Aircraft Noise:
1.	Noise produced by aircraft operations at an airport may be described by reference to published noise exposure contours for that airport. If the project site is within the 60 dB CNEL contour of an airport, predicted single event aircraft noise levels at the project site should be described. Predicted single event noise levels may be based upon noise measurements at the project site, or by using the FAA’s Integrated Noise Model (INM). Aircraft noise levels should be expressed in terms of the Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) and (where applicable) typical SEL and Lnuix values.
2.	Noise produced by aircraft operations at other than an established airport should be described in terms of predicted Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL), SEL and L^ values. Predicted noise levels may be based upon noise measurements at the project site or other representative locations, or may be predicted using the FAA’s Integrated Noise Model (INM). Helicopter noise level predictions may also be based upon the data reported in Helicopter Noise Exposure Curves for Use in Environmental Impact Assessment, FAA-EE-82-16.
Interior Noise Levels:
1.	Interior noise levels should be calculated from the predicted exterior sound level and source spectrum at the affected building facades, and the sound transmission characteristics of the building facades. The calculation should account for the types and sizes of the building elements used in the facade, the amount of exposure of each facade to the noise source, and the cumulative noise exposure from each facade. If detailed building plans are not available, generalized building descriptions may be employed, subject to review when detailed plans are provided.
2.	One-third octave or 1/1 octave band analysis is preferred, describing the source frequency content and facade transmission loss characteristics from 125 Hz to 4000 Hz. Corrections should also be made for absorption of sound by the receiving room. A safely factor of 3 dB is recommended to allow for potential degradation of acoustical performance from variables in construction and materials. Source spectra and transmission loss values should be obtained from published test results, if available.
3.	If it is necessary to close windows and doors to achieve the required interior noise level standard, the analysis should indicate that adequate ventilation must be provided to meet the fresh air exchange requirements of the Uniform Building Code. Recommendations should also be made to ensure that the ventilation system does not compromise the acoustical integrity of the building facades, and that It does not create excessive interior noise levels due to its operation.

4.	The report should cite the assumptions used for building elements and design features. Any building design features required to achieve the interior noise level standard should be clearly specified.
S,	Description Of Noise
Noise is often defined simply as unwanted sound, and thus is a subjective reaction to characteristics of a physical phenomenon. Researchers for many years have grappled with the problem of translating objective measurements of sound into directly correlatable measures of public reaction to noise. The descriptors of community noise in current use are the results of these efforts, and represent simplified, practical measurement tools to gauge community response. Before elaborating on these descriptors, it is useful to first discuss some fundamental concepts of sound.
Sound is defined as any pressure variation in air that the human ear can detect. If the pressure variations occur frequently enough (at least 20 times per second), they can be heard and hence are called sound. The number of pressure variations per second is called the frequency of sound, and is expressed as cycles per second, now called hertz (Hz) by international agreement.
The speed of sound in air is approximately 770 miles per hour, or 1,130 feet/second. Knowing the speed and frequency of a sound, one may calculate its wavelength, the physical distance in air from one compression of the atmosphere to the next. An understanding of wavelength is useful in evaluating the effectiveness of physical noise control devices such as mufflers or barriers, which depend upon either absorbing or blocking sound waves to reduce sound levels.
Measuring sound directly in terms of pressure would require a very large and awkward range of numbers. To avoid this, the decibel scale was devised. The decibel scale uses the hearing threshold of 20 micropascals as a point of reference, defined as 0 dB. Other sound pressures are then compared to the reference pressure, and the logarithm is taken to keep the numbers in a practical range.
The decibel scale allows a million-fold increase in pressure to be expressed as 120 dB. Another useful aspect of the decibel scale is that changes in levels (dB) correspond closely to human perception of relative loudness.
The perceived loudness of sounds is dependent upon many factors, including sound pressure level and frequency content. However, within the usual range of environmental noise levels, perception of loudness is relatively predictable, and can be approximated by weighting the frequency response of a sound level measurement device (called a sound level meter) by means of the standardized A-weighting network. There is a strong correlation between A-weighted sound levels (expressed as sound levels in dB) and community response to noise. For this reason, the A-weighted sound pressure level has

become the standard tool of environmental noise assessment. Figure VIII-14 illustrates typical sound levels and subjective reaction due to recognizable sources.
Community noise is commonly described in terms of the "ambient" noise level, which is defined as the all-encompassing noise level associated with a given noise environment. A common statistical tool to measure the ambient noise level is the average, or equivalent, sound level (Leq), which corresponds to a steady-state sound level containing the same total energy as a time-vaiying signal over a given time period (usually one hour). The is the foundation of the composite noise descriptors such as kn and CNEL, and shows very good correlation with community response to noise.
Two composite noise descriptors are in common use today: Ldn (Day-night Average Level) and CNEL (Community Noise Equivalent Level). The Ldn is based upon the average hourly L^ over a 24-hour day, with a +10 decibel weighting applied to nighttime (10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.) Leq values. The nighttime penalty is based upon the assumption that people react to nighttime noise exposures as though they were twice as loud as daytime

A
exposures. The CNEL, like Ldn, is based upon the weighted average hourly Leq over a 24-hour day, except that an additional +4.77 decibel penally is applied to evening (7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m.] hourly Leq values. The CNEL was developed for the California Airport Noise Regulations, and is applied specifically to airport/aircraft noise assessment. The Ldn descriptor is a simplification of the CNEL concept, but the two will usually agree, for a given situation, within 1 dB. Like the Leq, Ldn and CNEL are averages and tend to disguise short-term variations in the noise environment. Because they presume increased evening or nighttime sensitivity, they are best applied as criteria for land uses where nighttime noise exposures are critical to the acceptability of the noise environment, such as residential developments.
Noise in the community has often been cited as being a health problem, not in terms of actual physiological damage such as hearing impairment, but in terms of inhibiting general well-being and contributing to undue stress and annoyance. The health effects of noise in the community arise from interference with human activities such as sleep, speech, recreation, and tasks demanding concentration or coordination. When community noise interferes with human activities or contributes to stress, public annoyance with the noise source increases, and the acceptability of the environment for people decreases. This decrease in acceptability and the threat to public well-being are the bases for land use planning policies preventing exposure to excessive community noise levels.
To control noise from fixed sources which have developed from processes other than zoning or land use planning, many jurisdictions have adopted community noise control ordinances. Such ordinances are intended to abate noise nuisances and to control noise from existing sources. They may also be used as performance standards to judge the creation of a potential nuisance, or potential encroachment of sensitive uses upon noise-producing facilities. Community noise control ordinances are generally designed to resolve noise problems on a short-term basis (usually by means of hourly noise level criteria], rather than on the basis of 24-hour or annual cumulative noise exposures.
In addition to the sound level, other factors should be considered in establishing criteria for noise sensitive land uses. For example, sounds with noticeable tonal content such as whistles, horns, droning or high-pitched sounds may be more annoying than the A-weighted sound level alone suggests. Many noise standards apply a penalty, or correction, of 5 dB to such sounds. The effects of unusual tonal content are generally more of a concern at nighttime, when residents may notice the sound in contrast to low levels of background noise.
Because many rural residential areas experience very low noise levels, residents may express concern about the loss of "peace and quiet" due to the introduction of a sound which was not audible previously. In very quiet environments, the introduction of virtually any change in local activities will cause an increase in noise levels. A change in noise level and the loss of "peace and quiet" is the inevitable result of land use or activity changes in such areas. Audibility of a new noise source and/or increases in noise levels within recognized acceptable limits are not usually considered to be

r

significant noise impacts, but these concerns should be addressed and considered in the planning and environmental review processes.
6,	Chtaia for Acceptable Noise Esqposwres
The State Office of Planning and Research (OPR) Noise Element Guidelines include recommended exterior and interior noise level standards for local jurisdictions to identify and prevent the creation of incompatible land uses due to noise. The OPR guidelines contain a land use compatibility table which describes the compatibility of different land uses with a range of environmental noise levels in terms of Ldn or CNEL. A noise environment of 50 to 60 dB Ldn or CNEL is considered to be "normally acceptable" for residential uses according to those guidelines. The OPR recommendations also note that, under certain conditions, more restrictive standards than the maximum levels cited may be appropriate. As an example, the standards for quiet suburban and rural communities may be reduced by 5 to 10 dB to reflect lower existing outdoor noise levels.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also offers guidelines for community noise exposure in the publication "Information on the Levels of Environmental Noise Requisite to Protect Public Health and Welfare with an Adequate Margin of Safety". These guidelines consider occupational noise exposure as well as noise exposure in the home. The "Levels Document" recognizes an exterior noise level of 55 dB Ldn as a goal to protect the public from hearing loss, activity interference, sleep disturbance and annoyance. The EPA notes, however, that this level is not a regulatory goal, but is a level defined by a negotiated scientific consensus without concern for economic and technological feasibility or the needs and desires of any particular community. The EPA and other Federal agencies have adopted suggested land use compatibility guidelines which indicate that residential noise exposures of 55 to 65 dB Ldn are acceptable.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has also prepared a Model Community Noise Control Ordinance, using Leq as the means of defining allowable residential noise level limits. The EPA model contains no specific recommendations for local noise level standards, but reports a range of Leq values as adopted by various local jurisdictions. The mean daytime residential noise standard reported by the EPA is 56.75 dB (Leq); the mean nighttime residential noise standard is 51.76 dB (Leq). This ordinance format has been applied by the City and County of San Diego.
7. Techniques for Noise Control
Any noise problem may be considered as being composed of three basic elements: the noise source, a transmission,path, and a receiver. Local control of noise sources is practical only with respect to fixed sources (e.g., industrial facilities, outdoor activities, etc.), as control of vehicular sources is generally preempted by federal or state law. Control of fixed noise sources is usually best obtained by enforcement of a local noise

r
A
control ordinance. The emphasis of noise control in land use planning is therefore placed upon acoustical treatment of the transmission path and the receiving structures.
The appropriate acoustical treatment for a given project should consider the nature of the noise source and the sensitivity of the receiver. The problem should be defined in terms of appropriate criteria (Ldn, Leq, or L^), the location of the sensitive receiver (inside or outside), and when the problem occurs (daytime or nighttime). Noise control techniques should then be selected to provide an acceptable noise environment for the receiving property while remaining consistent with local aesthetic standards and practical structural and economic limits. Fundamental noise control techniques include the following:
a.	Use of Setbacks
Noise exposure may be reduced by increasing the distance between the noise source and receiving use. Setback areas can take the form of open space, frontage roads, recreational areas, storage yards, etc. The available noise attenuation from this technique is limited by the characteristics of the noise source, but is generally 4 to 6 dB per doubling of distance from the source.
b.	Use of Barriers
Shielding by barriers can be obtained by placing walls, berms or other structures, such as buildings, between the noise source and the receiver. The effectiveness of a barrier depends upon blocking line-of-sight between the source and receiver, and is improved with increasing the distance the sound must travel to pass over the barrier as compared to a straight line from source to receiver. The difference between the distance over a barrier and a straight line between source and receiver is called the "path length difference," and is the basis for calculating barrier noise reduction.
Barrier effectiveness depends upon the relative heights of the source, barrier and receiver. In general, barriers are most effective when placed close to either the receiver or the source. An intermediate barrier location yields a smaller path length difference for a given increase in barrier height than does a location closer to either source or receiver.
For maximum effectiveness, barriers must be continuous and relatively airtight along their length and height. To ensure that sound transmission through the barrier is insignificant, barrier mass should be about 4 lbs./square foot, although a lesser mass may be acceptable if the barrier material provides sufficient transmission loss in the frequency range of concern. Satisfaction of the above criteria requires substantial and well-fitted barrier materials, placed to intercept line of sight to all significant noise sources. Earth, in the form of berms or the face of a depressed area, is also an effective barrier material.
Transparent noise barriers may be employed, and have the advantage of being aesthetically pleasing in some environments. Transparent barrier materials such as laminated glass and polycarbonate provide adequate transmission loss for most highway noise control applications. Transparent barrier materials may be flammable, and may

Tage vrrr-&
J
( )
be easily abraded. Some materials may lose transparency upon extended exposure to sunlight. Maintaining aesthetic values requires that transparent barriers be washed on a regular basis. These properties of transparent barrier materials require that the feasibility of their use be considered on a case-by-case basis.
The attenuation provided by a barrier depends upon the frequency content of the source. Generally, higher frequencies are attenuated (reduced) more readily than lower frequencies. This results because a given barrier height is relatively large compared to the shorter wavelengths of high frequency sounds, while relatively small compared to the longer wavelengths of the low frequency sounds. The effective center frequency for traffic noise is usually considered to be 550 Hz. Railroad engines, cars and horns emit noise with differing frequency content, so the effectiveness of a barrier will vary for each of these sources. Frequency analyses are necessaiy to properly calculate barrier effectiveness for noise from sources other than highway traffic.
There are practical limits to the noise reduction provided by barriers. For highway traffic noise, a 5 to 10 dB noise reduction may often be reasonably attained. A 15 dB noise reduction is sometimes possible, but a 20 dB noise reduction is extremely difficult to achieve. Barriers usually are provided in the form of walls, berms, or berm/wall combinations. The use of an earth berm in lieu of a solid wall will provide up to 3 dB additional attenuation over that attained by a solid wall alone, due to the absorption provided by the earth. Berm/wall combinations offer slightly better acoustical performance than solid walls, and are often preferred for aesthetic reasons.
Another form of barrier is the use of a depressed noise source location, such as depressed loading areas in shopping centers or depressed roadways. The walls of the depression serve to break line-of-sight between the source and receiver, and will provide absorption if left in earth or vegetative cover.
c.	Site Design
Buildings can be placed on a project site to shield other structures or areas, to remove them from noise-impacted areas, and to prevent an increase in noise level caused by reflections. The use of one building to shield another can significantly reduce overall project noise control costs, particularly if the shielding structure is insensitive to noise.
As an example, carports or garages can be used to form or complement a barrier shielding adjacent dwellings or an outdoor activity area. Similarly, one residential unit can be placed to shield another so that noise reduction measures are needed for only the building closest to the noise source. Placement of outdoor activity areas within the shielded portion of a building complex, such as a central courtyard, can be an effective method of providing a quiet retreat in an otherwise noisy environment. Patios or balconies should be placed on the side of a building opposite the noise source, and "wing
. walls" can be added to buildings or patios to help shield sensitive uses.
Where project design does not allow using buildings or other land uses to shield sensitive uses, noise control costs can be reduced by orienting buildings with the narrow end facing the noise source, reducing the total area of the building requiring acoustical

treatment. Some examples of building orientation to reduce noise impacts are shown in Figure VHI-15.
Another option in site design is the placement of relatively insensitive land uses, such as commercial or storage areas, between the noise source and a more sensitive portion of the project. Examples include development of a commercial strip along a busy arterial to block noise affecting a residential area, or providing recreational vehicle storage or travel trailer parking along the noise-impacted edge of a mobile home park. If existing topography or development adjacent to the project site provides some shielding, as in the case of an existing berm, knoll or building, sensitive structures or activity areas may be placed behind those features to reduce noise control costs (see Figure VIII-16).
Site design should also guard against the creation of reflecting surfaces which may increase on-site noise levels. For example, two buildings placed at an angle facing a noise source may cause noise levels within that angle to increase by up to 3 dB. The open end of 'V-shaped buildings should point away from noise sources for the same reason. Landscaping walls or noise barriers located within a development may inadvertently reflect noise back to a noise-sensitive area unless carefully located. Avoidance of these problems while attaining an aesthetic site design requires close coordination between local agencies, the project engineer and architect, and the noise consultant.
Another important aspect of site design is avoiding the creation of noise problems at adjacent noise-sensitive properties. For example, air conditioning units should not be placed adjacent to living areas of adjoining residences unless adequate shielding is provided. Swimming pools and outdoor activity areas such as "tot lots" should be located away from adjoining residences, or should be adequately shielded.
d.	Building Design
When structures have been located to provide maximum noise reduction by barriers or site design, noise reduction measures may still be required to achieve an acceptable interior noise environment. The cost of such measures may be reduced by placement of interior dwelling unit features. For example, bedrooms, living rooms, family rooms and other noise-sensitive portions of a dwelling can be located on the side of the unit farthest from the noise source, as shown by Figure VIII-17.
Bathrooms, closets, stairwells and food preparation areas are relatively insensitive to exterior noise sources, and can be placed on the noisy side of a unit. When such techniques are employed, noise reduction requirements for the building facade can be significantly reduced, although the architect must take care to isolate the noise impacted areas by the use of partitions or doors.
In some cases, external building facades can influence reflected noise levels affecting adjacent buildings. This is primarily a problem where high-rise buildings are proposed, and the effect is most evident in urban areas, where an "urban canyon" may be created.
r

Bell-shaped or irregular building facades and attention to the orientation of the building can reduce this effect.
e.	Noise Reduction by Building Facades
When interior noise levels are of concern in a noisy environment, noise reduction may be obtained through acoustical design of building facades. Standard residential construction practices provide 12-15 dB noise reduction for building facades with open windows, and 20-25 dB noise reduction when windows are closed. Thus a 20 dB exterior-to-interior noise reduction can be obtained by the requirement that building design include adequate ventilation systems, allowing windows on a noise-impacted facade to remain closed under any weather condition.
Where greater noise reduction is required, acoustical treatment of the building facade is necessary. Reduction of relative window area is the most effective control technique, followed by providing acoustical glazing (thicker glass or increased air space between panes) in low air infiltration rate frames, use of fixed (non-movable) acoustical glazing or the elimination of windows. Noise transmitted through walls can be reduced by increasing wall mass (using stucco or brick in lieu of wood siding), isolating wall members by the use of double- or staggered- stud walls, or mounting interior walls on resilient channels. Noise control for exterior doorways is provided by reducing door area, using solid-core doors, and by acoustically sealing door perimeters with suitable gaskets. Roof treatments may include the use of plywood sheathing under roofing materials.
Standard energy-conservation double-pane glazing with an 1/8" or 1/4" air-space is not considered acoustical glazing, as its sound transmission loss for some noise sources is actually less than that of single-pane glazing.

Whichever noise control techniques are employed, it is essential that attention be given to installation of weatherstripping and caulking of joints. Openings for attic or subfloor ventilation may also require acoustical treatment; tight-fitting fireplace dampers and glass doors may be needed in aircraft noise-impacted areas.
Design of acoustical treatment for building facades should be based upon analysis of the level and frequency content of the noise source. The transmission loss of each building component should be defined, and the composite noise reduction for the complete facade calculated, accounting for absorption in the receiving room. A one-third octave band analysis is a definitive method of calculating the A-weighted noise reduction of a facade.
A common measure of transmission loss is the Sound Transmission Class (STC). STC ratings are not directly comparable to A-weighted noise reduction, and must be corrected for the spectral content of the noise source. Requirements for transmission loss analyses are outlined by Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations.
i.	Use of Vegetation
Trees and other vegetation are often thought to provide significant noise attenuation. However, approximately 100 feet of dense foliage (so that no visual path extends through the foliage) is required to achieve a 5 dB attenuation of traffic noise. Thus the use of vegetation as a noise barrier should not be considered a practical method of noise control unless large tracts of dense foliage are part of the existing landscape.
Vegetation can be used to acoustically "soften" intervening ground between a noise source and receiver, increasing ground absorption of sound and thus increasing the attenuation of sound with distance. Planting of trees and shrubs is also of aesthetic and psychological value, and may reduce adverse public reaction to a noise source by removing the source from view, even though noise levels will be largely unaffected. It should be noted, however, that trees planted on the top of a noise control berm can actually slightly degrade the acoustical performance of the bander. This effect can occur when high frequency sounds are diffracted (bent) by foliage and directed downward over a barrier.
In summary, the effects of vegetation upon noise transmission are minor, and are primarily limited to increased absorption of high frequency sounds and to reducing adverse public reaction to the noise by providing aesthetic benefits.
g.	Sound Absorbing Materials
Absorptive materials such as fiberglass, foam, cloth and acoustical tiles or panels are used to reduce reflections or reverberation in closed spaces. Their use in exterior environmental noise control may reduce reflections between parallel noise barriers or other reflective surfaces. Maintenance of absorptive materials used outdoors may be difficult, as most such materials are easily damaged by sunlight and moisture. Their application as an outdoor noise control tool is limited to special cases where the control of reflected noise is critical and where the material is sufficiently durable.

The Safely Element presents a plan for minimizing the hazards to public health and safety in the City of Auburn and its environs. It identifies natural and man-made hazards that affect existing and future development, and provides guidelines for protecting residents from injury and death. It describes present conditions, and sets policies and standards for improved public safely. It seeks to minimize physical harm, as well as economic and social disruptions. The goals and objectives of the Safely Element reflect Auburn’s regard for the health and safety of its residents. The element

r

addresses issues which the community believes would require government intervention in order to effectively achieve public safety. The purposes and goals of the other elements are also related to the goals of the Safety Element. Together, they will serve as a guide for decision making by public and private investors and for the future expenditure of public funds.
Natural and man-made disasters result in losses of life and properly, economic and social setbacks, and the destruction of the environment. Local governments are charged with the responsibility of protecting their residents from danger and harm. The Safety Element is intended to guide development by reducing the levels of risk posed by natural and man-made hazards within the city and its planning area.
Some degree of risk is inevitable since natural disasters cannot be predicted with certainty, and because the knowledge and technology to control man-made risks is constantly evolving. Since the total elimination of risk is not possible, public safety is relative to the degree of risk that people find tolerable. The value of life and property becomes a yardstick for tolerance and the need for governmental action.
Specifically, the Safety Element serves the following purposes:
1.	As one of the state-mandated elements, it fulfills the requirements of the State Planning and Zoning Law and the regulations in Section 65302(g) of the Government Code of the State of California.
2.	The identification, mapping, and appraisal of seismic hazards which would be of concern, including areas subject to liquefaction, groundshaking, surface rupture, or seismic sea waves [Section 65302(f)].
3.	An appraisal of mudslides, landslides, and slope stability which might occur as a result of a seismic disturbance [Section 65302 (i)].
4.	The identification of the potential for fires and other natural and man-made disasters and measures designed to reduce the loss of life, injury, and damage to property [Section 65302(i)].
2.	Goals and Policies
The goals and policies in this report were developed in conjunction with the Citizen. Advisory Committee for the City of Auburn General Plan Update. These Goals and Policies are presented by topic and sequentially, not by priority.

This section of the Safety Element is concerned with natural and man-made hazards that affect the City of Auburn planning area and the impacts that they could have on life in the City. It focuses on fire hazards, seismic hazards, flood-related hazards, geologic hazards associated with the slope and soil stability failure, the risk of aircraft accidents at Auburn Municipal Airport, hazardous materials, and crime. Certain key issues were identified early in the planning process by city staff, residents, and members of the Auburn General Plan Citizens Advisory Committee. In addition, there are statewide and regional safety issues which affect the city.
This section documents existing conditions in the planning area and provides the background analysis that led to the goals and policies contained in the previous section.
Threats to public health and safety are posed by natural and man-made conditions. Natural hazards result from characteristics of the environment. They are difficult to control or eliminate and are best avoided in order to reduce their danger and potential for damage. Human action may magnify the potential impact of natural hazards, but the disaster is primarily dependent on environmental conditions, such as the presence of earthquake faults, floodplains, and steep slopes. Man-made hazards stem from human activity. They happen as a result of specific practices and actions of man which may create a potential for fire, aircraft accidents, hazardous materials contamination, and crime. To eliminate a man-made hazard, the complete suspension of particular activities is sometimes necessary. This is difficult when economic forces are at play or when the activity supports a host of other economic activities.
In the Auburn area, the major natural hazards are wildfire hazards, seismic activity, flood, and geologic conditions. Aside from these, urban fires, aircraft accidents, hazardous materials contamination, accidents on Interstate 80, Highway 49, and railroads, and crime hazards are present due to ongoing human activities.
Wildfires occur on mountains, hillsides, and grasslands and they spread in relation to the area’s vegetation, climate, and slope. In the planning area, native vegetation, such as chaparral, sage, and grassland provide the fuel that allows fire to spread easily across large tracts of land. These plant species are capable of regeneration after a fire, making periodic wildfires a natural part of the ecology of these areas. The climate of the Auburn region keeps the grass dry and readily combustible. Steep slopes bring grass and brush within reach of upward flames while impeding the access of fire-fighting equipment. Seasonal drought conditions exacerbate fire hazards.

Figure IX-1 shows the fire hazard ratings within the study area. Due to the rugged terrain, highly flammable timber and brush covered lands, and dry summers, most of the land is designated either extreme or high hazard. The fire season in the Auburn planning area typically occurs roughly from June to November. If rains are minimal, grass may dry as early as May and brush as early as July. From December to April, in the rainy season, wildfires rarely occur.
Wildfire may be started by a variety of things: carelessly used matches, cigarettes discarded in the brush, the lack of spark arresters in off-road vehicles, and target shooting ricochets. In turn, fire fighters are hampered by motorists who do not yield to fire vehicles or who do not know how to provide clear passage in emergencies, as well as the steep terrain in areas where wildfires typically occur.
Fire protection in the plan area is provided by the City of Auburn, the California Department of Forestry, and the Consolidated Fire District and Newcastle Fire Districts. The City of Auburn has an agreement with the Consolidated Fire District to provide services for both structural and wildland fires within its boundary. Structural and wildland fire protection outside the ciiy limits are provided by the individual fire districts or by the California Department of Forestry.
The Auburn Fire Department has four stations currently in operation:
1.	Martin Park Station
485 High Street and El Dorado
2.	Gietzen Station
226 Sacramento Street
3.	Maidu Station
901 Auburn Folsom Road and Maidu Drive
4.	Airport/Industrial	Station
New Airport Road	and Earhart Avenue
The City is evaluating the addition of new fire stations: four sites under consideration are:
1.	Palm Avenue/Nevada Street area
2.	Bowman area near Foresthill Road and 1-80
3.	Bowman Road north of Luther on the west side of 1-80
4.	Department of Forestry Station
Urban Fires
Urban fires occur in built-up environments, destroying buildings and other man-made structures. These disasters are often due to faulty wiring or mechanical equipment, combustible construction materials, or the absence of fire alarms and sprinkler systems.

Human accidents with appliances and equipment, and the careless use of cigarettes and matches also cause urban fires. Older buildings are considered more likely to have fires since they often do not comply with present standards for fire safely construction. To minimize fire damage and loss, the fire department sets standards for building and construction. It requires the provision of adequate water supply for fire fighting, fire retardant construction, and minimum street widths, among other things. Fire prevention awareness programs and fire drills are conducted to train residents to respond quickly and correctly in order to reduce injuiy and losses during fires.
In the planning area, fires have been largely due to human accidents. Fire hazards are continuously present in the form of older buildings in the city center, although there are no pockets of high density development to compound the danger.
Seismic Hazards
A major earthquake is likely to occur in Northern California sometime during the next 30 years. Such an earthquake is expected to cause the loss of life, injury, and property damage at a scale unprecedented in this nation’s history. While it is impossible to prevent an earthquake from occurring, research is continuing to develop ways of predicting earthquakes. Still, it will be many years before a program which accurately and reliably predicts earthquakes can be implemented.
Principal faults that could produce damaging earthquakes in the Auburn area are the San Andreas, Bear Mountain, Melones, Hayward and Cleveland Hills faults. The San Andreas Fault is the boundary where the North American plate and the Pacific plate meet. Pressure along this boundary causes earthquakes.
The San Andreas Fault in San Francisco and the Hayward Fault in the east bay area are 100 and 94 miles, respectively, from Auburn. Maximum credible earthquakes along these faults projected at magnitude 8.25 for the San Andreas and 7.5 for the Hayward, would produce barely perceptible shock and bedrock acceleration at Auburn (less than 0.05 g). The closest identified "potentially active" faults (where movement has occurred within the past two million years), are the Bear Mountain Fault and the Melones Faults, which are situated approximately three to four miles westerly and easterly from Auburn respectively. The closest identified "active" fault (where movement has occurred within the past 11,000 years), is the Cleveland Hills Fault, situated approximately 36 miles northwesterly of Auburn. Most recently, the Cleveland Hills fault was the source of the 1975 Oroville earthquake (Richter Magnitude: 5.7).
Active faults located between 50 and 100 miles from Auburn include the Mohawk Valley Fault, the Stampede Valley Fault, and the Fort Sage Fault; all located northeast of Auburn. Given the relationship to these various active faults, there is a high potential that the area will be subject to at least moderate earthquake shaking one or more times over the next century.

In general, the City of Auburn and the planning area are located in a seismically active region (Seismic Zone 3), The Uniform Building Code states that structures shall be designed to withstand seismic events as well as windstorm velocities. The dominant seismic feature affecting the city is the Cleveland Hills Fault which is 36 miles northwest of the planning area. This fault is considered one of the most active in the area in terms of destructive potential.
In addition, there are a number of fault traces that branch off from the primary fault. Movement on the San Andreas Fault may activate one or all of the subsidiary faults.
The amount of groundshaking at a site is expressed in terms of the acceleration of gravity. Ground acceleration is the rate of increase of speed of the ground, where each change in rate acts as a force on a structure. Thus, the greater the acceleration, the greater the force acting on a building site. Table IX-1 shows the historic activity of the San Andreas Fault, which includes richter scale measurement and modified Mercalli intensity scale (MMSI) measurement (see the Technical Appendices for a full description of the MMSI).
Placer County is traversed by a series of northwest-trending faults that are related to the Sierra Nevada uplift. Although seismic activity is a potential hazard, no active faults are known within Placer County (for details, refer to ''Earthquake History of Placer County," Livingston, 1979, prepared for Placer County Planning Department).
Aside from groundshaking and ground surface rupture, earthquake hazards include the fissuring or cracking of bedrock, landslides, liquefaction, intense ground breakage, and ground settlement. Structures most likely to be affected are those that are old or near earthquake faults. Dams along earthquake faults may be subject to failure and may cause flooding of the surrounding area. Critical damage may also occur to structures that provide emergency services (hospitals, fire stations, schools, emergency shelters). Roads and utility lines for water, gas, power, telephone, sewer, and storm drainage may be disjointed and services cut off. These structures require special attention in the public safety programs of the city.
In case of a major earthquake in the region, damage to the following structures could occur:
1.	Interstate Highway 80: There are a number of overpasses on Interstate 80 that could possibly be threatened in the event of a severe earthquake, greater than those previously experienced. Under such a scenario the County would be virtually cut in half between the eastern and western portions. Similar conditions have resulted from past winter storms requiring limited emergency measures.
2.	Train Derailments: Southern Pacific Railroad tracks run adjacent to Interstate 80. Passenger trains run between Sacramento and Reno through the 1-80 Corridor. A derailment in the higher elevations would pose logistics problems involved in freeing passengers caught in snowsheds

3. Telephone Communications: Telephone communications could be
adversely affected due to overloading resulting from post-earthquake calls within the area and from outside, and many instruments could be off their hooks.

Water Supplies: The open canals operated by Placer County Water Agency could rupture during a large earthquake. It is anticipated that these canals, of which some are elevated and over 100 years old, would be susceptible to failure under sufficient stress that a large earthquake could produce.
5. Natural Gas and Propane: The City relies on natural gas for fuel, with some properties dependent on individual propane tanks. Earthquake damage could cause natural gas line breaks, disruption of service and damage to propane tanks by knocking them off their foundations, posing potential fire hazard.
Ground Motion
The technical analysis of earthquakes to be expected from faults affecting the study area has defined these events in terms of a magnitude and recurrence interval. The level of risk associated with each event is indicated by the recurrence interval in much the same manner as the risk from other natural hazards, such as flooding, is defined by a recurrence interval. For example, it is common practice to design flood-prevention projects to accommodate the flows from a 100-year storm. Where a higher level of protection is' desired, the design levels are increased to accommodate the flows from storms occurring at 300- to 500-year intervals.
The choice of a particular earthquake, for which protection is to be provided, involves a determination of acceptable risk. In general, the risk of occurrence decreases as the magnitude of the potential earthquake increases. Since the cost of providing protection increases as the magnitude of the "design earthquake" is increased, there is a point at which the cost of providing protection becomes prohibitive. Design for the 100-year event should be considered minimum; where a high level of protection is desired, such as for hospitals, design levels should be increased to protect against earthquakes with longer recurrence intervals.
Flood Hazards
Historically, precipitation has been moderate to occasionally heavy, but snowfall is very-light in the Auburn area. The drought situation which has extended over the past five years has resulted in a significant decrease from the mean precipitation figures of previous years. The average annual rainfall totals 35 inches, but there is considerable variability from year to year. In a ten-year period, on the average, the driest year has less that 24 inches of precipitation while the wettest will receive 48 inches. Winter is the rainy season with 89 percent of the annual total precipitation falling in the six months from November through April.
Although no major flooding is expected in the planning area, intermittent flooding and sheetwash occur along major drainage channels and adjoining areas on scattered sites. Areas with flood hazards are the natural drainage channels of the Auburn Ravine, Dutch

Ravine and Rock Creek and the tunnel section of the Auburn Ravine under Old Town. Flat plains and natural depressions are also subject to possible flooding (as was noticeable in the Mt. Vernon Road area during the 1986 floods).
Both earthquake faults and developments reduce the total ground absorption area. Earthquake faults include bedrock features that create barriers to subsurface percolation, thus increasing the velocity and erosive capacity of storm water runoff on hillsides. Development also creates impermeable surfaces (structures, pavement, streets). Storm runoff is augmented by water flows from development contributing to street flooding. Both earthquake faults and developments reduce the total ground absorption area. Moreover, developed areas generate irrigation water runoff from landscaping which may channel storm water and other runoff flows into nearby underdeveloped areas and street gutters.
Geologic Hazards
The area’s geology determines its capacity for supporting man-made structures. In Auburn, consolidated rocks make up the mountains and rocky buttes while alluvial soils are found on stream beds and the valley floor. Beneath the alluvial soils are the same hard rocks as found in the mountain areas. Geologic hazards are present in the form of unstable soils and certain ground formations which render some areas unsuitable for intensive human activity.
The planning area has steep slopes on its eastern edges, with unstable slopes, and areas subject to erosion and landslides. Areas with slopes less than 15 percent are generally considered suitable for all types of development. Those with a 15 to 25 percent slope are typically required to use hillside construction techniques to achieve substantial foundation support and stable soil conditions. Areas with slopes greater than 25 percent are subject to instability and erosion and are generally not recommended for development. Increasing urbanization on the hillsides exposes the community to possible landslides and rockslides which may result in human injury and property damage. Extensive grading will be required to create a developable surface in these areas. However, grading is also a form of land disturbance which may provide future land failure.
Geologic hazards within the area of the Auburn General Plan are small slumps, block slides, and landslides within the metamorphic rock; and slumps, occasional block slides, and erosional gullying within the intensely fractured serpentine. The occurrence of these features will increase as land values increase and more and more building sites are excavated on natural hillsides. The deeper the excavations, the more the weaknesses of underlying rock masses are exposed for potential failure.
Lands around major fault zones are exposed to greater geologic hazards as a result of repeated fault movement. Earthquakes give rise to broken rocks, ground fracture, and clay gouge. Broken subsurface rocks may not be readily apparent but the ground would no longer have its cohesive and shear strength to carry building loads. Ground fracture
9&vem6er3, 1993
Vagt VC-23
y
is characterized by surface cracks and dips which increase the potential for erosion and landslides. Clay gouge occurs as a result of uneven ground settlement. Clay is more fine-grained than other soils. Thus, repeated ground movement will cause more settlement in areas with clayey soils than in other places.
A soil’s potential to expand when wet, and shrink when dry, depends upon the type and amount of clay in the soil. Soil with certain types and a high amount of clay tend to swell or expand when water content is increased. They also shrink disproportionately when dry. Highly expansive soils can cause structural damage to foundations and roads. Lawn watering could concentrate subsurface water and subsequent soil expansion could cause land slippage. Soils with low shrink/swell potentials are suitable for building, with other factors considered. A high shrink/swell potential makes the site less suitable. Detailed investigations may be necessary for areas with moderate to high expansion potentials. Development on expansive soils requires special grading and construction techniques which increase development costs.
The propensity for soil erosion by wind or water runoff is dependent on soil type and its consolidation, vegetative cover, slope, and the runoff velocity. Erosive soils are often found in steep slopes where runoff velocity is also greatest and vegetative cover least. Eroded materials end up on the valley floor with coarse materials near the hillsides and finer ones in areas farther from the slopes.
Complete elimination of these geologic hazards is not possible due to the expense and the potential damage to the environment from massive alteration of the terrain. Danger can be avoided by prohibiting construction in areas with soil stability problems. It can also be reduced to some extent by grading and other engineering methods which remedy soil instability and provide a stable foundation for building construction. Differences in soil stability require specific engineering methods to offset the potential damage to the foundation and the reduced structural strength of buildings.
Aircraft Accident Potential
The Draft Auburn Airport Master Plan reports that seventy-five percent of aircraft accidents have been reported to happen on or near airport runways. These accidents may cause injury, death, fire, explosion, damage to property, and special and nuclear cargo problems, straining hospital facilities, disrupting traffic and utilities, and causing crowd control problems.
The presence of the Auburn Municipal Airport in the planning area carries the probability of aircraft accidents in surrounding areas. The number of flights at the airport fluctuates with an average of 65,000 operations over the last two years. Although forty-six accidents have occurred at the airport since 1964, only three accidents have occurred since 1984.
The airport minimizes disaster potential by following strict safety precautions and by having its own emergency personnel for crash and rescue operations. Development

proposals around the airport are subject to review and approval by the FAA to ensure compatibility with the airport. High density developments around the runway approach zones are limited or prohibited by the adopted Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUP).
Hazardous Materials/Wastes
Trace metals and chemical compounds used in industry have caused toxic pollution of the environment and harmful effects on man. The concern for the production, storage, transport, and disposal of hazardous materials/wastes arises in the wake of widely publicized health and safety problems due to improper handling.
Interstate 80 and Highway 49 pass through Auburn. - The bulk of truck carried hazardous materials that enter the County do so via 1-80. The cargos consist of a wide range of hazardous substances. Although the road Is well maintained and a controlled access roadway, there are some steep and sharp turns that severely tax the brakes and handling ability of semi-trailer trucks. A propane gas spill Interstate 80 through Auburn in 1988.
In addition to highway traffic, other hazardous materials are transported through Auburn on the Southern Pacific Railroad and a major pipeline which runs along Borland Avenue.
Historically, hazardous materials incidents in Auburn have been frequent but of a relatively minor nature compared to more urbanized and industrialized areas.
In accordance with Assembly Bill 2948 (Tanner 1986), the City and County are jointly preparing a Hazardous Waste Management Plan which will include:
•	An analysis of the hazardous waste streams generated in the city.
•	A description of existing hazardous waste facilities which treat, handle, recycle, and dispose of hazardous waste in the city.
•	An analysis of the potential for reducing the volume of hazardous waste through recycling and source reduction.
•	A consideration of the need for the management of small volumes of hazardous waste produced by businesses and households.
•	A determination of the need for additional hazardous waste facilities to meet expected generation volumes.
•	An identification of existing facilities that may be expanded or siting criteria to identify new hazardous waste facilities.
•	A statement of goals, objectives and policies for siting of hazardous waste facilities and the general management of hazardous waste facilities and the general management of hazardous waste through the year 2000.
•	A schedule which describes City actions necessary to implement the plan through the year 2000.
Assembly Bills 2185 and 2187 (Waters, 1985 and 1986) were intended to protect public health and safety, and the environment by establishing business and area plans relating
r i

_______________J
V-....-
to the handling, and release or threatened release of hazardous materials/wastes. The area plan for Placer County has been developed and is implemented by the Placer County Division of Environmental Health. The area plan covers all of Placer County and includes an inventory of hazardous materials/wastes facilities in the County including Auburn, procedures for emergency notification response, pre-emergency planning measures, and public safety information. Facilities with more than a specified amount of hazardous materials/wastes on-site, must submit a business plan to the Placer County Division of Environmental Health. The information in the Placer County Area Plan is available for public review.
Assembly Bill 939 (Sher, 1989), the California Integrated Waste Management Act, was enacted to reduce the amount of solid waste that must be disposed of by transformation or "transportation" and land disposal. Each County, City or local governmental agency which provides solid waste handling services must "provide services that include, but are not limited to, source reduction, recycling, composting activities, and the collection, transfer, and disposal of solid waste within or without the territory subject to its solid waste handling jurisdiction." There are no hazardous waste landfills currently operated by the City of Auburn. The Auburn Placer disposal site, however, is a transfer station presently in use near the Auburn Airport.
Several State agencies monitor hazardous materials/waste facilities. Potential and known contamination sites are monitored and documented by the Department of Health Services (DHS) and the Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB). A review of the leaking underground storage tank list produced by the RWQCB, and the Hazardous Waste and Substances Sites List produced by the Office of Planning and Research indicates no hazardous waste sites are located in Auburn.
If an imminent public health threat is posed by an outside factor, the city will support local regulating agencies in notifying the public.
The transport of hazardous materials/wastes and explosives through the planning area is regulated by the California Department of Transportation (DOT). Interstate 80 is open to vehicles carrying hazardous materials/wastes. City streets and unincorporated County areas are generally not designated as hazardous materials/wastes transportation routes, but a permit may be granted on a case-by-case basis. Transporters of hazardous wastes are required to be certified by the DOT and manifests are required to track the hazardous waste during transport. The danger of hazardous materials/wastes spills during transport does exist and will potentially increase as transportation of these materials increases on Interstate 80, Highway 49, and the railroad. The Placer County Office of Emergency Services (OES), Placer County Division of Environmental Health, the Auburn Police Department, and the Auburn Fire Department are responsible for hazardous materials accidents at all locations within the City.
Development of industrial land in the planning area could increase risks associated with hazardous materials/wastes use. Programs for proper storage, handling, and disposal need to be developed according to State, Federal, and local guidelines to reduce those risks. The City will support and assist in such programs.

Crime
Crime and other acts of violence undermine the community's sense of security and threaten public safety. As Auburn develops, the increasing concentration of population will bring increasing criminal activities, although not necessarily increasing the crime rate (number of crimes per 1,000 population). While it is expected that individuals will take normal precautions to protect themselves from danger, the city provides additional protection from harm brought on by the malicious intent of others.
COWSTRA/ATTS
Constraints to public safety are a result of both natural events and the activities of man. Natural hazards are caused by excess rainfall, seismic activity, landslides or high winds. Man made hazards are the result of aircraft accident, crime, hazardous materials spills, and fires. The following are some of the factors which constrain protection of the public:
1.	Unpredictability. Natural disasters are often unpredictable. In order to reduce the danger of disaster precautionary measures are required. Avoidance of flood-prone areas and flood control measures are necessary. Construction to earthquake standards has proven effective to reduce losses in seismic events. Emergency plans which include evacuation, medical aid, and temporary food and shelter are important.
2.	Existing Land Development. Prior settlement patterns and very dense development often present difficult access problems for emergency vehicles. Undefined evacuation routes and lack of emergency communication lines are also problems for emergency service providers.
3.	Priorities. Public safety may be described as the preservation of human life and the protection of property. These values underlie the concept of human settlement: however, the relative importance of saving lives or saving property is sometimes a subjective decision.
4.	Human Carelessness. Carelessness often leads to accidents which can involve automobiles, airplanes, hazardous materials spills, urban fires and forest fires. Public education and safety rules and regulations are important to avoid careless attitudes and actions.
5.	Individual Precaution. Citizens often are the cause of their own disasters through lack of available or at-hand precautions, i.e. not locking doors at night or when away, swimming alone, drinking and driving, or smoking in bed.
6.	Economics. Economic considerations often play an important role in providing for public safety. Budget limitations force difficult decisions related to deciding which safety measures are more important or cost effective.

ECONOMIC ELEMENT
Previously Auburn. Hotel - Auburn Promenade
1. EntraducUon
The economic growth rate of a city or area is controlled by numerous factors, many of which operate at both regional and national levels beyond the direct influence of local governments. However, the purpose of this Economic Element is to provide a framework for future economic development in Auburn, including the development of methods and strategies for creating new opportunities for future economic growth and development within the city. This Economic Element addresses Auburn’s fiscal condition because the City’s fiscal resources can be directly connected to its ability to provide amenities that attract economic development.

Economic growth and development are crucial to the City for three reasons:
1.	Supply of jobs in the community.
2.	Production of goods and services.
3.	Maintenance of a tax base for the community that will ensure the financial stability of the city and provide financial resources for future municipal programs and projects.
To reach the goal of economic viability, the labor market must have a varied economy where new opportunities are constantly available, where upward mobility is possible and where entry-level positions already exist. An important factor in recruiting new business and industry is the matching of job skills of the local labor force with the needs of business and industry, in itself an ever changing arena. The Auburn Airport Industrial Park is an important location for industrial development in the Auburn Area, however, it is an island within the County. To achieve economic balance, the island needs to be eliminated, joining the airport with the remainder of the City through annexation.
This element is an optional or “elective” element of the Auburn General Plan. That is, although not one of the seven elements mandated by the state, the preparation of an Economic Element to the General Plan is authorized by Section 65303 of the California Government Code, which states: "The General Plan may include any other elements or address any other subjects, which in the judgement of the legislative body relate to the physical development of the County or City."
The inclusion of the Economic Element in the Auburn General Plan is an indication of the awareness of the City of the influence of economic factors on the development of a viable community, of adequate levels of community services, and the standard of living.
2.	Goals and Policies
The goals and policies in this report were developed in conjunction with the Citizens Advisory Committee for the City of Auburn General Plan Update. These Goals and Policies are presented by topic and sequentially, not by priority.
Goal 1:	Provide a land development pattern, planning process, and
regulatory atmosphere conducive to maintaining and increasing employment opportunities for City residents and fostering new economic development.
Policy 1.1 Focus on attracting clean, non-polluting industries.
1.2	Actively encourage new industries that will employ city residents.

1.3	Consider the adequacy of economic development efforts on an annual basis.
1.4	Attempt to increase the number of persons who both work and live in the city.
1.5	Develop industrial lands primarily for economic activities that contribute to local employment and income.
1.6	Support airport improvements.
Goal 2:	Enhance the City’s sales tax revenues by strengthening the City's retailing to serve the needs of local residents and encouraging shoppers from outside the community.
Policy 2.1	Improve commercial areas by providing a variety of commercial needs for tourists and residents.
2.2	Improve economic development through promotion and by utilizing redevelopment funds.
Goal 3:	Maintain and expand existing businesses.
Policy 3.1	The Chamber of Commerce, Main Street, City, and Merchants Associations should all work together to promote the retention and expansion of existing businesses.
Policy 3.2	The City will utilize and promote redevelopment to retain and expand existing businesses.
Goal 4:	Encourage tourism, conventions and development of a conference center.
Policy 4.1	Emphasize Auburn as a tourist stop.
Policy 4.2	Strengthen and maintain tourism as a major industry in Auburn.
Policy 4.3	The City of Auburn and Chamber of Commerce will promote the development and utilization of a conference center.

Economic Profile
Auburn’s economic profile is characterized by government, service and retail, industrial and tourist related employment. Auburn is the county seat of Placer County with the County representing the largest employer in the Auburn area. Table X-1 summarizes the major employers in the Auburn area.
As Table X-l indicates, most of the large employers in Auburn provide services to the local population. The lack of industrial sector jobs is due in part to two factors: (1) the close proximity of Auburn to Roseville and Sacramento where significant amounts of industrial sector jobs are located: and (2) development constraints such as topography and difficulty in access. Thus, Auburn operates as a bedroom community to the more developed areas in and around Sacramento.
According to the Jobs/Housing Balance Issue Paper prepared for the 1991 Auburn Bowman Community Plan Update, the Auburn area is job poor and housing rich. (Jobs/housing balance is typically expressed as a ratio of jobs to housing units: 1:1 denoting one job for each housing unit.) In the City limits of Auburn, the 1990 jobs/housing ratio was 0.81 to 1. This ratio was only somewhat higher in the unincorporated area around Auburn. In addition to the poor jobs/housing balance, further analysis in the study showed that the Auburn area lacks the important match between jobholder’s housing needs at prices commensurate with their wages, and jobs to support the more expensive residences in the area.
The implications of the above information for this General Plan are important in the development of opportunities for economic development in Auburn. Opportunities which Auburn should consider include the following:
1.	Auburn has been recognized as a tourist stop. This statement means that Auburn has been a destination for travelers and has significant attractions to warrant extended visits by tourists travelling through the area. To improve Auburn’s attractiveness as a tourist spot, emphasis should be placed on lodging, food, entertainment, as well as its unique historical background. The City of Auburn imposes a Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) that serves as a source of revenue. This tax currently stands at 8%, 2% of which is passed to the Chamber of Commerce and 6% of which remains with the City. The revenue accrued from TOT for fiscal year 1991-92 was approximately $15,500.
2.	Auburn offers unique recreational opportunities. These include, but are not limited to, fishing, gold panning, swimming, rafting, mountain biking, hiking, horseback riding, golfing, and picnicking.
3.	Auburn has the potential resources to provide adequate sites for small industrial employers. Areas such as the Auburn Municipal Airport

Industrial Park and the industrially zoned areas along Nevada Street and Borland Avenue provide the opportunity for small scale industrial development to occur. Interstate 80 is directly accessible from all of these sites and public infrastructure such as water and sewer is currently in place.
4.	Auburn is in an ideal location to provide services to the growing population of the Sacramento area. Possibilities include recreational services such as golf courses, hiking, biking and hotel services for tourists and conventions.
C/ty of Auburn budget
In order to understand how Auburn’s fiscal resources are generated and utilized, the following analysis discussion of the City’s 1988 to 1991 budgets have been included in the Economic Element. While commercial and industrial uses are taxed like residential uses, they usually do not create the same demand for public services. In effect, commercial and industrial uses help finance public services provided to Auburn's residential areas. A solid base is crucial to the City, for it is this base which generates funds which pay for many of the basic public services the City of Auburn must provide.
Revenue
In fiscal year 1990-91, the City of Auburn’s estimated total general fund resources totaled $4,511,726 (Final 1990-91 Operating Budget-City of Auburn). The sources of funding are described in Table X-2.
The total represents a seven percent increase from revenues during fiscal year 1989-90 (when revenues totaled $4,203,672) and a 22 percent increase from revenues during fiscal year 1988-89 (when revenues totaled $3,729,378). The most significant source of increase was revenue from service charges which rose by 67 percent. Other significant contributors to the increase were; a) revenues from “other agencies”; b) sale of documents, insurance refunds, etc., (a 46 percent increase); c) permits (a 38 percent increase); and d) property rentals (a 35 percent increase).
Expenditures
In fiscal year 1990-91, the City of Auburn’s estimated expenditures totaled $5,160,191, The expenditures, by department, were as follows:
•	Police (24.37%),
•	Non-departmental; insurance,	contractual services, retirement, annexation
costs, etc. (22.74%),
•	Public services (18.92%),

Estimated revenues are expected to remain constant until the current (1992) economic climate improves. A decline in revenues occurred in 1992-92 due to the loss of Lumberjack. Safeway, and Alpine Market. Recent changes in state property tax allocations have also contributed to the decline in revenues. New sources of revenue along with the attraction of new revenue generating business are needed.
Although the City of Auburn is not facing a budget deficit, the future economic picture of the City is not clear. Currently 66 percent of the City’s budget is spent on salaries with the remaining 34 percent available for materials, supplies, and capital. This is typical for most cities. Most of the 34 percent is allocated to materials and supplies. Therefore, significant public resources are not available for capital improvements for community services and amenities. In addition, the City has suffered the loss of three large commercial retailers, whose sales taxes are an important resource in the City’s annual budget. Facing the situation described above, the City of Auburn may have to increase its dependence on private resources in the future to fund public services and amenities such as the construction and maintenance of roadways and parks. To provide for the City’s needs, stable, long-term revenue generators need to be attracted and maintained.
These programs relate to the adopted goals and policies. . The implementation and completion of the programs represent the means by which progress in carrying out the Goals and Policies will be measured.

The Historic Element is an Optional Element of the General Plan (Government Code Section 65303). The following Goals and Policies are presented by topic and sequentially, not by priority.
2,	Goals wad Mteta
The goals and policies in this report were developed in conjunction with the Citizen Advisory Committee for the City of Auburn General Plan Update. These Goals and Policies are presented by topic and sequentially, not by priority.
Goal 1:	Preserve all historical sites and enhance the character of the
historic districts.
Policy 1.1	Implement the Historic Development Guidelines listed in the Historic
Element.
Policy 1.2 Preserve existing Indian and Chinese cemeteries and other historic sites.
3.	Esdsttog Conditions
Auburn lies in the heart of territory formerly occupied by the Nisenan or Southern Maidu Indians. Their country encompassed the Bear, Yuba and American River basins. The Nisenan languages and dialects were related to those of the Northeastern or Mountain Maidu of the upper Feather River drainage system in much of what is now Plumas County and the Konkow or Northwestern Maidu of the lower Feather River and Butte Creek basins in much of modem-day Butte County.
It has been noted that the economy of the Hill Nisenan was so diversified, the means of resource exploitation so effective, and the carrying capacity so relatively high, that Hill Nisenan territory was among the most densely populated in prehistoric California. Acorns, deer and fish were the primary staples of the Nisenan diet, and these were supplemented with a vast array of smaller game, nuts, seeds, roots, berries, herbs, fruits and fungi.
The discovery of gold in 1848 on a ravine in the center of what is now Old Town led to the first Anglo settlement in Auburn. By April of 1849 a mining camp was well established. It was initially called by several names—North Fork Dry Diggins, Rich Ravine, Wood’s Dry Diggins—but by November of 1849 it became known as Auburn (Auburn Main Street Architectural Design Guidelines (AMSADG), 1989).
The Chinese came to the Auburn area with the advent of the railroads and the gold mining, as laborers, miners, cooks and merchants.

Although gold led to the beginning of Auburn, a secondary economy soon evolved around banking, lodging, and provisions as other areas of the Mother Lode opened up to gold mining. This resulted in the development of a variety of building types to house each of these activities. Old Town’s population also began to change, reflecting Auburn’s developing economy, from predominantly miners to a population that included lawyers, bankers, and shopkeepers (AMSADG, 1989).
Incorporation of Auburn as a city occurred in 1860; then it disincorporated in 1868 and reincorporated in 1888. In 1865, the transcontinental railroad from Sacramento arrived in Auburn with a profound effect. The railroad chose to bypass Old Town, establishing tracks and a station to the east, closer to what was to become the Downtown area of Auburn. With the development of Downtown, two historic areas evolved in Auburn, each with its own distinct character reflecting the time, people, and events that influenced development of the area.
Today Old Town functions as a specialty retail shopping area attracting both locals and tourists. Downtown plays a significant role as a major commercial area in Auburn and has a significant amount of 1920s-era buildings housing a wide variety of retail goods and services.
In addition to the above noted historic commercial areas, there are two historic residential neighborhoods, the Downtown Residential neighborhood and the Foresthill /Aeolia neighborhood which contain homes constructed between the mid- 1800s and the early 1900s.
Current Preservation Efforts
Preservation efforts in Auburn have led to the development of two historic districts. The Old Town Historic District includes buildings constructed between 1850 and 1900. The Downtown Historic District includes buildings constructed between 1900 and 1940 with many 1920s-era structures dominating the area. Each historic district is surrounded by a larger design review district delineated to include many of the surrounding properties that give Auburn its historic character. Design guidelines and zoning regulations have been developed to control demolition, remodeling, and new construction within these design review districts. (Table XI-2) Each district prohibits the demolition of historic structures, requires that the remodeling of historic and non-historic structures to meet design guidelines, and requires that new construction meet design guidelines. However, the district regulations do not apply to residential structures and application of the guidelines are subject to approval or denial by the Old Town Historic Design Review Committee and the Planning Commission, For the Downtown Review District, the Downtown Design Review Committee makes recommendations with final action by the Planning Commission (these actions can be appealed to the City Council).
A significant number of historic sites are outside the existing Old Town and Downtown Design Review Districts. For instance, many historic residential sites can be found along the American River Canyon to the northeast of Old Town and Downtown Auburn. Exclusion of these historic sites from review districts or regulation could allow legal
r

removal or significant alteration to many of Auburn’s significant historical structures. Enlarging the design review districts, however, will not adequately preserve historic residential structures because neither the design guidelines nor the zoning regulations apply to any building designed for or used exclusively for residential purposes.
The existing design guidelines and historic districts are documented in the Auburn Main Street Architectural Design Guidelines (AMSADG), developed under the Auburn Main Street program to revitalize Old Town and Downtown Auburn. The omission of many historic sites from the Design Review Districts stems from the purpose of the Auburn Main Street program, which is to revitalize the two "Main" Streets to ensure that quality and compatible building improvements are made to further economic revitalization efforts. The emphasis of the Main Street program led to boundaries that omitted residential historic sites outside of the commercial areas of Old Town and Downtown Auburn.
To remedy this situation, the Historic Element is included as an optional element to the General Plan with the specific purpose of identifying historic sites in Auburn and developing regulations or guidelines to preserve historic residential, as well as commercial, sites and to ensure the compatibility of new construction in historic areas.
Historic Element inventory
Identification of Auburn’s historic sites is presented in the City of Auburn Historical Resources Inventory (CAHRI). The CAHRI was initiated after the loss of two historic buildings. This document is a supporting reference document. A supplemental survey was conducted by City and consultant staff for the specific purposes of identifying additional areas that should be considered for historic preservation. The CAHRI contains a complete listing of historic sites in Auburn based upon National Register status codes. The supplemental survey concentrated on historic structures that reflected local characteristics to supplement the use of national standards in the CAHRI. For the Historic Element, the CAHRI criteria were simplified as shown in Table XI-1 and then used with the supplemental survey to define additional historic areas that specifically reflect Auburn’s past.

The CAHRI and the supplemental survey, indicate that there are potentially about 400 historically significant properties within the city limits. As shown in Figure XI-1, these surveys suggest that an additional new historic area be identified to coincide with the 1948 Auburn City Limits. This is designated as Area HI, the Historic Residential Area, in the following guidelines.
4.	Historic Etozdcpmcnt Guidelines
Auburn contains two distinct historic commercial areas and a large historic residential area. Each area differs in respect to land use, time period, and historic styles. Therefore, each historic area will require different standards and guidelines for preservation.
Area I:	The Old Town Historic Commercial area—circa 1850-1900.
Area H:	The Downtown Historic Commercial area which displays 1900 to
1940 style buildings and contains a significant number of Twenties era buildings.
Area HI:	The Historic Residential Area—circa 1850-1940. The area within the
1948 Auburn City Limits.
The following Development Guidelines are intended for Areas I and II identified above. In these areas a public hearing is required for a demolition permit and extreme alteration. The Development Guidelines should be used in conjunction with the Auburn Main Street Architectural Design Guidelines (AMSADG). These development guidelines can be advisory or mandatory. It should be noted that all successful historic districts in the country have mandatory guidelines. To be mandatory, the City Council must adopt ordinances requiring that all existing, modified, and new structures comply with the development guidelines. If the Auburn Historic Area is to continue to compete with Old Sacramento, Nevada City, and other historic areas—the semblance of "older buildings" must be apparent.
In the guidelines, the term "shall" is mandatory and "should" is advisory. Authentic means that all building components are of the stated era and style. Compatible means a building has a combination of old and new components so that it appears to be compatible with the surrounding older buildings. Contemporary refers to any architectural style after 1940.
For Area III identified above, a public hearing is required for a demolition permit or extreme alteration. Implementation Measure E requires preparation of design guidelines for this area. This element does not include specific regulations for Area III.
Area I-Old town Historic Commercial Area
This area contains a number of buildings which were constructed during the 1850-1900 period. The goal is to preserve this area in a pre-1900 style. Semi-modernization and infill with new pseudo western buildings would eliminate the potential for a historic

context. The following guidelines are intended to preserve the authenticity of this area. All building construction, renovations or additions, all signs and other structures are subject to the City’s zoning, building, sign and other similar regulatory measures. Also, improvements within the Historic District (HD) currently require approval from the Old Town Historic Design Review Committee.
Exteriors
The exterior elements of a building include all walls, foundation, roof elements, doors, windows glazing, porch elements, eaves, chimneys, shutters and appurtenances.
1.1	Demolition of existing historic buildings shall undergo a public hearing process.
1.2	Remodel of an historic building shall be authentic and compatible with other historic buildings in the area (Circa 1850 to 1900).
1.3	Non-historic buildings may remain.
1.4	Remodel of existing non-historic buildings shall be compatible with the building itself and where possible should be compatible with the surrounding areas’ historic buildings.
1.5	All new construction shall be in 1850-1900 style.
Accessory Buildings
Garages, work sheds and other accessory uses should only be located in rear yards as required by the Zoning Ordinance.
Signage
All signs must be in accordance with the City of Auburn Sign Ordinance and Main Street Design Guidelines. All new signs should be compatible with the 1850-1900 building styles.
Street Appurtenances and Landscaping
Streets, walks, alleys and open spaces were sparse within business areas in the late 1800s. Boardwalks, dirt streets and a few trees were most common. A return to these types of improvements would not be practical for a rehabilitated Old Town Auburn area. Appropriate improvements, however, are discussed in the Main Street Design Guidelines and the Design Workplan.
Parking Facilities
Parking facilities should be consistent with Main Street Design Guidelines and Design Workplan.

2, Specific Plan toplememtaUon
The urban reserve designation requires the preparation of a specific plan prior to the commencement of development. The criteria which shall apply to the preparation of a specific plan are outlined on the next page.
The following is taken from the State of California General Plan Guidelines, June 1987.
A specific plan is a tool for the “systematic implementation** of the general plan. It may be applied to all or a portion of the area covered by a general plan. Any interested party may request the adoption, amendment or repeal of a specific plan. While a plan may be prepared by either the public or private sectors, plan adoption, amendment and repeal are the responsibility of the local legislature. As a legislative act, however, a specific plan is subject to the referendum and initiative processes.
At a minimum, a specific plan must include a statement of its relationship to the general plan (Government Code Section 65451 (b)) and a text and diagram(s) that specify all of the following in detail:
•	The distribution, location, and extent of the uses of land, including open space, within the area covered by the plan.
•	The proposed distribution, location, and extent and intensity of major components of public and private transportation, sewage, water, drainage, solid waste disposal, energy, and other essential facilities proposed to be located within the area covered by the plan and needed to support the land uses described in the plan.
•	Standards and criteria by which development will proceed, and standards for the conservation, development, and utilization of natural resources, where applicable.
•	A program of implementation measures including regulations, programs, public works projects and financing measures necessary to carry out the provisions of the preceding three paragraphs (Government Code Section 654451(a)).
These requirements are general and enable a local government to select from a wide range of land use criteria and implementation programs. Specific plans may also address any other subject which in the judgment of the planning agency is necessary or desirable for general plan implementation (Government Code Section 65452).
As allowed under Government Code Section 65452, the City of Auburn has developed the following additional specific plan requirements. This criteria was developed because of the unique environmental, circulation, and infrastructure impacts that will result due to development of the urban reserve area in southwest Auburn. These requirements are minimum standards, therefore, additional requirements may be required for the development of a specific plan.
1.	Infrastructure elements shall evaluate storm drainage, water system, sewer system, and gas and electricity.

2.	The circulation element shall evaluate access, streets, public transit and bikeways.
3.	Environmental conditions analysis shall evaluate topography, geology/soils, biology and wetlands, noise, historical and cultural resources, and public services and schools.
4.	A land use concept shall be developed that includes the proposed land use pattern, the collector street system, the location and extent of public facilities, and the location and amenities of park and recreation facilities.
5.	The specific plan shall also include an infrastructure master plan with cost estimates,
urban design guidelines, and an implementation, phasing and financial plan.

Trip
A one-way journey that proceeds from an origin to a destination via a single mode of transportation; the smallest unit of movement considered in transportation studies. Each trip has one “production end/ (or origin—often from home, but not always), and one “attraction end,” (destination).
Trip Generation
The dynamics that account for people making trips in automobiles or by means of public transportation.

slowing its conversion to urban and suburban development. The program entails a ten-year contract between the City or County and an owner of land whereby the land is taxed on the basis of its agricultural use rather than its market value. The land becomes subject to certain enforceable restrictions, and certain conditions need to be met prior to approval of an agreement.
Zone, Combining
A special purpose zone which is superimposed over the regular zoning map. Combining zones are used for a variety of purposes, such as airport compatibility, floodplain or wetlands protection, historic designation, or special parking regulations. Also called “overlay zone?
Zone, Interim
A zoning designation that temporarily reduces or freezes allowable development in an area until a permanent classification can be fixed; generally assigned during General Plan preparation to provide a basis for permanent zoning.
Zone, Traffic
In a mathematical traffic model the area to be studied is divided into zones, with each zone treated as producing and attracting trips. The production of trips by a zone is based on the number of trips to or from work or shopping, or other trips produced per dwelling unit.
Zoning
The division of a city or county by legislative regulations into areas, or zones, that specify allowable uses for real property and size restrictions for buildings within these areas; a program that implements policies of the General Plan.

required open space, provision for low- and moderate-income housing, or plans for public plazas and courts at ground level—are included in a project.
ZO/WG, INCLUSIONARY
Regulations which increase housing choice by providing the opportunity to construct more diverse and economical housing to meet the needs of low- and moderate-income families. Often such regulations require a minimum percentage of housing for low- and moderate-income households in new housing developments and in conversions of apartments to condominiums.
Zoning Map
Government Code §65851 permits a legislative body to divide a county, a city, or portions thereof, into zones of the number, shape, and area it deems best suited to carry out the purposes of the zoning ordinance. These zones are delineated on a map or maps, called the Zoning Map.
