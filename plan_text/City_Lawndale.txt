I. INTRODUCTION
A. Community Context
Established over a century ago, Lawndale is a small but highly urbanized community
located in the South Bay area of the Los Angeles basin. Although Lawndale encompasses
approximately two square miles, the community is home to nearly 33,500 residents with
only a few parcels of remaining vacant land. Surrounding communities include Hawthorne
to the north, Redondo Beach to the west, and Torrance to the south. Lawndale is well
served by several regional transportation systems, including the San Diego (405) Freeway
and Hawthorne Boulevard (107 Highway) which both pass through the community.
Historically, Lawndale experienced much of its growth after World War II when the City
lost much of its rural character and evolved into a bedroom community primarily consisting
of single-family homes. Since 1970, development in the City has consisted of these older
single-family homes being replaced with higher density projects such as duplexes and
multi-family projects of three or more units. Over the past 15 years, Lawndale has
undergone significant economic changes. Heavily impacted by closures in the aerospace
industry and the economic recession in the early 1990s, unemployment became a concern
for many residents and housing prices in the City dropped dramatically. Since 2000,
economic prosperity throughout Southern California has resulted in new employment
opportunities and improvements in the regional housing market.
Since 2000, Lawndale has also experienced demographic changes that have impacted
housing needs in the community. Lawndale has become increasingly diverse in race and
ethnicity, with Hispanics now comprising over more than half of the population and Asians
comprising more than 12 percent. About 31 percent of the City’s households resided in
overcrowded conditions (23 percent renter-households and 8 percent owner-households),
according to the 2000 Census. Another trend is the increasing average household size of the
community. Average household size increased from 3.3 in 2000 to 3.5 in 2007. With limited
housing growth, the overcrowding conditions have likely worsened since 2000.
Lawndale’s housing stock primarily consists of single-family homes which account for 66
percent of all housing units, with approximately one-third consisting of multi-family units
and a small number of mobile homes. Much of the City’s residentially zoned land allows
two single family detached dwellings per lot without going through a subdivision process.
In addition to presenting opportunities for further residential intensification, this flexibility
may help to explain the predominance of renter-households (65 percent) in Lawndale;
owners of lots with two units can choose to either rent both units or live in one unit and rent
the other. In addition, close to 80 percent of the City’s housing units are over 30 years old,
indicating that housing rehabilitation is also a concern in the community.
The median price of all homes sold in Lawndale in November 2007 was $455,000, lower than
most surrounding communities.1 Rents ranged between $720 for a studio unit to over $3,000
                                                            
1 Note: The City permits two attached or detached single family units per legal lot throughout most of the City.
The median price for homes may include the sale of lots with two units.

                                                                                                            1
                                                                                            December 2010
 

for a single-family home. However, relative to other South Bay communities, housing costs
in Lawndale are relatively affordable.
Due to the City’s built-out status, housing growth occurred primarily through single-family
infill on underutilized parcels throughout the community. This growth has been facilitated
through the City’s Zoning Code, which permits the majority of residential lots in the
community to have more than one housing unit. The City’s Redevelopment Agency has
also begun playing an active role in the community fostering the revitalization of residential
and commercial areas. Future housing development will take place primarily as mixed-use
development as part of the revitalization project along Hawthorne Boulevard and various
other infill and underutilized parcels throughout the community.
B. Authorization for the Housing Element
The California State Legislature has identified the attainment of a decent home and suitable
living environment for every California as the State’s major housing goal. Recognizing the
important role of local planning programs in pursuit of this goal, the State law requires that
all jurisdictions to periodically prepare a housing element as part of their comprehensive
General Plan. Section 65583 of the Government Code sets forth the specific components to
be contained in a Housing Element. This 2008-2014 Lawndale Housing Element is prepared
in compliance with State law and covers the period of July 1, 2008 through June 30, 2014.
C. Organization of the Housing Element
The Lawndale Housing Element is comprised of the following major components:
        Housing Needs Assessment: An analysis of the City's population, household and
         employment base, and the characteristics to identify housing needs.
        Housing Constraints: A review of potential market, governmental,                 and
         environmental constraints to meeting the City’s identified housing needs.
        Housing Resources: An evaluation of opportunities that will further the
         development of new housing.
        Housing Plan: A statement of the Housing Plan to address Lawndale's identified
         housing needs, including housing goals, policies and programs.

           December 2010
 

D. Data Sources
In preparing the Housing Element, various sources of information were consulted. The 2000
Census provided the basis for population and household characteristics. Although dated,
the Census is still the most comprehensive and widely accepted source on demographic
characteristics.2 In addition, the 2000 Census is used in the Housing Element to ensure
consistency with State and federal housing programs. However, several sources of
information are used to supplement and provide reliable updates of the 2000 Census. These
include:
              Population and demographic data is updated by the Department of Finance as of
               2008.
              Housing market information, such as home sales, rents, and vacancies, is updated by
               home sales data, regional statistical data and the Department of Finance as of 2008.
              Local and County service agencies are consulted for information on special needs
               populations, the services available to them, and gaps in the system as of 2007.
              Lending patterns were analyzed from financial institutions based on an analysis of
               Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data of 2006.
E. Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
The City of Lawndale General Plan is comprised of the following seven elements:
              Land Use
              Circulation
              Housing
              Economic Development
              Open Space, Conservation
              Air Quality Management Plan
              Safety
              Noise
The Housing Element is being updated at this time in conformance with the update cycle for
jurisdictions in the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) region. The
Housing Element builds upon the other General Plan elements and is entirely consistent
with the policies and proposals set forth by the Plan. As portions of the General Plan are
amended in the future, the Plan (including the Housing Element) will be reviewed to ensure
internal consistency is maintained.
                                                            
2      The Bureau of the Census provides updated survey data for communities over 65,000 in population through
       the American Community Survey process. Lawndale’s population size is substantially below this threshold
       and therefore is not included in the survey updates.
                                                             CITY OF LAWNDALE| 2008-2014 HOUSING ELEMENT
                                                                                                          3
                                                                                            December 2010
 

F. Public Participation
Section 65583 (c)(5) of the Government Code states that, "The local government shall make
diligent effort to achieve public participation of all economic segments of the community in
the development of the housing element, and the program shall describe this effort." The
City of Lawndale encourages and solicits the participation of its residents and other local
agencies in the process of identifying housing and community development needs, and
prioritizing expenditure of funds.
1. Planning Commission Study Sessions
On September 26, 2007, a study session on the Housing Element update was conducted
before the Planning Commission to discuss Housing Element requirements and housing
needs in the community. A second Study Session was conducted on July 23, 2008 to review
issues and opportunities with the Planning Commission.
The meetings were advertised in the Daily Breeze. Direct invitation increases the exposure of
the City’s Housing Element update process to nonprofit agencies and community groups.
Special invitation was sent out to the following agencies:
       Bet Tzedek
       Bridge Housing
       California Department of Rehabilitation – South Bay Office
       Habitat for Humanity
       Hope in Action/Hope Chapel
       House of Yahweh
       Jamboree Housing Corporation
       Lawndale Medical/Mental Health Services
       Lawndale Senior Center
       Lawndale Senior Housing
       Lawndale Special Transportation
       Legal Aid
       Los Angeles Community Design Center
       Project New Hope
       Salvation Army Family Services/His House
       Transitional Living Centers
       Westside Regional Center
No resident or community group attended the study sessions and no public comment was
received at the meeting. The City also broadcasted these meetings on public access
television. No comment was received from the public following the broadcast.

2. Consultation with Service Providers
As no agency or resident attended the September 2007 study session, to expand the efforts
of community outreach, telephone interviews were conducted in October 2007 to directly
solicit input on housing needs from service agencies. Conducting telephone interviews is an
effective means of obtaining input from the public and community stakeholders. This
approach allows the City to proactively reach out to groups that represent the frontline
agencies serving the low and moderate income persons and those with special needs. They
are often the “eyes and ears” of a community and are also aware of the issues and trends
impacting a community.
The following agencies responded to the interviews:
        California Department of Rehabilitation – South Bay office
        House of Yahweh
        Lawndale Medical/Mental Health Services
        Lawndale Senior Center
        Project New Hope
        Salvation Army Family Services/His House
        Transitional Living Centers
        Westside Regional Center
Most agencies interviewed did not indicate any specific housing needs in Lawndale for their
clients. However, the Lawndale Senior Center commented on the need for Section 8
housing assistance for seniors and the Center provides referral services for seniors to obtain
information and assistance from the Lawndale Housing Authority. This Housing Element
includes a program to expand Section 8 assistance to residents.
The House of Yahweh serves lower income persons, victims of domestic violence, and the
homeless through distribution of food, clothing, and a transitional housing facility that
provides accommodation of up to six months. The House of Yahweh commented that
additional transitional housing is needed in Lawndale. This Housing Element includes a
program to address the provision of transitional housing in Lawndale.
3. Public Review of Draft Housing Element
The Draft Lawndale Housing Element was available for public review at the following
locations:
        Lawndale City Hall
        Lawndale Senior Center
        City website
                                         CITY OF LAWNDALE| 2008-2014 HOUSING ELEMENT
                                                                                          5
                                                                        December 2010
 

4. Public Hearings
Public hearings will be conducted before the Planning Commission and City Council to
review the Draft Housing Element and to adopt the Final Element. The City will broadcast
these meetings on public access television. The City will also mail notices of the public
hearings to nonprofit agencies and community groups, inviting their participation in the
hearing process. Specifically, the City will contact the property owners who have expressed
interests redeveloping or selling their properties for mixed use and residential
developments.

II. HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
Assuring the availability of adequate housing for all social and economic sectors of the
City's present and future population is an important goal of the Housing Element. To
implement this goal, the City must target its programs toward those households with the
greatest need. This section of the Housing Element discusses the characteristics of the City's
present and future population and housing stock, in order to better define the nature and
extent of unmet housing needs in the City.
A. Population Characteristics and Trends
Population characteristics affect the type and amount of housing need in a community.
Issues such as population growth, race/ethnicity, age, and employment trends are factors
that combine to influence the type of housing needed and the ability to afford housing. The
following section describes and analyzes the various population characteristics and trends
that affect housing need.
1. Population Growth
In 2008, the State Department of Finance estimated the Lawndale population at 33,540,
which represented a six-percent increase from the 2000 population of approximately 32,000
(Table 1). Although the population increase since 2000 is significantly less than the increase
during the 1990s, the population growth in Lawndale since 2000 is similar to that of the
surrounding communities, but slightly less than the growth experienced countywide.
The City’s population density has also increased over time from 21.6 persons per acre in
1990 to 26.5 persons per acre in 2008. Lawndale has the highest population density of
surrounding jurisdictions. Hawthorne’s population density is closest (23.2 persons per
acre), followed by Gardena (16.6 persons per acre) and Redondo Beach (16.4 persons per
acre). The County of Los Angeles had a population density of 4.0 persons per acre in 2008.

                                                                                                         7

Due to the small geographic size and limited number of parcels available for development,
future population growth in Lawndale will likely be modest, consisting primarily of infill
development including replacement of older homes with new development. Mixed use
development along Hawthorne Boulevard represents additional opportunities for growth.
2. Age Composition
The age structure of a population is also an important factor in evaluating housing and
community development needs and determining the direction of future housing
development. Typically, each age group has distinct lifestyles, family types and sizes,
incomes, and housing preferences. As people move through each stage of life, housing
needs and preferences change. For example, young householders without children will
have different housing preferences than middle-age householders with children or senior
householders living alone. Consequently, evaluating the age characteristics of a community
is important in determining the housing needs of residents.
In 2000, the median age of Lawndale residents was 29.3 years, which was lower than the
countywide median age of 32 years. Relative to the surrounding communities, the median
age in Lawndale was significantly lower than Gardena and slightly higher than Hawthorne.
The proportion of residents aged 65 or over in Lawndale (5.6 percent) was the lowest among
its neighbors, while the proportion of residents under 18 was the highest among
neighboring jurisdictions (Table 2). These figures indicate that the City of Lawndale has a
family-oriented community with a high proportion of families with children.

The most apparent shift in age distribution from 1990 to 2000 was among residents aged 25
to 34, who accounted for one quarter of all residents in 1990, but less than 20 percent in 2000
(Figure 1). In contrast, the share of residents age 35 to 44 and 45 to 54 increased between
1990 and 2000. This shift in age distribution may be partially attributable to younger
households “aging in place” since 1990, but the significant drop in residents age 25 to 34
may also be the result of younger adults choosing to live in other communities. This trend
may be an indication that home and rental prices are outpacing the affordable price range
for persons in this age group.

3. Race and Ethnicity
Different racial and ethnic groups often have different household characteristics, income
levels, and cultural backgrounds, which may affect their housing needs and preferences.
Studies have also suggested that different racial and ethnic groups differ in their attitudes
toward and/or tolerance for “housing problems” as defined by the federal Department of
Housing and Urban Development (HUD), including overcrowding and housing cost
burden.3                According to these studies, perceptions regarding housing density and
overcrowding tend to vary between racial and ethnic groups. Especially within cultures
that prefer to live with extended family members, household size and overcrowding also
tend to increase. In general, Hispanic and Asian households exhibit a greater propensity
than the White households for living in extended families.
As of 2000, slightly more than half of Lawndale residents were Hispanic, 22 percent were
White, 12 percent were Asian, and 10 percent were Black (Figure 2). This represents a
significant shift from 1990, when 46 percent of residents were White and 34 percent were
Hispanic. This trend of an increasing proportion of Hispanic residents and a decreasing
proportion of White residents is consistent with the trend exhibited countywide. Lawndale
has a higher proportion of Hispanic residents and White residents, and a significantly
smaller proportion of Black residents than the surrounding communities except for
Redondo Beach (Table 3).

B. Employment Profile
An assessment of the needs of the community must take into consideration the type of
employment held by residents. Incomes associated with different jobs and the number of
workers in a household determines the type and size of housing a household can afford. In
some cases, the types of jobs themselves can affect housing needs and demand (such as in
communities with military installations, college campuses, and seasonal agriculture).
Employment growth typically leads to strong housing demand, while the reverse is true
when employment contracts.

1. Occupation and Wage
The Census provides information about employment, specifically the number of City
residents by industry type, who are employed by businesses either outside or within their
community. As of 2000, sales and office occupations employed the largest share of City
residents, accounting for nearly one third of resident employment (Table 4), while service
and management/professional occupations each accounted for slightly more than 20
percent of the total employment. Together, these three sectors accounted for nearly three
quarters of resident employment. Although in aggregate, these three sectors accounted for a
similar proportion of the employment countywide, Lawndale had a higher proportion of
residents employed in sales/office and service occupations, which tended to lower-paying,
and a lower proportion in management/professional occupations, which tended to be
higher-paying.

C. Household Characteristics
The Census defines a household as all persons who occupy a housing unit, which may
include single persons living alone, families related through marriage or blood, and
unrelated individuals living together. Persons living in retirement or convalescent homes,
dormitories, or other group living situations are not considered households. Information on
household characteristics is important to understand the growth and changing needs of a
community.
1. Household Type
Different household types generally have different housing needs. Seniors or young adults
typically comprise the majority of the single-person households and tend to reside in
apartment units, condominiums, or smaller single-family homes. Families often prefer
single-family homes. According to the Census, 9,555 households lived in Lawndale in 2000.
Nearly three-quarters of all households were families and a majority of families had
children (Table 5). Between 1990 and 2000, Lawndale experienced a shift in household

2. Household Size
Household size identifies sources of population growth and household overcrowding. A
community's average household size will increase over time if there is a trend towards
larger families. In a community where the population is aging, the average household size
may decline.
According to the 2000 Census, the average household size in Lawndale (3.3) was
significantly higher than the countywide average household size as well as that of the
surrounding communities ( Figure 3). The State Department of Finance reported that the
average household size in Lawndale has increased slightly since the 2000 Census, with an
average of 3.47 persons per household as of January 1, 2008.

3. Household Income
Household income is an important consideration when evaluating housing and community
development needs because lower income typically constrains a household's ability to
secure adequate housing or services. While housing choices, such as tenure (owning versus
renting) and location of residences are very much income-dependent, household size and
type often affect the proportion of income that can be spent on housing.
According to the 2000 Census, the median household income of Lawndale residents was
approximately $39,000, which was lower than the County median of $42,000 (Table 6).
Approximately 44 percent of households earned less than $35,000, while 14 percent earned
more than $75,000. The largest proportion of households, roughly one fifth, earned between
$50,000 and $75,000. Relative to the County, Lawndale had a much lower proportion of
residents earning more than $75,000.

The State and Federal government classify household income into several groupings based
upon the relationship to the County Area Median Income (AMI), adjusted for household
size. The State of California utilizes the following income groups:
              Extremely Low                               0-30% AMI
              Very Low                                    31-50% AMI
              Low                                         51-80% AMI

              Above Moderate                              120%+ AMI
In 2000, a majority (56 percent) of the Lawndale households earned moderate or above-
moderate incomes (Table 7), while one quarter of households had incomes in the extremely
low and very low levels.4

4. Overcrowding
An overcrowded housing unit is defined as a unit occupied by more than one person per
room.5 Overcrowding can result when there are not enough adequately sized units within a
community, when high housing costs relative to income force too many individuals to share
a housing unit than it can adequately accommodate, and/or when families reside in smaller
units than they need in order to devote income to other necessities, such as food and health
care. Overcrowding also tends to accelerate the normal wear and tear, resulting in
deterioration of housing. Therefore, maintaining a reasonable level of occupancy and
alleviating overcrowding are critical to enhancing quality of life for residents and aesthetic
quality of neighborhoods.
As of 2000, roughly 31 percent of the Lawndale households were living in overcrowded
conditions, with renters being disproportionately affected by overcrowding (23 percent for
renters and 8 percent for owners). This high proportion of overcrowding can be a result of
several factors, including a limited supply of large rental units, high housing costs relative
to household income, and differing perceptions among racial and ethnic groups regarding
overcrowding.
According to the 2000 Census, approximately half of renter-occupied housing units had
three or fewer rooms, in contrast to less than 30 percent of owner-occupied units. This large
proportion of smaller rental units is a contributing factor to overcrowding, particularly for
large renter-households.
Programs listed in the Housing Plan will have the cumulative effect of reducing
overcrowding by reducing cost burden. This will be accomplished by through the provision
of incentives and concessions (Program 9) as well as direct assistance (Program 5) to
developers of affordable housing. The supply of rental and ownership housing, including
the supply of larger-sized housing units will be increased through the development of
vacant sites and redevelopment of underutilized sites (Program 8) and consolidation of
smaller lots zoned for mixed-use and residential development (Program 10).
In the City’s R2 district, two units are permitted on each lot. The City has seen a trend of
property owners adding a second unit to these R2 properties. Some of these additional

units are larger units with three bedrooms. These second units provide moderately priced
housing for families and help relieve overcrowding.
In addition, the City promotes the development of second units as a means of relieving
overcrowding. Residents of Lawndale are also eligible to apply for assistance under the
Residential Rehabilitation Loan Program administered by the Los Angeles County
Community Development Commission. This program includes room additions as a means
to address overcrowding as an eligible activity.
5. Cost Burden
State and federal standards for housing cost burden are based on an income-to-housing cost
ratio of 30 percent and above. Households paying more than 30 percent of their income on
housing have limited remaining income for other necessities. Above moderate income
households generally are capable of paying a larger proportion of income for housing;
therefore, estimates of housing cost burden generally focus on low and moderate income
households.
In 2000, cost burden was equally prevalent among owners and renters in Lawndale, with 41
percent of both incurring a cost burden.
D. Persons with Special Housing Needs
Certain segments of the population may have more difficulty in finding decent, affordable
housing due to their special needs. Special circumstances may be related to one’s
employment and income, family characteristics, disability, and household characteristics,
among other factors. Consequently, certain residents in Lawndale may experience a higher
prevalence of housing cost burden, overcrowding, or other housing problems.
“Special needs” groups in Lawndale include the following: senior households, single-parent
households, large households, persons with disabilities, agricultural workers, and the
homeless (Table 8). This section provides a detailed discussion of the housing needs facing
each particular group as well as programs and services available to address their housing
needs.

1. Elderly Households
Elderly households can have special needs resulting from four main concerns: limited and
often fixed income; poor health and associated high health care costs; mobility limitation
and transit dependency; and high costs of housing.
In 2000, seniors (age 65+) comprised 5.6 percent of Lawndale residents while nearly 11
percent of Lawndale households were headed by seniors. Approximately 60 percent of
elderly households owned homes, while 40 percent were renters.6 Housing cost burden was
the most common housing problem for elderly households, with nearly half of all elderly
renter-households being impacted. Housing cost burden was less common for elderly
owner-households, with approximately one-quarter of households being impacted.
Aside from cost burden issues faced by seniors due to their relatively fixed incomes, many
seniors are faced with various disabilities. Roughly, 45 percent of Lawndale’s senior
population was listed as having one or more disabilities in 2000 by the Census (Table 9).
Among these disabilities, the most common were physical and go-outside-the-home
disabilities.

For elderly residents that require assisted care, there are three residential care facilities in the
City with a total capacity of 18 beds. To help meet the needs of low-income seniors that are
able to live independently, the Lawndale Housing Authority assisted in the development of
the 56-unit South Bay Co-op, subsidized rental housing facility located on 153rd Place. Due
to the long waiting list, prospective clients are primarily referred to other residential
facilities in nearby communities such as Gardena. Section 8 assistance is also available for
senior households. As of December of 2007, the Housing Authority provides rent subsidies
to 197 households; of these, 72 were utilized by seniors.
2. Single-Parent Households
Single-parent households require special consideration and assistance because of their
greater need for day care, health care, and other facilities. Female-headed households with
children in particular tend to have lower incomes, thus limiting housing availability for this
group.
Nearly 23 percent of Lawndale households were headed by single parents in 2000; the large
majority of which were headed by females (82 percent). According to the 2000 Census,
approximately 20 percent of female-headed households with children had incomes below
the poverty level. The City’s Section 8 assistance can benefit female-headed households. As
of December of 2007, 133 female-headed households were receiving Section 8 assistance.
3. Large Households
Large households (with five or more members) are identified as a group with special
housing needs based on the limited availability of adequately sized, affordable housing
units.     Large households are often of lower income, frequently resulting in the
overcrowding of smaller dwelling units and in turn, accelerating unit deterioration.

Nearly one quarter of Lawndale households had five or more members in 2000. Among
large households, 64 percent were renters while only 36 percent owned their units. Large
households can benefit from the City’s Section 8 housing assistance as well as homebuyer
assistance programs offered through the Los Angeles County Community Development
Commission.
4. Persons with Disabilities
Disability is a physical or mental condition that substantially limits one or more major life
activity. Physical disabilities can hinder access to housing units of conventional design, as
well as limit the ability to earn adequate income. The 2000 Census defines six types of
disabilities: sensory, physical, mental, self-care, go-outside-home, and employment. The
Census defines sensory and physical disabilities as “long-lasting conditions.” Mental, self-
care, go-outside-home, and employment disabilities are defined as conditions lasting six
months or more that makes it difficult to perform certain activities. A more detailed
description of each disability is provided below:
       Sensory Disability: Refers to blindness, deafness, or severe vision or hearing
        impairment.
       Physical Disability: Refers to a condition that substantially limits one or more basic
        physical activities, such as walking, climbing stairs, reaching, lifting, or carrying.
       Mental Disability: Refers to a mental condition lasting more than six months that
        impairs learning, remembering, or concentrating.
       Self-Care Disability: Refers to a condition that restricts ability to dress, bathe, or get
        around inside the home.
       Go-Outside-Home: Refers to a condition that restricts ability to go outside the home
        alone to shop or visit a doctor’s office.
       Employment Disability: Refers to a condition that restricts ability to work at a job
        or business.
The Census estimates that 20 percent of Lawndale residents over five years of age had a
disability in 2000 (see Table 9). Employment disabilities were the most frequent, as nearly
70 percent of the persons with a disability reported an employment disability (Table 10).
Proportionally, more children are impacted by mental disabilities, which include
developmental disability; whereas, proportionally, more seniors are impacted by physical
and go-outside-home disabilities.

Several factors limit the supply of housing for persons with disabilities, including
affordability, accessibility, location, and discrimination. The most obvious housing need for
persons with disabilities is housing that is adapted to their needs. Most single-family homes
are inaccessible to people with mobility and sensory limitations. Housing may not be
adaptable to widened doorways and hallways, access ramps, larger bathrooms, lowered
countertops and other features necessary for accessibility. The cost of retrofitting a home
often prohibits homeownership, even for individuals or families who could otherwise afford
a home. Furthermore, some providers of basic home buying services do not have offices or
materials that are accessible to people with mobility, visual or hearing impairments.
Location of housing is also an important factor for many persons with disabilities, as they
often rely upon public transportation.
Various residential facilities in Lawndale serve those with disabilities. A total of 13 adult
residential care facilities with a total capacity of 70 beds are located in Lawndale. Two social
rehabilitation facilities with a combined capacity of 28 beds are operated by the Transitional
Living Centers in Lawndale. In addition, two group homes with a total of 12 beds serve
children with disabilities. The City also offers housing rehabilitation programs that can be
used to make accessibility improvements.

5. Agricultural Workers
Agricultural workers are traditionally defined as persons whose primary incomes are
earned through permanent or seasonal agricultural labor. Permanent farm laborers work in
the fields, processing plants, or support activities on a generally year-round basis. When
workload increases during harvest periods, the labor force is supplemented by seasonal
labor, often supplied by a labor contractor. For some crops, farms may employ migrant
workers, defined as those whose travel distance to work prevents them from returning to
their primary residence every evening.
According to the 2000 Census, no Lawndale residents were employed in farming, forestry,
or fishing occupations. Lawndale is an urbanized community with no parcels zoned for
agricultural use. Because no residents are employed in farming, fishing, and forestry
occupations and there is little potential for this occupational category to expand within the
City, no housing programs or policies are needed to address the needs of farm-workers.
6. Homeless
According to HUD, a person is considered homeless if he/she is not imprisoned and:
              Lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence;
              The primary nighttime residence is a publicly or privately operated shelter designed
               for temporary living arrangements;
              The primary residence is an institution that provides a temporary residence for
               individuals that should otherwise be institutionalized; or
              The primary residence is a public or private place not designed for or ordinarily
               used as a regular sleeping accommodation.
According to the homeless population count conducted by the Los Angeles Homeless
Services Authority (LAHSA), an estimated 58 homeless persons are located in Lawndale.7
No emergency shelters are located within the City of Lawndale. However, the House of
Yahweh, located at 4430 W. 147th Street, offers a variety of programs to the homeless,
including transitional housing. Services include providing food through the soup kitchen,
lunch and grocery program as well as providing clothing vouchers, use of mailboxes and
telephone, and information and referrals to appropriate service agencies.
                                                            
7      The 2007 Homeless Population Count by Census Tract conducted by LAHSA is based on actual street
       counts at specific locations, estimates of street counts at surrounding locations, estimates based on general
       telephone survey, and actual shelter counts. For the four census tracts (6038, 6039, 6040, and 6041) the
       comprise Lawndale, LASHA estimated a homeless count of 58 persons.

E. Housing Stock Characteristics
A community’s housing stock is defined as the collection of all housing units located within
the jurisdiction. The characteristics of the housing stock, including growth, type, age and
condition, tenure, vacancy rates, costs, and affordability are important in determining the
housing needs for the community. This section details the housing stock characteristics of
Lawndale in an attempt to identify how well the current housing stock meets the needs of
current and future residents of the City.
1. Housing Unit Growth and Type
Lawndale has experienced relatively little housing growth since 1990, with the total housing
units increasing by less than one percent between 1990 and 2000, as well as from 2000 to
2008. Much of the City’s housing construction occurred during the 1980s, with housing
growth in Lawndale (13 percent) exceeding that countywide (11 percent). Relative to
surrounding communities, Lawndale experienced limited growth during the past two
decades (Figure 4).

In 2008, single-family homes comprised approximately two thirds of the housing stock,
while multi-family units comprised nearly one third and one percent of the housing stock
consisted of mobile homes (see Table 11). Although the City has a high proportion of
single-family homes relative to other types of housing, most of the City’s residential land is
zoned R-2, which allows development of two detached units per legal lot. The 5,000 square
foot minimum net lot area in the R-2 zone allows up to eight lots per acre with potential to
yield up to 17.4 dwelling units per acre.
The distribution of housing units among the unit types remained the same between 2000
and 2008, as the total number of housing units increased only minimally during this period.
The vacancy rate in Lawndale remained approximately three percent, which is consistent

percent).

2. Housing Age and Condition
Typically, housing over 30 years in age is more likely to have major rehabilitation needs that
may include new plumbing, roof repairs, foundation work and other repairs. According to
the 2008 Department of Finance data, almost 80 percent of housing units in Lawndale were
constructed prior to 1980 (Figure 5) and therefore is of sufficient age to be highly susceptible
to deterioration. The age of the City’s housing stock indicates a potentially significant need
for continued code enforcement, property maintenance and housing rehabilitation
programs to stem housing deterioration.

According to the City staff, an estimated 11 percent (1,096) units in the City require
substantial rehabilitation and 20 units require replacement. The City of Lawndale offers the
Great Neighborhoods Program to provide loans and grants for income-qualified households
to make necessary repairs and improvements.
3. Housing Tenure
The tenure distribution of a community's housing stock (owner versus renter) can be an
indicator of several aspects of the housing market, including the affordability of units,
household stability and residential mobility, among others. In most communities, tenure
distribution generally correlates with household income, composition, and age of the
householder.

distribution generally correlates with household income, composition, and age of the
householder.
In 2000, 32 percent of the housing units in Lawndale were owner-occupied, while 65 percent
were renter-occupied (Table 12). This represented a slight increase in the homeownership
rate from the 30 percent in 1990. A predominance of R-2 lots developed with two dwelling
units may explain the relatively low rate of homeownership in Lawndale. These lots/units
may be occupied by two renter households or one owner and one renter household,
effectively capping the owner-occupancy rate over much of the City’s residentially-zoned
land.

According to Table 13, Owner-households had a slightly higher average household size
than renters, which results from the higher proportion of large households (five or more
members).

4. Housing Vacancy
A certain number of vacant units are needed to moderate the cost of housing, allow
sufficient choice for residents, and provide an incentive for unit upkeep and repair.
Specifically, vacancy rates of two to three percent for ownership housing and five to six
percent for rental housing are generally considered optimal to balance demand and supply
for housing.
The 2000 Census reported the ownership housing vacancy rate at 1.3 percent, while the
rental vacancy rate was 2.5 percent. According to the Department of Finance, the overall
vacancy rate in Lawndale was 3.2 percent in 2008, which is up slightly from the vacancy rate
reported in the 2000 Census (3.1 percent). These low vacancy rates contributed to the
escalation in the costs in recent years, until the recent credit crisis in the subprime mortgage
market led to reductions in home prices.

5. Housing Costs and Affordability
The cost of housing is directly related to the extent of housing problems in a community. If
housing costs are relatively high in comparison to household income, there will be a
correspondingly higher prevalence of housing cost burden and overcrowding. This section
summarizes the cost and affordability of the housing stock to Lawndale residents.
Homeownership Market
According to DataQuick8, the home prices in Lawndale are the lowest among surrounding
communities (Table 14). Furthermore, most communities experienced decreases in home
prices as a response to the “credit crunch” in the real estate market. Compared to one year
ago home prices in Lawndale decreased by more than ten percent. The City offers
homebuyer assistance through the County of Los Angeles Community Development
Commission.

Rental Market
With renters comprising approximately two thirds of the City’s households, it is important
to understand the rental market in Lawndale. According to information published on rental
websites, rental prices range from slightly more than $700 for a studio apartment to more
than $3,000 for a four-bedroom unit (Table 15). The average rent for units in Lawndale was
approximately $1,400.

A large number of single-family homes in Lawndale are used as rentals. Table 16 shows the
average rental rates by unit type. As shown, condominium/townhome units had the
highest rental rates, with an average of nearly $1,700 followed by rental homes and
apartments. Although the rental rates in Lawndale are lower than the surrounding beach
communities, these rental rates are out of the affordability range of most low and moderate
income households (Table 17). Given the large proportion of renters in the City, the high
cost of rental housing is a major concern. The City of Lawndale Housing Authority offers
Section 8 rental housing assistance to very low income households. However, low and
moderate income households do not qualify for this program.

Housing Affordability by Household Income
Housing affordability is dependent upon income and housing costs. Using set income
guidelines, current housing affordability can be estimated. According to the HCD income
guidelines for 2008, the Area Median Income (AMI) in Los Angeles County was $59,800
(adjusted for household size). Assuming that the potential homebuyer has sufficient credit
and downpayment (10 percent) and spends no greater than 30 to 35 percent of their income
on housing expenses (i.e. mortgage, taxes and insurance), the maximum affordable home
price and rental price can be determined. The maximum affordable home and rental prices
for residents of Los Angeles County are shown in Table 17. Households in the lower end of
each category can afford less by comparison than those at the upper end. The income-
affordability of the housing stock for each income group is discussed below:
Based on the home prices and rental rates presented in Table 14, Table 15, and Table 16
earlier, extremely low, very low, and low income households are not able to afford rental
housing or purchase a home in Lawndale without incurring a cost burden. Moderate
income households may be able to afford the rents for some smaller apartments and
purchase small condominiums/townhomes. However, single-family homes are beyond the
financial means of even the moderate income households.

F. Project-Based Rental Housing Assistance
State law requires the City to identify, analyze and propose programs to preserve housing
units that are currently restricted to low-income housing use and that will become
unrestricted and possibly be lost as low-income housing. Specifically, State law requires the
following:
       An inventory of restricted low-income housing projects in the City and their
        potential for conversion;
       An analysis of the costs of preserving and/or replacing the units "at risk" and a
        comparison of these costs;
       An analysis of the organizational and financial resources available for preserving
        and/or replacing the units "at risk"; and
       Programs for preserving the "at risk" units.
1. Inventory of Affordable Housing and At-Risk Status
Currently, the only subsidized rental project in the City is the Lawndale Senior Housing
project, a 56-unit property located at 4702 W. 153rd Place completed by the Lawndale
Housing Authority in 1990. This project was built with Section 202 funds, and carries a 55-
year deed restriction. However, a Section 8 contract is also used on this project to keep the
rents at rates affordable to very low income households. This contract is due to expire on in
December 2010.
2. Costs Analysis
Preservation of the at-risk units can be achieved in two ways: 1) provide additional financial
assistance in lump sum to enhance the self-sufficiency of project; and 1) provide rental
assistance to tenants using funding sources other than Section 8. If a project is owned by a
for-profit agency, then transferring ownership to a nonprofit organization is also potential
option. However, given that the Lawndale Senior Housing is already owned by a nonprofit
organization, this is not an application option to preserve the affordability of the units.
Provision of Additional Financial Assistance
Another option to preserve the affordability of the Lawndale Senior Housing is to provide
additional financial assistance to this project so the project financing can be self-sufficient
even without the Section 8 assistance. Assistance could include writing down the interest
rate on the remaining loan balance.
Rent Subsidy
Tenant-based rent subsidies could be used to preserve the affordability of housing. Similar
to Section 8 vouchers, the City through a variety of potential funding sources could provide
a voucher to very low income households. The level of the subsidy required to preserve the
at-risk affordable housing is estimated to equal the Fair Market Rent for a unit minus the
housing cost affordable by a very low income household. Table 18 shows the rent subsidies

required for the Lawndale Senior Housing project. As shown, subsidizing the project would
require approximately $376,000 annually, an average of $560 per unit per month.

Average subsidy per unit for each project is estimated with the following assumptions:
A 1-Bedroom unit is assumed to be occupied by a 1-person household
Vacancy rate of 5%.
Based on 2008 Area Median Income in Los Angeles County, affordable monthly housing cost for a 1-person very low
income household is $481 (Table 17).
HUD 2008 Fair Market Rent in Los Angeles-Long Beach MSA is $1,041 for a 1-BR
Replacement Housing Cost
The cost of developing new housing depends on a variety of factors such as density, size of
units, location and related land costs, and type of construction. Assuming an average
development cost of $150,000 per unit for multifamily rental housing ($250 per square foot,
assuming an average unit size of 600 square feet for the 56 units), replacement of the 56 at-
risk units would require approximately $8,400,000. This cost estimate includes land,
construction, permits, on- and off-site improvements, and other costs.
Cost Comparison
The cost of constructing new units would cost $8.4 million and providing rent subsidies for
20 years would result in a cost of approximately $7.5 million. Based on these costs,
providing rent subsidies may be a more feasible option to maintain the affordability of the
56 at-risk units. However, a sustainable funding source must be available to preserve the
affordability of these units in the long term.
Resources for Preservation of At-Risk Units
A variety of potential funding sources are available for the acquisition, replacement, or rent
subsidies; however, due to the high costs of developing and preserving at-risk housing
relative to the amount of available local funds, multi-layering of local and non-local sources
may be required. A more thorough description of resources for the preservation of at-risk
units is presented in Section 4, Housing Resources.

G. Estimates of Housing Needs
The Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) developed by the Census for
HUD provides detailed information on housing needs by income level for different types of
households in Lawndale. Detailed CHAS data based on the 2000 Census is displayed in
Table 19. Housing problems considered by CHAS include:
      Units with physical defects (lacking complete kitchen or bathroom);
      Overcrowded conditions (housing units with more than one person per room);
      Housing cost burden, including utilities, exceeding 30 percent of gross income; or
      Severe housing cost burden, including utilities, exceeding 50 percent of gross
       income.
The types of problems vary according to household income, type, and tenure.            Some
highlights include:
      In general, renter-households had a higher level of housing problems (60 percent)
       compared to owner-households (52 percent).
      Large renter- and owner-families had the highest level of housing problems
       regardless of income level (89 percent for large renters and 83 percent for large
       owners).
      Very low income households had the highest incidence of housing problems (95
       percent).
      More than half of all elderly renters suffered from a housing problem, including
       more than 85 percent of very low income elderly renters.

III.HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
Although the City of Lawndale strives to ensure the provision of adequate and affordable
housing to meet the needs of the community, many factors can constrain the development,
maintenance, and improvement of housing.                These include market mechanisms,
government regulations and policies, and infrastructure and environmental constraints.
This section addresses these potential constraints that may affect the supply and cost of
housing in Lawndale.
A. Market Constraints
Locally and regionally there are several constraints that hinder the City’s ability to
accommodate the community’s affordable housing demand. The high cost of land, rising
development costs, and neighborhood opposition make it expensive for developers to build
affordable housing. These constraints may result in housing that is not affordable to low
and moderate income households, or may render residential construction economically
infeasible for developers.
1. Land and Development Costs
High development costs in the region stifle potential affordable housing developments.
Construction costs for residential units have increased rapidly over the last decade,
particularly the land and extensive entitlements costs. Furthermore, neighborhood
resistance to some developments lengthens development time, driving up costs for holding
the property. The difficulty of developing small, infill sites can also constrain housing
development in built out communities such as Lawndale.
Reduction in amenities and the quality of building materials (above a minimum
acceptability for health, safety, and adequate performance) could lower costs and associated
sales prices or rents. In addition, prefabricated factory-built housing may provide for lower
priced housing by reducing construction and labor costs. Another factor related to
construction costs is the number of units built at one time. As the number of units increases,
overall costs generally decrease due to economies of scale.
The price of raw land and any necessary improvements is a key component of the total cost
of housing. The diminishing supply of land available for residential construction combined
with a fairly steady demand for housing has served to keep the cost of land high. High and
rapidly increasing land costs have resulted in home builders developing increasingly
expensive homes in order to capture profits. According to the MLS database, no residential
land is currently for sale in Lawndale. However, a review of land costs in the surrounding
communities revealed multifamily land costs ranging from $52 per square foot in the
Gardena and Inglewood areas to more than $100 per square foot in the nearby beach
communities. No single-family residential land was listed for sale in any neighboring
community.

                                                                         December 2010
 

A density bonus up to 35 percent over the otherwise maximum allowable residential density
under the applicable zoning district is available to developers who provide affordable
housing as part of their projects. Developers of affordable housing are also entitled to at
least one regulatory concession or development incentive. Density bonuses, together with
the incentives and/or concessions, result in a lower average cost of land per dwelling unit
thereby making the provision of affordable housing more feasible.
2. Availability of Mortgage Financing
Under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), lending institutions are required to
disclose information on the disposition of loan applications and the income, gender, and
race of loan applicants. The data for Lawndale were complied by census tract and
aggregated to the area that generally approximates the City boundaries.
Conventional Lending
Overall, 899 households applied for mortgage loans for homes in Lawndale in 2006 (Table
20).    Of  the  applications  for  conventional  mortgage  loans,  49  percent  were  originated 
(approved  by  the  lenders  and  accepted  by  the  applicants).    The  overall  denial  rate  was  28 
percent, while 10 percent of the applications were withdrawn or closed for incompleteness, 
and  11  percent  received  approval,  but  the  loan  was  not  accepted  by  the  applicant.    This 
origination  rate  was  much  lower  than  a  few  years  ago  when  about  70  percent  of  the  loan 
applications  were  approved  countywide.    Home  improvement  financing  was  even  less 
accessible.    More  than  one  third  of  the  applications  for  home  improvement  loans  were 
denied and only 42 percent were originated.  The City offers first‐time homebuyer assistance

Foreclosures
Between 2000 and 2005, with low interest rates, “creative” financing (e.g., zero down,
interest only, adjustable loans), and predatory lending practices (e.g. aggressive marketing,
hidden fees, negative amortization), many households purchased homes that were beyond
their financial means. Under the false assumptions that refinancing to lower interest rates
would always be an option and home prices would continue to rise at double-digit rates,
many households were (and still are) unprepared for the hikes in interest rates, expiration of
short-term fixed rates, and decline in sales prices that set off in 2006. Suddenly faced with
significantly inflated mortgage payments, and mortgage loans that are larger than the worth
of the homes, many had to resort to foreclosing their homes.
In Los Angeles County, 13,583 homeowners filed Notices of Default (NODs) in the third
quarter of 2007, compared to 5,565 NODs filed during the same period in the previous year
(for a 144-percent increase).9 With implosion of the mortgage lending market, many
households have difficulty obtaining new mortgage loans or refinancing, even for above
moderate income households.
In January 2008, 100 homes in Lawndale were listed as foreclosures for sale.10 These homes
are listed at various stages of foreclosure (from pre-foreclosures to auctions) and range in
price from $270,000 to $750,000. The high prices of these homes facing foreclosure indicate
that the impact of foreclosure extends not only to lower and moderate income households,
but also households with higher incomes.
B. Governmental Constraints
Policies of the City can have an impact on the price and availability of housing in Lawndale.
Land use controls, site improvement requirements, building codes, fees, and other local
programs to improve the overall quality of housing may serve constraints to housing
development. The following public policies can affect overall housing availability,
adequacy, and affordability.
1. Land Use Controls
General Plan and Zoning
The Lawndale General Plan and Zoning Ordinance provide for a range of residential land
use designations/zones in the City:
              Single-Family Low Density (R-1): 0 - 8.8 dwelling units/acre; single-family
               dwelling units; minimum 5,000 square feet lot.
              Single-Family Medium Density (R-2): 8.9 - 17.4 dwelling units/acre; single-
               family/duplex /double units; allows two units on minimum 5,000 square feet lot,
               with an additional unit for each 3,000 square feet in excess of 5,000 square feet.

                                                                                                          35
                                                                                            December 2010
 

       Multiple-Family Low Density Residential (R-2): 8.9 - 17.4 dwelling units/acre;
        townhouse/apartments; allows two units on minimum 5,000 square feet lot, with an
        additional unit for each 3,000 square feet in excess of 5,000 square feet.
       Multiple-Family Medium Density (R-3, R-4): 17.6 - 33 dwelling units/acre;
        minimum 5,000 square feet lot.
       Residential Planned Development (RPD): 0 – 37 dwelling units/acre; where a
        proposed development offers amenities and benefits to the community substantially
        in excess of those normally provided; subject to Planning Commission approval.
In addition to these density provisions, the City complies with the State density bonus law
for housing projects that provide a portion of the units to lower income households.
Housing Element Law specifies that jurisdictions must identify adequate sites to be made
available through appropriate zoning and development standards to encourage the
development of various types of housing for all segments of the population, including
multi-family residential housing, factory built housing, mobile homes, emergency shelters,
and transitional housing.
The City closely monitors the implementation of its General Plan and Zoning Ordinance.
When constraints are identified, staff works to address those constraints. In 2007, the City
identified some inconsistencies between the General Plan Land Use Map and Zoning
Ordinance that had occurred due to a non-parcel-specific land use map created in 1992.
These inconsistencies had prevented residential development to occur on some properties
along Hawthorne Boulevard. A General Plan Amendment was processed to re-designate
these properties from General Commercial to Multi-Family Medium Density.
Specific Plan
The Hawthorne Boulevard Specific Plan permits mixed-use development within the specific
plan area pursuant to approval of a Special Use Permit (SUP). The property frontage along
an arterial street (Hawthorne, Manhattan Beach, or Marine) must be developed with
commercial uses on the ground floor. Residential uses are subject to residential density and
development standards consistent with the R4 zone. However, the Planning Commission
and City Council may approve shared parking between the guest parking for the residential
use and parking spaces for the commercial use. To encourage and facilitate residential
development, the City will amend the Specific Plan to waive the ground floor commercial
requirement for projects with at least 50 percent of proposed units affordable to lower
income households (Program 10).
2. Residential Development Standards
The City’s Zoning Ordinance contains development standards for each zoning           district
consistent with the land use designations of the General Plan. The Lawndale          Zoning
Ordinance establishes residential development standards for each zone to ensure      quality
development in the community. Development criteria, as specified in the              Zoning
          2008-2014 HOUSING ELEMENT | CITY OF LAWNDALE
   36
          December 2010
 

Ordinance, are presented in Table 21. These development standards are typical and
consistent with standards established in surrounding communities.
All residential uses are required to provide the number of parking spaces as specified in Table
22, with the exception of secondary dwelling units, which require one additional uncovered
parking space. Developers of affordable and senior housing who are eligible for a density bonus
pursuant to Government Code Section 65919-65918 are eligible to use parking standards
established by State law. However, the City’s Zoning Ordinance includes provisions for reduced
parking standards that are more lenient than the State Density Bonus law. Unlike the State
Density Bonus law, which provides reduced parking only for a 100-percent senior housing
development with 35 or more units, the City’s Zoning Ordinance (Section 17.72.130) provides up
to 20 percent reduction in parking requirements if a project contains 20 percent of the units set
aside for seniors. As part of the City’s effort to promote mixed use development in the
Hawthorne Specific Plan area, the Planning Commission or the City Council may approve
tandem parking, off-site parking, and/or shared parking between the guest parking for the
residential use and parking spaces for the commercial use.
Given the densely developed nature of the City, the intended urbanized character of mixed use
development, surface parking is rarely desirable from the land use efficiency and aesthetic
standpoints. In general and throughout the urbanized communities in Southern California,
mixed use and high density development typically provide parking in enclosed space either at or
below grade. While enclosed/garage parking add to the cost of development, based on the
development applications and proposals submitted by developers, this requirement has not
constrained the ability of achieving the maximum density permitted. Other mechanism and
incentives are available (reduced parking, tandem parking, or shared parking) to offset the cost.
The City monitors closely its development standards and their impact on development.
Periodically, the City made amendments to its Zoning Ordinance to ensure development
standards respond to market trends. The residential development standards were amended in
2006 and in the case of open space the standards were made more onerous. Staff recognized this
as a problem and revised the open space standards in 2008 to help remove the constraints that
were created. Specifically, smaller units are now required to have a smaller private open space
requirement.

Conclusions: The cumulative effect of the City’s residential development standards do not
constrain the expansion of housing opportunities within Lawndale as variances to exceed
these limits are rarely requested and developers are able to achieve the maximum
residential density on residentially-zoned lots. Density standards of the Zoning Ordinance
are consistent with the densities established for General Plan land use categories. The
setback requirements of residential zones relate well to the densities permitted. Minimum
lot size requirements are reasonably small and reduce the number of potentially non-
conforming lots that could occur with larger minimum lot size requirements, especially
within the R-2, R-3, and R-4 zones. Few properties are zoned RPD in the City; little or no
future residential development is expected to occur in the RPD zone.

Finally, the City’s density bonus provisions of the Zoning Ordinance, which are consistent
with State law, provide various incentives, concessions, and potential waivers of
development standards, including parking standards as necessary to ensure that the City’s
development standards do not constrain the development of affordable housing.
Additional incentives are available to senior housing.
The City recognizes that a prevalence of smaller sized lots within the Hawthorne Specific Plan
area may impede mixed use and high density residential development. To address this
constraint, the Housing Element includes reduced and shared parking incentives to promote lot
consolidation (Program 10). Larger lots and reduced parking requirements are intended to
encourage redevelopment and reduce the cost of housing in Lawndale.
3. Mixed-Use Residential Development Standards
Within the Hawthorne Boulevard Specific Plan area, where the majority of residential
growth is expected to occur, the City has established different height limits to facilitate
mixed use development. A height limit of 50 feet is established for the GC zone and a
height limit of 70 feet is established for the OC zone. Mixed use development can therefore
achieve a significantly higher height limit in the Hawthorne Boulevard Specific Plan area.
In 2006, the City adopted a resolution to amend the Hawthorne Boulevard Specific Plan
development standards to eliminate the use of Floor Area Ratios (FARs). The FAR was
found to be constraining development in that when applied with other development
standards, the buildable area would be reduced. Therefore, the City amended the
development standards for the Specific Plan to eliminate this inconsistency in order to
facilitate development. Table 23 shows the development standards in the Specific Plan area.

Multi-Family Housing
As of January 2008, multi-family housing units constituted approximately 33 percent of
Lawndale’s housing stock. The Zoning Ordinance provides for multi-family developments
in the R-2, R-3, R-4 and RPD zones. Apartments and condominiums require approval of a
Special Use Permit (SUP) in all zones. To ensure the SUP requirement does not constrain
the production of multi-family housing, the City will undertake a comprehensive review of
permit processing procedures to identify and implement ways to streamline development.
The maximum density for the R-3 and R-4 zones is 33 units per acre. All projects within the
RPD zone require approval of an SUP and the Planning Commission may approve projects
with densities up to 33 units per acre. Therefore, the allowable densities in Lawndale are
sufficient to allow for the development of affordable housing.
Manufactured Housing/Mobile Homes
Manufactured housing and mobile homes offer an affordable housing option to many low
and moderate income households. According to the California Department of Finance,
there are 128 mobile homes in the City. The City allows manufactured housing placed on a
permanent foundation by right in all residential zones.
Second Dwelling Units
Second dwelling units are attached or detached dwelling units that provide complete
independent living facilities for one or more persons including permanent provisions for
living, sleeping, cooking and sanitation. Second units may be an alternative source of
affordable housing for lower-income households and seniors.

California law requires local jurisdictions to adopt ordinances that establish the conditions
under which second dwelling units are permitted (Government Code, Section 65852.2). A
jurisdiction cannot adopt an ordinance that precludes the development of second units
unless findings are made acknowledging that allowing second units may limit housing
opportunities of the region and result in adverse impacts on public health, safety, and
welfare. An amendment to the State’s second unit law in September 2002 requires local
governments to use a ministerial, rather than discretionary process for approving second
units (i.e. second units otherwise compliant with local zoning standards can be approved
without a public hearing).
Second dwelling units are permitted by right in all residential zones in Lawndale, subject to
the following conditions:
        An attached second residential dwelling unit shall contain not less than 400 square
         feet of enclosed floor area nor shall it be larger than 30 percent of the existing single-
         family dwelling unit that is to be attached to.
        A detached second residential dwelling unit shall be located at least 20 feet from the
         closest habitable structure. It shall contain not less than 400 square feet of enclosed
         floor area nor shall it contain more than 1,200 square feet of enclosed floor area.
The majority of the City is zoned R-2, which allows at least two units on a lot without the
need to complete a discretionary subdivision process. This flexibility has resulted in the
development of larger, more marketable and attractive units than what could be built under
the second unit ordinance. Furthermore, few R-1 lots are large enough to accommodate
secondary dwelling units. As such, second units are not a popular housing option for
Lawndale property owners.
Residential Care Facilities
Residential care facilities can be described as any family home, group care facility or similar
facility, including transitional housing, for 24-hour non-medical care of persons in need of
personal services, supervision, or assistance essential for sustaining the activities of daily living.
In accordance with State law, Lawndale allows residential care facilities serving six or fewer
persons within all residential zones. Residential care facilities serving more than six persons
are not permitted in residential zones, but are allowed in the Light Manufacturing (M-1) zone.
Transitional Housing
Transitional housing is a type of supportive housing used to facilitate the movement of
homeless individuals and families to permanent housing. Transitional housing can take
several physical forms, including group quarters with beds, single-family homes, and multi-
family apartments and typically offers case management and support services to return
people to independent living (usually between 6 and 24 months). The Transitional Living
Centers operate two facilities in Lawndale.
Currently, the Lawndale Zoning Ordinance does not explicitly address transitional housing
facilities. The City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to differentiate between transitional
housing that is configured as group quarters/institutional use and transitional housing that

                                                                            December 2010
 

is configured as a regular housing development. For transitional housing that has a group
quarter/institutional use arrangement, such housing will be regulated as a residential
community care facility. For transitional housing that is configured as regular housing,
such housing is permitted as other housing is otherwise permitted.
Supportive Housing
According to the National Housing Institute, supportive housing is permanent housing with
a service component, which can be provided either on-site or off-site. Similar to transitional
housing, supportive housing can take several physical forms, including group quarters with
beds, single-family homes, and multi-family apartments The Lawndale Zoning Ordinance
does not currently address supportive housing facilities. The City will amend the Zoning
Ordinance to differentiate between supportive housing that is configured as group
quarters/institutional use and supportive housing that is configured as a regular housing
development.        For supportive housing that has a group quarter/institutional use
arrangement, such housing will be regulated as a residential community care facility. For
transitional housing that is configured as regular housing, such housing is permitted as
other housing is otherwise permitted.
Emergency Shelters
An emergency shelter is a facility that provides shelter to homeless families and/or homeless
individuals on a limited short-term basis. No emergency shelters are currently located within
Lawndale, and the zoning regulations do not address emergency shelters. The Zoning
Ordinance will be revised to permit emergency shelters with a ministerial permit in the Light
Manufacturing (M-1) zone, and in the Commercial Manufacturing Zone (C-M) via a Special
Use Permit, consistent with SB 2 that was enacted in 2007. These properties can either be
redeveloped or adapted to accommodate emergency shelters. Specifically, the M-1 and C-M
properties are located primarily in the northwest quadrant of the City, near other commercial
and office uses and along major transportation corridors. Such locations are ideal for housing
persons who would require access to social and supportive services.
Together, the M-1 and C-M zones cover approximately 13 acres in Lawndale. Many of these
parcels are developed with older, low intensity, and outdated uses. Therefore, adequate
capacity exists to accommodate an emergency shelter for at least 58 homeless individuals
(identified unsheltered homeless population in Lawndale) and at least one year-round
emergency shelter.
 
Single-Room Occupancy
With high housing costs, many communities in California are exploring the use of SRO to
fulfill the affordable housing needs of certain segments of the community, such as seniors,
students, and single workers. The Lawndale Zoning Ordinance does not currently address
Single-Room Occupancy (SRO) units. The City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to permit
SROs in commercial zones via a Special Use Permit. Conditions for approval will relate to
the performance of the facility, such as parking, security, and management.

Farmworker Housing
As an urbanized community, there is no land within Lawndale designated for agricultural
use. The U.S. Census identified only no persons employed in farm, fishing, or forestry
occupations. Therefore, the City has no specific need for farmworker housing.
5. Housing for Persons with Disabilities
Both the federal Fair Housing Amendment Act (FHAA) and the California Fair Employment
and Housing Act direct local governments to make reasonable accommodations (i.e.
modifications or exceptions) in their zoning laws and other land use regulations when such
accommodations may be necessary to afford disabled persons an equal opportunity to use
and enjoy a dwelling.
As part of this Housing Element update, the City conducted an analysis of the zoning
ordinance, permitting procedures, development standards, and building codes to identify
potential constraints for housing for persons with disabilities. The City’s policies and
regulations regarding housing for persons with disabilities are described below.
Zoning and Land Use
Restrictive land use policies and zoning provisions can constrain the development of
housing for persons with disabilities.
Definition of Family: Local governments may restrict access to housing for households
failing to qualify as a “family” by the definition specified in the Zoning Ordinance.
Specifically, a restrictive definition of “family” that limits the number of and differentiates
between related and unrelated individuals living together may illegally limit the
development and siting of group homes for persons with disabilities but not for housing
families that are similarly sized or situated.11 The City of Lawndale Zoning Ordinance does
not contain a definition of family.
Residential Care Facilities: Under State Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act
(aka Lanterman Act), small licensed residential care facilities for six or fewer persons must
be treated as regular residential uses and permitted by right in all residential districts;
Lawndale is compliant with the Lanterman Act. The Land Use Element and Zoning
Ordinance provide for the development of multi-family housing in the R-2, R-3, and R-4
zones. Regular multi-family housing for persons with special needs, such as apartments for
seniors and the disabled, are considered regular residential uses permitted by right in these
zones. The City’s land use policies and zoning provisions do not constrain the development
of such housing. State licensed residential care facilities for more than six persons are
permitted in the Light Manufacturing (M-1) zone. No minimum distance requirement has
been adopted by the City for residential care facilities.
                                                            
11     California court cases (City of Santa Barbara v. Adamson, 1980 and City of Chula Vista v. Pagard, 1981, etc.)
       have ruled an ordinance as invalid if it defines a “family” as (a) an individual; (b) two or more persons
       related by blood, marriage, or adoption; or (c) a group of not more than a specific number of unrelated
       persons as a single housekeeping unit. These cases have explained that defining a family in a manner that
       distinguishes between blood-related and non-blood related individuals does not serve any legitimate or
       useful objective or purpose recognized under the zoning and land use planning powers of a municipality,
       and therefore violates rights of privacy under the California Constitution.
                                                             CITY OF LAWNDALE| 2008-2014 HOUSING ELEMENT
                                                                                                             43
                                                                                            December 2010
 

Parking Standards: No specific parking standards apply to residential care facilities.
Convalescent facilities and rest homes require one space for every three patient beds, plus
one space for every two employees working the largest shift. These standards are
reasonable for most residential uses and facilities that serve persons with disabilities. In
addition, the City offers a reduction of up to 20 percent in the parking requirements for a
housing development that sets aside 20 percent of the units for seniors. The City will
consider extending this incentive for housing that set aside units for persons with
disabilities.
Reasonable Accommodation: Otherwise regular development standards under unique
circumstances may be found constraining to the development or improvement of housing
for persons with disabilities. Therefore, it may be reasonable to accommodate requests from
persons with disabilities to waive a specific requirement or standard of the zoning
ordinance to ensure that homes are accessible for the mobility impaired. For example, a
setback and encroachment standard may need to be relaxed in order to accommodate the
construction of a ramp. Whether a particular modification is reasonable depends on the
circumstances, and must be decided on a case-by-case basis.
The City amended its Zoning Ordinance in 2002 to establish the process for requesting and
grant reasonable accommodations in the application of the Zoning regulations for persons
with disabilities. Requests for reasonable accommodation filed in accordance with the
procedure set forth in Chapter 17.26 of the Lawndale Municipal Code are reviewed and
decided by the Community Development Director unless the applicant seeks a permit or
approval that is reviewed by the Planning Commission.
The Director must review the request within five days of receipt to determine whether the
application is complete. If the application is determined to be incomplete, the Director
promptly gives the applicant written notice of the additional information necessary to
complete the application. Once determined complete, the Director must render a decision
either approving or denying the request within 30 days of receipt of an application. The
decision is based on the following criteria: :
       The accommodation is reasonable considering the nature of the applicant’s
        disability, the surrounding land uses, and the rule, standard, policy, or practice from
        which relief is sought.
       The accommodation is necessary to afford the applicant equal opportunity to enjoy
        and use a dwelling.
       The accommodation will have only incidental economic or monetary benefits to the
        applicant, and the primary purpose of the accommodation is not to assist with real
        estate speculation or excess profit taking.
       The accommodation does not create a substantial adverse impact on surrounding
        land uses, or a public nuisance, that cannot be reasonably mitigated.
           2008-2014 HOUSING ELEMENT | CITY OF LAWNDALE
   44
           December 2010
 

       The accommodation is reasonably feasible considering the physical attributes of the
        property and structures.
       There are no alternative accommodations which may provide an equivalent level of
        benefit to the applicant, while minimizing adverse impacts on surrounding land uses
        and lessening the financial and/or administrative burden on the City.
       In the case of a determination involving a one-family dwelling, whether the
        household would be considered a single housekeeping unit if it were not using
        special services that are required because of the disabilities of the residents.
       The requested accommodation does not impose an undue financial or administrative
        burden on the City.
       The requested accommodation does not require a fundamental alteration in the
        nature of a program.
Within the time provided for approving or denying the application, the Director provides
the applicant with a written notice of the decision. Notice of the Director’s decision is also
given to interested parties and any person may request a Director’s hearing within ten days
of the date the notice is mailed. If no request for hearing is received, the decision becomes
final.
Building Codes: The City enforces Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations that
regulates the access and adaptability of buildings to accommodate persons with disabilities.
Furthermore, Government Code Section 12955.1 requires that 10 percent of the total
dwelling units in multi-family buildings without elevators consisting of three or more rental
units or four or more condominium units are subject to the following building standards for
persons with disabilities:
       The primary entry to the dwelling unit shall be on an accessible route unless
        exempted by site impracticality test.
       At least one powder room or bathroom shall be located on the primary entry level
        served by an accessible route.
       All rooms or spaces located on the primary entry level shall be served by an
        accessible route. Rooms and spaces located on the primary entry level and subject to
        this chapter may include but are not limited to kitchens, powder rooms, bathrooms,
        living rooms, bedrooms, or hallways.
       Common use areas shall be accessible.
       If common tenant parking is provided, accessible parking is required.

Compliance with provisions of the Code of Regulations, California Building Standards
Code, and federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is assessed and enforced by the
Building and Safety Division of the Community Development Department as a part of the
building permit submittal.
Conclusion: The City has not adopted unique restrictions that would constrain the
development of housing for persons with disabilities. The State has removed any City
discretion for review of small group homes for persons with disabilities (six or fewer
residents). The City does not impose additional zoning, building code, or permitting
procedures other than those allowed by State law. There are no City initiated constraints on
housing for persons with disabilities caused or controlled by the City. The City also allows
residential retrofitting to increase the suitability of homes for persons with disabilities in
compliance with accessibility requirements. Such retrofitting is permitted under State law.
Further, the City works with applicants who need special accommodations in their homes to
ensure that application of building code requirements does not create a constraint. Finally,
the City’s formal ministerial process for review and approval of reasonable accommodation
requests is codified in the Lawndale Municipal Code.
6. Planning and Development Fees
Developers are subject to a variety of fees and exactions to cover the cost of processing permits
and providing necessary services and facilities. In general, these fees can be a constraint on
housing development and compromise market-rate affordability because the additional cost
borne by developers contributes to overall increased housing unit cost. However, the fees are
necessary to maintain adequate planning services and other public services and facilities in the
City. The City’s fee schedule for a typical residential project is displayed in Table 25. In
comparison to surrounding jurisdictions, the City’s planning fees are moderate (see Table 27).
Development impact fees are established for mitigating various development impacts based on
the specific existing conditions of and projected needs for infrastructure and public facilities.
Therefore, comparing the levels of impact fees across communities does not recognize the
unique circumstances for establishing these fees. Furthermore, impact fees are subject to the
requirements of State law for ensuring reasonableness and proportionate share of responsibility.
The key development impact fees charged by the City include: water, sewer, public facilities,
and school fees. Overall fees charged by the City are limited and do not constrain housing
development. While multi-family housing has a higher per-unit development impact fees, the
difference is approximately $3,000 per unit. Other incentives available for multi-family housing
such as higher base densities and density bonus will offset the costs to some extent.

7. On- and Off-Site Improvements
Requirements for on- and off-site improvements vary depending on the presence of existing
improvements, as well as the size and nature of the proposed development. Given the built
out character of Lawndale, most residential areas are already served with infrastructure.
The City has established specific standards for improvements and facilities to serve new
development, including: concrete curbs, gutters, asphalt concrete street pavement,
sidewalks and streetlights. The City adopted the American Public Works Association
Standards.
The City of Lawndale’s fee structure includes some on- and off-site improvements, which
are described in the section above. Off-site improvement fees include drainage and sewer
facility fees, school fees, park land fees, and public facility fees, among others. While these
fees add to the cost of housing development, these fees are established to cover the costs of
infrastructure, facilities, and improvements necessary to serve the development.

8. Development Permit Procedures
Development review and permit procedures are necessary steps to ensure that residential
construction proceeds in an orderly manner. The following discussion outlines the level of
review required for various permits and timelines associated with those reviews. The
timelines provided are estimates; actual processing time may vary due to the volume of
applications and the size and complexity of the projects.
Discretionary Applications
The time frame for discretionary approvals varies by the type of approval and the size and
complexity of the project. Discretionary applications discussed in greater detail below
include General Plan Amendments and/or Zoning Changes, Special Use Permit, and
Residential Planned Developments (RPDs).
              General Plan Amendment and/or Zone Change: A proposed housing project may
               include a general plan amendment and/or rezone. This type of approval is
               discretionary, requiring approval by the City Council. Approval of a rezone or
               general plan amendment would depend on the applicant’s ability to show that the
               proposal would further and not detract from the City’s established land use goals.
               General Plan Amendments and Zone Code Amendments are generally processed
               concurrently with required project entitlements to save time.
              Special Use Permit (SUP): The City requires a Special Use Permit (SUP) for multi-
               family projects with three or more units in R-3 and R-4 zone districts. The timeframe
               for most SUPs is approximately 45 to 60 days from formal submittal until the
               Planning Commission hearing date. Approval of a SUP requires the Commission to
               make the following findings:
                
               o      Granting of such special use permit will not be detrimental to the public health
                      or welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in such zone or
                      vicinity;12
               o      The use applied for at the location indicated is properly one for which a special
                      use permit is authorized;
               o      The site for the proposed use is adequate in size and shape to accommodate said
                      use, and all yard, spaces, walls, fences, parking, loading, landscaping, and other
                      features required to adjust said use with the land and uses in the neighborhood;
                                                            
12     Typically, the evaluation begins with an analysis of consistency with the City’s General Plan and Municipal
       Code. These documents provide the foundational standards for use, design, and development. Therefore, a
       project that complies with the General Plan and the Municipal Code will likely not present any hazard.
       However, larger residential developments can present greater challenges, and therefore, the review process
       allows the City to take a closer examination and to conclude with certainty that a project will not be
       detrimental to the City. This further analysis is based on site layout and orientation, intensity, circulation
       (such as ingress/egress), and how the project interfaces with adjacent properties, etc.
                                                             CITY OF LAWNDALE| 2008-2014 HOUSING ELEMENT
                                                                                                               49
                                                                                            December 2010
 

        o    The site abuts streets and highways adequate in width and pavement type to
             carry the kind of traffic generated by the proposed use; and
        o    Granting of such special use permit is consistent with the City's General Plan.
 
        These general findings are objective and typical and apply to all uses requiring an
        SUP. No special findings are required for any specific land use. The SUP
        requirement does not result in additional time in the review process as this occurs
        concurrently with Design Review conducted by the Planning Commission, and both
        can be completed within the 60-day period. The City has not denied a SUP for a
        proposed multi-family residential development and processing the permit does not
        substantially lengthen the approval process; therefore, the SUP requirement is not a
        constraint.
       Residential Planed Development (RPD): The RPD offers flexibility in the site
        planning and design process by allowing developers to propose projects that may
        not otherwise conform to the development standards of any single zoning district.
        Once an application All development proposals within the RPD district require
        approval of a SUP by the Planning Commission. Although the typical maximum
        density within the RPD zone is 33 units per acre, the Planning Commission may
        grant a maximum density of up to 37 units per acre. However, few properties in the
        City are zoned RPD. Note that the RPD Zone is an overlay zone that may be applied
        to any residential zone in the City. This process is rarely used as most multi-family
        residential development now occurs within the Hawthorne Boulevard Specific Plan
        area.
 
        As with any application for development, the City starts start with a pre-submittal
        meeting to gain an understanding of on which development standards the developer
        is looking for flexibility. An important factor in the negotiation is that the proposed
        project offers a benefit to the community in excess of what would normally be
        provided and therefore concession on a development standard is justified, keeping
        in mind the impacts of relaxing a development standard (e.g., can the street system
        handle the increased density). Once staff is satisfied that a mutually beneficial
        arrangement has been met, staff makes a recommendation to the Planning
        Commission, which has the ultimate authority to approve or deny any development
        standard concessions.
Ministerial Applications
Formal plan checks for residential projects are required for all new units, all second story
additions, single-story additions over 500 square feet. When the City accepts applications
for formal plan check, three entities perform separate plan checks: Building and Safety
(under contract to Los Angeles County staff); Lawndale Planning Department; and
Lawndale Public Works Department. Applicants for projects must address all corrections
before permits can be issued. The time frame for formal plan checks is usually a minimum
of three weeks, but can be longer depending on how much time the applicant takes to make
any required corrections/changes to the plan. To start the plan check process, the applicant
           2008-2014 HOUSING ELEMENT | CITY OF LAWNDALE
   50
           December 2010
 

submits four sets of plans and pays the plan check fee. The structural and mechanical plan
checks are performed by staff on contract from Los Angeles County, which takes two to
three weeks for the first check and corrections which are provided to the applicant. When
the applicant resubmits, the recheck takes approximately one week, sometimes longer
depending on the amount of projects that are currently in plan check. If all corrections have
been addressed and all applicable fees paid, the project is ready for permit issuance.
Therefore, the time frame largely depends on the applicant's timeliness in making
corrections, and payment of fees. Applications for minor additions can be reviewed and
approved over-the-counter.
Design Review Criteria
The design review procedure is applied according to the following design criteria:
       The building height, bulk and other design features shall be proportionate to the site
        and the surrounding area.
       The site layout, orientation, and location of structures, and their relationship to one
        another and to open spaces, parking areas, pedestrian walks, illumination and
        landscaping should be interrelated and arranged to achieve a safe, efficient and
        harmonious development.
       The grading and development of sites should respect the qualities of the natural
        terrain and landscape—mature trees and other natural features.
       Building sites should be developed to achieve a harmonious relationship with
        existing and proposed adjoining developments.
       Each building shall reflect due consideration of a total site design program that
        reflects quality contemporary design practices.
       The proposed project shall substantially comply with the design elements set forth in
        the City’s adopted design guidelines.
       The mechanical equipment or machinery, trash storage areas and other exterior
        service areas shall be screened from view from all public spaces.

9. Building Codes and Enforcement
The City of Lawndale adopts by reference the County of Los Angeles Building, Electrical,
Mechanical, Plumbing, and Fire Codes. These codes are considered to be the minimum
necessary to protect the public’s health, safety and welfare. The codes are determined by
the International Conference of Building Officials and the State of California. Substandard
housing conditions within the City’s existing housing stock are abated primarily through
code compliance. Identification of code violations is based on resident complaints.
Property owners are advised by the City of available rehabilitation programs to assist in the
correction of code violations.
C. Public Policy Constraints
State and federal requirements may act as a barrier to the development or rehabilitation of
housing, and affordable housing in particular. These include State prevailing wage
requirements and environmental review requirements.
1. State Prevailing Wage Requirements
The State Department of Industrial Relations (DIR) has recently greatly expanded the kinds
of projects that require the payment of prevailing wages. Labor Code Section 1720, which
applies prevailing wage rates to public works of over $1,000, now defines public works to
mean construction, alteration, installation, demolition, or repair work done under contract
and paid for in whole or in part out of public funds. For example, public transfer of an asset
for less than fair market value, such as a land write-down, would now be construed to be
paid for in part out of public funds and trigger prevailing wage requirements.
While the cost differential in prevailing and standard wages varies based on the skill level of
the occupation, prevailing wages tend to add to the overall cost of development. In the case
of affordable housing projects, prevailing wage requirements could effectively reduce the
number of affordable units that can be achieved with public subsidies. The following types
of projects are not however required to pay prevailing wages:
       Residential projects financed through issuance of bonds that receive an allocation
        through the State; or
       Single-family projects financed through issuance of qualified mortgage revenue
        bonds or mortgage credit certificates.
2. Environmental Protection
State and federal regulations require environmental review of proposed discretionary
projects (e.g., subdivision maps, development review permits, etc.). Costs resulting from the
environmental review process are also added to the cost of housing and are passed on to the
consumer. These costs include the preparation of environmental analyses, and from delays
caused by the mandated public review periods. However, the presence of these regulations
helps preserve the environment and ensure environmental safety to Lawndale residents.

          December 2010
 

Furthermore, recent State laws have established exemptions from CEQA for infill and
affordable housing projects.
D. Infrastructure and Public Service Constraints
Another factor adding to the cost of new home construction is the cost of providing
adequate infrastructure such as streets, curbs, gutter, sidewalks, water and sewer lines, and
street lighting. The cost of these additions or improvements is borne by developers and
then, to the extent possible, added to the cost of new housing units, impacting affordability.
There are several constraints related to the City's infrastructure that can hinder the
emergency response to a fire: water supply and distribution; sewer collection and treatment
capacity inadequate fire flows; narrow streets; limited access to some large structures;. Each
of these constraints is briefly described below.
Lawndale was initially developed as a single-family residential suburb of Los Angeles. At
that time, four-inch mains were adequate to meet water fire flow requirements. Over time,
however, single-family properties were redeveloped at higher densities, and minimum fire
flow requirements were increased, but actual physical improvements to the water delivery
system lagged behind. There are a number of areas in the City that require upgrading to
meet current water fire flow standards. Many of the areas with inadequate mains are
designated for residential use.
Another fire fighting and emergency response constraint is the narrow streets found
throughout the City. Narrow streets greatly restrict the maneuverability of fire equipment.
This problem is exacerbated in the evenings because of on-street parking. Narrow curb cuts
and deep, narrow lots also restrict emergency access. The physical accessibility and design
of structures also hinder emergency access. Many areas of Lawndale have infill
development consisting of large apartment complexes. Design of these structures
emphasized the achievement of high densities at the expense of adequate open space that
would allow firefighters and emergency personnel sufficient room to operate. The storage of
materials in side and rear yard areas may also constrain access for firefighting purposes.
According to the City’s water purveyor, Golden State Water Company, there is sufficient
water capacity under existing conditions and future demand conditions to accommodate the
City’s share of regional housing needs of 468 units (see detailed discussions in Section IV,
Housing Resources, of this Element).13
According to the City’s wastewater service provider, the Los Angeles County Sanitation
Districts, the Districts’ wastewater conveyance system is adequate to accommodate the
City’s share of regional housing needs of 468 units. The City’s wastewater is treated at the
Joint Water Pollution Control Plant located in the City of Carson. This facility has a design
capacity of 400 million gallons per day (mgd) and is currently processing an average flow of

297 mgd. Thus, adequate capacity is available to accommodate the growth mandated for
the City of Lawndale.14
Senate Bill 1087 (enacted 2006) requires that water providers develop written policies that
grant priority to proposed development that includes housing affordable to lower-income
households. The legislation also prohibits water providers from denying or conditioning
the approval of development that includes housing affordable to lower-income households,
unless specific written findings are made. Senate Bill 1087 also mandates priority sewage
collection and treatment service to housing developments providing units affordable to
lower-income households. The City will provide a copy of the adopted 2008-2014 Housing
Element to Golden State Water Company and the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts
within 30 days of adoption. The City will continue to coordinate with the Golden State
Water Company and Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts to ensure priority service
provision to affordable housing developments.
E. Environmental Constraints
Lawndale is located in the seismically active Los Angeles Basin where numerous active and
potentially active faults have been identified. However, to date no faults or fault-related
features have been identified within the City limits. The seismic hazard with the most
potential for impact to the City of Lawndale is ground shaking induced by any earthquake
on a regional fault like the San Andreas or a moderate earthquake on a local fault like the
Newport-Inglewood. This risk is typical of any area located within the Los Angeles Basin.
The General Plan contains goals and policies that address seismic hazards to the extent
possible.

IV. HOUSING RESOURCES
This section identifies resources that are available for the development, rehabilitation, and
preservation of housing in the City of Lawndale. The analysis includes an assessment of
land resources for future housing development, the City’s ability to satisfy its share of the
region’s future housing need, the financial resources available to support housing activities
and the administrative resources available to assist in implementing the City’s housing
programs. Additionally, this section examines opportunities for energy conservation.
A. Residential Development Potential
1. Regional Housing Needs Allocation
State Housing Element law requires that a local jurisdiction accommodates a share of the
region’s projected housing needs for the planning period. This share, called the Regional
Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA), is important because State law mandates that the
jurisdiction must provide sufficient land to accommodate a variety of housing opportunities
for all economic segments of the community. Compliance with this requirement is
measured by the jurisdiction’s ability in providing adequate land to accommodate the
RHNA.
The Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG), as the regional planning
agency, is responsible for allocating the RHNA to individual jurisdictions within the six-
county region.15 For the 2008 Housing Element update, the City of Lawndale is allocated a
RHNA of 468 units by SCAG as follows:
              Extremely Low/Very Low-Income (up to 50 percent of AMI): 116 units (24.8
               percent)16
              Low-Income (51 to 80 percent of AMI): 72 units (15.4 percent)
              Moderate-Income (81 to 120 percent of AMI): 77 units (16.4 percent)
              Above Moderate-Income (more than 120 percent of AMI): 203 units (43.4 percent)
The City must ensure the availability of residential sites at adequate densities and
appropriate development standards to accommodate these units.
 
                                                            
15     Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) covers a six-county region, including Los Angeles,
       Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, Ventura, and Imperial.
16     The City has a RHNA allocation of 116 very low income units (inclusive of extremely low income units).
       Pursuant to new State law (AB 2634), the City must project the number of extremely low income housing
       needs based on Census income distribution or assume 50 percent of the very low income units as extremely
       low. According to the CHAS data developed by HUD using 2000 Census data, the City had 24.4 percent
       very low income households (11.7 percent extremely low income and 12.7 percent very low income) as
       shown in Table 7. Therefore the City’s RHNA of 116 very low income units may be split into 56 extremely
       low and 60 very low income units. However, for purposes of identifying adequate sites for the RHNA, State
       law does not mandate the separate accounting for the extremely low income category.

2. Credits toward the RHNA
The RHNA for the 2008-2014 Housing Element cycle in the SCAG region used January 1,
2006 as the baseline for projecting housing needs. As such, housing units constructed,
issued building permits, or approved since January 1, 2006 can be credited toward the
RHNA. Table 28 provides a summary of the units constructed since January 1, 2006.
Lawndale is a small, older, and built out community. Development activities in the City
have been limited. Since January 1, 2006, a total of 69 single-family homes (attached and
detached) and 25 second units have been constructed in the City. Based on the income and
housing cost affordability analysis presented earlier, newer detached single-family homes
are not affordable to lower and moderate income households in Lawndale. For the 25
second units, these units can only be used as rentals. According to www.rentslicer.com, the
average rent for rental homes in Lawndale was $1,663 (Table 16). Specifically, the average
rent for two-bedroom units was $1,406 and that for three-bedroom units was $1,897 (Table
15). The two-bedroom units are affordable to moderate income households according to
affordable housing costs shown in Table 17. However, without specific information on the
sizes of these second units, they are assumed also to be affordable to above moderate
income households. Therefore, based on the units constructed, the City has a remaining
RHNA of 374 units (116 very low, 72 low, 77 moderate, and 109 above moderate income
units).

3. Residential Sites Inventory
Because the planning period extends seven and one-half years from January 1, 2006 to June
30, 2014, the City may meet the remaining RHNA requirement using potential development
on suitable vacant and/or underutilized sites within the community. The City must
document how zoning and development standards on the sites facilitate housing to
accommodate the remaining 430-unit RHNA identified in Table 28.  
 
The City’s sites inventory consists of 23.4 acres of developable land on 34 sites with the
capacity to yield 676 new units during the planning period. The sites are depicted in Figure 
6  and  a  summarized  in  Table  29.    A  parcel‐by‐parcel  listing  of  these  sites  with  specific 
analysis of potential yield is included in Appendix A.

Vacant Sites
The inventory of vacant residential and commercial land is limited to 5.21 acres. Of this
acreage, 3.78 acres is zoned to allow residential uses at a minimum density of 26.4 units per
acre. The remaining 1.43 acres is zoned R-2 and can accommodate up to 13.9 units per acre.
The combined capacity of the vacant 5.08 acres given existing land use controls and zoning
standards is 131 new dwelling units. This estimate includes a 38-unit affordable senior
project being proposed on Site #3 (see Appendix A).
Underutilized Sites
A total of 25 underutilized sites on 18.22 acres of commercial and residential land have been
identified in the City’s sites inventory. Although some portions of each of these sites are
developed with existing commercial, manufacturing, and/or residential uses, these sites are
ripe for redevelopment with higher density residential uses. A minimum of 475 net new
dwelling units can be accommodated on these underutilized sites.

Density Factor
Two recent development applications and one project in the pipeline are used to assess the 
development  density  that  can  be  achieved  considering  the  City’s  development  standards.  
One project on a 0.26‐acre R‐3 site is being proposed for eight attached homes at a density of 
30 units per acre.   
 
Another 96‐unit mixed use project is being proposed on a 2.17‐acre site in the C‐M zone (Site 
31).    This  yields  density  of  44  units  per  acre,  inclusive  of  a  35‐percent  density  bonus  the 
developer is requesting in exchange for providing affordable housing on site.  This project, 
if calculated without the density bonus units, would still result in a density of 32.8 units per 
acre, indicating that the City’s development standards allow a development to achieve the 
base maximum density permitted, taking into consideration the required commercial space.

Another affordable project in the pipeline is a 38‐unit senior housing project on the 0.87‐acre 
site  (Site  3).    This  yields  a  density  of  43.7  units  per  acre,  inclusive  of  a  35‐percent  density 
bonus.  Excluding the density bonus, this project still yields a density of 33 units per acre.   
 
This analysis is intended to illustrate the use of 26.4 units per acre as the potential density
used in calculating capacity. Capacity for most sites in the inventory is based on the
potential 26.4 units per acre; no density bonus was used in estimating capacity. For the two
sites with development proposals in the pipeline, the developers are indeed requesting
density bonuses in exchange for providing affordable units. Only the capacity of these two
specific sites is based on the actual developments proposed and indeed these projects are
achieving densities that are higher than the conservative assumption used in this sites
analysis.
 
4. Availability and Suitability of Sites
Lawndale is an older urbanized City with limited development opportunities on vacant
land. As such, the City’s vacant sites do not have the capacity to meet the City’s share of the
regional housing need and the City must rely on recycling of current underutilized
properties for residential development. As shown in Figure 6, most sites are along
Hawthorne Boulevard. Figure 7 shows the characteristics of vacant and underutilized sites
in the City. Most underutilized sites are occupied by small independent businesses with
large parking areas.
Improvement-to-Land Value Ratio (ILR)
According to the methodology developed by the University of California for the State of
California Business, Transportation, and Housing Agency, the ratio of land improvements
to land value (ILR) can facilitate identification of underutilized sites with potential for infill
or redevelopment with higher density residential uses. An improved site may be
considered underutilized if it is located in a non-single-family area (e.g., commercial,
industrial, multifamily, etc.) if the total value of improvements on the site is less than the
total value of the underlying land (i.e., ILR < 1.0). Improved sites within single-family
residential areas that have improvements valued at less than half of the land value (i.e., ILR
<0.5) may also be considered underutilized. Each of the 25 underutilized sites identified in
Appendix A and summarized in Table 29 meets these criteria.
Existing Uses
Determining a site’s ILR is rarely enough to establish that a site has a reasonable potential to
redevelop with higher density residential uses within the planning period. Improved
properties included in the City’s sites inventory have been carefully screened to eliminate
parcels with commercial structures built within the past 15 years, residential structures built
within the past 30 years, as owners of newer structures may not be inclined to redevelop
their properties even though the land value may be more than the value of improvements.
Oddly-shaped parcels may be difficult to achieve minimum density thresholds and have
therefore also been excluded from the sites inventory.
                                                    CITY OF LAWNDALE| 2008-2014 HOUSING ELEMENT
                                                                                                           59
                                                                                        December 2010
 

All the sites identified include marginal uses such as independent auto repair shops or used
car sales, small homes on large lots, small commercial offices or retail businesses that have
outdated configuration and marginal operations.
Prior to the recession, various developers and property owners had expressed interest in
redevelopment opportunities in the City, particularly along Hawthorne Boulevard.
However, the development community has been on a standstill since 2007/08. The City
anticipates resumed interests when the economy recovers.
Density Assumptions
An economic research consultant was recently commissioned to conduct a feasibility study
of mixed use developments in the South Bay. Eight hypothetical models of various urban
development forms ranging from medium density residential to high density mixed use
were formulated for feasibility testing. Each model involves the recycling of low-intensity
uses to medium- to high-intensity uses. Residential density assumptions used in this study
were between 25 and 38 units per acre. Lawndale’s maximum density of 33 units per acre
and realistically achievable density of 26.4 units per acre fall within this range. When
determining the realistic capacity of commercially zoned sites, a number of performance
standards and criteria were taken into account as well as the potential for the sites to
develop with uses other than residential in zones GC and OC districts. These include: lot
size, location, and configuration (such as potential for lot consolidation, street frontage,
access, etc.); parking standards; height limits; required commercial component; existing and
adjacent uses; and appropriateness for mixed use developments. The South Bay feasibility
study shows that at these densities, stand-alone residential uses and mixed use with a
residential component all yield very high internal rates of return, justifying the recycling of
existing properties.
Small Lot Development
Most  of  the  City’s  parcels  were  created  long  ago  and  are  relatively  small.    To  facilitate 
redevelopment  of  properties  within  the  Hawthorne  Boulevard  Specific  Plan  area,  the 
Specific Plan contains incentives for lot consolidation: 
 
     Required parking may be reduced up to a maximum of 20 percent provided that a 
        finding  can  be  made  that  adequate  parking  will  be  available  to  serve  the  subject 
        project. 
         
        Section J of the Specific Plan outlines development incentives which may be granted 
        at  the  discretion  of  the  City  Council  to  achieve  a  high  quality  development,  one  of 
        those  incentives  being  a  potential  reduction  (20  percent  maximum)  in  the  parking 
        required  by  code.    In  order  to  grant  this  incentive,  an  applicant  would  need  to 
        demonstrate  that  a  proposed  project  would  be  adequately  parked  with  fewer 
        parking spaces than the Municipal Code calls for.  An applicant might demonstrate 
        this  by  way  of  a  comparative  analysis  of  similar  uses  in  different  locations  and/or 
        jurisdictions; however, the figures must be defensible.

         For example, on the community center project that is underway in the City (although 
         just  outside  the  boundaries  of  the  Specific  Plan  area),  the  architect  looked  at  the 
         parking  provided  by  other  recently  constructed  community  centers  and  calculated 
         the  number  of  parking  spaces  per  thousand‐square‐foot  for  each  project,  which 
         equated to figures significantly less than what the Lawndale Municipal Code would 
         otherwise  require.    The  City  Council  found  the  argument  to  be  legitimate  and  that 
         the  community  center  project  would  be  adequately  parked.    Each  case  would  be 
         reviewed  individually  and  there  are  multiple  ways  for  an  applicant  to  justify  a 
         parking  reduction;  however,  the  provision  of  less  than  required  parking  must  be 
         defensible.   
          
        Area of permitted signs may be increased by a maximum of 10 percent provided that 
         a  finding  can  be  made  that  the  increased  area  does  not  distract  from  the 
         beautification and pedestrian‐oriented objectives set in the Specific Plan and that the 
         increased size of signs on one parcel will not adversely affect the visibility of signs 
         on adjacent parcels. 
The original Specific Plan also included a provision for increased FAR as an incentive for lot
consolidation. As the City subsequently removed FAR restrictions in the Specific Plan area,
this incentive is no longer needed. Recent commercial developments along Hawthorne
Boulevard have involved lot consolidation. The City has been actively encouraging
potential developers to look into Site 12 on the Sites Inventory as an opportunity site for a
mixed-use project where lot consolidation would be necessary.
The City will amend the Specific Plan to include additional incentives to encourage and
facilitate lot consolidation and residential development (Program 13). Specific incentives
considered include alternative parking options (e.g., tandem, shared, and off-site parking)
and graduated density bonuses (e.g., density bonuses will be proportional to the number of
lots and total area consolidated).
Infrastructure Availability
As discussed in details in Section III, Housing Constraints, of this Element, the City has
adequate water and sewer capacity to accommodate the RHNA of 468 units. However,
older infrastructure and narrow streets have constrained development in the City.
Therefore, the City focuses future development in the Hawthorne Boulevard Specific Plan
area where existing infrastructure and planned improvements can facilitate additional
mixed use development in the community.

5. Adequacy of Sites to Meet the RHNA
A minimum of 606 net new housing units can be accommodated on 34 vacant and
underutilized sites in Lawndale. Although this exceeds the City’s overall RHNA for the
2008-2014 planning period, the Housing Element must demonstrate that the City has
adequate capacity to accommodate the RHNA by income category.
The City’s remaining RHNA after crediting units constructed since January 1, 2006 is 374
units, including 116 very low income, 72 low income, 77 moderate income, and 109 above 
moderate  income  units  (Table  30).    The  sites  summarized  in  Table  29  above  have  the 
potential to yield 606 net new dwelling units by the end of the 2008–2014 Housing Element 
planning  period.    State law (AB 2348) established a default density of 30 units per acre to
facilitate the development of lower income housing in urbanized communities. When
strictly based on density, the City offers a potential for 583 units to be developed on vacant
and underutilized properties zoned for 33 units or more per acre. Thus, up to 583 lower
income units could potentially be developed on the identified sites, far exceeding the City’s
remaining RHNA of 188 lower income units. However, when considering the lot sizes,
many small sites were conservatively classified as moderate or above moderate income
housing sites. Therefore, the City’s sites inventory by income/feasibility as presented in
Table 30 represents a conservative estimate -   at  least  230  lower  income,  145  moderate 
income, and 208 above moderate income units. This estimate does not preclude the actual
use of these sites for affordable housing. Vacant and underutilized R-2 sites within the City
have capacity to accommodate a minimum of 23 above moderate income net new units.

B. Financial Resources
As a small and built out community, Lawndale has limited financial resources available for
affordable housing. The City leverages, to the maximum extent feasible, local funds with
federal and State funds in meeting its housing and community development objectives.
1. Redevelopment Housing Set-Aside Funds
Pursuant to state Community Redevelopment Law (CRL), 20 percent of the tax increment
generated from a redevelopment project area is required to be set aside for low and
moderate-income housing activities. CRL also sets forth a variety of options for expending
the Housing Set-Aside Fund, including the following:

                                                                                             63
                                                                               December 2010
 

        Acquire real property or building sites;
        Improve real property or building sites with on-site or off-site improvements;
        Donate real property to private or public persons or entities;
        Finance insurance premiums during the construction or rehabilitation of affordable
         housing that are administered by governmental or nonprofit organizations;
        Construct, acquire, or rehabilitate properties;
        Provide subsidies to lower and moderate income households;
        Develop plans, pay principal and interest on bonds, loans, advances, or other
         indebtedness, or pay financing or carrying charges;
        Maintain the supply of mobile homes;
        Preserve publicly assisted housing units that are at risk of converting to market-rate
         housing;
        Fulfill replacement housing requirements; and
        Subsidize administrative expenses provided the expenses are proportionate to the
         amount spent on the production, improvement, and preservation of housing.
While the Housing Set-Aside Fund can be used for on- and off-site improvements, the
improvements must be made as part of an overall project/program that directly results in
new construction or rehabilitation of affordable units.
The Lawndale Redevelopment Implementation Plan projects a total deposit of $3,723,133
(including interest income) into the Set-Aside Fund between FY 2008 and FY 2014. The City
plans to expend $1,000,000 for site acquisition to facilitate affordable housing development
and $1,000,000 to assist in the conversion of a mobile home park into tenant ownership. Set-
Aside Funds are also used to support the Great Neighborhoods Home Rehabilitation
Program.
The City is working with Habitat for Humanity on the first of what is anticipated to be a
series of small affordable housing projects. The current project is proposed as a three-unit
development for low income first-time home buyers. Although the exact numbers are not
yet set, the City will be contributing approximately $428,000 (essentially the cost of the land)
to assist with the land purchase and predevelopment costs. This funding will be in the form
of a zero interest development loan. After construction, silent second loans will be assumed
by each end buyer. The initial buyer will be a low income buyer earning less than 60
percent of Area Median Income (AMI). The property will carry the 45-year affordability
restriction. The restriction will require all subsequent buyers to earn less than 80 percent
AMI.
The City Council recently adopted a budget for FY 2010 that contains funding in the amount
of $1,000,000 for an acquisition and rehabilitation program to provide owner-occupied
housing units for low and very low income households. The funds would be used to
acquire existing single-family units, duplexes, and triplexes for rehabilitation and later resell
as affordable housing.

2. Section 8 Rental Assistance
Section 8 represents a significant housing resource for very low income, especially for
extremely low income households. Specifically, pursuant to HUD regulations, each housing
authority must set aside a portion of the Section 8 vouchers for extremely low income
households.
The Lawndale Housing Authority contracts with the Housing Authority of the County of
Los Angeles to administer its Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program. This program
provides rental assistance to very low income households. Currently, 197 Lawndale
households are receiving Section 8 assistance, including 72 elderly-headed households. In
addition, 45 households are receiving Section 8 assistance from the Housing Authority of
the County of Los Angeles but are using these vouchers in Lawndale. However, the need
for Section 8 assistance still exceeds the availability of resources.
3. Community Development Block Grant
The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program was initiated by the Housing
and Community Development Act (HCDA) of 1974. The primary objective of the program
is to develop viable urban communities by providing decent housing, a suitable living
environment, and economic opportunities, principally for persons of low incomes (up to 80
percent AMI). CDBG funds can be used for a wide array of activities, including:
              Housing rehabilitation;
              Downpayment and other homeownership assistance;
              Lead-based paint screening and abatement;
              Acquisition of buildings and land;
              Construction or rehabilitation of public facilities and infrastructure;
              Removal or architectural barriers;
              Public services for low-income persons and persons with special needs;
              Rehabilitation of commercial or industrial buildings; and
              Loans and grants for businesses that provide employment for low-income persons.
The City of Lawndale does not qualify as an entitlement jurisdiction to receive annual
CDBG allocations directly from HUD.17 The City participates in the CDBG program
through the Urban County program administered by the Los Angeles County Community
Development Commission (LACDC). Annually, the City receives approximately $400,000
in CDBG funds through the County. Funding is primarily used to support capital
improvements.
                                                            
17     A jurisdiction must have a population of 50,000 or over to qualify as an entitlement jurisdiction to receive
       annual funding from HUD directly.

C. Administrative Resources
1. Lawndale Redevelopment Agency
The City/Agency adopted its first redevelopment project area in May 1999. The
Redevelopment Project Area covers almost the entire City with the exception of single-
family residential neighborhoods. The Redevelopment Agency administers first-time home
buyers programs, the Great Neighborhoods Home Rehabilitation Program, and can assist
with any residential rehab project within the City.
2. Lawndale Housing Authority
The Lawndale Housing Authority offers Section 8 rental assistance via a contract with the
Los Angeles County Community Development Commission (LACDC). The Section 8
program extends rental subsidies to very low-income (up to 50 percent of AMI) family and
seniors who spend more than 30 percent of their income on rent. The subsidy represents the
difference between the excess of 30 percent of the monthly income and the actual rent.
Rental assistance is issued to the recipients as vouchers, which permit tenants to locate their
own housing and rent units beyond the federally determined fair market rent in an area,
provided the tenants pay the extra rent increment.
3. Los Angeles County Community Development Commission
The City of Lawndale participates in a range of programs administered by LACDC. These
include the CDBG program, first-time homebuyer assistance (such as Mortgage Credit
Certificates and Home Ownership Program), and rehabilitation assistance (Home
Improvement Program). Nonprofit housing developers may also directly apply for HOME
funds from the LACDC to develop affordable housing in Lawndale.
4. Nonprofit Housing Developers
In pursuing the development and preservation of affordable housing in the future, the City
will work with qualified nonprofit housing developer in order ensure the long-term
affordability of housing provided. The following nonprofit developers have expressed
interest in providing affordable housing in the region:
       Bridge Housing
       Habitat for Humanity
       Jamboree Housing Corporation
       Los Angeles Community Design Center
D. Opportunities for Energy Conservation
In relation to new residential development, and especially affordable housing, construction
of energy efficient building does add to the original production costs of ownership and
rental housing. Over time, however, the housing with energy conservation features should
           2008-2014 HOUSING ELEMENT | CITY OF LAWNDALE
   66
           December 2010
 

reduce occupancy costs as the consumption of fuel and electricity is decreased. This means
the monthly housing costs may be equal to or less than what they otherwise would have
been if no energy conservation devices were incorporated in the new residential buildings.
1. State Regulations
Title 24 of the California Administrative code establishes energy conservation standards that
must be applied to all new residential buildings. The regulations specify energy saving
design for walls, ceilings and floor installations, as well as heating and cooling equipment
and systems, gas cooling devices, conservation standards and the use of nondepleting
energy sources, such as solar energy or wind power. Compliance with the energy standards
is achieved by satisfying certain conservation requirements and an energy budget. Among
the alternative ways to meeting the energy standards are the following:
       Alternative 1: The passive solar approach which requires proper solar orientation,
        appropriate levels of thermal mass, south facing windows, and moderate insulation
        levels.
       Alternative 2: Generally requires higher levels of insulation than Alternative 1, but
        has no thermal mass or window orientation requirements.
       Alternative 3: Also is without passive solar design but requires active solar water
        heating in exchange for less stringent insulation and/or glazing requirements.
In turn, the home building industry must comply with these standards while localities are
responsible for enforcing the energy conservation regulations.
Energy conservation will have the added benefit of reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions
(GHG), consistent with the legislative intent of AB 32, enacted in 2006. AB 32 tasks the
California Air Resources Board (CARB) with establishing a statewide GHG emissions limit
that is equivalent to the statewide GHG emission levels in the year 1990 to be achieved by
the year 2020. CARB will establish rules and regulations to achieve the AB 32 GHG
emission reduction targets.
2. State and Federal Programs
The California Department of Community Services and Development in partnership with
the network of local community services agencies that assist lower-income households,
administers the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) and Energy Low-
Income Weatherization Assistance Program (DOE-LIWAP). Assistance available to lower
income households through State LIHEAP programs include: financial assistance towards a
household's energy bill, emergency assistance if a household's home energy service is shut
off or about to be shut off, and a range of other energy-related services that States may
choose to offer, such as weatherization improvements, utility equipment repair and
replacement, budgeting counseling, etc. The DOE-LIWAP provides installation and
weatherization measures that increase energy efficiency of existing residential and multi-

                                                                          December 2010
 

family dwellings occupied by lower-income persons. Eligible weatherization services
include a wide variety of energy efficiency measures that encompass the building envelope,
its heating and cooling systems, its electrical system, and electricity consuming appliances.
3. Local Measures
Opportunities for additional energy conservation practices include the implementation of
"mitigation measures" contained in environmental impact reports prepared on residential
projects in the City. These mitigation measures may be adopted as conditions of project
approval.
The City has a goal and policies regarding energy conservation in the Conservation Element
of the General Plan. The energy conservation goal is to “minimize negative environmental
effects of supplying and using energy by reducing the community's reliance upon
traditional energy resources through initiation of energy conservation practices and the
utilization of available energy technology." Policies 3a through 3f in the Conservation
Element of the General Plan implement this goal. These policies include the encouragement
of innovative building, site design and orientation techniques that minimize energy use, and
the promotion of public awareness of energy conservation technology and techniques. The
City also supports SCAG’s Regional Housing goals and Regional Transportation Plan to
reduce GHG emissions by fostering Transit Oriented Design.
In 2002, the City amended the Hawthorne Boulevard Specific Plan to allow mixed-use
residential development within commercial zones. Policies and programs of this Housing
Element will encourage and facilitate the redevelopment of underutilized commercial sites
within the City’s primary transit corridor. Mixed-use residential development that is both
pedestrian- and transit-oriented conserves energy by reducing the number of vehicular trips
and efficient use of land and construction materials.
4. Private Sector Programs
Southern California Edison (SCE) offers a variety of energy conservation services as part of
its Customer Assistance Programs (CAP). The Energy Assistance Fund helps income-
qualified residential customers facing financial hardship manage their electricity bills
during the months of February and March. These services are designed to help low-income
households, senior citizens, permanently disabled, and non-English speaking customers
control their energy use. The 2007 Residential Multifamily Energy Efficiency Rebate
Program offers property owners and managers incentives on a broad list of energy
efficiency improvements in lighting, HVAC, insulation, and window categories. These
improvements are to be used to retrofit existing multi-family properties of two or more
units.

V. HOUSING PLAN
Previous sections of the Housing Element establish the housing needs, opportunities, and
constraints in the City of Lawndale. The Housing Plan presented in this section sets forth
the City’s goals, policies and programs to address Lawndale’s identified housing needs.
A. Review of Past Accomplishments
Government Code Section 65588(a) requires each jurisdiction to review its housing element
as frequently as appropriate to evaluate:
       The appropriateness of the housing goals, objectives, and policies in contributing to
        the attainment of the state housing goal;
       The effectiveness of the housing element in attainment of the community’s housing
        goals and objectives; and
       The progress of the city, county or city and county in implementation of the housing
        element.
This section documents the City’s achievements under the 2000-2008 Housing Element with
respect to the actions and objectives contained therein.              The City’s efforts and
accomplishments under the 2000-2008 Housing Element are summarized in Appendix  B.
The Appendix also contains recommendations for program retention, revision, deletion or
addition to address current and projected needs and State requirements between 2008 and
2014.
B. Goals and Policies
This section of the Housing Element contains the goals and policies the City of Lawndale
intends to implement to address a number of important housing-related issues. The
following five major issue areas are addressed by the goals and policies of this Element:
       Ensure that a broad range of housing types are provided to meet the needs of the
        existing and future residents;
       Ensure that housing is maintained and preserved;
       Increase opportunities for homeownership;
       Ensure the availability of housing-related services for special needs groups; and
       Promote equal housing opportunity.
Each issue area and the supporting goals and policies are identified and discussed in the
following section.

                                                                                          69
                                                                          December 2010
 

1. Provide for a Range of Housing Types
Continuing to provide a balanced inventory of housing in terms of types (e.g., single-family,
duplexes, apartments, condominiums, and mobile home), cost and style will allow the City
to fulfill a variety of housing needs. In addition, providing regulatory and available
financial assistance will be essential to support the production of affordable housing.
GOAL 1:      Assist in the provision of adequate housing that meets the existing and future needs
             of the community. Establish a balanced approach to meeting the housing needs of
             both renter- and owner-households.
Policy 1.1: Ensure the provision of a variety of housing types to fulfill regional housing
             needs.
Policy 1.2: Facilitate development of affordable housing through use of financial and/or
             regulatory incentives where feasible.
Policy 1.3: Maintain streamlined procedures for processing new residential development
             applications.
Policy 1.4: Continue use of federal and state housing assistance programs for lower and
             moderate income households.
Policy 1.5: Encourage the development of residential units intended for the special groups,
             including the elderly, large families, persons with disabilities, and the homeless.
Policy 1.6: Encourage the provision of housing affordable to extremely low income
             households when reviewing proposals for new affordable housing
             developments.
Policy 1.7: Continue to promote improvements to increase energy efficiency.
2. Provide Adequate Residential Sites
Lawndale is a built-out community with a limited amount of remaining vacant residential
land. To facilitate new residential development, the City plays an important role in both
assisting in the identification and promotion of potential sites for future development, and
allowing for a range of development types on these key remaining parcels.
GOAL 2:      Provide adequate housing sites through appropriate land use, zoning, and specific
             plan designations to accommodate the City’s share of regional housing needs.
Policy 2.1: Maintain an up-to-date residential sites inventory, and provide to interested
             developers in conjunction with information on available development incentives.
Policy 2.2: Promote mixed-use development to facilitate smart growth and reduction in
             automobile trips, vehicle miles traveled, and associated energy consumption.
           2008-2014 HOUSING ELEMENT | CITY OF LAWNDALE
   70
           December 2010
 

Policy 2.2: Assist in marketing key residential development sites to the real estate and
            development community.
Policy 2.3: Continue to allow second residential units on single-family parcels as a means of
            providing additional rental housing opportunities.
Policy 2.4: Provide zoning to accommodate a variety of housing options.
3. Promote Homeownership
Increasing homeownership in the City can contribute to improved property maintenance
and stabilization of neighborhoods. In addition, by assisting renters to move into
adequately sized ownership units, the City can address overcrowding in its rental housing
stock. The City participates in homeownership assistance programs offered by the County.
The City has also adopted an ordinance to allow the conversion of existing apartments into
condominiums, which when combined with tenant ownership assistance, can provide lower
cost home purchase opportunities.
GOAL 3:     Provide increased opportunities for lower and moderate income households to
            become first-time homebuyers.
Policy 3.1: Promote increased homeownership in the City, with a goal to increase the
            proportion of owner-occupied households in Lawndale to 40 percent.
Policy 3.2: Support the development of affordable homeownership housing for first-time
            homebuyers.
Policy 3.3: Continue to participate in mortgage and downpayment assistance programs
            offered through the County Community Development Commission, as well as
            private sources.
Policy 3.4: Maintain a condominium conversion program to make homeownership possible
            for an increased segment of the population.
4. Maintain and Preserve Existing Housing
In general, housing over 30 years old usually is in need of some major rehabilitation, such as
a new roof, repair of termite damage, foundation work, plumbing, etc. With approximately
80 percent of Lawndale’s housing stock built prior to 1980, preventive maintenance is
essential to ward off widespread housing deterioration. Some households, particularly
those that have owned their homes for many years and have relatively low house payments,
may be able to afford the monthly payments, but may have limited money remaining for
major repairs. Assisting these households will help preserve the City's existing housing
stock.

GOAL 4:     Use public and private resources to preserve existing residential neighborhood
            characteristics and to ensure adequate infrastructure for housing needs.
Policy 4.1: Continue to provide programs for the rehabilitation of substandard and
            deteriorating units.
Policy 4.2: Work to alleviate unit overcrowding by permitting owners to add bedrooms,
            bath, and additional living areas in existing homes.

5. Promote Equal Housing Opportunities
The City seeks to expand the range of housing opportunities provided in Lawndale,
including housing for seniors on fixed incomes, low and moderate income residents, the
disabled, large families, female-headed households with children, and the homeless. In
order to make adequate provision for the housing needs of all segments of the community,
the City must ensure equal and fair housing opportunities are available to all residents.
GOAL 5:     Provide housing opportunities for all, regardless of race, color, ancestry, national

            programs requiring joint efforts, especially public/private, have the necessary
            representatives involved.
C. Housing Programs
The goals and policies outlined in the prior section address Lawndale’s identified housing
needs, and are implemented through a series of housing programs offered primarily
through the City’s Community Development Department and Redevelopment Agency.
Housing programs define the specific actions the City will undertake to achieve the stated
goals and policies. The City’s housing programs for addressing community housing needs
is described according to the following five issue areas.
       Housing Conservation
       Production of Housing
       Provision of Adequate Housing Sites
       Removal of Governmental Constraints
       Promotion of Equal Housing Opportunity
The housing programs presented on the following pages include existing programs as well
as various revised and new programs that have been added to address the City’s unmet
housing needs. The responsible agency, funding source(s), and five-year objectives is
identified for each program.
Conservation of the Existing Supply of Housing
Conserving and improving the housing stock is an important goal for the City of Lawndale.
Nearly 80 percent of housing units in Lawndale were constructed prior to 1980 and are
therefore more likely to have rehabilitation needs than newer housing units, including new
plumbing, roof repairs, foundation work and other repairs.                 The City supports
neighborhood preservation and improvement through housing rehabilitation and
improvement programs, and code enforcement. Other housing conservation needs of the
City include existing multifamily rental apartments at-risk of converting to condominiums
and continuing the City’s Section 8 rental assistance program.
Program 1: Residential Rehabilitation Programs
City of Lawndale Programs
The City’s Residential Rehabilitation Programs are the primary means by which the City
preserves and improves the quality of its housing stock. The following loans and grants are
available:
       Great Neighborhoods Program Forgivable Loan ($20,000 loan): Loans offered at 0 zero
        percent interest and no monthly payments to owner-occupants that earn at 50

        percent or below the area median income (AMI). Repayment is due if the owner-
        occupant sells the home, refinances for cash, or transfers the title within five years
        from the filing date of the notice of completion. A proportional amount of the
        principle (at the rate of 20 percent per annum) is forgiven each year of ownership for
        a period of five years. The City files a lien (Deed of Trust) against the recipient
        property to secure the loan. This program benefit primarily extremely low and very
        low income households.
       Great Neighborhoods Program Deferred Loan ($20,000 loan): Loans offered at zero
        percent interest and no monthly payments to owner-occupants that earn between 51
        percent and 80 percent of the AMI. Repayment is due if the owner-occupant sells the
        home, refinances for cash, or transfers the title within five years from the filing date
        of the notice of completion. The City files a lien (Deed of Trust) against the recipient
        property to secure the loan.
       Great Neighborhoods Program Repayable Loan ($20,000 loan): Loans offered at three
        percent interest with monthly payments to owner-occupants that earn between 81
        percent and 120 percent of the AMI. Loan funds are amortized over a 15-year
        period. The City files a lien (Deed of Trust) against the recipient property to secure
        the loan.
       Home & Gardens Grant ($3,000 grant): 100 percent grants are available to owner-
        occupants that earn up to 120 percent of the AMI. Repayment is not necessary.
Eligible rehabilitation work for the programs, include items such as roofing, painting,
plumbing, windows, and other general property improvements. All work must be
completed in the following order: (1) HUD Required Items and Health and Safety Items; (2)
Emergency Repairs or ADA Improvements; (3) Correction of Code and Building Violations;
(4) Exterior Property Improvements; and (5) Interior Property Improvements.
Available Programs as Participating City in Urban County
As a participant in the Los Angeles Urban County Program, Lawndale is also eligible to
participate in the County’s Rental Rehabilitation Loan Program. This program provides
financial assistance in rental property owners for the rehabilitation of multi-family units that
are made available to tenants at or below 80 percent of the AMI. It allows the rental owners
to rehabilitate affordable rental housing for low-income families by providing financial
support through the utilization of public/private funding sources to maintain existing
rental properties. The County rental rehabilitation program focuses on housing for
extremely low and very low income households, especially those with special needs.
Lawndale residents are also eligible to receive assistance under the Housing Rehabilitation
Loan Program for single-family or duplex homes. Room addition as a means to address
overcrowding is an eligible activity under this program. The various programs are
designed to assist households of different financial means. Very low and extremely low
income households are eligible for forgivable loans, and therefore are available to these
households potentially at no cost.

Program 2: Rental Rehabilitation
The City uses Redevelopment Housing Set-Aside funds to facilitate the rehabilitation of
properties as affordable rental housing for lower income households. Specifically, the City
has set aside $800,000 to rehabilitate dilapidated units as affordable rental housing for lower
income households.
    Responsible Agency:         City of Lawndale, Community Development Department
    Financing:                  Redevelopment Set-Aside Funds
    2008-2014 Objectives:       Rehabilitate ten housing units.
Program 3: Acquisition and Rehabilitation Program
The City, through its Redevelopment Agency, has established an Acquisition and
Rehabilitation Program, the purpose of which is to acquire and rehabilitate existing housing
units, and resell them to low and very low income households. Funding in the amount of
$1,000,000 has been appropriated for this purpose and Habitat for Humanity has expressed
interest in participating in this program.
    Responsible Agency:         City of Lawndale, Community Development Department
    Financing:                  Redevelopment Set-Aside Funds
    2008-2014 Objectives:       Rehabilitate three housing units.
Program 4: Condominium Conversion Ordinance
Due to the lack of vacant residential land and the high proportion of rental housing units in
the community, opportunities to build owner-occupied dwelling units within Lawndale are
extremely limited. Since converted rental units offer a more affordable housing alternative
than newly constructed units, the City adopted a condominium conversion ordinance in
2000 that permits the conversion of two or more multi-family properties to condominium
ownership. Included in the ordinance are a number of tenant provisions such as relocation
assistance. The ordinance, coupled with the City’s expanded homeownership assistance

                               throughout the planning period.
Program 5: Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers
The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program extends rental subsidies to very low-
income households, including families, seniors, and the disabled. The program offers a
voucher that pays the difference between the current fair market rent (FMR) as established
by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and what a tenant can
afford to pay (i.e. 30 percent of household income). The voucher allows a tenant to choose
housing that costs above the payment standard, providing the tenant pays the extra cost. A
portion of the Section 8 vouchers is reserved for household with extremely low incomes.
The Los Angeles County Housing Authority administers the Section 8 program on behalf of
the City of Lawndale Housing Authority. As of December 2007, 197 households were
receiving Section 8 assistance in the City. Given the continued need for rental assistance for
very low income households, the City will continue to promote this program through
dissemination of brochures at public counters, providing information on the City’s web-site,
and referring residents and property owners to the Los Angeles County Housing Authority.

Program 6: Conservation of Existing and Future Affordable Units
Between July 1, 2008 and June 30, 2018, one federally assisted multi-family apartment
development with 56 Section 8 units is at-risk of converting to market rate housing. The
City will work with the property owner of the Lawndale Senior Housing development,
interest groups and the State and federal governments to implement the following actions
on an ongoing basis to conserve its affordable housing stock:

          December 2010
 

       Monitor Units at Risk: Monitor the status of units within the Lawndale Senior
        Housing development since they may lose their Section 8 subsidies due to
        discontinuation of the program at the federal level or opting out by the property
        owner.
       Tenant Education: California Legislature extended the noticing requirement of at-risk
        units opting out of low-income use restrictions to one year. Should a property
        owner pursue conversion of the units to market rate, the City will ensure that
        tenants were properly noticed and informed of their rights and that they are eligible
        to receive Section 8 vouchers that would enable them to stay in their units.
       Assist Tenants of Existing Rent Restricted Units to Obtain Section 8 Voucher Assistance:
        Tenants of housing units with expired Section 8 contracts are eligible to receive
        special Section 8 vouchers that can be used only at the same property. The City will
        assist tenants of "at risk" units to obtain these Section 8 vouchers through the Los
        Angeles County Housing Authority.

                               period. Within 60 days of notice of intent to convert at-risk
                               units to market rate rents, the City will work with potential
                               purchasers, educate tenants of their rights, and assist tenants
                               to obtain rental assistance in accordance with this program.
Production of Housing
The City of Lawndale implements various programs to encourage a diversity of housing
types. Part of this diversity is addressed through the Regional Housing Needs Allocation
(RHNA), which encourages the construction of housing for all economic segments in the
community. Housing diversity is important to ensure that all households, regardless of age,
income level, and household type, have the opportunity to find housing suited to their need
and lifestyle. The following programs support the provision of additional housing
opportunities in Lawndale.
Program 7: Affordable Housing Development
To facilitate affordable housing development in Lawndale, the City will provide regulatory
incentives to private developers along with information regarding the availability of
funding through HUD and other Federal, State, and local housing assistance. In addition,

with the adoption of a Redevelopment Project Area and generation of tax increment
housing funds, the City will be able to provide direct financial assistance for affordable
housing.
The City is a participant of the Urban County program and therefore housing development
in the City may apply for the Countywide Affordable Rental Housing Development
Program administered by the LACDC. This program provides financial and technical
assistance to acquire sites and develop affordable rental housing in unincorporated areas
and in cities participating in the Urban County Program on a countywide basis using
HOME and CDBG funds.
Financial assistance is provided in the form of “gap” financing, for both short-term and
long-term financing. Housing development projects are required to have a minimum of 20
percent of units set aside for low-income households earning below 50 percent of the Area
Median Income. The County’s housing development policy requires that conventional
construction and/or permanent financing be incorporated into a project whenever possible.
In addition, applications for Federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credits must be applied
whenever possible.

Program 8: Second Units
Second dwelling units are permitted by right in all residential zones in Lawndale, subject to
the following conditions consistent with State law:
       An attached second residential dwelling unit shall contain not less than 400 square
        feet of enclosed floor area nor shall it be larger than 30 percent of the existing single-
        family dwelling unit that is to be attached to.
       A detached second residential dwelling unit shall be located at least 20 feet from the
        closest habitable structure. It shall contain not less than 400 square feet of enclosed
        floor area nor shall it contain more than 1,200 square feet of enclosed floor area.
The majority of the City’s residential land is zoned R-2, which allows two units on a lot
without the need to complete a discretionary subdivision process. This flexibility has
resulted in the development of larger, more marketable and attractive units than what could
be built under the Second Unit Program. Furthermore, few R-1 lots are large enough to
accommodate secondary dwelling units. As such, second units are not a popular housing
option for Lawndale property owners. Nevertheless, the City will continue to promote
second dwelling units through distribution of a brochure at public counters and to the South
Bay Board of Realtors. The City will also post information about the program on the City’s

Program 9: Homeownership Programs
The City does not offer first-time homebuyers assistance programs due to limited funding
available and the high prices of for-sale homes. However, Lawndale residents are eligible to
participate in Home Ownership Program (HOP), Housing Economic Recovery Ownership
(HERO) Program, and the Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC) Program, offered by the
County of Los Angeles Community Development Commission (LACDC). The City will
continue to promote the HOP, HERO, and MCC programs, particularly to tenants in
developments undergoing condominium conversion.
The HOP program is financed with HOME funds provided through HUD and has been
designed to meet the needs of lower- and moderate-income families with down payment

assistance. The program provides a 2nd Trust Deed loan at zero percent interest with all
payments deferred until sale, transfer, refinancing, or full repayment of the first mortgage.
Borrowers are eligible to receive $80,000 or 20 percent of the purchase price, whichever is
least.
The MCC Program offers the first-time homebuyer a federal income tax credit. This credit
reduces the amount of federal taxes recipients would pay and can help the first-time
homebuyer qualify for a loan by allowing a lender to reduce the housing expense ratio by
the amount of tax savings. The qualified homebuyer who is awarded an MCC may take an
annual credit against their federal income taxes paid on the homebuyer's mortgage. The
credit is subtracted dollar-for-dollar from the recipient’s federal income taxes. The qualified
buyer is awarded a tax credit of up to 15 percent.
The Housing Economic Recovery Ownership (HERO) program administered by the County
is available to first-time homebuyers (borrowers) with no ownership interest in, or who
have not held “title” to, a principal residence during the three-year period preceding the
purchase of the property. HERO loans are zero percent interest loans. No repayment is
required until the home is sold, transferred, refinanced, or no longer owner-occupied.
Eligible properties are single-family foreclosed, abandoned or vacant homes with a
maximum purchase price of $493,000, and attached or detached condominium/townhomes
with a maximum purchase price of $394,250. Homes located in census tracts 6038.00,
6039.00, 6040.00, and 6041.00 in Lawndale are eligible properties to participate in this
program.

Provision of Adequate Housing Sites
Meeting the housing needs of all segments of the community requires the provision of
adequate sites for all types, size and prices of housing. The City’s General Plan and Zoning
Ordinance determine where housing may locate, thereby affecting the supply of land
available for residential development.

Program 10: Residential Development on Vacant and Underutilized Sites
The City of Lawndale is almost entirely developed and few vacant residentially zoned sites
remain in the City. Recent and future residential development relies primarily on the
redevelopment of underutilized properties, particularly along the City’s major corridors
where mixed use development is permitted.
Recognizing the need to create additional capacity to accommodate the community’s
housing needs, the City amended the Hawthorne Specific Plan to allow mixed-use
development of properties within the Neighborhood Commercial (NC), General
Commercial (GC), and Office Commercial (OC) districts in the specific plan subject to the
approval of a Special Use Permit (SUP). The amendment is intended to facilitate promotes
redevelopment of underutilized commercial properties with a mix of high density
residential uses above ground-floor commercial uses.
Given the City’s small size, the Lawndale is able to monitor the status of vacant and
underutilized sites and will continue to provide sites information to interested developers.
To facilitate mixed use development, the Hawthorne Boulevard Specific Plan offers
incentives (reduced parking, increased sign area, etc.) for lot consolidation and the provision
of public facilities and pedestrian amenities. The City has also assisted developments with
public improvements. The City will also amend the Specific Plan to waive the ground floor
commercial requirement for projects with at least 50 percent of proposed units affordable to
lower income households.
In addition, mixed-use development is permitted in commercial zones other than those
within the Hawthorne Boulevard Specific Plan area. One program action is to actively
advertise opportunity sites by creating brochures of the sites and circulating them to
qualified developers. The Redevelopment Agency is also actively pursuing development
opportunities for mixed-use projects and has funding available for property acquisition.
Certainly, for a mixed-use project that has an affordable housing component the
Redevelopment Agency would be able and willing to close an economic gap through
Agency assistance.

                                reporting throughout the planning period.
Program 11: Residential Development Monitoring
To ensure adequate sites are available throughout the planning period to meet the City’s
RHNA, and to assist developers in identifying appropriate sites for residential and mixed
use developments, the City will continue to annually update an inventory that details the
amount, type, and size of vacant and underutilized parcels. The City will also record the
number of extremely low, very low, low, and moderate income units constructed annually.
If the inventory indicates a shortage of available sites, the City shall provide additional
incentives for affordable housing development which could include changes to the zoning
code or direct financial assistance for sufficient sites to accommodate the City’s RHNA.
The City has identified residential capacity within the mixed use zone to accommodate 188
units of the City’s RHNA for lower income households. The parcels identified in the sites
inventory represent only a portion of the Hawthorne Boulevard Specific Plan area where
mixed use developments are permitted. For example, the City is in negotiation with a
property owner to acquire a vacant parcel adjacent to Site 14 in the sites inventory
(Appendix A). To ensure sufficient residential capacity is maintained within this Specific
Plan area to accommodate the identified need, the City will develop and implement a
formal ongoing (project-by-project) evaluation procedure pursuant to Government Code
Section 56863. Should an approval of commercial development on the parcels included in
the Housing Element sites inventory result in a reduction of capacity below the potential
residential capacity anticipated in this Housing Element as needed to accommodate the
remaining need for lower income households, the City will identify additional sites within
the Hawthorne Specific Plan area and the R-3 zone to ensure adequate capacity is available.
The City will also review, and modify as appropriate, the development standards in these
zones in order to facilitate mixed use and high density residential development in these
zones.

                                ability to accommodate the remaining RHNA.
Removal of Governmental Constraints
Under State law, the Housing Element must address, and where legally possible, remove
governmental constraints affecting the maintenance, improvement, and development of
housing. The following programs are designed to mitigate government constraints on
residential development and facilitate development of housing affordable to lower and
moderate income households, including families, seniors, and persons with special needs.

Program 12: Density Bonus Ordinance/Affordable Housing Development Incentives
Density bonuses, together with the incentives and/or concessions, can result in a lower
average cost of land per dwelling unit thereby making the provision of affordable housing
more feasible. SB 1818 (enacted 2005) and SB 435 (enacted 2006) changed the requirements
of State law regarding the mandatory provision of density bonuses, incentives and
concessions to affordable housing developers that meet certain criteria. A density bonus up
to 35 percent over the otherwise maximum allowable residential density under the
applicable zoning district is available to developers who provide affordable housing as part
of their projects. Developers of affordable housing are also entitled to at least one
concession or incentive. The City will update its density bonus ordinance to comply with
SB 1818 (enacted 2005) and SB 435 (enacted 2006). The revised density bonus ordinance will
specify the types of regulatory concessions and incentives to be offered consistent with State
law. Examples of concessions and incentives that could be offered include, but are not
limited to, reductions in the amount of required on-site parking, fee reductions, expedited
permit processing, and modified or waived development standards.

                                of adoption of the 2008-2014 Housing Element. Promote the
                                use of density bonus incentives to developers and provide
                                technical assistance to developers in utilizing density bonus
                                for maximize feasibility and meet local housing needs.

                                reporting throughout the planning period.
Program 13: Lot Consolidation Program
The Hawthorne Boulevard Specific Plan includes a variety of incentives to encourage the
owner-initiated merger or consolidation of contiguous properties located within the General
Commercial (GC) and Office Commercial (OC) districts. The intent of these incentives is to
achieve orderly development, improve pedestrian activity, and implement the goals,
policies, and objectives of the Specific Plan and the Housing Element. The following
incentives may be provided at the discretion of the City Council:
    •   Parking Reduction: Required parking may be reduced up to a maximum of 20
        percent, subject to finding that adequate parking will be available to serve the subject
        project;
    •   Signage Bonus: Area of permitted signs may be increased by a maximum of 10
        percent, subject to finding that the increased area does not detract from
        beautification and pedestrian-oriented objectives of the Specific Plan and that the
        increased size of signs on one parcel will not adversely affect the visibility of signs
        on adjacent parcels; and

Additional incentives to encourage and facilitate lot consolidation and residential
development will include:
    •   Alternative Parking: Tandem, shared, and off-site parking options may be allowed,
        subject to finding that adequate parking will be available to serve the subject project.
    •   Graduated Density:         A graduated density bonus may be granted for lot
        consolidation (e.g., parcels consolidated to achieve a lot greater than two acres in
        size would be eligible for a larger density bonus when compared to consolidation of
        parcels to achieve a one acre lot).
The City will advertise the lot consolidation provisions of the Hawthorne Boulevard Specific
Plan to existing property owners and prospective mixed-use and affordable housing
developers. Advertisement actions will include preparation and distribution of a brochure
with information about program incentives and an invitation to attend a working session to
discuss opportunities for lot consolidation and mixed-use residential development,
including affordable housing development within the Hawthorne Boulevard Specific Plan
corridor.
The Neighborhood Commercial (NC) district is intended for smaller scale, pedestrian-
oriented developments. While lot consolidation is permitted, no additional incentives
would be offered by the City.

Program 14: Transitional and Supportive Housing
Transitional housing is a type of housing used to facilitate the movement of homeless
individuals and families to permanent housing. According to the National Housing
Institute, supportive housing is permanent housing with a service component, which can be
provided either on-site or off-site. Both transitional housing and supportive housing can
take several forms, including group quarters with beds, single-family homes, and multi-
family apartments. Both types of housing typically offers case management and support
services to return people to independent living. However, transitional housing usually
allows a tenancy of between six and 24 months; supportive housing is permanent housing.
The City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to different transitional/supportive housing that
is configured as group quarters/institutional use and transitional/supportive housing that is
           2008-2014 HOUSING ELEMENT | CITY OF LAWNDALE

configured as regular housing. For transitional/supportive housing that is developed as group
quarters/institutional use, such housing will be permitted as community residential care
facilities. For transitional/supportive housing that is configured as regular housing, such
housing will be permitted where regular housing is otherwise permitted.

Program 15: Emergency Shelters
An emergency shelter is a facility that provides shelter to homeless families and/or
homeless individuals on a limited short-term basis. No emergency shelters are currently
located within Lawndale, and the zoning regulations do not address emergency shelters.
The Zoning Ordinance will be amended to allow emergency shelters with a ministerial
permit within the M-1 zone and in the C-M zone via an SUP, consistent with SB 2 enacted in
2007. The M-1 and C-M zones cover approximately 13 acres in Lawndale and are presently
developed with many older and underutilized manufacturing and commercial uses.
Therefore, adequate capacity exists in these zones either through redevelopment or
rehabilitation to accommodate an emergency shelter for at least 58 homeless individuals
(identified unsheltered homeless population in Lawndale) and at least one year-round
emergency shelter.

Program 16: Single Room Occupancy Units
SRO units are one-room units intended for occupancy by a single individual. It is distinct
from a studio or efficiency unit, in that a studio is a one-room unit that must contain a
kitchen and bathroom. Although SRO units are not required to have a kitchen or bathroom,
many SROs have one or the other. Currently, the Zoning Ordinance does not expressly
address SROs. The Zoning Ordinance will be amended to facilitate and encourage the
provision of SROs, consistent with SB 2 enacted in 2007. SROs will require approval of an
SUP in commercial zones. Criteria that would be used to review SUP applications for SROs
pertain to performance standards and are not specific to the proposed use. Potential
conditions for approval of these facilities may include hours of operation, security, loading
requirements, and management. Conditions would be similar to those for other similar uses
in the same zones and would not serve to constrain the development of such facilities.

Program 17: Housing for Persons with Disabilities
Both the Federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act
direct local governments to make reasonable accommodations (i.e. modifications or
exceptions) to allow disabled persons an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.
The City amended its Zoning Ordinance in 2002 to establish the process for requesting and
grant reasonable accommodations in the application of the Zoning regulations for persons
with disabilities, consistent with SB 520. Requests for reasonable accommodation are
reviewed and decided by the Community Development Director unless the applicant seeks
a permit or approval that is reviewed by the Planning Commission. The City will place
information regarding procedures for requesting reasonable accommodation at public
counters and on the City’s website. The City will also continue to monitor its development
codes and procedures to ensure that no conditions exist to unduly constrain the
development of housing for persons with disabilities. When constraints are identified, the
City will work to mitigate or eliminate such constraints.

                               (similar to current City incentive for senior housing).
Program 18: Special Use Permit Requirement
The City currently requires a Special Use Permit (SUP) for multi-family housing in R-3 and
R-4 zone districts and all development within RPD districts. The City’s SUP process and
Design Review process run concurrently and there is only one fee for the two processes.
Therefore, there is no time delay or additional costs involved with a SUP.
To ensure this discretionary permit does not constrain the production of multi-family
housing from an efficiency standpoint, the City will undertake a comprehensive review of
permit processing procedures to identify and implement ways to streamline, as well as

redundancies in various processes and streamline the development review/approval
process.
    Responsible Agency:         Lawndale Community Development Department.
    Financing:                  Department Budgets
    2008-2014 Objectives:       Evaluate permit processing procedures within one year of
                                adoption of the 2008-2014 Housing Element to
                                eliminate/reduce redundancies in various processes. Ongoing

                                throughout the planning period.
Promotion of Equal Housing Opportunity
To adequately meet the housing needs of all segments of the community, the Housing Plan
must include program(s) that promotes housing opportunities for all persons regardless of
race, religion, sex, family size, marital status, ancestry, national origin, color, age, or physical
or mental disability.
Program 19: Fair Housing Program
Fair housing is defined as a condition in which individuals of similar income levels in the
same housing market have a like range of choice available to them regardless of race, color,
ancestry, national origin, religion, sex, disability, marital status, familial status, or any other
arbitrary factor. Continue to contract with a fair housing service provider for fair housing
outreach and education, as well as tenant/landlord dispute resolution. The program will be
advertised through placement of fair housing services brochure at the public counter, the
City website, the local library and the Lawndale Senior Center, as well as periodic
advertisements in the City newsletter and the community newspaper. The City will
continue to refer fair housing complaints to appropriate agencies.
