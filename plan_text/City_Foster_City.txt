PARK AND OPEN SPACE INTRODUCTION
Purpose
This Element of the City of Foster City General Plan addresses the preservation of parks and open space
in the City of Foster City. Since the park lands in the City of Foster City make up much of the City’s open
space resources, the Parks section is combined with the Open Space section. Therefore this document is
divided into two separate sections as follows: Parks and Open Space. The other Elements of the General
Plan concern land use, housing, circulation, noise, conservation and safety.
The City of Foster City is situated along the southwestern coast of the San Francisco Bay, east of San
Mateo. The city is midway between San Francisco and San Jose, and ten minutes from San Francisco
International Airport. Tidal marshes along the bay and rolling hills to the west characterize the region.
As described in the Land Use Element, the City of Foster City is a master planned community first
developed in the early 1960’s. Each residential neighborhood originally had its own school, shopping
center and park. Almost all of the City of Foster City residents have a park within walking distance of their
home.
Vision
The vision of the City of Foster City as presented in the Parks and Open Space Element.
The Parks and Open Space Element of the City of Foster City General Plan have three primary concerns:
    •    Preserve and Improve the Quality of Life within Existing Neighborhoods.
             o Maintain and improve existing resources, parks and open space for the day-to-day and long-
                 term enjoyment of the City of Foster City residents.

     •   Assure the Proper Development of Undeveloped Property.
              o Maintain adequate standards, integrate environment, parks and open space considerations
                  as the City approaches build-out, and evaluate the impacts and appropriateness of new
                  development with environmental conditions and needs of the City.
     •   Assure that Redevelopment of Developed or Underutilized Property Occurs in an Appropriate
         Manner.
              o Establish mitigation measures for any changes inland use as are reasonably necessary to
                  assure the protection of environmental resources, parks, and open space.
State Law Requirements
The legal authority and requirements for the City of Foster City to prepare the City of Foster City General
Plan derive from state law (California Government Code, Section 65300 et. seq.). This document
combines two of the seven elements required in a General Plan: open space and conservation. The Open
Space Element establishes programs to maintain expand and improve the City of Foster City’s open space
and recreation areas. The Conservation Element institutes programs to conserve natural resources such
as the lagoon and canal system. The state requisites with regard to parks are listed in subsection 1.(3) of
the Open Space Element requirements.
Open Space Requirements
An Open Space Element has been required as part of the City of Foster City General Plans since 1970. In
enacting this requirement, it was the intent of the State Legislature to assure that cities and counties
recognize that open space land is a limited and valuable resource and to assure that every city and county
will prepare and carry out an open space plan.
Section 65560 and 65561 of the Government Code specifies the contents of an Open Space Element.
Section 65560. (a) "Local open-space plan" is the open-space element of a county or city general plan
adopted by the board or council, either as the local open-space plan or as the interim local open-space
plan adopted pursuant to Section 65563. (b) "Open-space land" is any parcel or area of land or water that
is essentially unimproved and devoted to an open-space use as defined in this section, and that is
designated on a local, regional or state open-space plan as any of the following:
(1)      Open space for the preservation of natural resources including, but not limited to, areas required for
         the preservation of plant and animal life, including habitat for fish and wildlife species; areas
         required for ecologic and other scientific study purposes; rivers, streams, bays and estuaries; and
         coastal beaches, lakeshores, banks of rivers and streams, and watershed lands.
(2)      Open space used for the managed production of resources, including but not limited to, forest
         lands, rangeland, agricultural lands and areas of economic importance for the production of food or
         fiber; areas required for recharge of groundwater basins; bays, estuaries, marshes, rivers and
         streams which are important for the management of commercial fisheries; and areas containing
         major mineral deposits, including those in short supply.
(3)      Open space for outdoor recreation, including but not limited to, areas of outstanding scenic, historic
         and cultural value; areas particularly suited for park and recreation purposes, including access to
         lakeshores, beaches, and rivers and streams; and areas which serve as links between major
         recreation and open-space reservations, including utility easements, banks of rivers and streams,
         trails, and scenic highway corridors.
Adopted September, 2009                                                                                Page 5-2

(4)      Open space for public health and safety, including, but not limited to, areas which require special
         management or regulation because of hazardous or special conditions such as earthquake fault
         zones, unstable soil areas, flood plains, watersheds, areas presenting high fire risks, areas required
         for the protection of water quality and water reservoirs and areas required for the protection and
         enhancement of air quality.
(5)      Open space in support of the mission of military installations that comprises areas adjacent to
         military installations, military training routes, and underlying restricted airspace that can provide
         additional buffer zones to military activities and complement the resource values of the military
         lands.
(6)      Open space for the protection of places, features, and objects described in Sections 5097.9 and
         5097.993 of the Public Resources Code.
State policy with regard to open space is described in Section 65561 establishes State policy with regard to
open space:
                                                     (1)    That the preservation of open-space land is
                                                            necessary not only for the maintenance of the
                                                            economy of the state, but also for the assurance of
                                                            the continued availability of land for the production
                                                            of food and fiber, for the enjoyment of scenic
                                                            beauty, for recreation and for the use of natural
                                                            resources.
                                                     (2)    That discouraging premature and unnecessary
                                                            conversion of open-space land to urban uses is a
                                                            matter of public interest and will be of benefit to
                                                            urban dwellers because it will discourage non-
                             Edgewater Park
contiguous development patterns which unnecessarily increase the costs of community services to
community residents.
(3)      That the anticipated increase in the population of the state demands that cities, counties, and the
         state at the earliest possible date make definite plans for the preservation of valuable open-space
         land and take positive action to carry out such plans by the adoption and strict administration of
         laws, ordinances, rules and regulations as authorized by this chapter or by other appropriate
         methods.
(4)      That in order to assure that the interests of all its people are met in the orderly growth and
         development of the state and the preservation and conservation of its resources, it is necessary to
         provide for the development by the state, regional agencies, counties and cities, including charter
         cities, of statewide coordinated plans for the conservation and preservation of open-space lands.
(5)      That for these reasons this article is necessary for the promotion of the general welfare and for the
         protection of the public interest in open-space land.
Adopted September, 2009                                                                                 Page 5-3

Clarification of Terminology
The difference between parks and open space is that parks generally have landscaping improvements
such as grass and trees, and recreational equipment such as play apparatuses, basketball courts and/or
sports fields. Open space lands are likely to be unimproved and vacant of structures of any kind.
The advantage of unimproved open space lands is the historical view such lands offer of the original
condition of the area before any development occurred. The value of open space lands increases when
the property is located adjacent to a scenic resource, such as a lake or stream, because these resources
attract people to the site.
The difference between open space and conservation areas is that open space lands might be preserved
for recreational or scenic purposes, while conservation areas might be preserved solely because of the
presence of a specific resource within the area; not necessarily the land itself. In some cases open space
lands could also be conservation areas but the emphasis is on different aspects of the land. For example,
open space land may be preserved for its waterfront scenic qualities while a conservation area may be so
designated because of the presence of an endangered animal or plant species found near the waterfront.
Park: An improved, primarily unobstructed area with landscaping and recreational equipment such as play
apparatuses and/or basketball courts. In some cases, this definition includes property with recreation
buildings or structures. The purpose of parks is to provide opportunities for outdoor recreation and physical
exercise near to residential and employment areas.
Open Space: An open area which is vacant of any structures and is primarily maintained in its natural
condition. In some cases, this definition includes pathways and landscaping; improvements which are
maintained. The provision of open space is intended to offer residents and visitors opportunities for quiet
introspection in a location that provides visual relief from buildings, concrete and noise associated with
urban life.

Parks Background
Existing Resources
The Parks Section of the Parks and Open Space Element concerns the park and recreation facilities in the
City of Foster City administered by the Parks and Recreation Department.
Types of Parks
Passive Parks: The purpose of passive parks is to provide an area for picnics, reading and/or use of limited
playground equipment. The park encourages quiet recreation for all ages and generally is not large
enough for organized sports.
Active Park: The purpose of active parks is to provide sports fields for active play and/or team sports such
as soccer, baseball or football. The park encourages active recreation or team sports for all ages and is
not intended for passive use or for small children to play on playground equipment.
Existing Parks
The City of Foster City has twenty (20) parks within the four square miles comprising the City’s boundaries.
The parks range in size from 0.2 acre to 26 acres for a total of approximately 103 acres of park land. The
table on page 5-6 compares this total to total park acreage in other cities with a comparable population.

The preceding Table also includes the City of Foster City’s main indoor recreation facilities: The
Community Recreation Center and the Brewer Island School campus facilities are used primarily as
meeting rooms for recreation classes and community groups.
Dog Park (a portion of Boat Park), which opened in 1999, is located at Bounty Drive and Foster City
Boulevard. It offers separate off-leash areas for small and large dogs in 20,700 square feet of fenced-in
area. Amenities include drinking fountains for dogs, a shade structure, individual outdoor chairs with
storage area, picnic tables, benches, lighting at night, and 11,000 square feet of synthetic turf. The City of
Foster City also has five parks that serve as off-leash areas. In 1999, four park areas were designated as
off-leash and in 2008, an area at Farragut Park was added. Dogs may be off-leash (but under control)
between the hours of 5 AM and 8 AM at Farragut, Boothbay, Edgewater, and Catamaran Parks. At Sea
Cloud Park, dogs are allowed off-leash from 5 AM to 8 AM on a daily basis in a designated area on the
southeast side of the park, and from 5 AM to 9 AM on Sunday only.
The new 6,800 square foot Teen Center opened in Summer 2009 with a kitchen, activity room, conference
room, study room, multi-purpose room, enclosed courtyard, and recreational facilities such as six tennis
courts, tennis backboard (rebound wall), a half-court basketball court, and a 4,600 square foot above-
ground skate park. The Teen Center provides a safe and positive environment for the City of Foster City’s
youth to have access to educational, social, and recreational programs and services. Rooms are available
for reservation to the general public.
Park Land Acquisition and Standards
Section 66477 of the Government Code (the Quimby Act) authorizes jurisdictions to establish ordinances
requiring residential subdivision developers to provide land or in-lieu fees for park and recreation purposes.
Such land or fees may only be used for public recreation lands; the Quimby Act does not apply to the
provision of private recreational land.
The National Recreation and Park Association has established standards for the number of acres parkland
per 1,000 population. The recommended minimum standard is three acres per 1,000 population. In
jurisdictions where the amount of existing neighborhood and community park land exceeds three acres per
1,000 population, the legislative body may adopt a higher standard not to exceed 5 acres/1,000 persons.
Because the City of Foster City has more than three acres per 1,000, the City of Foster City uses the 5
acre per 1,000 persons standard.
City amenities include both land and water for a total of 103 acres of parks and 212 acres of recreational
waterways. Based on the 2009 population of 30,429, as projected by the California Department of
Finance, the City has an average of 10.35 acres of park and recreation facilities per one thousand City of
Foster City residents. The National Recreation and Park Association recommends ten acres of park land
and other recreation faculties per one thousand population. In the City of Foster City, this includes the 212
acres of recreational waterways and 43 acres of walkways and pedways. This standard is suggested as a
guideline for local communities in their 1990 publication entitled Recreation, Park and Open Space
Standards and Guidelines. The conclusion of this analysis (shown in the following tables) is that overall,
the City of Foster City compares favorably with national standards and comparably sized cities in the San
Francisco Bay Area.

 Comparison with the number of recreation facilities in other cities is another effective way for evaluating the
 adequacy of the City of Foster City facilities. The Table below demonstrates that the City of Foster City
 has more tennis courts than any of the other cities surveyed; more basketball courts than most surveyed
 cities but is one of the only communities that has neither a public gym nor a pool.

 Recreation Programs
 In addition to parks and recreation facilities, the City of Foster City has an extensive recreation program
 that includes many seasonal outdoor activities. New programs are offered quarterly and have doubled in
 number within the last few years. The table below demonstrates the increase in the number of recreation
 programs offered between fiscal year 2002/03 and 2007/08.

Some recreation programs are geared toward certain age groups. Separate crafts classes are offered to
tots, youths, teens and adults. The 55+ Club is a group of senior men and women who gather weekly to
socialize and recreate in the Senior Wing of the William E. Walker Recreation Center. The club also
sponsors full day or longer shopping or recreational excursions.
The most popular and consistently offered programs are preschool, tot crafts, youth and teen dances, art,
adult fitness, sports, special workshops, and holiday special events. Expansion is expected in the following
programs: after school enrichment, preschool, day camps, adult fitness, dance, theater arts and Family
Fun Special Events.
Walkway, Pedway and Bicycle Facilities
In addition to parks, recreation facilities and recreation programs, the City of Foster City has several other
recreational amenities. These include “passive” landscaped walkways, and the pedway/bike path.
Walkways are connector paths between a street and a park, school or other street. Some pedestrian
walkways are completely paved and others have landscaping on either side of the path and one or more
benches. Two of the walkways shown above are particularly long and wide (Pilgrim and Constitution).
These walkways also have play areas for tots in addition to benches and pathway lighting.
The pedway is another unique recreational amenity found in the City of Foster City. The pedway consists
of a concrete pathway constructed atop a levee that runs approximately seven (7) miles, encircling almost
the entire city and providing public access to the San Francisco Bay, Belmont Slough and Marina Lagoon.
Most of the pedway is raised above street level and is separated from streets or developed areas with
landscaping. The paved pathway has viewpoints with benches for viewing of the waterfront. The pedway
can be used for running, walking and biking around the city.
The Bay Trail: Planning for a Recreational Ring Around San Francisco Bay (dated July 1989), which was
prepared by the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG), includes the pedway as part of the
regional trail designated around the Bay. The Bay Trail Plan consists of two components: A proposed
alignment for the Bay Trail and policies to guide the selection of a trail route and implementation of the trail
system. The trail system includes spine trails that encircle the Bay, spur trails that lead to points of interest,
and connector trails that link the trail with recreational, residential and commercial land uses.
Adopted September, 2009                                                                                        Page 5-13

The goal of the Plan is to provide a continuous trail around the Bay which requires the development of a
pathway in some areas (not including the City of Foster City). The Plan designates the City of Foster City
pedway as an existing pathway (along the waterfront) and a connector trail (north/south route through the
interior of the City of Foster City). The pedway qualifies as a Class 1 pathway for bicycles and pedestrians
in the Plan because the pedway is completely separated from motor vehicles.
The City of Foster City Bikeway System Report presents information on bikeway systems and recommends
improvements for implementation in the City of Foster City. The Planning Commission adopted the Report
on November 1, 1990 and the City Council adopted it on January 7, 1991.
The bikeway system consists of a combination of bike paths, bike lanes and bike routes. Bike lanes are
utilized wherever existing roadway widths and traffic configurations allow, as long as the lengths and
locations of the lanes make them safer than continued bike routes would be. Implementation of the system
involves five new bike paths, new bike lanes, new bike routes and upgrading of existing bike paths in two
areas.

Use of Parks and Programs
The purpose of this section is to examine the geographical area served by each park, the use of the parks
by residents and the use of recreation programs by different age groups.
Geographical Area Served by Parks
The Park and Recreation Department uses a standard of 1/4 mile as the typical distance a resident would
walk to the nearest park. In Planning and Development Criteria by De Chiara and Koppelman (1969), a
graphic reference of current urban design standards, the suggested radius is 0.5 mile for the area served
by a park. For the City of Foster City the 1/4 mile radius is more appropriate because it reflects the City of
Foster City’s heritage as a planned community.
Map GP-11 identifies City of Foster City parks. The map does not differentiate between “active” and
“passive” parks; residents who live closest to an “active, community” park were assumed to use that park
for “passive, neighborhood” uses like walking, reading or “picnicking”. The map illustrates that almost all
the City of Foster City residents have a park or a private recreation facility within walking distance of their
residence. People not within walking distance of a park are within walking distance of the waterfront.
Public access is provided to the waterfront within private developments in some areas and the city’s
pedway provides access to the waterfront along the periphery of the city.
                                                                                                  Gateshead Park
Daily and Seasonal Use of Facilities
Understanding use patterns of parks and recreation facilities provides an indication of which facilities may
need improvement or expansion. This section includes daily and seasonal use of outdoor facilities for team
sports or free use of courts and fields, and indoor facilities for recreation programs.
The Parks and Recreation Department has determined which recreation programs are most popular by
program evaluations, enrollment statistics and public requests. The Department offers these programs
year round. Enrollment figures approximate the portion of the City of Foster City population served each
season by recreation programs.

Use of Facilities by Age Groups
Recreational programs can best serve the needs of the population by offering programs geared to certain
age groups. For example, a population with a significant number of people 65 years or older may have
programs designed specifically for seniors, under the assumption that people would enjoy meeting and
associating with their peers in a recreation setting. The Table below shows the recreation programs
offered for various age groups.

Needs Determination
In order to provide for future recreation and park needs, it is necessary to examine the demographics in a
community. The demographic statistics considered in this section include: (1) type of housing; (2)
projected City of Foster City population (total); and (3) age distribution.
Relevant Demographic Criteria
Apartment, condominium and townhouse residents generally have less private recreation space than
residents of a single family dwelling, and therefore may be more likely to use public parks for their
recreation needs. However some multiple family projects provide recreational facilities for resident use
only. These facilities range from swimming pools and recreation centers to small, open areas with grass
and benches. The figure below indicates the current distribution of single and multiple family housing in

   *Reason for loss of units from 1990 to 2000: The City of Foster City disagreed with US Census
Since very little vacant land remains in the City of Foster City that would be appropriate for single family
development, the majority of the expected growth in housing units are estimated to be multiple family
dwellings. The City of Foster City’s policy is for all future multi-family development to provide a significant
amount of on-site open space/recreation facilities, and park-in-lieu fees to be used to improve existing
public parks. In this manner, no significant impact from the new residents is expected on the public park
system.
The national and state standards for park land per 1000 population offer reasonable guidance for the
purposes of anticipating the effect of an increase in population on total park acreage.
Assuming the City of Foster City continues to have a total of 103 acres of parkland and 212 acres of
waterways, and the City of Foster City population reaches a high of 31,853 residents, the City of Foster
City would still exceed the minimum standard recommended by the National Recreation and Park
Association (6-10 acres/1000 population) with 9.9 acres of park and recreation facilities per 1,000 persons.
Although the total population in the City of Foster City increased from 28,176 in 1990 to 28,803 in 2000 and
to 30,429 in 2009, the number of people less than 20 years old decreased. Within the age groups under
20, the age distribution has become more even since 1980, when there were more teenagers than children

under 10 years old. The decrease in the proportion of children and teenagers in the community was
thought to result in a need for fewer recreation programs and classes geared to this age group in the
1990’s, but to date there is still a large need for youth classes.
The adult population continues to be the largest group and has grown significantly since 1980. The City of
Foster City could expect a resulting increase in demand for adult recreation programs, adult sport teams
and requests for membership in the 55+ Club.
Based on the 2000 U.S. Census, it is estimated that about 14% of all households in the City of Foster City
are headed by women. The percent of females in the labor force (aged 16 years and over) was about 64%
in 2007, according to the U.S. Census. Women with children under 18 are more likely to work today than
in 1990. Assuming this trend continues the demand for child care and after-school programs should be
expected to increase.

Recreation Program Needs
The Parks and Recreation Department uses two indicators to determine whether or not demand has
increased for recreation programs: waiting lists and telephone inquiries. The programs listed below are
identified as needs in the Parks and Recreation Master Plan and have waiting lists and multiple inquiries
about them:
Preschool program: This program is 100% full every session. In 2008 the class for 3 year olds had a 10
person waiting list, the class for 4 year olds has a 5 person waiting list and the Department is still receiving
inquiries about the programs. The Recreation Department has expanded the preschool program as much
as possible while still accommodating other programs.
After-school programs: Although the current after-school programs do not extend beyond Wednesdays,
the Recreation Department is always looking for ways to offer additional youth activities. The Enrichment

program takes place on Wednesdays from 12:30 PM to 2:30 PM in order to accommodate the parents’
needs for extended care on the school district minimum day. Other programs that the City of Foster City
parents look to for after school needs are the Annex program which is the School Districts afterschool
enrichment program and the Chinese School and Indian School which is operated by the Bright Horizons
Day School vendor a contract with the School District.
Indoor sports: The City of Foster City has one multi-purpose facility that can be used for indoor sports
such as volleyball. This facility is the Brewer Island Elementary School Gymnasium. It is a joint use facility
between the City of Foster City and the San Mateo/Foster City School District that is used by the City six
days a week. Volleyball classes and leagues consistently fill up, and there is still a high demand for adult
basketball leagues and youth indoor soccer. The Parks and Recreation Department can set up two
volleyball or two basketball courts in the gym at any one time.
Community meeting space: Community meeting space needs are/or will generally be met through the
use of meeting rooms in the City of Foster City Community Center, the William E. Walker Recreation
Center and the Senior Wing, and the Teen Center. The Department's recreation programming expansion
has somewhat limited the availability of community rental space at the Community Center and Recreation
Center, but rarely poses problems due to the amount of space. The 3,500 square foot Lagoon Room and
1,900 square foot Wind Room provide ample space for large functions, or community meetings.

Tennis play/tournaments: The fifteen tennis courts available in the City of Foster City play host to public
drop-in play, instructional classes, private lessons, club match play and two large tournaments each year.
The City of Foster City recently added lights to five courts to bring the total number of lit courts to nine, and
has no plans at this time for additional tennis courts.
Adult sports: The City of Foster City has only one lighted softball facility which is not adequate for the
projected population of 31,470. The adult softball program has 84 men and women’s teams and 1,260
participants annually from April through October. The City of Foster City can accommodate 42 teams per
program session and the Department turns away an average of 4 teams per session.
Swim Program: The Department is currently working with the Peninsula Jewish Community Center to
obtain the use of their pools for a swim programs. The summer 2008 PJCC program offered swimming
programs to local youths and adults.

Improvements to Park Facilities
The Parks and Recreation Department has determined that the City of Foster City has an adequate
amount of park land but needs certain amenities in existing parks, walkways and on the pedway.
Sources of Funding for Improvements
Funding sources for Park and Recreation facilities include grants, park in-lieu fees received from new
residential development and City of Foster City funds. Park in-lieu fees and State grants may be utilized to
fund improvements and development of new and existing park facilities. Interest accruing on park in-lieu
fees already collected may be utilized to fund the maintenance of existing facilities.
Without a significant payment of park in-lieu fees and/or funding from outside sources (such as
redevelopment agency fund, grant funds), the City of Foster City’s ability to fund improvements will be
limited. Available funding will be allocated according to the priority and timing of new construction projects.
Maintenance of Existing Resources
The City of Foster City Parks Maintenance system is divided into three geographical areas: 1) east parks,
2) west parks and 3) playfields/medians. Shell Boulevard is the dividing line between the east and west
areas. The playfields referred to in the third area are located at Sea Cloud and Port Royal Parks.
The bathrooms, trash receptacles and tot lots are checked regularly in each park with these facilities.
Mowing and preparation of sports fields occurs once a week all year except the winter when the parks are
mowed once every three weeks. Preparation of the sports fields includes watering, and checking of the
lines (e.g. baseball in-field lines). Bathrooms are washed twice a month year-round. Tennis courts are
washed once a month from April through October. Carpentry and irrigation systems are checked
periodically for to determine maintenance requirements.
Summary
The goals, policies and programs applicable to this section are located at the end of this document. These
provide implementation guidance for future City of Foster City action with regard to maintenance and
improvement of park and recreation facilities.
It is intended that future City of Foster City actions with regard to park and recreation facilities will refer to
the Parks section of the Parks and Open Space Element of the City of Foster City General Plan and
demonstrate that proposed actions are consistent with applicable policies of the City of Foster City General
Plan.

Open Space Background
Purpose
The Open Space section of the Parks and Open Space Element concerns vacant land in the City of Foster
City which is primarily maintained in its natural condition. In some cases this land includes landscaped
areas which are maintained.
The City of Foster City’s existing open space resources include: (1) existing permanent open spaces
ranging from waterways and open spaces within developments to landscaped areas along City of Foster
City streets; (2) short-term open spaces that may be developed in the future; and, (3) possible future
permanent open spaces. The purposes of these distinctions are to link future open space with existing
open space, and to recognize potential open space preservation opportunities for vacant land that is
ultimately intended for development (according to the City of Foster City General Plan designations).
Waterways Open Space Resources
The largest and most unique permanent open spaces in the City of Foster City are the waterways. These
include San Francisco Bay, Belmont Slough, Marina Lagoon, the City of Foster City Lagoon and Canal
system, and Vintage Park.

Description: The Bay is the primary source of water for most of the City of Foster City’s waterways and
constitutes the north and northeastern boundaries of the City of Foster City. Uses of Lower San Francisco
Bay water include navigation, active water recreation, passive water recreation, ocean commercial and
sport fishing, wildlife habitat, preservation of rare and endangered species, fish migration, shellfish
harvesting and estuarine habitat. The pedway system along the Bay provides recreational opportunities
such as boating, fishing, walking, observation of wildlife, and biking.

                                                   vicinity.
Surrounding Land Uses: Land uses adjacent to Belmont Slough include residences and parks. The land
in adjacent Redwood City is mostly vacant.
Views: The pedway system affords the best views of the Belmont Slough and provides an opportunity to
view bird species that frequent the Slough.
Importance: The Slough extends the waterfront amenities of the San Francisco Bay and provides a
natural habitat for various wildlife species.

Marina Lagoon
Description: The Marina Lagoon establishes the southwestern boundary of the City of Foster City and
was originally a slough similar to the Belmont Slough described above. The City of San Mateo converted it
to a lagoon for storm drainage retention purposes and to serve as a boating area.
Surrounding Land Uses: Surrounding land uses are primarily residential in both the City of San Mateo
and the City of Foster City, with the exception of Highway 101 along the southern portion of the Lagoon
and Shoreview Park/Recreation Center in the City of San Mateo.
Views: The pedway and East Hillsdale Boulevard, especially at the Bridge, provide the best views of the
Marina Lagoon in the City of Foster City.
Importance: The Marina Lagoon is an important visual and recreational amenity for the City of Foster City
because it provides frontage along the water for the western boundary of the City of Foster City along Port
Royal Avenue.
The City of Foster City Lagoon and Canal System
Description: The City of Foster City Lagoon was entirely man-made and is used as a storm drainage
retention basin with gates at the south end and pumps at the north end. Surface drainage is collected and
drained into the lagoon system where it is discharged by gravity or pumped into San Francisco Bay at the
north end of the lagoon. Water from the Bay is taken into the lagoon system through tide gates located at
the southeast end of the lagoon.
As a part of the original development of the City of Foster City, a system of islands and canals were
constructed in order to increase the number of residential lots with lagoon frontage. The lagoon supports a
number of marine organisms and serves as resting and feeding sites for waterfowl.
The recreational uses of the lagoon system include boating, windsurfing and swimming, along with passive
recreational uses which are enhanced by the many views provided from waterfront land uses. Bridges
were constructed to accommodate most sailboats. Power boats are restricted to only electrically-powered
motors on the City of Foster City Lagoon and Canals.
Surrounding Land Uses: The primary land uses adjacent to the lagoon system are residential, although
some parks and shopping centers also have lagoon frontage.
Views: Views of the City of Foster City Lagoon system are provided from the City of Foster City Parks (Sea
Cloud Park, Leo Ryan Park, Gull Park and Marlin Park) and individual residences. The best view of the
system is provided from an airplane.
Importance: The City of Foster City Lagoon and Canal system significantly contributes to the City of
Foster City’s open space network because it extends waterfront amenities to the interior of the city rather
than just along its boundaries. The form and character of the City of Foster City are defined by the
waterways (i.e., the Bay, Lagoon, Canals and Bridges) which help to distinguish the City of Foster City from
other communities, particularly as seen from an airplane. The waterways create a sense of place and a
recreation-oriented image for the City of Foster City as much or more than the San Francisco Bay.
The protection of the lagoon system is also a “historical preservation” effort given the original land planning
of the City of Foster City. The plan for the City of Foster City was to create as many single family detached

residential units along the waterfront as possible. These units would have direct access to the water for
aesthetic, recreational purposes in addition to enhancing property values and creating a “sense of
openness” for the property even though the lot sizes are small by suburban standards.
In order to protect the lagoon system and waterfront properties, the City of Foster City requires a use
permit for room additions on the waterfront. The use permit procedure allows property owners adjacent to
and across the water from the proposed addition to comment on the proposal.
Public Open Space Within Developments
This category includes permanent open spaces that were set aside during the development of surrounding
property. Most of these spaces were established as part of a Planned Development (PD) District. The
projects listed below exemplify public open spaces provided within commercial developments
Metro Center Town Green
Description: This one acre park is privately owned but has a public access easement over it. The park is
circular, surrounded by a public pathway, is landscaped and hosts outdoor art. The lawn provides a
passive recreation area for workers and shoppers to have lunch, rest and/or watch noon concerts.
Surrounding Land Uses: The Green is surrounded by high-intensity urban uses such as the existing
Metro (Office) Tower, neighborhood retail uses, and proposed office buildings.
Views: The Town Green is currently visible from the office tower, retail stores and adjacent planned
office/retail uses.
Importance: This open space provides a green area amidst a dense urban business and residential
center. Its central location near highly populated areas increases the park’s accessibility to the community.
Another key design feature of the park is the linkage it provides between Leo Ryan Park (across East
Hillsdale Boulevard to the south) and Metro Center Boulevard and its office and retail uses.
Vintage Park Lake and Plazas
Description: This artificial water system was constructed as part of the Vintage Park development. The
lake has a public access easement over it and also serves as a drainage catch basin. The Vintage Park
development also includes several small open areas near the existing lake. Most of the open areas are
small plazas except for the green area and pathway around the lake. The circular green area provides
opportunities for passive recreation within the development. A pedestrian pathway links these open areas
with the remainder of the development and with the Vintage Park Lake.
Surrounding Land Uses: The lake and plazas are surrounded by research and development, and office
land uses.
Views: Several of the Gilead campus and Vintage Park buildings are or will be oriented to provide views of
the lake.
Importance: The value of these open space areas is to provide visual and recreational amenities within
the development for workers and future residents. The inclusion of the lake links Vintage Park with other
the City of Foster City water bodies, consistent with the City of Foster City’s water-oriented image.

Importance: This open space provides a green area amidst a dense urban business and residential
center. It is located adjacent to a highly populated area and provides open space for the workers and
nearby residents to have lunch or rest.
Pilgrim/Triton Park
Description: This future 2.3 acre park will be developed as part of the Pilgrim-Triton General
Development Plan approved by the City Council on April 21, 2008. At build-out the development will
include up to 730 residential units and 296,000 square feet of commercial uses. The park will be privately
owned and will have a public access easement over it. The park will be hexagonal in shape, surrounded
by a public pathway, landscaped and will have a tot-lot, bocce courts and a lawn area. The lawn area will
provide an area for workers and shoppers to have a meal, rest and/or play on. The other amenities will
provide recreational opportunities for residents, shoppers, workers and the public.
Surrounding Land Uses: The Pilgrim/triton Park will surrounded by high-intensity urban uses such as the
existing light industrial and office buildings and proposed multiple story office and residential buildings.
Views: The Pilgrim/Triton Park will be visible from the existing light industrial and office buildings and
adjacent planned office/retail uses.
Importance: The future park will provide passive and active recreation amenities for residents, workers,
shoppers and the public.

Two of these private residential open spaces are described below for illustrative purposes:
Longwater Common Lot: Parcel D on Santa Cruz Lane in the Longwater development is a landscaped
lot that provides public access to the lagoon southwest of Sea Cloud Park. The parcel is surrounded by
single-family residences, has a bench and a small paved area, and provides views to the northeast and
southwest toward the water.
Alden Park Common Lot: A common lot is located in the Alden Park development on Cayman Lane, just
north of the intersection of Cayman and Tender Lanes, at the terminus of Liberty Lane. The parcel is
surrounded by single-family houses, is landscaped and includes a tot lot and benches. This common lot
exclusively serves the Alden Park development and provides open space in order to mitigate the density of
the project.

PG&E Power Line Easements
Power line easements are required to be free of structures so that the power lines may be modified or
maintained at any time. When utility easements follow major roadways, the landscaping in these
easements adds substantially to their appearance. The result is a green open area underneath the power
lines similar to landscaped setbacks required between a street and building, or to the recreation areas of
some residential projects.
An attractive example of the landscaping/recreation possibilities underneath power lines is visible along
Foster City Boulevard at the Foster’s Landing Condominium project. Such landscaping reduces the visual
impact of the power lines on the streetscape.
The utility easement in the City of Foster City follows Foster City Boulevard from Beach Park Boulevard to
State Route 92 and then veers northwest across a rectangular vacant lot off of Foster City Boulevard, and
through the Vintage Park development. Vintage Park was designed so that only open space areas and
parking lots would be within the utility easement. Other utility easements may not provide passive or active
open spaces but do provide visual relief from development (such as the easements near the Baffin
Court/Pitcairn Drive area).
Street Medians
Street medians significantly improve the open space qualities of urban streets. The medians divide large
expanses of pavement and add scenic value to the street for pedestrians, motorists, and inhabitants of
adjacent buildings.
The City of Foster City has a median strip planting program along major roadways in Metro Center,
residential neighborhoods, industrial areas and bridges (see Map GP-14). The Parks and Recreation
Department, in conjunction with the Planning/Code Enforcement Division, developed a Plan in 1987
requiring the planting of undeveloped medians and the replacement of inappropriate or deteriorated
landscaping. The program establishes a residential, industrial and downtown theme for median.
Building Setback Areas
A building setback area refers to the minimum distance between a reference line (usually a property line)
and a building or a portion thereof, as required by an ordinance or code. The purpose is to provide open
space which is unobstructed and unoccupied from the ground upward in order to reduce the visual density
of buildings as seen from the street.
Building setbacks also provide light and air between and into buildings, and offer visual relief from other
buildings as seen from inside. Usually setback areas provide landscaping in order to improve the
appearance of the site, its buildings and the streetscape.
Virtually every zoning district requires a minimum building setback from the front property line. The table
below demonstrates the range of front yard setbacks required in various zoning districts.
Adopted September 2009                                                                               Page 5-31

Waterfront Setbacks
Setbacks from the waterfront increase the open space quality of the lagoon or canal system by adding to
the total area free of structures. Such setbacks also reduce the visual density of residences along the
waterfront by providing an open area near the bulkhead which can be used for outdoor entertainment.
Additionally, setbacks reduce the likelihood of impairing waterfront views from adjacent buildings. As seen
from within a building, setbacks provide light, air and visual relief from adjacent structures.
Guidelines For Ranking Potential Future Open Space
To analyze the ability of a vacant property to meet the City of Foster City’s open space needs, guidelines
have been developed which apply to the three needs listed above. The table at the end of the discussion
ranks property for short term or future/possible open space purposes using the guidelines. In determining
the value of land as open space, the City of Foster City will consider the following questions to guide
decisions:
Aesthetics
1. Would the preservation of this site protect an important visual backdrop or edge of the City of Foster
    City?
2. Would the preservation of this site protect any unique site features?
3. Would the preservation of this site protect a shoreline?
Adopted September 2009                                                                                   Page 5-32

Significance
1. Would the preservation of this site protect property with importance to the community as whole?
2. Would the preservation of this site protect property with importance to an adjoining area?
Proximity of Other Open Spaces
1. Would the preservation of this site allow the combination of existing or proposed open spaces?
2. Would the preservation of this site provide an opportunity to enlarge an existing open space?
Passive Recreation Potential
1.  Would the preservation of this site protect a site with quiet, peaceful surroundings?
2.  Would the preservation of this site protect a site with scenic views?
3.  Would the preservation of this site protect property without organized sports or recreation facilities?
4.  Would the preservation of this site protect a site with pathways or the potential for pathways? Benches?
5.  Would the preservation of this site protect a site with appropriate areas for observation points and
    educational exhibits?
Potential For Development with Revenue Producing Land Uses
1. Would the preservation of this site eliminate desirable property for development?
2. Would the preservation of this site eliminate the potential to combine open space with other land uses?
Possible Funding Sources
1. What sources of funding are available for the preservation of this site?
2. Could the preservation of this site occur as part of an adjacent private development?
Environmental Resources
1. Would the preservation of this site protect sensitive wildlife and/or flora habitat?
2. Would the preservation of this site protect unimproved areas in their original, natural habitat for an
    historical perspective of conditions prior to development of the community?
Shorter-Term Open Space With Potential Long-Term Open Space Value
The open spaces included in this section do not have applications pending for development and may be
appreciated as open space until development occurs. They currently provide an open space resource and,
when (or if) developed, can establish areas preserved for long-term open space value to the community.
Once the guidelines have been examined to determine whether all of or a portion of a particular site is
appropriate for open space preservation, particular improvements can be implemented to enhance the
open space amenities of that site. The implementation of these techniques will achieve the stated needs
with regard to open space resources in the City of Foster City. Funding mechanisms will be examined in
conjunction with individual proposals. Below is a table and description of the relative values, views,
surrounding land uses and importance of key properties, along with recommended open space
improvements relevant to that site.

City of Foster City Owned Site on the North Side of East Third Avenue
Description: This site includes 40 acres of submerged land and shoreline designated open space. Ten
acres located along the bay are designated for open space to ensure public shoreline access. The
remaining 30 acres are also designated open space beyond a fill limit line according to an agreement
between the City and the Bay Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC). It is intended that
these open space lands be preserved in their natural state and that opportunities to enhance their wetland
value be pursued.
Surrounding Land Uses: Please refer to the discussion under "Shorter-Term Open Space With Potential
Long-Term Open Space Value".
Views: Please refer to the discussion under "Shorter-Term Open Space With Potential Long-Term Open

Proposed Marina Site
Description: Map GP-12 shows the marina proposals. The site occupies 45.8 acres of dry land adjacent
to Beach Park Boulevard and 21.3 acres of submerged land in San Francisco Bay. Some of the Marina
site is within the 100' shoreline band regulated by BCDC, which must remain open space with public
access to the waterfront.
The water portion of the site is existing bay tidelands characterized by a shoreline band of salt marsh, tidal
flats and submerged lands. The upland area is filled land which varies approximately between elevations
9.3 feet above Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) and 12.8 feet MLLW at points along the dike which
generally borders the west edge of the site. The majority of the site is occupied with annual grasses and
weeds, with a few coyote bush shrubs. The shoreline of the site contains salt marsh habitat.
Surrounding Land Uses: The San Francisco Bay borders this site to the north and east with residential
uses across Beach Park Boulevard to the northwest and the Belmont Slough to the south.
Views: The most attractive characteristics of this site are its open spaces with sweeping views of the Bay,
the Belmont Slough, and the San Mateo Bridge. These views are somewhat marred by the presence of
Pacific Gas and Electric Company transmission towers and high tension lines which pass just south west of
the southwesterly site boundary and continue to the southeast as far as the eye can see. The northeastern
portion of the site offers an unobstructed view of the Bird Island Wildlife Area.
Importance: This site has significant open space opportunities because of its waterfront access, existing
walking/bike path, and variety of plant and animal life habitat. The 100' shoreline band is required by
BCDC to remain as open space.
Suggested Improvements Should the Site Remain Designated as a Marina:
(1)      Develop open space in accordance with the San Francisco Bay Plan.
(2)      Improve passive recreation opportunities by installing benches, landscaping and observation areas
         within the shoreline band.
(3)      Install paved pathways with handrails to improve the accessibility of the shoreline band.
(4)      Determine if any portions of the site qualify as wetland areas as designated by the State and
         improve or enhance any such areas in accordance with State guidelines.
(5)      Use site planning techniques to cluster any buildings and development density away from the
         wildlife refuge and any designated wetland areas.
Werder Pier
Description: The Werder Pier site contains an unpaved parking lot serving the Pier and pedway, a dike
protecting the shoreline and the Pier itself. The Pier was constructed from the Old San Mateo-Hayward
Bridge.
Adopted September 2009                                                                                  Page 5-35

This property does not contain marshlands but does contain a productive shellfish bed which the San
Mateo County Health Department and California Regional Water Quality Control Board have taken
measures to protect.
The County of San Mateo prepared a Draft Recreation Plan for this site dated November 16, 1989. The
proposed design involved adding a rest room, improving the parking lot, fixing up the pier and adding
landscaping.
Surrounding Land Uses: The San Francisco Bay and the San Mateo Bridge are both north and east of
this site with residential uses to the south and commercial uses to the west.
Views: The site offers attractive views to the southeast of the City of Foster City shoreline, to the south of
the City of Foster City structures and Santa Cruz Mountains beyond, and to the north of the San Mateo
Bridge (State Route 92), San Francisco and northern mountain ranges.
Importance: The value of this site is its direct shoreline access and corresponding views, and recreational
use for fishing and walking. The open space opportunities are somewhat compromised by the proximity of
the San Mateo Bridge.
Suggested Improvements:
(1)      Use site planning techniques to cluster recreational improvements away from designated wetland
         areas.
(2)      Improve wetland areas in accordance with state and federal regulations to enhance the natural
         characteristics of the wetlands.
(3)      Develop open space in accordance with the San Francisco Bay Plan.
(4)      Improve passive recreation opportunities by installing benches, landscaping and observation areas
         within the shoreline band.
(5)      Install paved pathways with handrails to improve the accessibility of the shoreline band and fishing
         pier.
Sea Cloud Park/Phase II
Description: The unimproved 20 acres of the Sea Cloud park site is diked, does not have an outlet to
Belmont Slough and is not subject to tidal action. The site contains a low lying area that serves as a
seasonal pond, collecting storm water runoff during the rainy periods of the year. Shorebirds and waterfowl
often make intensive use of these seasonally flooded, unvegetated salt/mudflats.
The major detracting elements are the power transmission lines and poles which are in the vicinity of the
study area, and the barren and unkept condition of the vacant filled lands.
Along the site’s south edge, Belmont Slough, the estuarine vegetation which borders it and the wildlife
which inhabit it, constitute a major asset which can be enjoyed from the unpaved pathway along the levee.
Adopted September 2009                                                                                Page 5-36

Surrounding Land Uses: The Bayfront Condominium development is located north of this site with
Belmont Slough to the south and east, and the Alden Park development and Sea Cloud Park Phase I to the
west.
Views: The most dramatic views from the site are looking west toward the hills of San Mateo. Along the
eastern portion of the site, the Belmont Slough provides visual interest.
Importance: The views, waterfront access and variety of plant and animal life provide significant open
space opportunities for this property.
Suggested Improvements Whether or not Permits are Received to Expand the Park:
1.       Develop open space in accordance with the San Francisco Bay Plan.
2.       Improve passive recreation opportunities by installing benches, landscaping and observation areas
         within the shoreline band.
3.       Install paved pathways with handrails to improve the accessibility of the shoreline band.
4.       Determine if any portions of the site qualify as wetland areas as designated by the state and federal
         agencies and improve or enhance any such areas in accordance with state and federal guidelines.

PARKS AND OPEN SPACE GOALS
Introduction
The background section of this Element describes the City of Foster City’s existing recreational facilities,
and the character of existing park facilities and open space areas. This section of the Element draws upon
the background information to establish goals and policies for future expansion and maintenance of the
City of Foster City’s recreation and open space opportunities.
The goals and policies set forth below will guide future City of Foster City actions regarding the
management of parks and natural resources with specific implementation measures or programs. The
programs are actions to be performed by the City of Foster City in order to implement the Parks and Open
Space Element.
The time period envisioned for the goals, policies, and implementation measures is 15 years. This time
period should include build-out of the City of Foster City and some expansion of the City of Foster City’s
open space and recreation areas.
PC-A Provide Sufficient and Diverse Recreational Opportunities
         Provide sufficient and diverse recreational opportunities for all the City of Foster City residents
         through the development of new recreation facilities as needed, given available funding and
         support, and the construction of additional park amenities in existing parks and elsewhere in
         locations where deficiencies have been identified or opportunities occur.
 Adopted September, 2009                                                                              Page 5-39

Conservation Introduction                                                         Chapter 8: Conservation Element
CONSERVATION INTRODUCTION
Purpose
This Element of the General Plan addresses the preservation of conservation of natural resources in Foster
City. Foster City is situated along the southwestern coast of San Francisco Bay, east of San Mateo. The
city is midway between San Francisco and San Jose, and ten minutes from San Francisco International
Airport. Tidal marshes along the bay and rolling hills to the west characterize the region.
As described in the Land Use Element, the City is a master planned community first developed in the early
1960’s. Each residential neighborhood originally had its own school, shopping center and park. Almost all
Foster City residents have a park within walking distance of their home.
Clarification of Terminology
The difference between parks and open space is that parks generally have landscaping improvements
such as grass and trees, and recreational equipment such as play apparatuses, basketball courts and/or
sports fields. Open space lands are likely to be unimproved and vacant of structures of any kind.
The advantage of unimproved open space lands is the historical view such lands offer of the original
condition of the area before any development occurred. The value of open space lands increases when
the property is located adjacent to a scenic resource, such as a lake or stream, because these resources
attract people to the site.
The difference between open space and conservation areas is that open space lands might be preserved
for recreational or scenic purposes, while conservation areas might be preserved solely because of the
presence of a specific resource within the area, not necessarily the land itself. In some cases open space
lands could also be conservation areas but the emphasis is on different aspects of the land. For example,
open space land may be preserved for its waterfront scenic qualities while a conservation area may be so
designated because of the presence of an endangered animal or plant species found near the waterfront.
Park: An improved, primarily unobstructed area with landscaping and recreational equipment such as play
apparatuses and/or basketball courts. In some cases this definition includes property with recreation
buildings or structures. The purpose of parks is to provide opportunities for outdoor recreation and physical
exercise near to residential and employment areas.
Open Space: An open area which is vacant of any structures and is primarily maintained in its natural
condition. In some cases this definition includes pathways and landscaping, improvements which are
maintained. The provision of open space is intended to offer residents and visitors opportunities for quiet
introspection in a location that provides visual relief from buildings, concrete and noise associated with
urban life.
Conservation: The preservation and maintenance of a resource for the enjoyment of future generations
such as water, air and energy systems. The preservation of these resources is concerned with the quality
and quantity of the resource. Conservation areas sustain a rare species and/or natural resource that
cannot be restored or replaced. The purpose of conservation areas is to provide a protected location
where the properties of a natural resource may be observed and enjoyed without risk of endangering the
resource.
Special Note: The Conservation Element was split from the former Parks, Open Space and Conservation Element in
                   September 2009. There were no textual changes to the Element, which will be updated in 2010-
                   2011.

State Law Requirements for Conservation Elements
The legal authority and requirements for Foster City to prepare the General Plan derive from state law
(California Government Code, Section 65300 et. seq.). The Conservation Element institutes programs to
conserve natural resources such as the lagoon and canal system.
Conservation Element Requirements
A Conservation Element has been required as part of local general plans since 1970. The Conservation
Element overlaps those categories of the Open Space Element that deal with “open space for the
preservation of natural resources” and “open space for the managed production of resources”.
Conservation should prevent the wasteful destruction and neglect of Foster City’s natural resources,
particularly scarce resources. This philosophy is consistent with the intent of the California Environment
Quality Act (CEQA) and National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA).
Section 65302(d) of the Government Code specifies the contents of a Conservation Element:
A conservation element shall address the conservation, development, and utilization of natural resources
including water and its hydraulic force, forests, soils, rivers and other waters, harbors, fisheries, wildlife,
minerals, and other natural resources. That portion of the conservation element including waters shall be
developed in coordination with any countywide water agency and with all district and city agencies which
have developed, served, controlled or conserved water for any purpose for the county of city for which the
plan is prepared. The conservation element may also cover:
(1) The reclamation of land and waters
(2) Prevention and control of the pollution of streams and other waters
(3) Regulation of the use of land in stream channels and other areas required for the accomplishment of
     the conservation plan
(4) Prevention, control and correction of the erosion of soils, beaches, and shores
(5) Protection of watersheds
(6) The location, quantity and quality of the rock, sand and gravel resources
(7) Flood control
The Vision of Foster City as Presented in the Conservation Element
The Conservation Element of the Foster City General Plan has three primary concerns:
•   Preserve and Improve the Quality of Life within Existing Neighborhoods.
    Maintain and improve existing resources, parks and open space for the day-to-day and long-term
    enjoyment of Foster City residents.
•   Assure the Proper Development of Undeveloped Property.
    Maintain adequate standards, integrate environmental, parks and open space considerations as the
    City approaches build-out, and evaluate the impacts and appropriateness of new development with
    environmental conditions and needs of the City.

Conservation Background
Purpose
The Conservation section of the Parks, Open Space and Conservation Element concerns the preservation
of natural resources such as water, air and energy. Conservation of natural resources is necessary to
insure their availability to future generations.
The conservation issues that will be discussed in this document are human life-sustaining elements, wildlife
habitat, and recycling of renewable resources. Human life-sustaining elements include air, water and
energy. Wildlife habitat refers to areas within the city which provide feeding or resting areas for wildlife
such as birds. Recycling of renewable resources includes aluminum cans, glass, paper, newspaper, tin
and some plastic.
Human Life-Sustaining Elements
Water Availability
Existing Conditions: The water supply and distribution system must provide sufficient capacity to meet
domestic, commercial, and industrial user demands as well as satisfy fire protection requirements. These
components of demand are functions of land use, population density and per capita water consumption.
Residential water use varies with climate, lot size, system pressure, metering practices, water rates, and
the standard of living in the community, as well as other factors.
Water service in Foster City is provided by the Estero Municipal Improvement District (EMID). The
California Legislature created EMID in 1960 and granted this public agency most of the governing powers
associated with an incorporated municipality, except the powers to zone and approve development and
certain police powers. When Foster City was incorporated in April 1971, EMID remained a separate legal
entity and continues to provide water and sewer service to Foster City and water service to Mariner’s
Island.
The City of San Francisco supplies all water for EMID and the City of Foster City. The existing water line
from San Francisco enters Foster City along E. Third Avenue. A second emergency water supply line from
the Belmont Water District was recently completed to enter Foster City from the south across the Belmont
Slough. A third water supply line is proposed to come from Redwood City/Belmont.
Currently Foster City has two water storage tanks for emergencies which hold approximately four-million
gallons of water each. Construction of a third, four-million gallon tank is proposed to be completed in the
near future. Foster City has no supplemental water supplies such as wells or reclaimed water for use in
irrigation.
Table 1 in the Technical Appendix of the Conservation Section demonstrates the amount of water
purchased each month from San Francisco between 1977-1989. Foster City receives more water from
San Francisco in the summer than in the winter due to increased watering of landscaping and water-
recreation in the summer.
Desired Conditions: The recent droughts of 1976-77, 1987-92 and possible future droughts have forced
many water agencies throughout the State to undertake stringent conservation measures, and have
significantly constrained EMID’s water resources. In order to continue to provide water service to Foster
City and Mariner’s Island, EMID must maintain its commitment to strict conservation measures.

Conservation Background                                                            Chapter 8: Conservation Element
Conservation Techniques: One method of actively conserving the amount of water consumed in a
jurisdiction is reducing “unaccounted for” water. “Unaccounted for” water is the difference between water
purchased and water sold. Some of the causes for unaccounted water could be:
(1) Water system leakage
(2) Firefighting and firefighting training
(3) Water main flushing (removing sediment from the water system)
(4) Unauthorized water use from hydrants and other unmetered connections
(5) Water meter error
(6) Billing error
On-going efforts such as the following can minimize or significantly reduce these problems:
(1)    Water audit - a program involving the regular testing and repair of water meters.
(2)    Leak detection survey - a program involving testing and repair of pipe joints, bolts and fittings, and
       “listening” for underground leaks with mechanical/acoustical devices.
(3)    Valve exercising and main flushing program - a program involving regular operation of valves to
       prevent “freezing up” of the mechanism and main flushing to remove sediment from the system and
       minimze “dirty” water which may result when a main breaks or high flows are required for fire fighting.
These programs are further described in the Technical Appendix of the Conservation Section, within the
“Water Conservation Management Plan” (undated).
Other conservation techniques require personal initiative from property owners with regard to landscaping,
(particularly large land owners such as commercial and industrial businesses) and for all citizens with
regard to activities within dwelling units. These are listed below:
Utilize drought resistant plant materials - Existing public and private property can be retrofitted with water-
conserving landscaping and irrigation techniques, and all new development can be required to install
drought resistant plant materials and water-saving irrigation systems. Recommendations for specific
materials are provided in the “Foster City Planting and Irrigation Guidelines” within the Conservation
Section Appendix.
Limit turf areas to 25% of landscaping - The use of turf grasses and annuals should not exceed 25% of the
total landscaped area. (Annuals are considered turf because of their high water use.)
Limit hours of the day for watering - All watering and irrigation should occur between 6:00 P.M. and 10:00
A.M. During daylight hours, the sun evaporates water intended for landscaping purposes and the wind
blows water from its intended location.
Retrofit with water-conserving fixtures - All valves, drip and bubbler equipment in fountains and irrigation
systems should be replaced with those that maintain a low flow of water and those with pressure
regulators, filters and pressure gauges.
Retrofit existing bathrooms and install new bathrooms with low-flow toilets and water-conserving shower
heads - Bathroom fixtures can be replaced with valves that limit the flow and amount of water. These
fixtures should be combined with reducing the frequency of use and amount of water in showers and
toilets.

Water Quality - Drinking Water
Existing and Desired Conditions: The protection of the quality of Foster City drinking water is partially
the responsibility of the City of San Francisco (the supplier of drinking water for Foster City), and partially
the responsibility of the Regional Water Quality Control Board which must establish and maintain standards
for water quality. The desired condition is to maintain the existing quality of Foster City’s drinking water.
Conservation Techniques: Continue existing programs to conserve and protect water quality in
accordance with accepted standards. Continue to monitor the quality of the City’s drinking water by testing
the water regularly.
Water Quality - Lagoon System
Existing Conditions: The water in the City’s Lagoon and canals tends to be of lower quality than that of
the San Francisco Bay because they function as the City’s storm drainage system. Urban residues found
in the system include herbicides, pesticides, fertilizers, exhaust emissions, duck and animal waste, and oil
and tire decomposition products.
Desired Conditions: The protection of the water quality of the lagoon system is of particular importance
to Foster City due to the City’s reputation as a water-oriented community. High water quality enhances
recreational boating on the lagoon system and enhances the scenic qualities of the Lagoon and canals.
The City should continue its efforts to ensure high water quality.
Conservation Techniques: Continue to conserve and protect lagoon water quality by flushing, testing
and patrolling the water in the lagoon system. The adopted Lagoon Management Plan (1992) includes
programs for water exchange with the Bay to maintain water quality, control aquatic weeds, and continue
testing of water samples. The Department also performs weekly tests of water quality, patrols the
waterways weekly to remove trash and control herbicides, and controls the dumping of harmful substances
into the waterways. These techniques ensure the health and safety of the lagoon system by removing
broken/harmful items and testing the water for chemical, pesticide and algae content.
Conserve and protect the Foster City Lagoon System by maintaining accessibility for views and
recreational opportunities - Continue to review development proposals for impacts to the lagoon system
and to the views of the lagoon from adjacent properties.
Conserve and protect the Foster City Lagoon System by educating the public about toxic wastes in the
storm water system - Send brochures to residents and businesses explaining how Foster City street gutters
are connected to the lagoon system and therefore toxic wastes such as motor oil must not be spilled near
the street gutters.
Water Quality - Discharge into the Bay
Existing and Desired Conditions: The City of Foster City has an active permit with the Regional Water
Quality Control Board to discharge water into the San Francisco Bay after treating it according to Board
regulations. The regulations are intended to protect the health and safety of the water that is discharged in
the Bay. The desired condition is to maintain the quality of the discharged water in accordance with permit
requirements.

Conservation Techniques: Conserve and protect the quality of the water that is discharged into the San
Francisco Bay - Continue to treat water for discharge into the Bay according to the regulations established
by the Regional Water Quality Control Board.
Further information about water quality programs is provided in the Conservation Section Appendix.
Air Quality
Existing Conditions: Air quality is determined by the amount of pollutants emitted and the ability of the
atmosphere to transport and dilute them. The major determinants of transport and dilution are wind,
atmospheric stability, terrain, and sunshine.
Foster City is a relatively windy city and therefore protected from air pollution more than other cities on the
Peninsula. Foster City receives primarily northwest and northerly winds due to the orientation of the Bay
and San Francisco Peninsula. Winds from these directions carry pollutants released by autos and factories
from upwind areas of the Peninsula towards Foster City, particularly during the summer months. Winds
are lightest on the average in fall and winter. Every year in fall and winter, pollutants build up for several
days during periods of light wind.
Foster City frequently has “temperature inversion” conditions in the summer during morning and afternoon
hours, and in the winter during morning hours. This inversion is created by a layer of warm air above
cooler air. If there are also terrain barriers, or no wind to blow emissions away, the emissions are confined
near the ground. These conditions create a rapid build-up of pollutant concentrations, and in the presence
of sunshine form smog. Foster City has some terrain barriers because the City is inland and somewhat
sheltered which limits lateral dilution of pollutants.
Therefore Foster City has a moderate atmospheric potential for air pollution given the combined effects of
moderate ventilation, frequent inversion conditions and a terrain which restricts lateral dilution of pollutants.
Please refer to Table 3 in the Conservation Appendix for a comparison of federal and state standards for
ozone, carbon monoxide, etc.
Desired Conditions: Although Foster City enjoys better air quality than other cities on the Peninsula,
Foster City would like to mitigate the impact of air quality problems due to stationary and vehicular sources
within the City. The desired condition is fewer ambient pollutants to reduce the smog production during
inversion conditions.
Conservation Techniques: The purpose of these techniques is to reduce the release of pollutants at the
local level from stationary and vehicular sources.
Review proposed projects for their potential to affect air quality conditions - As part of environmental review
procedures, determine any projected impacts on air quality and require appropriate mitigation measures for
all new projects. Such measures are similar to those required through the Inter-City Transportation System
Management Program (described below) and may include preferential car pool parking, providing bicycle
storage, bus stop shelters and/or reduced emissions from stationary sources.
Separate air pollution sensitive land uses from sources of air pollution - Require buffer zones to separate
sensitive land uses, such as residential, from freeways, arterials, point sources and hazardous material
locations.

Enforce the Inter-City Transportation System Management Program - Transportation Systems
Management (TSM) involves the promotion of the use, maintenance and expansion of alternative forms of
transportation, such as public transit, vanpools, carpools and bicycles, for the purpose of improving the
efficiency of existing forms and systems of transportation.
Foster City adopted a TSM ordinance on April 17, 1989. The purpose of the ordinance is to achieve at
least a 25% employee participation rate within four years to alternatives to single occupant vehicle
commuting during peak traffic hours. Employees are required to complete surveys describing their
commute and schedule and will be offered incentives for carpooling or alternate transportation methods
such as preferential parking stalls, flexible work schedules, and subsidized public transit fares.
In January 1990, the cities of Belmont, Foster City, Redwood City, Burlingame, San Carlos and San Mateo
adopted a TSM ordinance establishing the Inter-City Transportation System Management Program. On
June 4, 1990, Foster City approved the San Mateo County Transportation System Management Plan. The
program is governed by the Inter-City TSM Authority, which is composed of a representative from each of
the participating cities. The responsibility of the Authority is to meet with large employers to encourage
participation in the program.
Each city is responsible as an employer to implement the provisions of the TSM plan with regard to city
employees. Cities are also required to implement the plan for new businesses through the project review
process. The Authority is responsible for educating employers in each city (excluding city governments)
about the objectives of the plan. The Authority has the power to enforce the ordinance to ensure that
businesses comply with the plan.
As often as possible, consolidate and/or eliminate motor vehicle trips to improve air quality - In conjunction
with the TSM program, educate Foster City residents and employees about the importance of carpooling to
both work and social engagements. Encourage mixed use developments, local retail diversity and a
healthy jobs/housing balance to reduce motor vehicle trips.
Coordinate with local, regional and state agencies to improve air quality - Comply with and enforce
provisions of the 1991 Bay Area Clean Air Plan and coordinate with the Bay Area Air Quality District
regarding emissions from existing and future developments.
Energy
Existing Conditions: The Pacific, Gas and Electric Company (PG&E), supplies energy to Foster City.
Energy offered by PG&E is generated in the Southwest, California and Canada. Since the 1970’s the
United States and many other countries have been facing an energy crisis. The cause of this crisis is two-
fold: 1) the United States consumes more energy than it produces, and 2) energy sources that were
formerly feasible have been found to create harmful environmental effects, such as coal and fuel oil with a
high sulfur content.
Foster City has the opportunity to reduce energy consumption because of two natural advantages:
(1)    The winds common to Foster City can cool a building naturally if the windows are open; and
(2)    Many buildings are situated or can be situated so as to take advantage of solar heating opportunities.

Desired Conditions: The desired condition is for each resident and employee in Foster City to minimize
their use of energy resources. Participation by everyone is integral to reducing consumption of energy.
Conservation efforts will ensure that energy is available in the future for basic needs.
Conservation Techniques: The following conservation techniques relate to development review and
educational efforts. Additional techniques are listed in the appendix that apply to energy conservation at
home or the office.
Construct new buildings and additions to energy efficiency standards according to Title 24 of the Uniform
Building Code -Title 24 of the Building Code establishes standards to ensure adequate light and ventilation
in buildings, and requires new buildings and additions to be designed for energy conservation and
efficiency.
Property owners should retrofit their buildings with weather-stripping and caulking around doors and
windows to reduce heat loss. Insulation of attics, exterior walls and water heaters will also contribute to
reduction of heat loss. The Building Division shall be available to answer questions about energy efficiency
and the Division or P, G & E are available to inspect buildings for energy efficiency. Table 4 in the
Technical Appendix offers further energy conservation tips.
Install solar panels for heating and cooling with solar energy - Encourage property owners to install solar
panels for heating interior space and cooling with solar energy, and require them for swimming pools and
spas.
One of the purposes of the architectural review ordinance adopted by the City of Foster City is to protect
solar access to adjacent homes. The City has also adopted solar guidelines that encourage energy
conservation while recognizing the necessity for good design. Solar energy can be used to heat water
heaters and/or buildings. Solar panels are part of an active solar energy system to collect and store energy
in the form of heated air or water.
Encourage property owners to heat all new and existing spas and swimming pools with solar
energy - During the architectural review process for pools and spas, the City will encourage and educate
property owners about the advantages of and requirements for the installation of solar panels.
Continue to expand and monitor information about energy conservation and establish a public outreach
program to inform Foster City residents and businesses about the availability and importance of the
information - The City will contact residents and businesses to educate them about the available resources
and assist them to determine appropriate conservation techniques to improve efficiency in their buildings.
Recycling of Renewable Resources
Existing Conditions: In 1989 amendments to the Government Code, Health and Safety Code, Revenue
and Taxation Code and the Public Resources Code resulted in the requirement that each city and county in
California to reduce 25% of the total waste generated by 1995 and 50% by 2000. (Please see Appendix
for section references.)
The City of Foster City is already participating in a curbside pick-up program in single-family areas for
glass, aluminum cans and newspapers. The advantages of curbside recycling programs include
convenience, conservation of raw materials and energy, reduction in the need for solid waste disposal and
landfill space, and the creation of jobs.
Several businesses and apartment complexes also have existing recycling programs, including City Hall
with a white paper, cardboard and newspaper recycling program (each office employee has a tray for

collection of white paper at their desks). The materials recycled from the above programs include
aluminum, glass, white paper, cardboard, computer paper, and newspaper.
The 1986 California Beverage Container Recycling and Litter Reduction Act delineated convenience zones
in cities and requires that a certified recycling center be located within these zones by October 1, 1987 or
operators within these zones will be fined $100 dollars per day. The act applies to aluminum, plastic, glass
and metal beverage containers.
Foster City’s recycling centers have been located behind Lucky’s Supermarket when the market was
located in Marlin Cove Shopping Center, and behind Alpha Beta Supermarket when the market was
located in Edgewater Place Shopping Center. A redemption center was recently located behind Lucky’s
Supermarket at Edgewater Place Shopping Center. Since the centers are privately operated, the City
cannot retain the centers when they decide to relocate. All proposals for redemption centers require a use
permit which is reviewed by the Planning Commission. This process is intended to protect adjacent
property owners from maintenance problems such as refuse left on the site after hours of operation.
Desired Conditions: The desired condition is a 50% reduction of materials to the landfill by the year
2000. This must occur through recycling, source reduction and composting of green materials. Foster City
should review options for developing recycling programs for all City residents and workers, including office,
multiple-family residential, industrial and retail land uses.
Source reduction refers to eliminating waste before it is generated. For example, making two-sided copies
instead of single sided copies reduces by half the amount of paper consumed.
Composting of green materials involves backyard and/or municipal collection and separation of leaves,
grass and food scraps from other waste and stockpiling it under proper conditions to create mulch for
gardens and landscaping.
Conservation Techniques: These techniques refer to some of the measures that should be undertaken
to reduce the waste stream. The majority of available techniques are described in detail as part of the
Foster City Source Reduction and Recycling Element, prepared in compliance with recent amendments to
State Law regarding recycling and adopted on July 6, 1992 by the City Council. (The applicable sections of
State Law are listed in the Technical Appendix.)
Implement Source Reduction and Recycling Element in accordance with State regulations - This Element
is included in the Conservation Section Appendix. The Element includes information from a waste
characterization study which serves as a basis for prioritizing the recycling of certain materials from the
waste generated. The Element also defines objectives for market development of recycled materials.
Inform all Foster City residents and businesses about recycling opportunities - Although the curbside
program is in effect for single family houses, many apartment and condominium dwellers, and businesses
do not have on-site recycling collection facilities. As part of the effort to comply with State regulations, the
City is in the process of contacting residential and business managers that do not have on-site recycling
programs to inform them about the recent State legislation and actively assist them in initiating recycling
programs.
Waive fees and simplify the review process for trash enclosures around recycling bins - All trash bins are
required to be placed in enclosures that are architecturally compatible with on-site buildings. To encourage
property owners to develop recycling programs, the City should simplify the review process by inspecting
the site to determine if existing trash enclosures can be converted to recycling bin enclosures.

Prepare a City-wide procurement policy for the purchase of recycled products - In compliance with
Assembly Bill 4 (Eastin, 1989) which amends Sections 12150, 12168 and 12169 of the State Contracts
Code, the City is required to purchase recycled paper products. The procurement policy should include
specifications for buying recycled products and specify percentages of recycled content. (Please refer to
the Technical Appendix for more information about AB 4.)
Wildlife Habitat
Existing Conditions: As discussed in the Open Space Background section, several areas within the City
provide feeding or resting areas for several types of shorebirds and waterfowl. The discussion in the Open
Space Section centered on the passive recreation and scenic opportunities of these areas, whereas this
section will concentrate specifically on the natural resources found in these areas.
Wildlife Refuge
In 1974 a 57-acre wildlife sanctuary was set aside in exchange for a permit to fill 382 acres of seasonal
wetlands elsewhere in Foster City. The wildlife refuge is roughly bounded by Belmont Slough on the east,
Beach Park Boulevard on the west, and between Tarpon Street and Foster City Boulevard (see Map GP-
12). The tidal wetlands and mudflats in this area contain feeding and resting habitat for numerous and
diverse migratory shorebirds and some species of waterfowl who migrate along the Pacific flyway.
The Environmental Protection Agency’s 404(b)(1) guidelines designate wetlands and mudflats, as well as
refuges, as special aquatic sites which influence and contribute to the overall environmental health and
vitality of the entire ecosystem of a region.
The upland area adjacent to the tidal wetland provides an important buffer area for the adjacent wetlands.
It also functions as a refuge area for wildlife species during high tides. Such escape covers, consisting of
transitional upland habitats, are limited along the linear marsh. They also have the potential to support
introduced populations which would assist in the recovery of declining species.
Other Important Habitat
Bird Island and portions of the adjacent mudflats are within the congressionally authorized boundary for the
San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge. Thousands of shorebirds feed on the mudflats adjacent to the
Island, which hosts a nesting colony for the endangered California least tern and large numbers of
endangered California brown pelicans.
Endangered Species
The California Clapper Rail is classified as an endangered species by the Department of The Interior and
the State of California. The bird and its habitat are therefore afforded protection under the Endangered
Species Act. This endangered bird inhabits coastal California salt marshes, including those of San
Francisco Bay. It depends for its existence upon salt and brackish tidal marshes with an abundant growth
of cordgrass and pickleweed. It breeds and forages exclusively within the confines of tidal marshes and
has been observed throughout all portions of the subject marsh area. The reason for the endangered
status of this bird is attributed to the destruction and degradation of its habitat.
The California Least Tern is another endangered species which has been observed on or near the wildlife
refuge. The tern often nests on the eastern portion of Bair Island about two miles south of the refuge, and
would probably use the shallow water mudflats of the refuge at mid-to high-tide times for fishing.
The dense pickleweed stands in the tidal wetland provide appropriate habitat for the endangered Salt
Marsh Harvest Mouse, which has been found in the pickleweed on and near the Bridge Landing site. The
upland grass species in the salt marsh area provides a reuge for the harvest mice during high tide.

Desired Conditions: It is the policy of the City of Foster City that no disturbance will be permitted to the
wildlife refuge. The preservation of the refuge is necessary to protect endangered species and to provide
an educational resource for the community and region. In this manner the refuge will provide an historical
example of the original shoreline conditions prior to filling for development.
Conservation Techniques: Expand public opportunities to learn about wetland areas and endangered
species by creating public viewing areas with exhibits - Foster City should consider constructing public
interpretive viewing areas with exhibits about characteristics of habitat and species typical for wetland
areas. The exhibits could also provide an historical perspective of how Foster City looked before
development.
Protect wetland habitat from human disturbance - Discourage human disturbance by posting signs
prohibiting trespassing on vegetation typical of wetland areas, such as pickleweed that would not survive
trampling.
Prohibit development within 57 acre wildlife refuge - The preservation of the refuge is essential for the
protection of endangered species, and as one of the few remaining examples in the region of undeveloped
San Francisco Bay wetland areas. Foster City shall ensure that all new development proposals do not
encroach on the refuge.
100-Foot BCDC Regulated Shoreline Band
Existing Conditions: The Bay Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC) has planning and
permit authority over areas 100 feet landward of the line of highest tidal action of the San Francisco Bay
(“the shoreline band”) and certain other lands that are suitable for Bay-related uses (see map). These
include salt ponds, managed wetlands and some waterways that empty into the Bay. In Foster City
BCDC’s jurisdiction extends along the Bay side of the levee, parallel to East Third Avenue and Beach Park
Boulevard between Highway 92 and south of Foster City Boulevard.
Development proposals within this band must be submitted to BCDC for review and approval with regard to
consistency to the policies of the San Francisco Bay Plan. Policies of the plan require public access by fee
or easement from public highways to shoreland. The main objectives of the Plan are to protect the Bay as
a natural resource for the benefit of present and future generations, and to develop the Bay and shoreline
to their highest potential with a minimum of Bay filling.
In Foster City, the shoreline band is adjacent to one of the most popular adult recreation opportunites in the
region: the pedestrian/bicycle trail (or pedway). The pedway provides public access to the shoreline band
in a manner that is not typical of communities along the San Francisco Bay. This public access to the open
space assets of the shoreline band is representative of the Foster City lifestyle and emphasis on water
resources.
Desired Conditions: The shoreline band should remain accessible to the public and as undeveloped as
possible. Any development proposed within the shoreline band will be strictly scrutinized and evaluated
against appropriate BCDC standards, and impacts to adjacent properties, wetlands, the wildlife refuge and
the pedway.
Conservation Techniques:
Improve public access to the 100 foot shoreline band - The City plans to improve public access to the
shoreline. The existing pathway will be widened to facilitate concurrent use by pedestrians and bicyclists.
The City has also proposed installing ramps and sloped pathways for the handicapped and others to reach
the pedway (refer to Parks Section).

Foster City will continue its past practice of improving public access to the shoreline in conjunction with
development proposals and as part of the 5 year Capital Improvement Program. For example,
developments located adjacent to the pedway have been required to provide public access and public
parking to the pedway within the subject project. Recently approved projects such as Bayfront Court
Townhomes have also been required to provide seating areas, picnic areas, a landscape and irrigation
system and four public access signs. The Lantern Cove project was required to provide pathways, an
exercise par course and a picnic area.
Strictly control development proposals in the vicinity of the shoreline band - Any development proposed
within the shoreline band must be consistent with BCDC standards, and must not significantly impact
adjacent properties, wetlands, the wildlife refuge and/or the pedway.
Foster City Lagoon System
Existing Conditions: The Foster City lagoon system is a unique water resource that affords many
recreational and scenic opportunities. The lagoon system also supports biologic species such as marine
organisms and serves as resting and feeding sites for waterfowl and as hunting territory for diving birds
such as the Caspian tern.
An attached form of chlorophyte algae is found along rocky portions of the southern and central portions of
the lagoon. The majority of invertebrate organisms sighted were found only along rock areas of the lagoon
system. The lagoon system was also found to support a dense population of striped bass, probably a
result of the lagoon’s high rate of plankton productivity. Young striped bass are fed upon by several bird
types.
A minimum of fifteen species of birds, ranging from the species normally associated with saltmarsh habitats
to those normally associated with grassland habitats, inhabit the terrestrial and slough areas in the
immediate area.
Desired Conditions: Since the Foster City lifestyle is distinctly associated with the lagoon system, the
City has resolved to protect the biologic function of the lagoon as a feeding and resting area for waterfowl
and as habitat for marine life, and the recreational and scenic resources of the lagoon.
Conservation Techniques:
Protect the water quality of the lagoon system - Continue to test and monitor the water in the lagoon
system, according to the standard and techniques previously mentioned in the Conservation Section.
Protect and conserve the recreational and scenic qualities of the lagoon system - Development proposals
are carefully analyzed for potential view or recreational impacts.
Inform City residents and workers about the relationship between the storm water system and the lagoon -
The City will prepare and distribute informational brochures to inform people about the multiple functions
performed by the lagoon system and what not to dispose of in the system.
AIR POLLUTION
The ingredients of smog (ozone) are sunshine, nitrogen, oxides and hydrocarbons. Altogether, vehicles
contribute 31% of the Bay Area's daily dose of man-made hydrocarbon emissions. Much of the damage to
air quality occurs in the first few minutes of any trip in which the car is starting and operating cold. Once

Housing Element
Introduction
Purpose of the Housing Element
The Housing Element of the Foster City General Plan identifies and addresses housing needs in the City.
State law requires that the Housing Element be updated every eight years to be responsive to changing
conditions, new laws, State law requirements and updated regional "fair share" Housing Needs
Determinations. This Housing Element for the 2015-2023 planning period is an update of the City of Foster
City's previous Housing Element for 2007-2014, which was adopted by the City Council in February 2010
and certified by the State of California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) in April
2010.
The Housing Element is consistent with the Land Use and Circulation, Parks, Open Space and
Conservation, and other elements of the Foster City General Plan. The next required update to the
Housing Element is due by January 31, 2023. (If the Housing Element is not revised and adopted within
120 days of the due date of January 31, 2015, then the next element would be due within four years by
January 2019.) This current revision of the Housing Element has a planning period from January 31, 2015
through January 31, 2023.
Overview of 2007-2014 Housing Element Accomplishments
This Housing Element builds upon the successes of the City’s 2007-2014 Housing Element. While in some
cases, time and opportunity hindered the accomplishment of some programs, most programs have been
implemented to at least some extent. This is described in more detail in the appendices, which include a
matrix that lists all of the 2007-2014 Housing Element programs and describes whether the program has
been achieved and if it should be retained, deleted or modified. Some of the particularly noteworthy
accomplishments of the 2007-2014 Housing Element include:
Adopted — February 2, 2015                                                                               Page 4-1

Chapter 4: Housing Element                                                                               Introduction
      Miramar and Marlin Cove
(1) Regional Housing Needs. For the 2007-2014 planning period, the City was required to plan for a
      minimum of 486 units. Between 2007 and the end of 2013, the City added 307 dwelling units including
      60 below market rate units, which equates to 63% of the total housing need.
(2) Approval of New Mixed Use Developments. The City approved the mixed use Pilgrim Triton Master
      Plan and the Foster Square Master Plan to create two new mixed use developments that will include
      up to 1,061 new housing units. Both developments will include 20% affordable housing. The City
      and/or Community Development Agency contributed funds to support the affordable housing.
(3) First Time Homebuyer Program. The First Time Homebuyer loans provide a 30-year second
      mortgage at 3% interest with the interest and payments deferred for the first 5 years. Although no new
      loans were issued after March 2011 due to the termination of the Community Development Agency
      and associated funding, as of June 1, 2014, a total of 33 loans have been made, with eight loans still
      outstanding. A total of $2,073,625 has been loaned.
(4) Housing Endowment and Regional Trust (HEART). The City continued its participation in the
      Housing Endowment and Regional Trust (HEART), which raises funds from public and private sources
      to meet critical housing needs in San Mateo County. As of July 2013, Foster City has contributed
      $79,682 to HEART.
(5) Existing Unit Purchase Program. Additional units were purchased to be rented to very low- and low-
      income families. The City has an inventory of six units that are part of this program.
(6) Homeshare Program. From 2007 to September 2013, 53 low-income residents were placed in
      shared housing arrangements.
(7) Anti-Discrimination Ordinance. Chapter 5.72, Tenant Anti-Discrimination, was added, prohibiting
      discrimination against existing tenants based on source of income.
(8) Reasonable Accommodation. Chapter 17.84, Reasonable Accommodation, was adopted, providing
      a procedure to review requests for reasonable accommodation.
(9) Emergency Shelter Zoning. Chapter 17.82, Emergency Shelters, was adopted, establishing
      standards for emergency shelters for the homeless and various other zoning districts were amended
      to allow emergency shelters for the homeless by right without a discretionary approval.

Introduction                                                                               Chapter 4: Housing Element
(10) Transitional and Supportive Housing. Definitions were added to Title 17 for transitional and
      supportive housing and various zoning districts were amended to allow transitional and supportive
      housing without a discretionary approval.
(11) Density Bonuses. Chapter 17.86, Density Bonuses, was adopted, establishing standards for density
      bonuses and other incentives for the provision of affordable housing, in accordance with State law.
(12) 21 Elements. As part of this Housing Element, the City has been involved in a unique, collaborative
      effort involving all 21 jurisdictions in San Mateo County. The project, known as “21 Elements,” has
      included two phases. The first phase involved collaboration among all of the jurisdictions to distribute
      the regional housing needs allocation (RHNA) for the county as a whole amongst all the jurisdictions.
      The second phase has involved the preparation of background materials as part of a Housing Element
      update kit for use by all of the jurisdictions in San Mateo County.
The Vision of Foster City as Presented in the Housing Element
The Housing Element plays a critical role in identifying housing needs, which maintain the "balance" that
exists in the types, tenure and affordability of housing in the City. The Housing Element also establishes
programs to maintain and protect existing housing and community character in order to:
Maintain the Existing Quality of Life
      Maintain the integrity and high quality living environment of the City's residential
          neighborhoods.
      Protect aesthetics and continue the emphasis that Foster City is a "master-
          planned" City.
      Protect existing affordable housing.
Provide Affordable Housing
      Respond to the need for additional housing by considering housing in potential
          mixed-use commercial/residential sites or potential re-use of existing commercial
          sites.
      Respond to the need for affordable housing by providing incentives and
          assistance where appropriate to create new affordable units, convert existing
          market-rate units into affordable units, acquire existing units and rent them at
          affordable levels, or provide rental subsidies toward rental of existing units.
Address Other Housing Issues
      Address the housing needs of special populations (e.g., elderly, homeless,
          disabled, developmentally disabled, single-parent households).
The General Plan serves as the ‘constitution’ for development in the city. It is a long-range planning
document that describes goals, policies and programs to guide decision-making. All development-related
decisions must be consistent with the City of Foster City General Plan, of which the Housing Element is but
one part. If a development proposal is not consistent with a city’s general plan, it must be revised or the
plan itself must be amended. State law requires a community’s general plan to be internally consistent.
This means that the Housing Element, although subject to special requirements and a different schedule of
updates, must function as an integral part of the overall Foster City General Plan, with consistency
between it and the other General Plan elements.
The Housing Element is consistent with all of the goals and policies contained in the other elements of the
City of Foster City General Plan. In particular, policies related to land use designations, infrastructure

capacity (transportation, services, etc.), and environmental protection are consistent with the housing sites
and quantified objectives contained in the Housing Element. Specific programs in the Housing Element to
modify the Zoning Ordinance, such as provisions to remove or reduce constraints to the production of
housing, are also consistent with the General Plan.
State Law Requirements for Housing Elements
State law requires each city and county to adopt a general plan containing at least seven elements
including a housing element. Regulations regarding Housing Elements are found in the California
Government Code Sections 65580-65589. Unlike the other mandatory general plan elements, the housing
element is required to be updated every eight years and is subject to detailed statutory requirements and
mandatory review by the State of California Department of Housing and Community Development — HCD.
Bay Area Housing Elements must be updated within 120 days of the January 31, 2015 deadline or be
subject to a four year update requirement. According to State law, the Housing Element must:
     Provide goals, policies, quantified objectives and scheduled programs to preserve,
      improve and develop housing
     Identify and analyze existing and projected housing needs for all economic
      segments of the community.
     Identify adequate sites that will be zoned and available (prior to housing element
      adoption) within the 8 year housing cycle to meet the city’s fair share of regional
      housing needs at all income levels
     Be internally consistent with other parts of the General Plan (and is critical to having
      a legally adequate General Plan)
     Be submitted to the State Department of Housing and Community Development
      (HCD) to determine if HCD “certifies” the Housing Element is in compliance with
      state law.
Several new requirements have been imposed since the last Housing Element. The new requirements are
summarized below and described in more detail in the appendices:
 o    Housing Element cycle and planning period is now 8 years for most jurisdictions.
 o    Jurisdictions that do not adopt their housing element (in accordance with Government Code Section
      65585) by the January 2015 deadline (plus 120 day grace period) are required to update their housing
      element every four years.
 o    The housing needs section must now include an analysis of the special housing needs of people with
      developmental disabilities.
 o    Jurisdictions whose population increased from under 25,000 to over 25,000 now have a default
      density of 30 dwelling units per acre. In San Mateo County, only Belmont is affected. (Default density
      refers to the zoning level where the available land inventory may assume - without additional analysis -
      that the zoning is appropriate for lower income housing.)
 o    Implementation programs must have timelines.

Introduction                                                                                    Chapter 4: Housing Element
  o   Rezonings to meet adequate sites must happen within specific timeframes. In many cases the
      timeframe is three years plus 90 days after receiving HCD comments, with a possible one-year
      extension.
  o   There are now two more potential consequences for jurisdictions that committed to rezone but did not
      do so:
              o    If a jurisdiction commits to the rezoning of a site and fails to do so within the specified
                   period, a housing developer has the right to build an affordable project on the site as if it had
                   been rezoned. In this case, affordable means at least 49 percent of the units must be low or
                   moderate-income housing. To turn down the application, local governments must make
                   findings that there is a ”specific, adverse impact,” and the only “feasible method” to mitigate
                   the impact would be to deny the project. Courts can enforce the builder’s remedy.
              o    Action to Compel – Any interested party may sue a jurisdiction to enforce compliance.
                   Judges may compel jurisdictions to change their zoning and impose sanctions if it is not
                   done.
  o   Jurisdictions now have more flexibility on the timing to commit assistance to an affordable housing
      project and count those units against the RHNA.
  o   The minimum size for RHNA credit for converting rental units to affordable units dropped from four to
      three.
  o   Jurisdictions can now receive credit if they convert market rate condominiums to affordable rental
      properties under some conditions.
  o   Converting foreclosed homes to affordable homes can now qualify for RHNA/alternative adequate
      sites credit, under some conditions.
  o   Cities are now officially encouraged to include weatherization and energy efficiency improvements as
      part of publicly subsidized housing rehabilitation projects.
  o   Cities are now allowed to report units that were rehabilitated, conserved or preserved (and met state
      requirements) as part of the annual report process.
  o   Housing element progress must be considered by City Council (or comparable legislative body).
State Law establishes detailed content requirements for housing elements and requires a regional “fair
share” approach to distributing housing needs. State Housing Element law recognizes that in order for the
private sector to address housing needs and demand, local governments must adopt land-use plans and
implementing regulations that provide opportunities for, and do not unduly constrain, housing development.
State law regarding Housing Elements was changed in 2004 to allow cities within a county to join together
to form a “sub-region,” which would administer the State mandated RHNA process at the local level. This
law allows the sub-region to receive the sub-regional collective housing allocation from ABAG and then
decide and implement its own methodology to divide the allocation among the member cities and county. In
turn, the sub-regional RHNA process is used to establish the housing need numbers for each jurisdiction’s
Housing Element update. For the current Housing Element update, the County of San Mateo, in
partnership with all twenty cities in the County, formed a sub-region responsible for completing its own
RHNA process and distributing the housing need numbers to the individual cities.

Chapter 4: Housing Element                                                                               Introduction
Why Housing Is Important: Key Findings
The “housing crisis” in the Bay Area has been an evolving phenomenon over the past 35 years as high
demand (and need) has continually exceeded supply and affordability. There has been a substantial
movement in the Bay Area, intensified by concerns about climate change, to find ways to grow sustainably
-- that is, to encourage regional development patterns that are more compact, transit-oriented, pedestrian-
oriented, well-designed, and highly livable. A central focus of this movement — the very foundation for
achieving a more sustainable and livable Bay Area — is rethinking the way in which we plan, design,
rehabilitate, preserve and manage housing in conjunction with transportation systems, jobs and services.
     About 26% of the City’s Households Are Considered Lower Income. The exact income category
      of a household is dependent upon the size and overall income of the household. In a general way,
      about 8% of the households in Foster City are estimated to be extremely low income, 6% are
      estimated to be very low income, 12% are estimated to be low income, 9% are estimated to be
      moderate income, and the remaining 65% are estimated to be above moderate income.
     Market Rate Ownership Housing Continues to be Affordable Only to Above Moderate Income
      Households. Market rate for sale housing is only affordable to above moderate-income households.
      The median price for a single-family home in Foster City in 2012 was $1,000,000, and the median
      price for a common interest development in Foster City in 2012 was $570,000.
     Market Rate Rental Housing is Generally Affordable to Moderate Income Households. While
      rents in Foster City are generally among the highest in the county for various size units, a good portion
      of market rate rental housing is affordable to moderate income households.
     Foster City has Good Mix of Housing Types. In 2013, the California Department of Finance
      estimated that there are 12,458 housing units in Foster City. Of these, Foster City has a good mix of
      housing types with about 38% of the units being single family detached homes, 20% single family
      attached, 7% in structures of 2-4 units, and 35% in structures with 5 or more units.
     The Senior Population in San Mateo County is Projected to Increase By 76 percent between
      2005 and 2025. According to the San Mateo County Health Department and other sources, the
      numbers of seniors in the population will increase significantly over the next several decades, with
      older seniors seeing the largest growth. In the year 2030, seniors will be more diverse than today, with
      the greatest increase in Latino and Pacific/Asian. San Mateo County is an expensive place for seniors,
      and has the highest cost of living of anywhere in the state for seniors who rent. Most seniors, 93
      percent in some surveys, prefer to age in place (stay in their homes as they age) or stay in their
      community.

Definitions of Housing Terms
o     Above Moderate Income Households: Defined by California Housing Element Law households
      earning over 120% of the median household income. As of February 2014, a family of four earning
      more than $123,600 per year was considered above moderate income.
o     Accessible Housing: As defined by HCD. units accessible and adaptable to the needs of the
      physically disabled.
o     Affordable Housing: Affordable housing, for the purposes of the Housing Element, refers to housing
      that is affordable to households at extremely low income, very low income, low income, and moderate-
      income levels. Generally, housing that costs less than 30% of household income is considered
      affordable to these groups.
o     Developmental Disability: As defined by the California Code of Regulations (Title 17, Section 54000),
      a developmental disability attributable to any of the following conditions: mental retardation. cerebral
      palsy, epilepsy, autism; or other disabling conditions found to be closely related to mental retardation
      or to require treatment similar to that required for individuals with mental retardation. In addition the
      disability must originate before an individual becomes 18 years old and can be expected to continue,
      indefinitely, and constitutes a “substantial disability” for that individual as defined by the California
      Code of Regulations (Title 17, Section 54001).
o     Emergency Shelter. As defined by Health and Safety Code Section 50800-50806.5, emergency
      housing is housing with minimal supportive services for homeless persons and is limited to occupancy
      of six months or less for each individual. No individual or household may be denied emergency shelter
      because of an inability to pay.
o     Extremely Low Income Households: Government Code Section 65583(a) now requires local
      housing elements to provide “Documentation of projections and a quantification of the locality's
      existing and projected housing needs for all income levels, including extremely low income households
      (GC 65583 (a)(1)).” Extremely low income are households earning less than 30% of the median
      household income, as defined by HUD’s income limits. An extremely low-income for a family of four in

Chapter 4: Housing Element                                                                                  Introduction
      San Mateo County as of February 2014, would earn less than $33,950 per year.
o     Housing Affordability: Housing is generally considered affordable if a household spends no more
      than 30% of its gross household income on housing costs, including utilities, principal and interest. The
      following examples illustrate housing affordability:
              o    A cook earning $29,247 per year can afford $731 per month for housing;
              o    A two wage-earner household with a cook earning $29,247 and a retail salesperson earning
                   $28,327 can afford $1,400 per month for housing;
              o    A schoolteacher earning $66,590 per year can afford $1,665 per month for housing;
              o    A police officer or fire fighter earning $97,487 per year can afford up to $2,437 per month for
                   housing.
              o    None of these example households would be able to afford to purchase the San Mateo
                   County median condominium, costing $579,418 or the median single-family home, costing
                   $1,246,121 (SAMCAR).
o     Housing Density: The number of dwelling units per acre of land. Gross density includes all the land
      within the boundaries of a particular area and excludes nothing while net density excludes certain
      areas such as streets, open spaces, easements, water areas, etc.
o     Housing First: “Housing First” is an approach that centers on providing homeless people with housing
      quickly and then providing services as needed. What differentiates a “Housing First” approach from
      other strategies is the immediate and primary focus on helping individuals and families quickly access
      and sustain permanent housing. The “Housing First” model offers an alternative to emergency shelter
      or transitional housing for homeless individuals, but does not eliminate the City’s need to zone for such
      uses.
o     Income Limits: Income limits establish a schedule to determine eligibility for subsidized housing and
      define the categories used in regional housing needs allocations. Income limits are updated annually
      by the California Housing and Community Development Department (HCD) and the U.S. Department
      of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for San Mateo County, with “Extremely Low Income”, “Very
      Low Income” and “Low Income” schedules published by both agencies. For additional information, see
      the HUD website at www.huduser.org/dataset/il.html and San Mateo County Department of Housing
      website at http://www.co.sanmateo.ca.us/portal/site/housingdepartment/.

Introduction                                                                                Chapter 4: Housing Element
o     Jobs/Housing Balance: This refers to the ratio of the number and types of jobs in a community with
      the availability and affordability of housing. An appropriate balance is commonly thought to be
      between 1.0-1.5 jobs for every housing unit. However, the issue is more complex when a community
      strives to reduce in-commuting and provide a more suitable mix of jobs to local residents. Other factors
      include the types of jobs and the salaries paid, number of employed people in the community,
      affordability of housing relative to the income of people working in local jobs, and household size and
      income. Affordable housing strategies strive to create opportunities for local workers, especially those
      employed in service and retail jobs, to find local housing which fits their household needs in terms of
      type, affordability, amenities and location. Foster City has a jobs/housing ratio of approximately 1.5
      (18,544 jobs in 2011 per US Census on the Map/12,458 housing units per California Department of
      Finance).
o     Low Income Households: California Health and Safety Code Section 50079.5 provides that the low-
      income limits established by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) are the
      state limit for low-income households. HUD limits for low-income households are generally households
      earning 50-80% of the median household income, adjusted for family size, with some adjustment for
      areas with unusually high or low incomes relative to housing costs. As of February 2014, a family of
      four earning between $56,550 and $90,500 per year was considered low income.
o     Median Household Income: The middle point at which half of the City's households earn more and
      half earn less. Income limits are updated annually by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
      Development (HUD) for San Mateo County. For many State and local programs, State Department of
      Housing and Community Development (HCD) income eligibility limits are used. HCD income limits
      regulations are similar to those used by HUD. In 2014, the HCD median household income for a family
      of four in San Mateo County was $103,000.
o     Moderate Income Households: Defined by Section 50093 of the California Health and Safety Code
      as households earning 80-120% of the median household income. As of February 2014, a family of
      four earning between $90,500 and $123,600 per year was considered moderate income.
o     Overpayment for Housing: Households are considered to be overpaying for housing if they spend
      more than 30 percent of their income on rent or mortgage payments. Approximately 38.3% of owners
      and 38.4% of renters in Foster City were overpaying for housing in 2011 (American Community Survey
      2009-2011).
o     Persons per Household: Average number of persons in each household.
o     Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA): Within each Housing Element, the State mandates
      that local governments plan for their share of the region’s housing need for all income categories. For
      the 2015-2023 Housing Element update, the County of San Mateo, in partnership with all twenty cities
      in the County, formed a sub-region responsible for completing its own RHNA. The RHNA for Foster
      City is shown below:

Chapter 4: Housing Element                                                                                 Introduction
o     Residential Care Facilities: There are a variety of residential care facilities that address the needs of
      special segments of the population, including special care for the chronically ill, seniors, special need
      adults or youths, etc. The California Department of Social Services, Community Care Licensing
      Division, issues licenses for residential facilities that provide 24-hour non-medical care for children,
      adults and the elderly.
o     Secondary Dwelling Unit: Generally defined as a dwelling unit on a residential lot in addition to a
      primary dwelling. A secondary dwelling unit provides independent living facilities for one or more
      persons and includes permanent provisions for living, sleeping, cooking and sanitation. Secondary
      dwelling units are also called granny units, in-law units, or accessory dwelling units.
o     Senior Housing. Defined by California Housing Element law as projects developed for, and used as
      housing for senior citizens. Senior housing is based on: (1) if the U.S. Department of Housing and
      Urban Development (HUD) has determined that the dwelling is specifically designed for and occupied
      by elderly persons under a Federal, State or a local government program; (2) if it is occupied solely by
      persons who are 62 or older; or, (3) if it houses at least one person who is 55 or older in at least 80
      percent of the occupied units, and adheres to a policy that demonstrates intent to house persons who
      are 55 or older. Under Federal law, housing that satisfies the legal definition of senior housing or
      housing for older persons described above can legally exclude families with children..
o     Supportive Housing. Defined by California Housing Element law as persons with low incomes who
      have one or more disabilities, including mental illness, HIV or AIDS, substance abuse, or other chronic
      health condition; or individuals eligible for services provided pursuant to the Lanterman Developmental
      Disabilities Services Act( Division 4.5 (commencing with Section 4500) or the Welfare and Institutions
      Code). Supportive housing is permanent rental housing linked to a range of support services designed
      to enable residents to maintain stable housing and lead fuller lives. This type of housing has no limit on
      length of stay, and is linked to onsite or offsite services that assist the supportive housing resident in
      retaining the housing, improving his or her health status, and maximizing his or her ability to live and,
      when possible, work in the community.
o     Target Population: Defined by California Housing Element law as persons with low incomes who
      have one or more disabilities, including mental illness, HIV or AIDS, substance abuse, or other chronic
      health condition; or individuals eligible for services provided pursuant to the Lanterman Developmental
      Disabilities Services Act (Division 4.5 (commencing with Section 4500) of the Welfare and Institutions
      Code) and may include, among other populations, adults, emancipated minors, families with children,
      elderly persons, young adults aging out of the foster care system, individuals exiting from institutional
      settings, veterans, and homeless people.
o     Transitional Housing. Defined by California Housing Element law as buildings configured as rental
      housing developments but operated under program requirements that call for the termination of
      assistance and recirculation of the assisted unit to another eligible program recipient at some
      predetermined future point in time, which shall be no less than six months. The time limits on
      transitional housing are intended to facilitate the movement of homeless individuals and families to
      permanent housing. A homeless person may live in a transitional apartment for up to two-years while
      receiving supportive services that enable independent living.
o     Very Low Income Households: California Health and Safety Code Section 50079.5 provides that
      HUD very-low income limits are used, which are households earning between 30% and 50% of the
      median household income (adjusted as described for low-income households above). As of February

      Mateo County would be considered very low income.
o     Workforce Affordable Housing: Housing that is affordable to the workforce in the community and
      earning a moderate income or below.
Process for Preparation of the Housing Element
Planning Commission study sessions have been the primary outreach and community workshop format for
the Housing Element update process. For each of the public meetings, City staff circulated notices that
briefly described the update process and schedule and topics that would be studied. The public, including
all economic segments of the community, was advised of the Housing Element update study sessions in
the following ways:
             Published notices in the Foster City Islander;
             Posted on Foster City website;
             Televised on Foster City TV Channel 27;
             Posted in public noticing locations (Library, Recreation Center, Post Office, Sea Cloud Park and
              Metro Center);
             Posted on electronic marquee at Leo J. Ryan Park;
             Emailed to people on the “Housing Element” email listserve (including people on the 21
              Elements Stakeholder List); and,
              Emailed to people on the “Planning” email listserve.
A webpage has been created on the City’s website to inform the public about the Housing Element Update
and to provide background information. The webpage also provides a link to join the Housing Element
Update listserve to receive notifications of meetings.
In addition, the process built upon the outreach conducted with housing advocate groups and affordable
housing service providers as part of the 21 Elements process. At the request of local jurisdictions, 21
Elements organized four panels of experts to provide information and policy suggestions on affordable
housing and special needs populations. Several themes emerged from all the panels. Many speakers
talked about the importance of multi-family housing in mixed-use, transit-oriented neighborhoods. This
type of development is necessary because it accommodates seniors and people with disabilities who
cannot depend on cars for transportation. The reduced dependence on cars and increased density
also helps meet sustainability goals. Additionally, many jurisdictions in San Mateo
County have little or no vacant land and therefore cannot meet their RHNA requirements without
rezoning. Panelists also discussed the importance of adding predictability to the development process
and the necessity of removing excessive regulations to encourage development. A more detailed
summary of the panels is contained in the Appendices. The list of panels and panelists is shown
below.

Housing Background
Housing Trends
        Rise of the Millennials. The Millennial generation (ages 20-34) has a preference for dense, mixed-
         use, walk-able and bike-able communities. Many have speculated that Millennials may be a
         “generation of renters,” but as the economy improves and as Millennials age, this conclusion may
         change.
        Growing senior population. Over the next decade and a half, the number of seniors in San Mateo
         County will increase by 76 percent. Foster City currently is home to approximately 2,400 seniors.
         Advanced planning will be necessary to ensure the opportunity for seniors to age safely in the
         communities where they reside.
        Worsening workforce-housing shortage. San Mateo County is projected to see notable job
         growth over the next decade, and about 40 percent of these jobs will pay lower income wages. San
         Mateo County already has a severe workforce housing shortage in general caused by years of
         rapid economic growth and slow housing growth. By 2025, the Department of Housing projects
         than the County’s housing supply will only meet one third to one half of the demand. While Foster
         City is expected by ABAG to lose jobs between a high of 18,480 in 2000 and 16,190 in 2025, the
         City’s RHNA still requires accommodating the County’s low-to-moderate income workers.
        Increasing ethnic diversity. According to 2010 U.S. Census data, San Mateo County is a
         “majority-minority” county — that is, no one racial group makes up over 50 percent of the
         population. The two racial groups growing the most rapidly in San Mateo County are Asians and
         Latinos. According to the regional Plan Bay Area, adopted on July 18, 2013, Latinos will emerge as
         the largest ethnic group, increasing from 23 percent to 35 percent of the total population in the Bay
         Area by 2040.
        Increase of people with developmental disabilities. Aging baby boomers will be unable to care
         for their children with developmental disabilities. Almost three quarters of people with

          developmental disabilities live with a parent or caregiver and many of these caregivers are baby
          boomers. This trend is also going to be factor in the increased need for community-based
          independent living options.
Housing Characteristics
         As of January 2013, Foster City had a total population of 31,120. According to census data,
          Foster City grew by four percent from 2000 to 2012. ABAG predicts Foster City’s population will
          continue to grow over the next two decades, reaching 33,000 in 2030.
         Foster City’s housing stock is mostly comprised of single-family attached and detached
          homes. Foster City has approximately 12,500 homes, 60 percent of which are owner-occupied.
         More than a quarter of Foster City’s households are lower-income. Foster City’s median
          household income is approximately $120,000 (in 2011), which is quite a bit higher than countywide
          averages. However, more than 25 percent of Foster City’s population is lower income. Specifically,
          eight percent are extremely low income.
         Seniors in Foster City have much lower incomes than the general population. While almost a
          third of seniors make more than $100,000, almost a third also make below $30,000. Nine percent of
          seniors in Foster City are below the poverty line, which is higher than the six percent in the county
          at large.
         For-sale housing prices are rising rapidly and are unaffordable to many households. The
          median price for a single family home in Foster City in 2012 was $1,000,000, and the median price
          for a common interest development in Foster City in 2012 was $570,000. Prices have continued to
          rise -- as of October 2013, the median sales price for a single-family home was over $1.1 million,
          while the price for a multi-family home was over $600,000. Single people and families earning a
          moderate income or below fall far short of being able to afford these prices.
         Rents have increased significantly in the past several years. Rents in Foster City have mostly
          been rising since 2010 and are generally unaffordable for households making below a moderate
          income.
         Many households are overpaying for housing. Almost all households earning less than $35,000
          annually, and many of the households earning more, are overpaying for housing (paying more than
          30% of their income for housing).
         Special housing needs for people with developmental disabilities. People with developmental
          disabilities in San Mateo County have various diagnoses. The common ones are mental
          retardation, Down’s Syndrome, autism, epilepsy, and cerebral palsy. Data provided by the Golden
          Gate Regional Center indicates that of the 149 people with developmental disabilities in Foster City,
          almost all (75%) live with a parent or legal guardian.
         Increasing Numbers of People with Autism. A large number of people with developmental
          disabilities have autism. They have been brought up as independent members of the community
          and want to remain independent and involved in the community. There is an anticipated coming
          need to supply community-based independent living options for these individuals.

Assisted Rental Housing “At Risk” of Conversion
Introduction
State law requires the analysis of, and a program for, preserving assisted housing developments and at-
risk units that could be lost over the next ten years and adequately planning for preventing or minimizing
tenant displacement and reduction in the local affordable housing stock. At-risk units are defined as
multifamily rental housing complexes that receive government assistance and which are eligible to convert
to market-rate due to the expiration of some types of affordability restrictions, such as termination of
subsidy contract, mortgage prepayment, or expiring use restrictions. The following at-risk analysis covers
the 10-year period between 2015 and 2025.
Inventory of Affordable Rental Housing Units Receiving Government Assistance
The following table inventories all the government assisted rental properties in the City, not including
Section 8 vouchers used for individual unit rental subsidies that are dispersed throughout the City.

**Until December 31, 2020, Fosters Landing must provide 74 below market rate units. The requirements then taper
down, with fewer units each year, ending December 31, 2023.
Identification of Rental Units At-Risk of Conversion to Market Rate
The majority of Foster City’s affordable housing inventory is at a low-risk with many of the existing
developments secure in perpetuity. However, Foster’s Landing, a large development for families and
elderly residents with 74 affordable units, has a restriction agreement that will begin to expire on December
31, 2020. By January 2024, the developer will not be required to have any affordable units. These 74 units
are considered to be at risk for conversion to market rate within the next ten years.

Preservation of Existing At-Risk Affordable Housing Stock
California state law requires that housing elements analyze options to preserve at-risk units. The following
analysis compares various preservation methods and their costs.
 Acquisition. One method to preserve affordable housing for the long term is to acquire the at-risk units or
acquire a covenant restricting the units and partner with a local non-profit organization to manage the units.
Another approach would be to acquire an equivalent number of units at another location and apply similar
affordability restrictions to replace the at-risk units.

The 2013 sale of the Harbor Cove Apartments provides a benchmark to use for estimating the current
market value of the 74 affordable at-risk units at Fosters Landing. Harbor Cove sold for $138 million for 400
units, or $345,000 per unit. The mix of one- and two-bedroom units is similar to Fosters Landing.

Rental Assistance. Another method to preserve at-risk units is to substitute Section 8 or other rental
subsidy funding. Such funding is not currently available and new funding sources would need to be
secured. The City of Foster City does not have funds available to subsidize the rent for tenants to remain in
their current at-risk units. The estimated total annual subsidy to maintain the units for very low-income
households is estimated to be approximately $1,100,000 as indicated in the table below.

Construction of Replacement Units. When preservation is not feasible, the City may also consider the cost
of producing new low-income housing units. The construction of new housing can vary greatly depending
on location, density, unit size, construction material and on-site and off-site improvements. As indicated in
the table below, assuming a development cost of $485/sq. ft., the estimated cost to replace 74 affordable
at-risk units would be approximately $31 million.

The per unit replacement cost is similar to the per unit cost to produce a unit of affordable housing
estimated by ABAG in “Affordable Housing Funding Gap Analysis,” published February 19, 2014. The
ABAG study estimated the range of cost per unit from $223,000 to $611,000 with an average of $349,000
per unit, based on a survey of 27 affordable housing developments built in the Bay Area between 2007-
2012 representing a variety of project types.
Resources to Preserve At-Risk Units
Efforts by the City to retain affordable housing must be able to draw upon two basic types of preservation
resources: organizational and financial. Pursuant to California Government Code Section 65863.11,
owners of government-assisted projects cannot terminate subsidy contracts, prepay a federally-assisted
mortgage, or discontinue use restrictions without first providing an exclusive Notice of Opportunity to
Submit an Offer to Purchase. This Notice is required to be sent to Qualified Entities at least twelve months
prior to sale or termination of use restrictions. Qualified Entities are nonprofit or for profit organizations or
individuals that agree to maintain the long-term affordability of projects. HCD maintains a list of Qualified
Entities who are interested in purchasing government-subsidized multifamily housing projects. The list is
periodically updated. A number of qualified agencies are listed in the table below.

Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA)
Within each Housing Element, the State mandates that local governments plan for their share of the
region’s housing need for all income categories. In the case of the San Francisco Bay Area, the
Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) and the State Housing and Community Development
Department (HCD) determine the number of housing units that should be produced in the region. This
determination of need is primarily based on estimated job growth. ABAG then allocates that need for each
jurisdiction.
State law regarding Housing Elements was changed in 2004 to allow cities within a county to join together
to form a “sub-region,” which would administer the State mandated RHNA process at the local level. This
law allows the sub-region to receive the sub-regional collective housing allocation from ABAG and then
decide on and implement its own methodology to apportion the allocation among the member cities and
county. In San Mateo County, the sub-regional RHNA process has been used to establish the housing
need numbers for each jurisdiction’s Housing Element update for both the 2007-2014 and 2015-2023
Housing Element planning periods.
For the current Housing Element update, the County of San Mateo, in partnership with all twenty cities in
the County, formed a sub-region responsible for completing its own RHNA process. At its meeting of
February 22, 2011, the City Council authorized Foster City to participate in the Countywide sub-region.
The San Mateo County sub-region considered several methods for allocating the RHNA to its member
jurisdictions. The San Mateo County sub-region adopted a draft methodology and submitted it to ABAG on
July 26, 2012.
Based on the allocation methodology, the San Mateo sub-region then apportioned the housing need to the
individual jurisdictions. The adopted sub-regional methodology, similar to ABAG’s methodology for the
current and previous RHNA processes, uses weighted factors to develop mathematical equations.
Weighted factors include household growth, employment growth, household/employment growth near
transit, and regional income allocations. These factors are derived using demographic information,
projections, regulations, objectives and policies. The sub-regional allocations are then distributed using
these weighted factors for the individual cities.
At their meeting on December 17, 2012, the City Council adopted a resolution accepting the assigned
housing share of 430 units for Foster City for 2014-2022 (for the 2015-2023 planning period). In addition to

determining each jurisdiction’s overall housing allocation, the units are also required to be distributed
according to income level (e.g., very low, low, and moderate).
The State limits for the low-, very low-, and moderate-income categories are derived from the income limits
updated annually by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the California
Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD). The income limits are based on the median
income for the County and are adjusted for household size. Very low-income is defined as a household
earning less than 50% of the median income. Low-income is defined as a household earning 50-80% of
the median income. Moderate-income is a household earning 80-120% of the median income. For San
Mateo County in 2014, the median income for a family of four is $103,000. Because San Mateo County is
considered a high cost area, HUD and HCD make some adjustments when calculating the income limits,
which results in the very-low income and low-income limits actually being higher than 50% and 80% of the
median income, respectively.
Below is a summary of the very low, low and moderate income levels, based on household size, for San
Mateo County.

As shown above, approximately 54 percent of all housing is required to be affordable to low- and very low-
income households. The percentage of affordable housing being required is significantly higher than
required for the last Housing Element.
In addition, it is estimated that 50% of the City’s Very Low Income housing need for the 2015-2023 time
period will be for households earning less than 30% of median income (considered “Extremely Low
Income” per the definitions). Thus, the number of extremely low-income households needing housing for
the 2015-2023 planning period, is estimated at 74 units. Housing types available and suitable for
Extremely Low Income households include apartments, emergency shelters, supportive housing and
transitional housing. The Housing Element includes several programs to address Extremely Low Income
Adopted — February 2, 2015                                                                                  Page 4-21

Existing Unit Purchase Program and the Homeshare Program.
New Housing (Available Land Inventory)
State law requires that the Housing Element identify housing opportunities for each jurisdiction’s share of
the region’s housing needs. Given the pipeline of projects under construction, under review and potential
for increased density at existing apartment developments, staff believes that the City will have the capacity
to meet the 430 units required of Foster City, as well as provide the needed units in the income categories
specified in the RHNA. Increased density at existing apartment developments is allowed under the current
zoning regulations through the use of density bonus with additional density allowed pursuant to the
proposed Affordable Housing Overlay (AHO) zone discussed later in this section.
Approved Housing Developments
A portion of Foster City’s RHNA will be met by housing developments that are already approved and/or
under construction. Jurisdictions may count units approved or constructed since January 1, 2014 toward
the RHNA for the 2015-2023 planning period. For Foster City, this will include the remaining three phases
of the Pilgrim Triton Master Plan (Triton Pointe, Waverly and Phase C) and the Foster Square
development, which together will produce 820 housing units, with 20% of those units being affordable. In
addition, six second units, which are allowed “by right” are projected in the R-1 District, bringing the total to
826 housing units.
The City is also required to demonstrate how units will be provided according to income level (e.g., very
low, low, and moderate). Housing Element Program H-E-2-a requires twenty percent of units developed in
the City to be affordable to very low-, low- or moderate-income households. Based on development
agreements that obligate the developers of Pilgrim Triton and Foster Square to provide affordable housing,
plus the anticipated six second units, 158 affordable units are projected.
Below is a summary of the sites already approved for new housing.

As shown above, expected below market rate units from the approved developments will help satisfy the
very low-, low- and moderate-income requirements. Based on the table above, there is a remaining
shortage of affordable units that will need to be met at other sites. The approved housing developments
are discussed in more detail below, followed by a discussion of other sites with potential for additional
housing.

for-sale units, 66 income-restricted units, and up to 155 assisted/independent living units, as
well as approximately 35,000 square feet of commercial uses, a public plaza, and a shared
surface parking lot proposed along Foster City Boulevard.
Location: 15 acres bounded by Foster City Boulevard, Shell Boulevard, North Peninsula Jewish Campus
and the Government Center.
Existing Use: Vacant.
Status: According to the General Development Plan phasing, the proposed Foster Square development
is divided into three phases. Phase 1 includes the Assisted Living, Affordable Housing, Shell
Boulevard Gathering Area, Town Plaza, the retail, parking lot and the Foster Square
Condominiums adjacent to Shell Boulevard. Phases 2 and 3 include development of the
remaining condominiums. Additionally, the sale of the Foster Square property (from the City to
the New Home Company) and development of the Foster Square project are contingent on the
financing and entitlement of the assisted and independent living component (i.e., the approved
Atria project) and the affordable housing component (i.e., the approved MidPen project).
As of June 19, 2014, the following phases of Foster Square have received approval of their Specific
Development Plan/Use Permit:
        66 affordable senior apartments and 10,560 sq. ft. of retail uses by Mid-Peninsula Housing
         (approved January 16, 2014)
        155 assisted/independent living units and 20,000 sq ft. commercial uses (approved June 5, 2014)
        200 for-sale condominium units (approved June 19 2014)
        Public realm improvements (approve June 19, 2014)
Grading is underway as of mid-2014. Construction is expected to begin in December 2014.
(5) Second Units
Second units are allowed “by right” in the R-1 District, provided they meet the criteria in Chapter 17.78 of
the Foster City Municipal Code. Six units are anticipated in the 10-year planning period for the Housing
Element. These units are anticipated to be affordable to lower-income households. According to a study
prepared for the 21 Elements project, Affordability of Secondary Dwelling Units, secondary units are a
more affordable option for lower income households, largely because approximately 25-55% of secondary
units are available for free to family members or domestic workers. After reviewing all available data, the
study makes the following conclusions:
     Approximately 25-60% of secondary units are affordable to extremely low-income households.
     An additional approximately 10-25% of secondary units are affordable to very low-income
         households.
     Another approximately 15-20% of secondary units are affordable to low-income households.
     Approximately 10-20% more of secondary units are affordable to moderate-income households.
The City projects six second units within the planning period, including four very low-income units, one low-
income unit and one moderate-income unit.
Applications or Inquiries Regarding General Plan Amendments to Allow Additional Housing
There are several housing proposals that are in various stages of consideration, ranging from preliminary
inquiries to submitted applications; however each of these would require an amendment to the General
Adopted — February 2, 2015                                                                                  Page 4-25

Plan Land Use Plan designations from commercial to housing or mixed use. Although some or all of these
might eventually be approved, for the purposes of addressing the RHNA in this Housing Element, these
sites will not be considered housing sites unless and until the General Plan Land Use Plan designations
are changed to allow housing. This will allow the Planning Commission, City Council and the community to
consider these applications pursuant to the normal development review process, including the required
environmental review. To otherwise include these sites as housing sites in the Housing Element would
commit the City to rezoning them within three years after the earlier of: 1) 90 days after receipt of
comments from HCD on the draft housing element or 2) adoption of the Housing Element. If a city fails to
adopt a housing element, then the rezonings must be completed no later than three years and 120 days
from the statutory deadline. There are additional penalties for not completing the rezonings.
The sites that are the subject of current General Plan Amendment proposals for more housing include the

Increased Densities at Existing Apartment Developments
In order to find sites for additional housing to meet the RHNA, staff reviewed all of the existing apartment
developments to determine if they have potential to be redeveloped at higher densities. This approach has
several advantages:
         Retention of the existing basic land use patterns in the City;
         Not requiring an amendment of the General Plan Land Use Plan designations;
         Encouraging owners to invest in repairs/upgrades to older buildings.
The potential disadvantage would be the displacement of existing residents. Policies and programs are
included in the Housing Element to minimize the potential for displacement.
Included in this group is the Harbor Cove development which has an application pending to utilize density
bonus regulations to provide additional units within the existing building envelopes. Harbor Cove was
originally designed with very generous lobby/common areas that are now being proposed to be
reconfigured into additional units. This is an indication that owners find it economically feasible to redevelop

existing apartment properties through the inclusion of affordable housing in order to utilize density bonus
regulations or other incentives to achieve higher densities.
In addition, discussions with the managers of the Beach Cove, Sand Cove and Shelter Cove complexes
indicate that these complexes have similar layouts that provide opportunities for additional units within the
existing building envelopes. The managers of these complexes have also indicated that they have spent
considerable time studying the economics of adding housing units, feel this approach is financially viable
and are interested in proceeding to obtain City approvals to construct the new units.
Several factors were included in the initial review of potential for redevelopment at higher density:
     Existing zoning
     Existing density
     Land area
     Age
     Adjacent uses
Existing Zoning. Almost all of the existing apartment developments are zoned R-3 (Medium Density
Multiple Family Residence District) or R-3/PD, which allows 20 units per acre. There are five exceptions:
     Waters Edge is zoned R-4/PD (High Density Multiple Family Residence District/Planned
         Development), which allows 35 units per acre.
     Miramar is zoned R-4/PD
     Shadow Cove is zoned R-4/PD
     Beach Cove is zoned R-4/PD
     Metro Senior Apartments is zoned C-2/PD/SHO (Town Center Commercial/Planned
         Development/Senior Housing Overlay)
     Marlin Cove is zoned CM/PD (Commercial Mix/Planned Development)
     Pilgrim Triton is zoned CM/PD
Existing Density. Sites with lower existing densities may be more likely to consider redevelopment if they
can increase their density. Many of the older apartment developments have a density of more than 20
units/acre even though they are zoned R-3, so their “base density” for considering additional density would
be the higher of the allowed density or the existing density.
Land Area. Staff reviewed the size of the sites as well as the adjacent uses. Smaller sites that border
single-family development would be difficult to develop at increased densities without adversely impacting
the adjacent uses. A larger site could mitigate potential impacts with increased setbacks and/or lower
heights near the adjacent development.
Age. The older apartment developments are believed to be more likely to be considering making
significant investments in either upgrading or redeveloping their property in order to remain competitive in
the marketplace and/or to correct existing problems.
Adjacent uses. Sites that border less dense uses, such as single-family development, will need to have
larger setbacks and adjust building massing compared to sites that border streets and/or the lagoon.
Based on this analysis, staff recommends the following apartment developments for consideration as sites
with potential for redevelopment at higher densities:

Density Bonus Regulations
The City’s adopted density bonus regulations in Chapter 17.86 of the Foster City Municipal Code provide
the opportunity to achieve a 20%-35% density bonus above the otherwise allowed density in return for
providing affordable housing. As discussed above, the owners of Harbor Cove Apartments have submitted
an application for additional housing units using the density bonus regulations. The Harbor Cove
application includes a 20% density bonus through the inclusion of 5% very low-income units.
The table below shows the potential for additional units using a 20% density bonus at the five sites
identified by staff as having the best potential for additional housing units. In addition to the developments
listed, any other existing residential development would be eligible to utilize the density bonus regulations
to provide 20-35% additional housing units.

*Distribution of very low- and low-income units is assumed. Developer can achieve a 20% density bonus with either
5% very low-income or 10% low-income units.
Although development at all of these sites with a 20% density bonus could meet the RHNA for most of the
very low- and low-income housing, and some of the “excess” low-income units and/or market units might
be able to “count” as moderate-income units, it would not provide a sufficient excess buffer as required by
the Housing and Community Development Department in order for the Housing Element to be certified.
Affordable Housing Overlay Combining District
A mechanism employed by other jurisdictions to encourage redevelopment of existing developed sites is
an Affordable Housing Overlay (AHO) Combining District. The AHO District provides different incentives
than the existing density bonus regulations, including the ability to combine incentives from more than one
income category and to achieve an increased density higher than the 35% maximum increase allowed
under density bonus law.
Minimum and Maximum Density Increases. State law requires that the Housing Element include an
analysis of economic feasibility for the provision of affordable units unless the jurisdiction utilizes the
“default density option.” This density has been “deemed appropriate to accommodate housing for lower
income households.” For Foster City, the “default density” is 30 units/acre. In order to provide at least a 30
units/acre minimum density under the AHO, staff recommends that the “base density” for properties in the
AHO be either the existing density or 23 units/acre, whichever is greater, and that the minimum density
increase will be 36% of the base density, which will provide a minimum density of 31.25 units/acre.
The AHO will allow additional density from a minimum 36% increase from the base density to a maximum
of a 52% increase. The maximum 52% density increase applied to 23 units/acre is 35 units/acre. As a
comparison to already developed sites, the density of the Miramar Apartments is 38.31 units/acre, Marlin
Cove is 33.41 units/acre and Triton Plaza is 50 units/acre.
The AHO provides for an increase in density in exchange for the provision of affordable housing. Utilizing
the same incentive tables that are provided in density bonus law plus additional options included in the
AHO regulations, the percentage of density increase above the base density is calculated. When the AHO
is applied to an existing residential development, the percentage of affordable units is calculated from the
existing number of units. For example, if an existing development of 100 units provided 9% very low-
income units, an increase in density of 30% could be achieved.

In order to qualify for the minimum 36% density increase, the same tables in the density bonus law are
used but additional options are provided to allow a combination of very low- and low-income units and
increased density is provided for smaller numbers of units than in the density bonus law.
The AHO will provide for a maximum allowable density increase of 52%, which would allow a maximum
density of 35 units/acre on sites currently developed with less than 23 units/acre. These maximum
densities are similar to the densities approved at Marlin Cove and Miramar and less than the density
approved at Triton Plaza. The sites do not have physical constraints, such as shape or topography that
would preclude development at these densities.
Income Ranges. For rental developments, only very low- and low-income units would qualify the
development for increased density. For-sale units would be able to provide moderate-income units to
obtain increased density. The AHO requires that for rental projects, a range of income levels including both
very low- and low-income units be provided; including that a minimum of 25% of the BMR units must be
very low-income (which includes extremely low-income) and at least 15% must be extremely low-income.
For ownership units, the BMR units may be all moderate-income or a mix.
Review Process and “By Right” Residential Use. The proposed Affordable Housing Overlay (AHO) Zone
includes a provision to establish the minimum 36% density increase as allowed “by right,” in other words,
with only a Use Permit to review the site plan, architecture and landscape plan, even if the PD Planned
Development zoning would otherwise require a General Development Plan. The elimination of the
otherwise required Rezoning/General Development Plan process will significantly shorten the time required
to review the proposal. Design criteria will be included in the AHO and/or accompanying Design Guidelines
to guide the Planning Commission’s consideration. The Planning Commission would not have the
discretion to disapprove the proposal if it complies with the design criteria.
Development Incentives. The AHO Zone will include various other incentives, summarized in the table
below.

       1. Minimum under Proposed Affordable Housing Overlay Zone. The base density provided in the
           AHO regulations is 23 units/acre. To achieve the minimum 36% density increase above the base
           density, a combination of extremely low-, very low- and low-income units are required. There are
           several combinations of extremely low-, very low- and low-income units that could be utilized to
           achieve at least the 36% minimum additional density. Example calculations for the achieving the
           36% additional density are contained below:
           4% very low-income units (including extremely-low income) x 416 existing units provides 17.5%
                additional density
           9% low-income units x 416 existing units provides 18.5% additional density
           Total = 36% additional density
           4% very low-income units x 416 existing units = 16.64, rounded to 17 very low-income units
                (including extremely low-income)
           9% low-income units x 416 existing units = 37.44, rounded to 38 low-income units
           Total = 55 affordable units
           15% minimum extremely low-income units x 55 affordable units = 8.25; rounded to 9 extremely
                low-income units
           17 total very low-income units (including extremely low-income) - 9 extremely low-income units =
                8 units remainder very low-income units
           25% minimum very low-income units x 55 affordable units = 13.75, rounded to 14 very low-
                income units (17 units are provided, which exceeds minimum)
           This example development is also shown in the table below:

         The base density of 23 units/acre with the 36% additional density results in a density of 31.25
         units/acre, which on the Beach Cove 18.7 acre site would result in a total of 585 units, or an
         increase of 169 units over the existing 416 units.

            Total = 53% additional density (but 52% is the maximum)
            6% very low-income units x 416 existing units = 24.96, rounded to 25 very low-income units
            17% low-income units x 416 existing units = 70.72, rounded to 71 low-income units
            Total = 96 affordable units

Combination of Existing Approvals, Harbor Cove Proposal and AHO to Address Regional Housing
Needs Allocation
A combination of the existing approvals for developments, the Harbor Cove Density Bonus proposal and
the Affordable Housing Overlay Zone will be utilized to address the RHNA. The Harbor Cove proposal for a
20% density bonus of 80 new units using existing density bonus regulations is included as a projected new
housing development. Harbor Cove is not proposed to be rezoned with the AHO.
The application of the proposed AHO to the other four existing apartment sites identified would result in a
potential for 549 to 752 new housing units, as indicated in the table below. When the potential new units
that could be developed at the four housing sites with the AHO are combined with the existing approvals
and projected units, the result is a potential for 1,659 new housing units, as indicated in the table below.
Because the minimum density would be higher than 30 units/acre, the City is allowed to use a streamlined
approach without the need for additional analysis of the financial feasibility of providing units at each of the
required income levels included in the RHNA. In other words, the default density is deemed appropriate to
accommodate housing for lower income households.

 The last phase of the Pilgrim Triton Master Plan is designated for 17 units by the Pilgrim Triton Master Plan (General
Development Plan) but has not yet submitted site, architectural and landscape plans for their final review. The
distribution of 20% below market rate (BMR) units among the income ranges is an estimate.

 Harbor Cove is included consistent with their application under review.
4
 The distribution of second units by income category is based on “Affordability of Secondary Dwelling Units,” prepared
by 21 Elements (included in Appendices).
5
 The distribution of affordable units by income category under the AHO is assumed, based on a combination that can
achieve 52% increased density (6% very low-income and 17% low-income).
Because the City will provide the opportunity for up to 1,662 new housing units on sites zoned at the
“default density” of 30 or more units per acre, this density is deemed appropriate to accommodate housing
for lower income (very low- and low-income) as well as moderate-income households.
Review Process/Guidelines for Development Review Under the AHO
The California Housing and Community Development Department requires that if the identified housing
sites are not zoned to allow the projected housing at the time the Housing Element is adopted, then the
jurisdiction must allow sufficient housing “by right.” The following programs are included in the Draft
Housing Element to direct the implementation of the AHO in a way that is appropriate for Foster City.
              H-D-2-b      Affordable Housing Overlay Zone. Program: Adopt and implement an Affordable
                           Housing Overlay (AHO) Combining District to encourage the production of additional
                           housing units, including affordable units. The AHO will require a minimum density of
                           31.25 units per acre (36% increase over the base density of 23 units/acre) “by right,”
                           subject to demonstrating compliance with criteria to ensure compatibility with
                           adjacent uses. Target: 2015. Responsible Agency: Community Development
                           Department, Planning Commission, City Council
              H-D-2-c      Rezoning with Affordable Housing Overlay Zone. Rezone selected housing sites
                           with the AHO to encourage redevelopment of existing, older apartments with
                           additional housing in a manner appropriate to their neighborhood and surrounding
                           development. Target: 2015. Responsible Agency: Community Development
                           Department, Planning Commission, City Council.
              H-D-2-d      Design Criteria for Affordable Housing Overlay Zone. Develop criteria to be used
                           by the Planning Commission in the review of developments pursuant to the AHO that
                           ensures:
                            Site plans, landscaping and structures are developed with a character that is
                               consistent with the quality of the City’s neighborhoods.
                            Building scale, setbacks and massing and other features are utilized to minimize
                               the impacts on adjacent development.
                            In mixed affordability developments, affordable units are dispersed and
                               indistinguishable from market rate units.

Potential Non-Governmental Constraints to Housing
State law requires that the Housing Element include a discussion of the factors that present barriers to the
production of housing, including government actions and market forces (non-governmental constraints).
Identification of these constraints helps cities implement measures that address these concerns and
reduce their impacts on the production of housing.
Cost of Mortgage Financing
Home mortgage financing is readily available at attractive rates throughout San Mateo County and
California. As part of the aftermath of the subprime crisis in 2008, interest rates are very low. In San Mateo
County, rates range from 4.0-4.5 percent for a fixed-rate, 30-year mortgage. One remaining challenge is
that many mortgages in San Mateo County are for more than $417,000 qualifying them as jumbo loans
with often higher interest rates.
Small changes in the interest rate for home purchases dramatically affect affordability. A 30 year home
loan for the median priced condominium in Foster City ($660,000) at four percent interest, has monthly
payments of roughly $3,611. The table below shows the costs at various interest rates for condominiums
and single family homes.

Also, people with short credit history, lower incomes or self-employment incomes, or those with other
unusual circumstances, often have had trouble qualifying for a loan. The data in the table below is from the
Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) and represents loan applications in 2012 for one to four-unit
properties, as well as manufactured homes. More than 65 percent of the loan applications were filled by
households earning above a moderate income (greater than 120 percent of AMI). Moderate income
households (80-120 percent of AMI) represented 18 percent of loan applicants, low income households
(50-80 percent of AMI) represent 12 percent, and very low income households (less than 50 percent of
AMI) only 4 percent. Almost 75 percent al all loans were approved and accepted by the applicants, and 10
percent were denied. Above moderate-income households had the highest rates of approval of any group.
Loan approval rates have improved since the subprime crisis.

Construction loans for new housing are difficult to secure in the current market. In past years, lenders
would provide up to 80 percent of the cost of new construction (loan to value ratio). In recent years, due to
market conditions and government regulations, banks require larger investments by the builder.
Due to Federal and State budget cuts, affordable housing developers have had a much harder time
securing funding. Since 2009, the federal government has cut programs such as Community Development
Block Grants, HOME, and HOPE VI funding by 27-50 percent (ABAG). Traditionally, these programs have
been a large source of affordable housing funds. In addition to Federal cuts, the State dissolved
redevelopment agencies in 2012, leaving San Mateo County with a loss of 25.5 million in funds for
affordable housing. However, Low Income Housing Tax Credits still provide an important source of funding,
so it is important for jurisdictions to consider which sites are eligible for affordable housing development.
Mid-Peninsula Housing has agreed to help jurisdictions identify appropriate sites.
Land and Construction Costs
Land cost is a significant component of the total housing development costs. Due in part to the desirability
of the region and because land is in short supply, land costs in San Mateo County are high. These costs
vary both between and within jurisdictions based on factors like the desirability of the location and the
permitted density with, multifamily and mixed-use land costing more. For typical multi-family construction in
San Mateo County, land costs add approximately $90,000 per unit. Land for a single-family home often
costs $400,000 or more per lot.
For San Mateo County, construction costs for multi-unit buildings vary based on the form of parking
(structure vs. surface) in addition to other environmental factors such as topography, pre-existing structures
etc. For a larger, multi-unit building, costs can vary from $185,000/unit to as high as $316,000/unit. The
cost per square foot ranges from $172-$200.
For the least expensive production single-family homes, the cost of preparing the vacant land is around
$100,000/lot and the costs of construction is approximately $145/sf. However, for more expensive, custom
homes, construction costs can be higher than $435/sf.1. All of these costs are exclusive of land, permits or

professional fees.
Construction costs include both hard costs, such as labor and materials, and soft costs, such as
architectural and engineering services, development fees and insurance. For multifamily homes in San
Mateo County, hard costs account for 60-65 percent of the building cost and soft costs average around 15-
20 percent (the remaining 15-20 percent is land costs). For single family homes, hard costs often are
roughly 40 percent of the total cost, soft costs are 20 percent and land is the remainder.

Costs can change dramatically over time. For instance, in late 2008/ early 2009, construction costs
dropped roughly ten percent.
Availability of Construction Labor
A factor contributing to the high construction costs on the Peninsula is the scarcity of construction labor.
Contractors have difficulty attracting and retaining workers because most cannot afford to live in the area
on construction labor wages. Many construction workers have to commute long distances from their jobs to
more affordable housing.
Neighborhood Opposition
Opposition from neighbors can be a significant obstacle to obtaining approvals for new housing
developments. Most notably, developments that are high-density, multi-family developments, supportive
housing, and low-income housing draw the most public opposition because they are perceived to increase
traffic, increase crime, and diminish property values. However, studies show that well managed affordable
housing developments have not caused such problems for their neighborhoods. City officials and
developers can work to assuage these concerns by requiring design review, emphasizing management of
new development, and engaging in public education to address myths about high density/low-income
/supportive housing (HCD). Undergoing a thorough public planning process to address and develop clear
and explicit requirements can combat public opposition.
Non-Governmental Constraints to Housing Production Specific to Foster City
Geologic conditions. Foster City is entirely a land-fill community located along and over the San Francisco
Bay. At this point in its development, the City is almost entirely built-out. On average, Citywide, the depth of
soil above the Bay mud is only about four (4) feet. The result is that the soils throughout the City are very
brackish and when developed begin to corrode underground infrastructure. This is not a problem for sites
Page 4-40                                                                                     Adopted —February 2, 2015

Housing Goals, Policies and Programs                                                        Chapter 4: Housing Element
developed in the last 25 years because they were constructed using appropriate materials, but for older
sites—those most likely to be redeveloped for housing-- all or most of the originally placed infrastructure
must be removed and replaced adding additional costs to projects. Additionally, as part of the site
preparation once a site is cleared, it is not uncommon to have to address problems associated with (minor)
land subsidence, requiring the re-compaction of site soils and associated additional site preparation costs.
Because the City is constructed on land-fill, constructing residential projects at the densities required in
order to amortize the costs of redeveloping a site, replacing all or most underground infrastructure, and
other site preparation issues, most new multi-story buildings must be constructed on a pile supported
foundation, which constitutes an expense that is not common to residential development in most cities.
Further, with the exception of the Foster Square site, there is no vacant land left which is appropriately
zoned for the development of new housing. Planning efforts to increase housing production require the
redevelopment of existing underutilized residential sites or failing commercial properties.
Electric transmission lines. Electric transmission lines traverse large and various areas of Foster City
including areas zoned for housing and commercial use. Because of the limitations imposed by PG&E
regarding the distance that residential units must maintain from the “swing line” of the power lines and the
very limited number and height of uses that can be placed within the power line easement-area beneath
the transmission lines, large portions of sites that may otherwise lend themselves to housing production
cannot be developed and may only be used as at-grade parking, resulting in a lower yield of units per gross
acre than would otherwise be possible. This condition reduces the number of attractive sites that land-
development firms would be interested in redeveloping.
School capacity. The San Mateo Foster City School District (SMFCSD) operates 20 schools serving the
communities of San Mateo and Foster City, including 16 elementary and four middle schools. The public
elementary and middle schools serving Foster City are Audubon Elementary School, Bowditch Middle
School, Brewer Island Elementary School and Foster City Elementary School. Increasing school
enrollments have resulted in SMFCSD looking for ways to increase school capacities. In November 2013,
the District asked the community to support Measure P, a general obligation bond that would have
increased school capacity by an additional 1,050 seats; upgrade classroom technology; and, provide for
District-wide solar energy efficiency. The bond measure did not pass. The District has appointed a Next
Steps Advisory Committee to engage the external and internal communities of the SMFCSD to generate
other options for addressing school capacity and equity issues created as student enrollment continues to
grow.
The current projection rate as of June 2014 for elementary school students in Foster City is 0.10 students
per multi-family housing unit (Tom Williams, Demographer for SMFCSD).
The San Mateo Union High School District (SMUHSD) provides high school education to the communities
of Burlingame, Foster City, Hillsborough, Millbrae, San Mateo, and San Bruno. The SMUHSD operates six
high schools, one continuation high school, one alternative education school and one adult school. Aragon
High School, Hillsdale High School and San Mateo High School, all located in San Mateo are the primary
public high schools attended by Foster City students. The District assigns capacities for each school and
reserves the right to assign students to other schools in the District if the school they request is at capacity.
New housing developments are required to pay school impact fees to help provide funding for capital
facilities for the school system. As of 2014, the school impact fees are $2.01 per housing unit for the
SMFCSD and $1.28 for the SMUHSD.

Potential Governmental Constraints to Housing
Most larger development sites are processed under the City’s PD (Planned Development District) zoning
which provides an extensive amount of flexibility in responding to City requirements for density, unit size,
parking and landscaping requirements. PD zoning (Section 17.36 of the Foster City Municipal Code) allows
the Planning Commission the flexibility to modify or waive development standards for: (1) density; (2)
minimum building site, lot size, floor area and yards; (3) maximum building site coverage and maximum
building height; (4) setbacks; and (5) any other minimum or maximum standards.
In the past, the City has achieved successes in providing affordable housing through a negotiated project
review process whereby specific incentives and “trade-offs” are tailored to individual project circumstances
to provide the greatest amount of affordable housing. In this process, the City seeks to leverage project
needs to negotiate as much affordable housing as is financially possible. It should be noted that this
process has resulted in a significant number of very low income affordable housing units and not just low
and moderate income units, as is the case for the inclusionary requirements in most Bay Area cities.
In the past, available funding through the City’s Community Development Agency (CDA) played a major
role in stimulating the production of affordable housing. In implementing this public/private partnership
approach designed to increase the opportunity for affordable housing, the CDA and the City provided
developers with the following incentives: (1) structured development agreements and CDA funding to
coincide with other subsidy program funding criteria; (2) technical assistance in structuring the affordable
housing program to best fit City needs; (3) tax increment funds, either up-front or long-term, to assure the
affordability of the units to an equal distribution of very low, low and moderate income households; (4)
increased density; (5) below Zoning Ordinance required unit sizes; (6), use of shared parking; and (7) use
of tax increment to pay for City fees.
However, the loss of CDA funding for affordable housing resulting from the State’s dissolution of
redevelopment agencies has made it more difficult for the City to provide financial incentives for affordable
housing.
Development Standards
There are many locally imposed land use and building requirements that can affect the type, appearance,
and cost of housing built in Foster City. These local requirements include zoning design standards,
development fees, parking requirements, subdivision design standards, and architectural review. Other
building and design requirements imposed by Foster City follow the state laws, the Uniform Building Code,
Subdivision Map Act, energy conservation requirements, etc. Development standards related to the various
zoning districts that allow residential development are summarized in the table, Development Standards for
Residential Zoning Districts, below.

Foster City makes extensive use of the PD, Planned Development, and Combining District to allow the
City's development standards to be tailored to each development. All of the existing developments
containing affordable housing were developed by utilizing the flexibility provided by the PD District. The
District was "established to allow flexibility of design which is in accordance with the objectives and spirit of
the General Plan." (Section 17.36.010, Foster City Municipal Code) The process requires that a General
Development Plan be adopted to serve as part of the zoning map for the site. This is followed by a Specific
Development Plan (Use Permit) for the site. The PD regulations allow the Planning Commission to grant
waivers to the following standards without being processed under a variance procedure:
              a. Minimum building site
              b. Minimum lot dimension
              c. Maximum building site coverage

                   of off-street parking requirements (10% parking waivers are allowed under a separate
                   section)
The Off-Street Parking Requirements (Section 17.62 of the Foster City Municipal Code) of the City allow
alternative means to address parking needs, including: (1) shared parking; (2) off-site parking; (3)
Transportation Systems Management (TSM) programs; (4) “in-lieu” parking fees; and (5) credit for bicycle
and motorcycle stalls. Parking standards are based on unit type and number of bedrooms.
A program is included in the Housing Element to reevaluate the City's parking requirements to determine
whether, how and when to modify parking requirements to allow higher densities and reduce housing costs
in areas appropriate for reduced parking requirements. The Senior Housing Overlay District (Section 17.37
of the Foster City Municipal Code) also provides incentives for reduced parking requirements down to 1
space per unit (includes unit and guest parking), in addition to other incentives, such as fee
waivers/reductions, density bonus and priority fast track processing.
As with other cities, Foster City’s development standards and requirements are intended to protect the
long-term health, safety and welfare of the community. In addition, the flexibility provided through P-D
zoning offers even more incentives and opportunities for individual projects. The Housing Element includes
programs to reevaluate existing development standards to determine whether they should be revised so
that they provide less of a barrier to the provision of affordable housing but still protect the long-term health,
safety and welfare of the community.
Below is a comparison with other San Mateo County Jurisdictions, which indicates Foster City’s parking
standards are fairly average. The information is taken from the 21 Elements project, which is a
collaborative effort involving all the jurisdictions in Marin County in assessing housing needs and issues for
their respective housing elements. Comparative data on potential governmental constraints is provided on

Processing fees are required for all property improvement and development applications, pursuant to City
Council policy to recover processing costs of development review. The City’s development permit fee
structure does not seem to be an impediment to development. Permit Fees in Foster City are similar to

The park in-lieu fee was established in 1984 to ensure that new residential developments contribute to the
City’s park system with park land dedication, credit for on-site facilities or in-lieu fee payments. The
requirements are based on a standard of 5 acres per 1,000 population as the amount of park land to be
provided either by land dedication, credit for on-site facilities, or in-lieu fee. This is the maximum standard
allowed under Section 66477 et. seq. of the California Government Code (Quimby Act) for subdivision-
related park dedication/fee requirements. The formula calculates how many people are expected to live in
the development, then calculates the acres of park land “owed” based on a rate of 5 acres/1000 population,
then calculates the dollar value of the park land owed, minus up to 50% credit for on-site facilities. During

review of the Miramar and Marlin Cove apartment developments, it became apparent that the high land
values result in a much higher in-lieu fee than in previous years, especially for a high density multi-family
development. The park in-lieu fee will be reviewed as part of Housing Program HD-9-a to review
processing fees and other potential government constraints to housing development.
The City of Foster City / Estero Municipal Improvement District creates an annual fees and charges
schedule that is approved by the City Council / District Board. The Master Fee Schedule is available on the
City website. The City’s current fee schedule is contained in the Appendix. The link for the fees that went
into effect on July 1, 2013 is http://www.fostercity.org/departmentsanddivisions/finance/upload/Master-
Fees-Schedule-2013-2014-FINALa.pdf . Development fees for smaller projects are specific to the
application. Fees for larger projects that require Planning Commission and/or City Council review are
generally charged based on the staff and/or consultant time it takes to process the application.
Development Processing Time
The City recognizes that the time required to process a development proposal can be a barrier to housing
production if it is lengthy. The City has streamlined its development review process over the years to make
it more efficient, while still providing adequate opportunity for public review and input.
Foster City is a "Planned Community" that has been constructed and implemented on the basis of an
organized program of development that was conceived over 40 years ago. The City was originally
designed to be a suburban community with a clear community center (Metro Center) and an industrial base
to support required services. The plan envisioned a self-contained, balanced community with a variety of
housing types, waterfront lots and parks, an internal lagoon for public recreation, marinas, offices, stores,
industry and public services.
The City was to be developed as a cluster of nine residential neighborhoods, a commercial/governmental
center, an industrial area and neighborhood shopping centers. Most of the neighborhoods were planned for
a variety of housing, from single-family homes on individual lots to high density apartments. In addition, the
Town Center includes a combination of community and regional commercial services, offices, government
agencies, entertainment establishments and parks
Foster City has been purposely planned to contain a mix of housing types. In 2014, there are an estimated
12,458 housing units in Foster City, 38% of the units being single family detached homes, 20% single
family attached, 7% in structures of 2-4 units, and 35% in structures with 5 or more units. Higher density
development has resulted in most market rate rentals units being affordable to moderate income
households.
The “Planned” nature of Foster City logically extends to the use of the planned development (PD) process
for the review and approval of larger sites, both vacant and those undergoing reuse. A property’s
designation on the General Plan Land Use map serves as a guide to land use potential. Specific standards
for development, such as height, setbacks, lot coverage and uses are established by the City’s Zoning
Ordinance in the base district. The PD or planned development combining district is designed as an option
to accommodate various types of development such as housing, neighborhood or community centers or
other uses or a combination of uses, such as housing combined with commercial and offices. The district
is established to allow flexibility of design which is in accordance with the objectives and spirit of the
General Plan.
The PD process creates the opportunity for developers and the City to enter into a development agreement
prior to initiation of the PD process. PD’s linked to development agreements provide both certainty and
flexibility for developable or redevelopable sites in the City. Flexibility is provided by enabling the developer

Housing Goals, Policies and Programs                                                       Chapter 4: Housing Element
to modify the development standards, land uses, land intensities, building heights, design guidelines, etc. in
the base district to respond to area and site conditions, as well as market and development timing needs.
In general, the PD approval process involves three major steps: (1) combined review and approval of
rezoning and general development plan; (2) Specific Development Plan and Conditional Use Permit; and
(3) construction approvals. The General Development Plan, approved as part of step 1, establishes the
parameters for future development, including allowable uses, number of units, land use configuration,
circulation and building heights. This provides certainty for the future development of the site, which may
subsequently occur as one development or in phases.
The City utilizes an Inter-Departmental Evaluation Committee (IDEC) made up of representatives from
each City department to provide feedback on a project within two-three weeks of the project application.
This process eliminates future surprises that can result in delays in project processing.
Following the IDEC review, major projects are reviewed by the Planning Commission at one or more Study
Sessions. This provides the developer with an opportunity to hear and respond to concerns raised by staff,
the Planning Commission, or the public prior to the public hearing on the project. The Study Session
process can take place while the environmental assessment as required by the California Environmental
Quality Act is being performed.
Following the Study Session(s), the project is scheduled for a public hearing by the Planning Commission.
Depending on the type of application, a public hearing by the City Council may also be required. If the
project does not require an environmental impact report and the developer meets the City's submittal
requirements and is able to respond quickly to requests for redesign, the process can move quickly, with
elapsed time from Use Permit application to approval ranging from four to seven months.
An example of this process is the Pilgrim-Triton project. The project is a joint effort by three property
owners: Northwestern Mutual Life, AMB Property Corporation and Foster City Executive Park to develop
approximately 20.75 acres with a mixed use project. The General Development Plan approved by the City
Council on April 21, 2008 includes:
        Up to 296,000 square feet of commercial/industrial office use;
        Up to 730 residential units, including up to 64 live-work units; and
        A minimum of one-acre open space/plaza area.
Following the approval of the General Development Plan, the City approved the Specific Development Plan
for Phase A of the Pilgrim-Triton project (The Plaza), which consists of approximately 6.14 acres at the
northwest quadrant of the Master Plan, between the intersection of Triton and Pilgrim Drives and State
Route 92. This phase included demolition of four existing industrial office buildings at 1153, 1154, 1155 and
1157 Triton Drive for a total of 92,000 square feet. Phase A included 307 multi-family residential units,
10,000 square feet of commercial space, a centrally located open space/plaza as well as a parking garage
and surface parking spaces. The uses, maximum building height, and circulation plan have already been
established as part of the General Development Plan. As such, the processing of each phase focuses on
the design of the buildings as part of this phase and the provision of 60 below market rate units (based on
the percentage established in the General Development Plan).The review process for the Specific
Development Plans/Use Permits for Triton Pointe and the Waverly took 6 and 9 months, respectively.
Potential Constraints for Persons Living with Disabilities
The City does not have any spacing or concentration requirements related to housing for persons living

with disabilities, so as a result, this issue poses no constraint to the development of housing appropriate for
persons with disabilities. The City has several options for reducing parking requirements for housing for
persons with disabilities. One is through the PD zoning process, where flexibility is provided to enable
tailored development standards, such as parking standards, to respond to the needs of project occupants,
including persons with disabilities, seniors, etc.
The other method for addressing parking is through the City’s Senior Housing Overlay Zone, which allows
reduced parking standards for seniors, some of whom live with disabilities. This is significant since the
senior population in San Mateo County is projected to increase by 72 percent by 2030, and most seniors,
93 percent in some surveys, prefer to age in place (stay in their homes as they age) or stay in their
community. The City’s Senior Housing Overlay Zone was utilized in the Metro Center Senior Homes
development in a very successful way. The City worked with the developer in the design of the
development to fit with the location and to enable reduced parking requirements. As the photos below
show, the townhomes sit on raised landscaped berms to look to be two stories high with pitched roofs, and
line quiet residential streets nearby. Tuck-under parking is reached from behind, showing that the houses
are actually 3 stories high from the rear. This allows the development to exceed 30 units per acre including
the parking access lanes.
The adopted Reasonable Accommodation procedures provide additional ways to reduce parking or other
requirements for individuals. Thus, in total, the conclusion of this analysis is that the City’s development
standards and regulations do not pose a constraint to housing for persons living with disabilities.

Potential Constraints Posed by the City’s Inclusionary Requirements
The City applies its inclusionary requirements through a process of working with the developer and the
community to offer a number of incentives. Incentives offered by the City include density bonuses, funding
(if funds are available), development standards flexibility, and reduced processing time.
The affordable housing produced or approved since the adoption of the 2007-2014 Housing Element are
listed below, together with types of incentives that were provided.

to the taxing agencies.
The ability of jurisdictions to mandate inclusionary housing was severely restricted in 2009 with the
California Appellate Court ruling in Palmer v. City of Los Angeles, which determined that inclusionary
requirements on rental units conflicted with the 1995 Costa-Hawkins Act, which regulates rent control. The
nexus study that is being prepared for consideration of housing impact fees will provide the necessary
documentation of the impacts of the need for affordable housing to support housing impact fees or the
provision of affordable housing to off-set those impacts.
Infrastructure
The City’s infrastructure was initially designed to accommodate the ultimate build-out projections of the
City, which have not changed significantly. Water is purchased from the San Francisco Public Utilities
Commission (SFPUC) pursuant to an agreement which expires in 2034. The individual supply guarantee
for Foster City (Estero Municipal Improvement District [EMID]) is 5.9 million gallons per day (MGD).
Although the water supply agreement and accompanying water supply contract expire in 2034, the supply
assurance survives their expiration and continues indefinitely. The individual supply guarantee can be
reduced during times of drought or when the volume of water storage in SFPUC’s reservoirs falls below
certain levels. The Urban Water Management Plan prepared by EMID addresses how water rationing
and/or other measures will be used to address any temporary water shortage. The Urban Water
Management Plan includes projections for increased population as well as implementation of conservation
measures. With the implementation of the plumbing codes and other conservation measures, the water use
projection is 5.86 MGD in 2020, which is below the 5.9 MGD individual supply guarantee. Implementation

Housing Goals, Policies and Programs                                                       Chapter 4: Housing Element
of the 2013 CALGreen Building Code will further reduce water demand. Capacity of the water system is not
a limiting factor for housing development identified in the General Plan, which includes the housing
identified in the this Housing Element.
Wastewater is transported to the San Mateo/EMID Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) jointly owned by
the cities of San Mateo and Foster City. EMID’s wastewater collection system consists of more than 43
miles of sanitary sewer lines, more than 8.5 miles of sewer force mains, 49 pumping stations, 15
permanent standby generators, and four portable generators. After collection, waste water is pumped to
the WWTP. The WWTP has treatment capacity of 14.4 MGD. Foster City is allocated 25 percent of the
capacity of the WWTP, which is 3.6 MGD. The WWTP serves more than 130,000 people and businesses
at an average flow of 12 MGD, 2.4 MGD less than the total capacity. The average daily wastewater flow
collected from Foster City’s users and pumped to the treatment plant is approximately 3.0 MGD. Plans are
being developed for improvements to the WWTP to better handle wet weather flows, but this will not
increase the overall capacity of the WWTP.
Although there are localized constraints in some of the industrial areas due to pipe sizes and/or lift station
capacities, wastewater capacity is not a limiting factor for housing development.
Building Codes
Foster City follows the requirements of the California Building Code as modified by Titles 20 and 24 of the
state's regulations. No additional local requirements are imposed which would affect the cost of building
homes in Foster City. While building and energy codes add to the cost of housing, their existence ensures
that all new housing units will meet minimum levels of performance for habitability, structural safety, and
energy use. Cities in California are required to utilize the California Building Code, which establishes
minimum construction standards. The City also administers State and Federal mandated standards
regarding energy conservation and accessibility for the disabled. The City has adopted several
amendments to these codes, including the following more significant provisions:
· Section 15.04.120 – concrete slabs
· Section15.24.130– roofs shall be Class B fire retardant or better
· Section 15.40 – limitations on wood burning appliances
· Section 15.24.230 – fire sprinklers required for all new buildings and significant expansions
· Section 15.24.290 – smoke control systems for buildings four or more stories in height
· Chapter 15.28 – Business and Residential Security
Although some of these regulations, especially the ones related to fire safety, have the effect of increasing
the cost of housing, they have beneficial economic and safety effects over the long term by reducing losses
due to fires and other factors.
Project Densities
Lower density development has a high land cost per unit and therefore adds to the cost of housing. Foster
City has always been planned to have a mixture of low, medium and high density development in order to
provide a variety of housing types and prices. Density bonuses are allowed for housing developments that
meet certain criteria, including the provision of affordable housing, as provided by State law.
All sites currently zoned for housing have either been developed or have received their design
approvals. Future housing will be on sites re-designated to allow residential use or existing residential sites
redeveloped at higher densities. It is anticipated that the new housing development will be attached
housing in the Townhouse, Apartment or Condominium categories. Listed in the tables below are the Land
Use Plan designations for residential use and examples of projects listed from highest to lowest densities
for each housing type.

Housing Goals, Policies and Programs                                                           Chapter 4: Housing Element
Foster City is basically “built out,” i.e., the little remaining vacant land either has projects under
construction or approved. Almost every new housing project will require the demolition of an existing
development. There are many difficulties associated with working with already developed properties: (a)
Many developed properties are small and don’t have sufficient area for a marketable project by
themselves; (b) Aggregating several small parcels can be difficult; (c) Purchasing or condemning leases of
existing tenants can be expensive and time-consuming; and (d) Neighbors may be opposed to changing
the existing use.
The City of Foster City General Plan designates the location and intensity or density of different types of
uses, ranging from parks and open space to offices and housing. Residential uses are designated by the
type of housing and the density of housing. The “density” of residential development is the number of
residential units on one acre of land. All residential densities are expressed in “gross” area density, which
includes internal streets. Below are the types and density of residential uses allowed in Foster City:
(1) Single Family Residential. Allows up to 8 dwelling units per acre. This is the single largest residential
      category in the City. Single family homes are located in every residential neighborhood except one.
(2) Two Family Residential. Allows up to 10 dwelling units per acre. This designation recognizes the small
      percentage of existing duplex homes in the City. The designation has been applied to a small area in
      the northeastern portion of the City, on Comet Drive (Neighborhood #1). Duplexes should provide the
      outward appearance of single-family residences in a single-family neighborhood, but at densities
      closer to those of townhomes.
(3) Townhouse Residential. Allows up to 15 dwelling units per acre. Townhomes in Foster City generally
      function as attached single family homes.
(4) Condominium Residential. Allows up to 15-35 dwelling units per acre. Condominium developments
      are usually constructed at a higher density than townhomes.
(5) Apartment Residential. Allows 20-35 dwelling units per acre. Apartment developments in Foster City
      generally provide the highest density living environment, although some apartment developments are
      built at comparable densities to condominiums.
(6) Mixed Use Residential/Commercial Projects. The City allows mixed residential/commercial projects to
      be built at the maximum allowed residential densities. In allowing higher residential densities for mixed
      use projects, the project must comply with the goals and policies of the General Plan, including
      policies regarding design and affordability.
There is no guarantee that any individual project will be approved for maximum density. The high end of a
density range is allowed only when the following issues are addressed:
    (1) Excellence in architecture and site planning is achieved through creative solutions to building
         location and/or design, the preservation of views or vistas, the creation of usable open areas for
         public and/or private enjoyment, the provision of pedestrian/bicycle pathways for links to existing or
         proposed routes, the preservation of Bay wildlife resources, and the conservation of energy
         resources (through solar siting, clustering, etc.).
    (2) Development is clustered to reduce paving, grading, runoff, and loss of vegetation cover.
    (3) Additional landscaping area is provided to enhance the natural qualities of the site.
    (4) Recreational facilities are provided on-site for the enjoyment of project residents.
    (5) It is ensured that the traffic, noise, or visual effects of the higher density development will not
         significantly affect adjacent or nearby residences, or the overall streetscape.

Chapter 4: Housing Element                                                                                 Housing Goals, Policies and Programs
    (6) The project includes very low, low and/or moderate income units in accordance with the City’s
          affordability needs and guidelines.
Each development proposal must be evaluated based on its own characteristics and merits to determine
whether the proposed density of development is appropriate for that site. Densities higher than those
included in the description of each Land Use Plan designation are possible through the use of density
bonuses. State Density Bonus Law and Chapter 17.86 of the Foster City Municipal Code provide for
density bonuses of up to 35 percent above the otherwise allowed density in return for promising of
affordable housing, childcare facilities or senior housing. Factors which must be considered include
adjacent uses, the proposed site and building design, traffic and noise impacts, and visual impacts. High
quality design that considers the building massing, siting, and landscaping can make higher density
developments appear to be much lower in density than they actually are when viewed from adjacent
properties and streets. The City’s General Plan, Zoning, and development review processes all exist to
ensure that each and every new development contributes to the overall quality of life in the community
without adversely impacting adjacent properties.
On/Off-Site Improvements
Street and infrastructure standards have a direct impact on housing construction costs, as well as on
subdivision design. There have been no public streets built in Foster City since the early 1980’s except for
Balclutha Drive between Foster City Blvd. and Shell Blvd. In general, residential street widths have a 50-
foot right-of-way and are 35-feet from curb to curb. However, all recent multi-family projects have been
developed as Planned Developments. Through this process, the City allows lesser street widths, with
recent examples being 20-24-feet from curb to curb. By using a planned development process for key
housing sites, allowances can be made to conform street standards and improvements to the projects’
needs and impacts. The Land Use and Circulation Element includes a policy that allows private streets to
be approved with narrower than standard street widths.

Discussion of Key Issues Related to Housing
Neighborhoods and Neighborhood Character
R-1 (Single Family Residence) Zoning District. The City’s oldest housing stock is approximately forty-five
years in age and is generally in good condition. Serious structural problems (foundations; framing; roof
structure) or problems with basic systems (plumbing; heating; electrical) are rare. With the exception of
construction related foundation problems in several planned developments, structural problems at this
stage in the City’s history do not constitute a serious concern.
Houses located in the City’s older neighborhoods, typically in Neighborhoods 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 9:
     Overall, structurally are in good condition.
     Are experiencing renovation and remodeling, especially by new property owners. (The most
         common remodeling or construction projects involve replacing roofs, room expansions and/or
         additions, kitchen and bathroom remodeling.)
     Compete well in the overall San Francisco Peninsula housing market and command high prices.
     Receive or have access to a complete range of typical city services (sewer; water; police; fire;
         library; parks).
Common problems in these neighborhoods include the following:
     Property maintenance, including: (1) unkempt yard maintenance; 2) dead, dying, or a lack of
         landscaping; 3) peeling or unpainted portions of houses); 4) storage of trash cans and recycling
         bins in front yards; 5) storage of garbage & miscellaneous debris in front yards.
     Construction or remodeling work occurring without City permits and required inspections.
     Storage of unregistered/inoperable vehicles on driveways and public streets.
     Seasonal storage of boats, catamarans and recreational vehicles on driveways and public streets.
R-1/PD (Single Family Residence/Planned Development Combining) Zoning District. Houses located in
Neighborhoods 5, 6, and 7, but also scattered throughout the City:
     Are newer than the houses found in the R-1 Zoning District.
     Are well maintained and are in very good physical condition.
 Have far fewer property maintenance problems than houses in the R-1 Zoning District.
 Compete very well in the overall San Francisco Peninsula housing market and command high prices.
 Receive or have access to a complete range of typical city services (sewer; water; police; fire; library;
    parks).
Common problems in these neighborhoods include the following:
 Construction or remodeling work occurring without City permits and required inspections.
 Seasonal storage of boats, catamarans and recreational vehicles on driveways, in common area
    parking lots and on private streets.
 Storage of unregistered/inoperable vehicles on driveways and public streets.
Other Residential Zoning Districts (R-T Residential Townhouse; R-3 Medium Density Multiple Family
Residence District; R-4 High Density Multiple-Family Residence) District. The above Zoning Districts are
located throughout the City. Dwelling units located in these Zoning Districts are multi-family units,
predominantly but not exclusively, apartment units, and range in age from 25-35 years to new/under
construction. Multifamily units in these Districts:
 Are well maintained and are in good physical condition.
 Compete very well in the overall San Francisco Peninsula housing market and command high prices.

 Landscape modifications (tree removals/ replacements) without permit.
Periodically, there are specialized rehabilitation needs in the community for lower income or elderly
households. In those cases, the City refers people to the County for rehabilitation assistance loans. The
City contracts with the County to administer rehabilitation loans and the disaster assistance program.
Between 1993 and 2008, 14 rehabilitation loans were provided in Foster City by this program. In addition,
Metro Senior Apartments also received a rehabilitation loan in 2013. The City estimates that in the 2015-
2023 time period, an additional 20 lower income or elderly households will need rehabilitation assistance.
Energy and Green Building
Housing Elements are required by the State of California to include an Energy Conservation section that
provides “an analysis of opportunities for energy conservation with respect to residential development”
(Government Code Section 65583(a)(7)).
Background. High energy costs have continued to increase over the past several decades and climate
change concerns have increased the need and desire to include energy conservation measures in new
housing construction as well as incorporating energy conserving features in existing homes. The use of
“green building” techniques and materials can reduce the resources that go into new construction and can
ensure buildings operate more efficiently. A common definition of “green building” is “design and
construction practices that significantly reduce or eliminate the negative impacts of building on the
environment through energy efficiency and renewable energy, conservation of materials and resources,
water efficiency, site planning and indoor environmental quality”. Energy conservation measures help to
minimize the percentage of income a household must dedicate to energy.. These savings are typically
greater than the added construction cost of the energy conservation feature.
States Codes and Guidelines. The State of California is a nationwide leader in sustainable building
practices. Written into the State Building Code are several sets of requirements and guidelines to facilitate
the production of more environmentally friendly buildings.
Currently, Foster City encourages energy conservation through the enforcement of statewide energy
standards which ensure that newly constructed residential units meet a minimum level of energy efficiency.
Part 6 Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations sets forth mandatory energy standards for new
development, and requires adoption of an “energy budget” In 2011, California added the California Green
Building Standards Code (CALGreen) to the state’s official building code. CALGreen is a new set of
building codes, some mandatory, and some voluntary, for all new buildings and renovations. It is the first
state level “green” building code to be implemented in the US. Minimum energy conservation standards
implemented through CALGreen may slightly increase initial construction costs, but reduce operating
expense and expenditure of natural resources over the long run.
In addition, the City has required buildings be equivalent to LEED (Leadership in Energy and
Environmental Design) Silver or better in development agreements for specific developments, including:
     Gilead Sciences

PG&E Programs. Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) provides power for all jurisdictions in San Mateo County.
PG&E offers a variety of energy conservation services for residents that help save money while moving
towards greater sustainability, including energy assistance programs for lower income households, which
help qualified homeowners and renters, conserve energy and control electricity costs. For example, Home
and Business Area Network (HAN) and the Smart-Rate Add-on are programs designed to identify peak
energy use times and unnecessary energy-consuming appliances, to assist consumers in making energy-
saving and money-saving decisions. Through Energy Upgrade California, PG&E also offers homeowners
up to $4,500 in rebates for implementing energy-saving home improvements. PG&E also has launched the
Zero Net Energy Pilot Program (ZNE) to move towards all new residential construction be zero net energy
by 2020, and all commercial construction by 2030.
PG&E also participates in several other energy assistance programs for lower income households, which
help qualified homeowners and renters, conserve energy and control electricity costs. These include the
California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE) Program and the Relief for Energy Assistance through
Community Help (REACH) Program. The CARE provides a 15 percent monthly discount on gas and
electric rates to income qualified households, certain non-profits, facilities housing agricultural employees,
homeless shelters, hospices and other qualified non-profit group living facilities. The REACH program
provides one-time energy assistance to customers who have no other way to pay their energy bill. The
intent of REACH is to assist low-income customers, particularly the elderly, disabled, sick working poor,
and the unemployed, who experience sever hardships and are unable to pay for their necessary energy
needs.
Foster City Programs. Foster City encourages energy conservation in a number of ways including:
Policies and Strategies
        Passed Resolution 2006-71, supporting efforts of all governments to develop policies and programs to
         reduce global warming.
        Passed Resolution 2009-17, adopting the San Mateo County Energy Strategy to reduce the impact of
         global warming and the corresponding climate change. (Previously adopted Resolution 2007-57,
         supporting the development of the strategy.)
        Appointed an Ad Hoc Environmental Sustainability Task Force which developed a Recommended
         Sustainability Action Plan. This work has been transferred to the Sustainable Foster City initiative which
         has an updated Sustainable Foster City Plan.
        Appointed a Transportation Committee which developed additional transportation
         recommendations. This work has been transferred to the Sustainable Foster City initiative which
         includes transportation initiatives in its Sustainable Foster City Plan.
        Included preparation of a Climate Action Plan with the update of the Land Use and Circulation Element –
         projected to be completed in late 2014/early 2015
Carbon Emissions
Emissions from City Operations
     Conducted an inventory of greenhouse gas emissions from City operations in 2005 and 2010. These
         inventories are used to guide the City's efforts to reduce emissions. The City currently has a number of
         programs that reduce carbon emissions both from City operations and the community as a whole.
     Preparing and expecting to complete a comprehensive Climate Action Plan in 2014.
Adopted — February 2, 2015                                                                                     Page 4-59

         Converted to a system by which water meters can be read remotely, eliminating the need to routinely
          access on-site meters around the city by automobile.
         Benchmarked major City facilities so on-going energy use and be tracked and managed.
Promotion and Support of Mass Transportation
     Works with the Traffic Congestion Relief Alliance and employers to ensure that trip-reducing alternatives
          are available, introduced to employees, and publicized on a regular basis.
     Promotes the AC Transit transbay bus service.
     Promotes employer-operated shuttles to and from the San Mateo Caltrain Station and the Millbrae
          Intermodal Station from three areas: Lincoln Centre, North Foster City, and Mariners Island.
     Operates a Senior Express Shuttle to transport residents age 55 and older to events and activities in the
          region.
Bicycle Alternatives
     Requires that bicycle racks be installed at all new commercial/office developments in town. Bicycle racks
          are also on all shuttles.
     Maintains a bicycle/pedestrian path along the bay front—a leg of the Bay Trail that connects with trails
          maintained in neighboring cities and allows for an easy commute by bicycle between Foster City and a
          number of Peninsula cities.
Foster City Employee Trip Reduction
     Implemented an alternative schedule for most employees, reducing employee commuter trips from a
          traditional schedule.
     Implemented the option for certain employees to telecommute from home, keeping cars off the
          roadways while maintaining a productive workforce.
     Participates in annual Great Race for Clean Air, sponsored by the Spare the Air Team at the Bay Area
          Air Quality Management District.
City Fleet Fuel Efficiency
     Increasing the percentage of hybrids in the City fleet and reviewing other fuel-efficient alternatives as
          vehicles are replaced.
     Replaced traditional vehicles with electric options for parks maintenance operations when appropriate.
     Maintains vehicle fleet in peak condition in order to maximize performance and minimize carbon
          emissions.
Other Carbon-Reducing Policies
     Reduced speed limits on most City streets to allow for use of Neighborhood Electric Vehicles (NEV) for
          intra-City transportation.
     Adopted regulations prohibiting the installation or replacement of wood burning appliances unless
          certain conditions are met to protect air quality.
Energy Conservation and Renewable Energy
     Eliminated permit fees for installation of solar panels.
     Installed Light Emitting Diode (LED) streetlights on all public streets. LED streetlights reduce energy use
          by up to 50% and require less maintenance and less frequent replacement.
     Converted all traffic and pedestrian signals to LED's; these lights use about 20 percent of the electricity
          of the older, halogen lights.
     Implemented energy conservation practices in building maintenance supplies, parts and systems in City
          facilities.
     Computer-controlled heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems in some buildings make them
          more energy efficient, shutting off systems when work areas may not be inhabited.
     Participates in the San Francisco Community Power Demand Response Program, reducing city-wide
          electricity use on peak demand days.

projects.
Funding for Housing
Past Funding from the Community Development Agency. In 1994 the City and the Community
Development Agency (CDA) adopted the Affordable Housing Strategic Plan, which contains a strategy for
meeting the City's and the CDA's affordable housing obligations. The Strategy was amended in 1997. The
Strategic Plan was developed because the high cost of providing affordable housing in the Bay Area, the
fairly substantial number of units required, the flow of available financial resources (the tax increment
revenue stream) and the need to maintain unit affordability for the life of the Agency all require that the City
and the CDA plan carefully and leverage the Agency's housing funds to the fullest extent feasible. The
Affordable Housing Strategic Plan was incorporated into the 2007-2014 Housing Element.
With the funding provided for affordable housing through the CDA, Foster City was able to provide a
significant amount of affordable housing for the community through a variety of programs, as indicated in
the table below.

In 2011, the passage of ABx1 28 by the State dissolved redevelopment agencies and eliminated a major
source of funding for affordable housing. The legislation, which was upheld by a ruling of the California
Supreme Court on December 29, 2011, dissolved agencies on January 31, 2012.
Current Funding for Affordable Housing. On January 9, 2012, the City Council exercised its right under the
legislation to become the Housing Successor Agency to the former Community Development Agency. All
non-cash housing assets and obligations, including the eight (8) affordable housing units formerly owned
and operated by the Agency, and loans receivable from the Metro Center Senior Housing Project and
individual borrowers under the former 1st Time Homebuyers Program, were transferred to the Successor
Agency’s Low- and Moderate-Income Housing Fund (LMIHF) effective February 1, 2012.
Continuing obligations of the Successor Agency to the Community Development Agency, including
affordable housing obligations related to Marlin Cove, Miramar and Triton Plaza, are funded from the tax
increment received by the Successor Agency and are not paid from the LMIHF or the City Affordable
Housing Fund.
The City chose to allocate the funds it received from the reallocation of the housing funds swept from the
CDA to the affordable housing in the Foster Square development. These funds are referred to as the
“boomerang” housing monies. Although these funds were not restricted when they were redistributed to
the various taxing entities, the City chose to allocate the approximately $3 million it received to the 66 units
of affordable housing in Foster Square being developed by Mid-Peninsula Housing.
The LMIHF includes the budget for expenditures related to operating and maintaining the remaining six (6)
affordable housing units now owned by the City, including property management services, landscaping and
other maintenance costs, as well as initiatives that were formerly funded by the Agency that support and
enhance the availability of affordable housing in Foster City. Revenues going into the Affordable Housing
Fund include proceeds from the sale in FY 2013-14 of two of the units in the Existing Unit Purchase
Program as well as rental income and loan repayments. The City Council has set a goal of maintaining a
$300,000 fund balance as a reserve for capital expenditures related to the affordable housing units owned
by the City.
Other funding sources available within San Mateo County include HEART and San Mateo County. Many
sources of state and federal funding for locally administered affordable housing program are declining,
such as the Community Development Block Grant, the HOME Investment Partnerships Program, HOPE VI
and Choice Neighborhoods, as documented in the Affordable Housing Funding Gap Analysis prepared by
ABAG in February 2014.
Potential New Sources of Funding. The dissolution of redevelopment agencies throughout California in
2012 eliminated the major source of funding for affordable housing in Foster City and other jurisdictions.
Although this funding has been eliminated, the state mandates to plan for and facilitate the provision of
affordable housing remain. An option to provide funding for affordable housing is the imposition of
development impact fees. The development impact fee would be charged to a development for the
increased demand for affordable housing that the development would create. In order to impose a
development impact fee, a “nexus study” is required to document that: 1) the development is in fact
creating an impact, and 2) that the fee is proportional to the impact.
Pursuant to City Council direction, a nexus study is underway in cooperation with the 21 Elements program
that will enable consideration of an affordable housing impact fee as a source of ongoing funding for
affordable housing. The nexus study is anticipated to be completed at the end of 2014 to enable the City
Council to consider adoption of a housing impact fee in early 2015.

Housing Goals, Policies and Programs                                                       Chapter 4: Housing Element
Addressing Housing for the Homeless
The unsheltered homeless population in Foster City was estimated to be 7 people as of the San Mateo
County Homeless Census taken in January 2013. Unsheltered homeless people are often “invisible”
because they may be living in vehicles. (See the Housing Needs Appendix for additional information.) The
City has adopted Chapter 17.82, Emergency Shelters, to allow emergency shelters for the homeless as a
permitted use in areas zoned Neighborhood Business (C-1), Central Business (C-2), and at
churches/synagogues in the Public Facilities (PF) Zoning District based on the following considerations:
    a. The City will encourage a dispersion of facilities to avoid an over-concentration of shelters for the
         homeless in any given area. An over-concentration of such facilities may negatively impact the
         neighborhood in which they are located and interfere with the “normalization process” for clients
         residing in such facilities.
    b. The City of Foster City shall encourage positive relations between neighborhoods and providers of
         permanent or temporary emergency shelters. Providers or sponsors of emergency shelters,
         transitional housing programs and community care facilities shall be encouraged to establish
         outreach programs within their neighborhoods and, when necessary, work with the Peninsula
         Conflict Resolution Center or other mediation service.
    c. It is recommended that a staff person from the provider agency be designated as a contact person
         with the community to review questions or comments from the neighborhood. Outreach programs
         may also designate a member of the local neighborhood to their Board of Directors. Neighbors of
         emergency shelters shall be encouraged to provide a neighborly and hospitable environment for
         such facilities and their residents.
    d. Development standards for emergency shelters for the homeless included in Chapter 17.82 will
         ensure that shelters would be developed in a manner which protects the health, safety and general
         welfare of nearby residents and businesses, while providing for the needs of a segment of the
         population as required by State law. Shelters shall be subject only to development, architectural
         review and management standards that apply to residential or commercial development in the
         same zone, except for the specific written and objective standards as contained in Chapter 17.82.
Program H-F-3-d Emergency Shelter Zoning, notes that the City will allow emergency shelters pursuant
to these already adopted regulations. The area zoned C-1, C-2 and PF, which allow emergency shelters
“by right” includes eleven properties with a total of over 40 acres. Two other programs help address these
needs within Foster City, including, the ability to locate transitional and supportive housing in any
residential area pursuant to Program H-F-4-a Transitional and Supportive Housing Zoning and the
Homeshare Program referenced in H-E-6-a Homeshare Program and H-F-2-f Home Sharing Program .
In addition, the Foster Square development will include two units that will be targeted for homeless seniors.
Together, these programs provide more than enough capacity to address homeless needs in Foster City.
In addition, there are several local agencies that provide services to the homeless in nearby jurisdictions,
including emergency housing, counseling and other services. The City has supported programs of various
agencies to address and prevent homelessness and has included programs to continue this support to the
extent funds are available, including:
              o     H-F-3-a          Emergency Housing Assistance
              o     H-F-3-b          Emergency Shelter Uses
              o     H-F-3-c          Multi-Jurisdictional Emergency Shelter

The section below contains the City’s Goals, Policies and Programs related to the Housing Element. Goals
are shown in capital letters, e.g., H-A. Policies related to each Goal include the Goal plus a number, e.g.,
H-A-1. Programs related to each Policy include the Goal and Policy reference followed by a lower case
letter, e.g., H-A-1-a.
H-A           Reinforce the City's Commitment to Meeting Housing Needs
Establish and monitor goals, policies and programs to address the City's housing
needs, encourage public participation in all housing policy matters and promote
equal housing opportunities.
Below is a breakdown of the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) for Foster City for the current
Housing Element planning period (2015-2023) as determined in partnership with all twenty cities and the
county as part of the San Mateo sub-region. (Although the RHNA is for the time period of 2014-2022, the
planning period covered by the Housing Element is 2015-2023.) Approximately 54 percent of the housing
need is required to be affordable to low-and very low-income households (“lower income” households). The
quantified objectives in the Foster City Housing Element are intended, in part, to make sure the City
addresses its RHNA for new units.

 Conservation includes preservation and improvement of existing affordable housing stock per Government Code Section
65583(c)(4).

 Extremely Low Income is a subset of the Very Low Income. Housing opportunities such as emergency shelters, supportive
housing, shared housing and Section 8 vouchers can provide opportunities to address Extremely Low Income housing needs. In
addition, the Affordable Housing Overlay Combining District will require a certain percentage of extremely low-income units.
The City will strive to provide some extremely low income housing in new construction through the development review
process negotiations.

H-F-3         Housing for the Homeless. The City of Foster City recognizes the need for and desirability of
              emergency shelter housing for the homeless and has adopted Chapter 17.82 to allow
              emergency shelters as a permitted use in areas zoned Neighborhood Business (C-1), Central
              Business (C-2), and at churches/synagogues in the Public Facilities (PF) Zoning District based
              on the following considerations:
              a. The City will encourage a dispersion of facilities to avoid an over-concentration of shelters
                   for the homeless in any given area. An over-concentration of such facilities may negatively
                   impact the neighborhood in which they are located and interfere with the “normalization
                   process” for clients residing in such facilities.
              b. The City of Foster City shall encourage positive relations between neighborhoods and
                   providers of permanent or temporary emergency shelters. Providers or sponsors of
                   emergency shelters, transitional housing programs and community care facilities shall be
                   encouraged to establish outreach programs within their neighborhoods and, when
                   necessary, work with the Peninsula Conflict Resolution Center or other mediation service.
              c. It is recommended that a staff person from the provider agency be designated as a contact
                   person with the community to review questions or comments from the neighborhood.
                   Outreach programs may also designate a member of the local neighborhood to their Board

                    of Directors. Neighbors of emergency shelters shall be encouraged to provide a neighborly
                    and hospitable environment for such facilities and their residents.
              d. Development standards for emergency shelters for the homeless included in Chapter 17.82
                    will ensure that shelters would be developed in a manner which protects the health, safety
                    and general welfare of nearby residents and businesses, while providing for the needs of a
                    segment of the population as required by State law. Shelters shall be subject only to
                    development, architectural review and management standards that apply to residential or
                    commercial development in the same zone, except for the specific written and objective

                              feasible. Responsible Agency: City Council.

                              as the opportunity arises, the City will consider participation in a multi-jurisdictional
                              emergency shelter, should one be proposed in the future. Target: Based on the
                              opportunity and feasibility of a multi-jurisdictional emergency shelter. Responsible

                              in the Public Facilities (PF) Zoning District. In addition, the City has established
                              written and objective standards, as allowed in State law, for the following:
                              (1) Maximum number of beds;

                              (7) Lighting; and

Executive Summary                                           Chapter 7: Local Hazard Mitigation Plan/Safety Element
1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.1      Overview
The Local Hazard Mitigation Plan/Safety Element focuses on the protection of the community from risks
associated with hazards such as earthquakes, floods, fires, hazardous materials and other hazards.
The Local Hazard Mitigation Plan/Safety Element analyzes these hazards and the risks they pose, and
includes goals and mitigation strategies to establish what measures will be undertaken to reduce these
risks to levels determined by the City to be reasonable. Foster City has chosen to prepare one
document to meet the requirements of both the Safety Element of the General Plan and the Local
Hazard Mitigation Plan in order to provide one point of reference for safety and hazard mitigation
planning.
The Local Hazard Mitigation Plan/Safety Element supports Foster City’s emphasis on hazard mitigation
prior to disasters such as earthquakes, storms and fires, including maintenance of infrastructure,
requirements for new construction beyond the uniform codes and education of residents and
community groups. The City believes that this proactive emphasis on pre-disaster mitigation is a large
part of the explanation of why the City has experienced minimal damage in the face of actual disasters.
When major storms cause flooding on nearby highways, the City’s Lagoon System works to collect
storm water and prevent local flooding. In the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake, Foster City experienced
some broken utility lines, minor local bridge damage (no local bridges were closed) and minor building
damage (no buildings were declared uninhabitable). Although the underlying geology of the area results
in mapping that shows a relatively high exposure to seismic hazards according to USGS maps, the
review of individual geotechnical reports prepared for various projects indicates that the risk is minimal
in some areas and in areas with higher risk can be mitigated with appropriate building design that has
been incorporated into projects.
One of the key mitigation strategies contained in this Plan, the Levee Protection and Planning
Improvements, is already well underway. This project will ensure that Foster City’s levees continue to
protect the City from the waters of San Francisco Bay, including sea level rise. The City has begun the
design and review process for this project with a goal of completion by mid-2020.
The City/Estero Municipal Improvement District has used a long-term, 10-year funding strategy to
ensure that funds are available to carry out a proactive capital improvement program to maintain the
City/District’s infrastructure. This includes proactive maintenance, recurring capital improvement
projects and infrastructure replacement. This ensures that key systems are operating at peak levels
and improves resiliency. The City has continued to adopt amendments to the uniform building codes
with each code cycle to improve seismic safety and fire safety. The City provides extensive public
education in emergency preparedness through a variety of means, including website, classes,
community events and the Community Emergency Response Training (CERT) a program that trains
individuals and groups in how to make their homes, businesses and neighborhoods more resilient as
well as how to respond in a disaster.

1.2     Goals
The Local Hazard Mitigation Plan/Safety Element includes the following goals:
     S-A. Strong infrastructure. Preserve the quality of life by ensuring the City’s infrastructure and
     municipal services are capable of withstanding reasonably foreseeable risks and hazards.
     S-B. Emergency Response. Maintain an effective emergency response program that anticipates
     the potential for disasters and ensures the ability to respond promptly, efficiently and effectively, to
     provide continuity of services during and after an emergency.
     S-C. Long-term community resilience. Ensure the long-term community resilience of the
     community by improving the resiliency to hazards and planning for post-disaster recovery.
     S-D. Empower residents and community groups. Provide on-going education/resources to
     empower residents and community groups to be better educated, prepared and self-reliant in order
     to protect themselves from unreasonable risk to life and property posed by the hazards specific to
     Foster City, including access to transparent, frequently updated hazard and emergency response
     information before, during and after any disaster event.
     S-E. Build sense of community. Build a strong sense of community and allegiance among
     residents, employees and visitors to Foster City by building social connectedness and commitment
     to the community so that individuals and groups are more empowered to help one another before,
     during and after any disaster event.

Introduction                                                       Chapter 7: Local Hazard Mitigation Plan/Safety Element
2 INTRODUCTION
2.1       Background
Disasters can cause loss of life; damage buildings and infrastructure; and have devastating
consequences for a community’s economic, social, and environmental well-being. Hazard mitigation
can reduce or eliminate these impacts. FEMA’s definition of hazard mitigation is “Sustained actions
taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to life and property from hazards.”1 For the purposes of the
Foster City Local Hazard Mitigation Plan (LHMP)/Safety Element, hazard mitigation is slightly expanded
as follows: Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to life, property and the
environment from hazards.
The Local Hazard Mitigation Plan/Safety Element supports Foster City’s emphasis on hazard mitigation
prior to disasters, including:
     Maintenance of infrastructure. The City/Estero Municipal Improvement District has used a
          long-term, 10-year funding strategy to ensure that funds are available to carry out a proactive
          capital improvement program to maintain the City/District’s infrastructure. This includes
          proactive maintenance, recurring capital improvement projects and infrastructure replacement.
          This ensures that key systems are operating at peak levels and improves resiliency.
     Requirements for new construction beyond the uniform codes. The City has continued to
          adopt amendments to the uniform building codes with each code cycle to improve seismic
          safety and fire safety.
     Education of residents and community groups. The City’s provides extensive public
          education in emergency preparedness through a variety of means, including website, classes,
          community events and the Community Emergency Response Training (CERT) program that
          trains individuals and groups in how to make their homes, businesses and neighborhoods more
          resilient as well as how to respond in a disaster.
The LHMP/Safety Element focuses on the protection of the community from risks associated with
natural hazards and some man-made hazards. Some level of risk associated with these hazards is
unavoidable; the LHMP/Safety Element is the means by which the City defines what measures will be
undertaken to reduce these risks to levels determined by the City to be reasonable. The City has
chosen to combine the two required plans into one document in order to reduce redundancy and to
ensure continued consistency in the City’s approach to hazard mitigation.
The City of Foster City is located in San Mateo County, California. Foster City, incorporated in 1971, is
situated on the San Francisco Peninsula midway between San Francisco and San Jose. Foster City is
a “Planned Community” originally designed to be a full service city with a character defined by nine
residential neighborhoods, supported by commercial centers throughout the City and light industrial
land uses in the northern portion of the City. The municipality of Foster City covers 4 sq. miles (a map
of the City’s jurisdictional boundary is provided in Figure 2-2). The City has a population of 32,390
people, based on an estimate as of 1/1/2015 by the California Department of Finance2. The City staff
also serves as staff to the Estero Municipal Improvement District, which provides water and sewer
services to Foster City and the Mariner’s Island portion of San Mateo. In FY 2015-16, the combined
City/Estero Municipal Improvement District total budget was $77,671,740, including $11.4 million for

capital expenditures. The City has a staff of 190 full-time employees and provides both Fire and Police
services to its residents.
The small size, underlying geologic conditions, and history of development result in Foster City having
nearly the same exposure to hazards throughout the City. Based on United States Geological Survey
(USGS) mapping, Foster City is underlain by Quaternary Holocene-aged Bay Mud that is less than
9,600 years old and man-made artificial fills that have been placed in the areas that are developed.
Foster City had its beginnings as reclaimed marshlands devoted to dairy farming and evaporation
ponds known as Brewer Island. During the late 1950s, T. Jack Foster, in association with Bay Area
developer Richard Grant, purchased an option to acquire Brewer Island for the development of a
complete community. In 1960, the California Legislature created the Estero Municipal Improvement
District (EMID) with most of the governing powers of an incorporated municipality. The County Board of
Supervisors approved the Foster City Plan and ground breaking for the first reclamation and
development projects took place in 1961. Due to the extensive fill, compaction and construction of
infrastructure that had to precede any building construction, three years passed before the first homes
were completed.
Similarly, the land areas of Foster City protected by the City’s levees have the same exposure to flood
hazards. The topography of Foster City is relatively flat with an existing ground surface elevation of
between 5 and 7 feet above mean sea level. Flood protection is provided through a combination of the
levees surrounding the City and the Foster City Lagoon. Storm water collected throughout Foster City
flows primarily to the Foster City Lagoon system, which serves as a drainage detention basin for storm
water runoff (a small area near Port Royal Avenue flows to the City of San Mateo’s Marina Lagoon).
The Foster City Lagoon system is designed and operated to store runoff from a 100-year storm event.
Storm water from the Foster City Lagoon flows or is pumped into the San Francisco Bay.
The demographic information for Foster City indicates that the age, race, and economic characteristics
are fairly evenly distributed throughout the City. Table 2-1 includes the citywide average for various
demographic characteristics as well as the range among the census tracts. Other than the range given
for owner occupied housing units, the ranges among the census tracts are narrow, further illustrating
the even distribution of demographics throughout the City. One factor with more disparity is the rate of
owner-occupied units, which is to be expected given that some neighborhoods include more apartment
communities.

2.2     Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 and AB 2140
Protecting the public health and welfare is a primary function of government. This has included
preparing for and responding to disasters and natural hazards. This plan has been prepared to comply
with the requirements of the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000, as administered by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA). The Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-390) amended the
Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act previously adopted in 1988. A
significant amendment was the requirement for state and local governments to prepare and adopt
hazard mitigation plans approved by FEMA under its implementing regulations as a condition of

Introduction                                               Chapter 7: Local Hazard Mitigation Plan/Safety Element
eligibility for receiving hazard mitigation grants from FEMA. The plans are “to reduce the loss of life and
property, human suffering, economic disruption, and disaster assistance costs resulting from natural
disasters.”
Federal regulations require an update of the LHMP every five years. The City’s previous LHMP was
adopted in 2011 as an annex to the 2010 Association of Bay Area Governments Local Hazard
Mitigation Plan Taming Natural Disasters and included a commitment to update the plan at least once
every five years.
AB 2140, passed by the California legislature in 2006, limits the State’s share for any eligible project
under the California Disaster Assistance Act to no more than 75% unless the local agency has adopted
a local hazard mitigation plan in accordance with the Federal Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000.
2.3       Safety Element Requirements
The legal authority and requirements for Foster City to prepare the General Plan derive from state law
(California Government Code, Section 65300 et. seq.). The Safety Element of the General Plan is
required to address natural hazards such as seismic and other geologic hazards, as well as urban fires,
safety issues related to evacuation routes, peakload water supply, minimum road widths and
clearances around structures. The Safety Element is required to include mapping of known seismic and
other geologic hazards.
The City’s previous Safety Element, adopted in 1995, utilized the most accurate information available at
the time. Substantial additional information regarding hazards has been developed in the twenty years
since adoption of the Safety Element.
2.4       Purpose
The purpose of hazard mitigation and this plan is to reduce or eliminate risks to people, property and
the environment from significant hazards in Foster City, California.
2.5       Scope/Plan Organization
This plan will replace the Safety Element of the General Plan adopted in 1995 and the Local Hazard
Mitigation Plan (annex to the 2010 Association of Bay Area Governments Local Hazard Mitigation Plan
Taming Natural Disasters) adopted in 2011. This plan is organized into the following sections:
    1. Executive Summary
    2. Introduction
    3. Planning Process
    4. Existing Plans and Programs
    5. Community Profile
    6. Hazard Analysis
    7. Vulnerability Analysis/Risk Assessment
    8. Capability Assessment
    9. Mitigation and Adaptation Strategy
    10. Plan Maintenance Procedures
2.6       What’s New in the 2016 Update
The City of Foster City has made several changes to the format and content of the Local Hazard
Mitigation Plan and Safety Element, including:

Introduction                                              Chapter 7: Local Hazard Mitigation Plan/Safety Element
       The two plans were combined into one document
       The plan is a “stand-alone” plan instead of an “annex” to a regional or County plan
       Best available data sources, maps and analysis tools were utilized in the hazard and risk
        exposure assessment
       The plan addresses sea level rise and other potential hazards resulting from climate change
       A more robust public involvement process was used, including a survey and interactive public
        workshop
2.7     Authority
This plan was prepared pursuant to the requirements of the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 (Public Law
106-390) and the implementing regulations set forth in Title 44 of the Code of Federal Regulations (44
CFR 201.6). Other Federal requirements are included in Section 322 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster
Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act) as amended, and the National Flood Insurance Act
of 1968 (NFIA), as amended.
This plan also meets the requirements for the Safety Element set forth in Section 65302(g) of the
California Government Code. In addition, Section 65302.6 of the California Government Code, adopted
with AB 2140, specifically allows the adoption of a local hazard mitigation plan with a safety element.

3 PLANNING PROCESS
3.1       Overview of Hazard Mitigation Planning
In 2005 and 2010, the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) led the regional hazard mitigation
planning effort and drafted the document, “Taming Natural Disasters,” which included Foster City’s
Annex detailing its local hazard and risk assessment and mitigation activities.
In early 2015, it became known that ABAG would not be leading a regional hazard mitigation planning
effort for the 2016 update, but would be providing resources and workshops to assist local jurisdictions
in creating their own complete Local Hazard Mitigation Plans. Foster City staff members participated in
three unique workshops provided by ABAG:
         Community Engagement on April 16, 2015,
         Hazard and Risk Assessment on July 23, 2015, and
         Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies on September 16, 2015.
Foster City followed the roadmap outlined by ABAG, which was based on the FEMA Local Mitigation
Planning Handbook (March 2013). Additionally, Foster City staff participated in a hazard mitigation
workshop offered by the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services Hazard Mitigation
Planning Branch on July 14, 2015.
3.2       Preparing the 2016 Update
Representatives from multiple City departments as noted below comprised the planning team. Each
department representative brought the perspectives of their individual departments along with
infrastructure and budget priorities. All members of the planning team participated in every aspect of
the planning process and plan development.

Planning Process                                               Chapter 7: Local Hazard Mitigation Plan/Safety Element
                                  Figure 3-1. LHMP/Safety Element Planning Process
The planning team began the hazard mitigation planning process with Initiation and Planning. A project
kick-off meeting was held on May 7, 2015. At this meeting, the planning team established that the
planning area would be limited to Foster City, rather than participating in a multijurisdictional planning
effort. This would enable Foster City to have a single plan that would also satisfy the requirements of a
General Plan Safety Element, which would contain the background data, goals and strategies, rather
than a county-wide plan with a city-specific “annex” that would not satisfy requirements of a General
Plan Safety Element. With the core team members and responsibilities identified, leadership roles and
ground rules were established during the kick-off meeting, and all planning team members agreed to
meet at least monthly throughout the course of the planning process. The planning team met 14 times
from May 2015 through February 2016. Meeting agendas, notes and attendance logs are available for
review upon request.
Additionally, the planning team identified various stakeholders and agencies and invited the following
organizations to provide input to the planning process via email, phone or face to face meetings
including: San Mateo Union High School District, San Mateo-Foster City School District, City of San
Mateo, City of Belmont, San Mateo County Health System, Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), Comcast
Communications, San Mateo County Office of Emergency Services (OES), the Association of Bay Area
Governments (ABAG) and the Foster City Chamber of Commerce. See Appendix A for a list of
stakeholder organizations invited to participate.

Planning Process                                               Chapter 7: Local Hazard Mitigation Plan/Safety Element
During the Initiation and Planning stage, the planning team reviewed the 2010 Plan and confirmed the
purpose, scope, schedule and goals for the 2016 plan update. Next, City staff also developed a public
outreach strategy, which will be discussed in Section 3.3.
The next steps in the planning process included the identification and assessment of hazards and
assets. The planning team participated in several meetings to research City records in order to provide
new information on hazards and susceptibility within the City. This was done comprehensively as part
of the City’s review of the 2010 materials to reflect minor changes to City policies and programs that
had occurred since 2010. The updates also incorporated the new ABAG data on hazard susceptibility.
The City included any additional occurrences of natural hazards since the last plan and updated the risk
assessment with new data from ABAG. This will be further discussed in Section 6.2.
Throughout the risk assessment process, the planning team used maps, rating tools, and assessment
questions supplied by ABAG. Foster City used its own Geographic Information System to incorporate
data sets from ABAG to allow for detailed analysis of community assets. The planning team used rating
tools and assessment questions in group settings to ensure consistency for both qualitative and
quantitative assessment of risk and vulnerability. This will be further discussed in Section 7.1.
At the close of the risk assessment process, the planning team organized a Public Workshop held on
November 17, 2015, to present the goals of the hazard mitigation plan, maps and displays related to
historical hazards and hazard risks, and the findings of the risk assessment to the community. The
community provided feedback to the planning team in this venue, and applicable feedback was
incorporated into the subsequent planning steps.
Next, the planning team identified mitigation strategies that would address the highest risk assets, and
ranked those strategies based on feasibility, social and economic benefits, environmental
improvements, and overall community objectives.
Finally, the plan was drafted to incorporate the findings from all of the above steps and the adoption
and implementation steps were followed.
3.3      Community Engagement Process
Per 44 CFR, Section 201.6(b)(1), public participation in the planning process helps ensure that citizens
understand risks and vulnerability and can work with the City to support policies, actions and tools that
will lead to a reduction in future losses. It is for this reason that the public must have opportunities to
comment on disaster mitigation plans during the drafting stages and prior to plan approval.
Foster City delivered a multipronged community engagement process, including the use of the City
Website, social media platforms, paper and online surveys, a public workshop, appearances at public
events, press releases, a Planning Commission Study session, and a City Council meeting, all
completed prior to the plan’s submission to California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services for
review. This strategy was designed to gauge the public’s perception of risk and ideas for mitigation
strategies by using multiple media avenues.
Website/Social Media
Foster City provided updates about the Local Hazard Mitigation process on its webpage, and
advertised the survey and workshop through its social media channels. The Foster City Local Hazard
Mitigation Plan Webpage can be found at http://www.fostercity.org/fire/communityoutreach/Local-
Hazard-Mitigation-Plan.cfm, and an image of the page appears in Figure-3-2.

                               Figure 3-2. Foster City Local Hazard Mitigation Plan Website
Survey
A local hazard mitigation plan public survey (Figure 3-3) was developed by the planning team and was
used to gauge the public’s concern about hazards identified by the planning team. In addition to the
hard copy of the survey and flyer (Figure 3-4), which was available at the City’s public counters in City
Hall, the Police Department, the Fire Department, and the Recreation Center, the Communications/City
Clerk Department made the survey available online via the Foster City Forum. The Foster City Forum is
an online forum for civic engagement that allows community members to comment on important Foster
City topics, which are reviewed by City officials and incorporated into the decision-making process.
From July 29, 2015 through November 13, 2015, a total of 448 hard copy and online surveys were
completed by community members. The results of the survey were also posted on the Foster City
Forum in an outcome statement (see Appendix B). All survey respondents were offered the opportunity
to provide their name for entry into a drawing to receive a personal preparedness kit valued at over
$40. The drawing was held and the winner was announced at the Public Workshop.
Upon closure of the public survey period, the planning team reviewed the top hazards as perceived by
the community, which were earthquakes, drought, sea level rise, flood and levee failure. The planning
team ensured that all of the hazards identified by the community were included in the hazard analysis.
The planning team also reviewed the recommended mitigation activities identified by the community
and found that an overwhelming majority of the recommendations were related to levee improvements,
flood control and other infrastructure. Other recommendations related to preparedness and response
rather than to the mitigation planning process were recorded and shared with City staff responsible for
coordinating those activities.

Public Workshop
A public workshop was held on November 17, 2015 at the Foster City Vibe Teen Center and was
attended by 27 members of the public. The meeting format included an introduction to hazard mitigation
and a short presentation on personal emergency preparedness, followed by an hour of rotating among
four stations. All stations allowed for direct conversations between the community with the planning
team and other City staff with subject matter expertise. Community members were able to examine

maps depicting various hazards, to review the history of disaster events in Foster City and San Mateo
County, to understand mitigation efforts that Foster City has already undertaken, and to hear about the
hazard mitigation planning process steps and potential mitigation priorities. A YouTube video
summarizing this event is available at: https://youtu.be/Cn5ym0jp0pY.
                            Figure 3-5. Foster City Community Members Learn about Hazards
This event was advertised through myriad channels, including through a press release to local
newspapers (see Appendix C); on the Foster City Website and Event Calendar; through various City
Listservs targeting businesses, homeowners associations, multifamily residential communities,
volunteer communities, and the Community Emergency Response Team; on various City social media
platforms, including Facebook, Twitter and Nextdoor; through flyers posted at various locations
throughout the City (Figure 3-6); and through direct outreach to individuals who had completed the
online and/or paper survey.
The planning team held a Public Workshop debriefing on November 24, 2015 and reviewed the
summary of public comments recorded throughout the workshop. Team members again reviewed the
top hazards and assets of concern mentioned by the community, and confirmed that the relevant
hazards and assets were included in the hazard analysis. The planning team also reviewed the
recommended mitigation activities identified by the community and found that many of the
recommendations were related to preparedness and response rather than mitigation. These
preparedness and response recommendations were recorded and shared with City staff responsible for
coordinating those activities. All feedback received from the public during this workshop is summarized
in Appendix D.

Visa Preparedness Day
A member of the planning team staffed a public information booth at the Visa Corporate Preparedness
Fair in Foster City on September 17, 2015. Community members had an opportunity to receive
information about the Local Hazard Mitigation Planning process, to fill out paper surveys, to share ideas
about hazards and assets of concern, and to offer ideas about mitigation strategies. This event was
supported by FEMA Region IX and was attended by other government and non-government
stakeholders.

Community Events
City staff used other scheduled community events as an opportunity to provide information about the
Local Hazard Mitigation Planning process and to distribute paper surveys. The City Paper Shred event
was held at City Hall on July 29, 2015, and the City Open House was held at City Hall, the Fire
Department and the Police Department on October 3, 2015. Community members shared ideas about
assets of concern, hazards of concern, mitigation strategies, and asked questions about the planning
process.
Planning Commission Review
As part of the General Plan Safety Element review process, the plan was provided to the Foster City
Planning Commission for review during a study session on January 21, 2016. The draft plan was made
available to the members of the Planning Commission and community at large for a 30 day review
period beginning on January 14, 2016. Public comment received by Foster City staff during the January
14-21, 2016 timeframe was also provided in writing to the Planning Commission for consideration
during the study session. The Planning Commission provided verbal and written feedback to the
planning team regarding the draft plan, and applicable changes were incorporated into a revision which
was reviewed by the City Council on March 7, 2016.
Draft Plan Public Comment Period
The planning team made the Draft Local Hazard Mitigation Plan-Safety Element available to the public
beginning on January 14, 2016 as part of the materials associated with the Planning Commission Study

Additionally, the planning team provided the draft plan to public agency stakeholders in the San Mateo
County Operational Area and to technical experts at the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG)
for review and comment.
The planning team reviewed all comments received during the public comment period and made the
relevant updates to the draft plan. Comments and/or recommendations related to preparedness and
response rather than mitigation were recorded and shared with City staff responsible for coordinating
those activities.
City Council Review
The planning team provided a revised plan that incorporated feedback from the Planning Commission,
recommendations of other Public Agencies and stakeholders, and relevant public comments to the
Foster City City Council for review on March 7, 2016, prior to submission to California Governor’s Office
of Emergency Services (CalOES) and California Geological Survey (CGS). The discussion of this plan
in the public forum provided an opportunity for revision prior to its entry into the formal review process
as prescribed by FEMA. The City Council adopted Minute Order No. 1456 directing staff to submit the
draft Local Hazard Mitigation Plan/Safety Element of the General Plan to the required reviewing
agencies.
3.4     Approval Process
Following the City Council’s review of the draft Local Hazard Mitigation Plan/Safety Element the
following steps are required prior to final adoption:
       Draft Plan is submitted to California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services (CalOES) for
        review (LHMP requirement) and at same time Draft Plan is submitted to California Geological
        Survey for review (Safety Element requirement)
       CalOES forwards the Plan to FEMA Regional Office for review and approval
       FEMA Regional Office conducts its review within 45 days and provides a completed Local
        Mitigation Plan Review Tool to the State

5 COMMUNITY PROFILE
5.1    Area at a Glance
      Date of Incorporation: 1971
      Current Population: 32,390 people, based on an estimate as of 1/1/2015 by the California
       Department of Finance.
      Population Growth: Foster City was virtually undeveloped in 1961, experienced significant
       population growth in the 1970s and 1980s, then grew at a much slower pace during the 1990s
       and to the present.
      Location and Description: Foster City is located midway between San Francisco and San
       Jose on the western shoreline of the San Francisco Bay, east of U.S. 101. The City is bisected
       by State Route 92 (the J. Arthur Younger Freeway), which runs between Half Moon Bay to the
       west and to Hayward and Highway 880 to the east via the San Mateo-Hayward Bridge. The City
       encompasses 12,345 acres, of which 8,726 acres are part of the San Francisco Bay and
       Belmont Slough, and 2,619 acres are reclaimed marshland. This equates to approximately 4
       square miles of land area.

      Brief History: Foster City had its beginnings as reclaimed marshlands devoted to dairy farming
       and evaporation ponds. At the turn of the century, the approximately 2,600 acres of tidal
       marshlands now occupied by Foster City were owned by Frank Brewer, and the land was called
       Brewer Island. During the late 1950s, T. Jack Foster, in association with Bay Area developer
       Richard Grant, purchased an option to acquire Brewer Island for the development of a complete
       community. In 1960 the California Legislature created the Estero Municipal Improvement District
       (EMID), the state’s first such public agency. EMID was granted most of the government powers
       associated with an incorporated municipality, except the powers to zone and approve
       development and certain police powers. T. Jack Foster prepared a master plan for the
       development of Brewer Island (Foster City) and submitted it to the County in 1961. The plan
       envisioned a self-contained community with a variety of housing types, waterfront lots and
       parks, an internal lagoon for public recreation, marinas, offices, stores, industry and public
       services. The engineering firm of Wilsey Ham developed a plan to raise the surface level of the
       island four to five feet and to dig a central drainage basin area that would also serve as a runoff
       storage area. This drainage basin is the Foster City Lagoon. EMID issued bonds to finance the
       improvements, including the lagoon, water systems, sewer system, roads, bridges and other
       necessary improvements. Foster City was incorporated in April 1971, with the newly elected
       City Council assuming the powers of the EMID Board. Foster City’s Master Plan was amended
       and adopted as the City’s General Plan.

         Climate: Foster City enjoys a marine-like climate characterized by mild and moderately wet
          winters and dry, cool summers. The summer weather is dominated by a cool sea breeze. Low
          overcast often occurs for a few hours in the morning. Summer nights are comfortably cool, with
          minimum temperatures averaging in the fifties. The average minimum and maximum
          temperature range is 47.1°F to 71.1°F.

         Governing Body Format: The City of Foster City and the Estero Municipal Improvement
          District provide governmental services to the citizens of Foster City. The members of the City
          Council serve as the policy-making body for both governmental agencies. City voters elect
          Council members to staggered terms of four years each. The City uses the Council-Manager
          form of government, with the City Manager appointed by and responsible to the five-member
          City Council.
5.2       Demographics
While Foster City population growth has been relatively minimal between 1990 and 2015, there have
been changes to the ethnic composition of residents. The proportion of residents who are white or black
has declined while the proportion that is Asian has increased. The Asian Indian population has been
the fastest growing, increasing ten-fold from 1.0 percent to 10.5 percent from 1990-2014.

The age composition of Foster City residents has shown an increase in the senior population since
2000, a decrease in the 20-59 year old segments and relatively constant proportion of children.3 Foster
City, like other cities in San Mateo County, can expect to see a dramatic increase in the number of
seniors as the baby boomer generation ages.

5.3     Trends
The following demographic and housing-related trends were noted in the 2015 Housing Element of the
General Plan:
     Rise of the Millennials. The Millennial generation (ages 20-34) has a preference for dense,
        mixed-use, walk-able and bike-able communities. Many have speculated that Millennials may
        be a “generation of renters,” but as the economy improves and as Millennials age, this
        conclusion may change.
       Growing senior population. Over the next decade and a half, the number of seniors (age 65+)
        in San Mateo County will increase by 76 percent. Foster City currently is home to
        approximately 2,400 seniors. Advanced planning will be necessary to ensure the opportunity for
        seniors to age safely in the communities where they reside.
       Worsening workforce-housing shortage. San Mateo County is projected to see notable job
        growth over the next decade, and about 40 percent of these jobs will pay lower income wages.
        San Mateo County already has a severe workforce housing shortage in general caused by
        years of rapid economic growth and slow housing growth. By 2025, the Department of Housing
        projects than the County’s housing supply will only meet one third to one half of the demand.
        While Foster City is expected by the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) to lose jobs
        between a high of 18,480 in 2000 and 16,190 in 2025, the City’s Regional Housing Needs
        Assessment (RHNA) still requires accommodating the County’s low-to-moderate income
        workers.
       Increasing ethnic diversity. According to 2010 U.S. Census data, San Mateo County is a
        “majority-minority” county — that is, no one racial group makes up over 50 percent of the
        population. The two racial groups growing the most rapidly in San Mateo County are Asians
        and Latinos. According to the regional Plan Bay Area, adopted by the Association of Bay Area
        Governments on July 18, 2013, Latinos will emerge as the largest ethnic group, increasing from
        23 percent to 35 percent of the total population in the Bay Area by 2040.
       Increase of people with developmental disabilities. Aging baby boomers will be unable to
        care for their children with developmental disabilities. Almost three quarters of people with
        developmental disabilities live with a parent or caregiver and many of these caregivers are baby
        boomers. This trend is also going to be factor in the increased need for community-based
        independent living options.
In addition, recent trends related to housing and job growth include:
     Housing growth “catch-up.” After eight years of no new housing construction in Foster City
        between 2005 and 2012, 307 new housing units at The Plaza were completed in 2013. As of
        January 2016, three housing developments including about 700 new units are under
        construction simultaneously. New development has utilized a “smart growth” concept including
        more urban, walkable, mixed-use developments close to transit, shopping and other amenities.
       Post-recession job growth. Foster City has seen dramatic job growth in the past five years
        and expects to see this continue for the next five years, based on development approvals.
        Commercial and industrial lands are nearly built out and, at the same time, some are
        undergoing redevelopment. In Vintage Park, Gilead Sciences has received approval to expand
        its existing campus by removing some buildings and adding larger buildings. Chess Drive
        Offices (recently purchased by Gilead Sciences) has been approved to include up to 800,000
45 | LHMP-Safety Element – Adopted-November 21, 2016

Community Profile                                          Chapter 7: Local Hazard Mitigation Plan/Safety Element
        sq. ft. of new office/research and development buildings. The Lincoln Centre area has been
        approved to include up to 595,000 sq. ft. for the bio-tech company, Illumina. This job growth is
        also resulting in the removal of many tilt-up concrete buildings constructed between 1965 and
        1985 and replacing them with new commercial structures, which will improve the resilience of
        the City’s building stock.
       Post-recession traffic growth. San Mateo County added 170,000 jobs between 2007 and
        2015 and added 6,290 new housing units between 2007 and 2014, resulting in a dramatic
        increase in commuting from outside San Mateo County. The increased traffic congestion on
        Highways 101 and 92 has spilled onto City streets and created congestion at City intersections
        near the freeways.
5.4     Past Disasters
The City of Foster City has experienced a limited number of disasters since the City was incorporated
in 1971. However, there is potential for earthquakes, floods, droughts, and severe storms. Regional
disasters can affect the City even though they might not cause local damage. The Loma Prieta
Earthquake of 1989 is an example of the kind of large scale disaster which can strike the Bay Area. It
killed 63 people, injured 3,757, and displaced over 12,000 people. With over 20,000 homes and
businesses damaged and over 1,100 destroyed, this quake caused approximately $6 billion of damage
in the region. Although damage in Foster City was minimal, the City was impacted by the disruptions to
the regional transportation system.
Locally significant incidents that have also impacted the City of Foster City in the past include:
      2014-16 – Drought Emergency. In January 2014, the Governor proclaimed a State of
        Emergency and directed State officials to take all necessary actions to prepare for drought
        conditions.
      2014 – Winter Storm damage resulted in San Mateo County’s Proclamation of State of
        Emergency on December 19, 2014, and the Governor’s Proclamation of a State of Emergency
        on December 22, 2014. Foster City personnel worked overtime and provided sandbags to City
        residents.
      2013 – Asiana Airlines Flight 214 plane crash at San Francisco International Airport. Through
        automatic aid agreement, Foster City personnel provided coverage for neighboring communities
        that responded to the crash.
      2010 – San Bruno gas line explosion. Numerous Foster City personnel worked at the event as
        part of initial response teams and during the aftermath.
      2009 – Mehserle Shooting. Civil disturbance during which the City of Oakland activated their
        EOC. San Mateo County monitored this situation.
      2002 – Santana Row Fire- Foster City Fire Department responded as part of a San Mateo
        County strike team deployment to the Santana Row Fire in San Jose.
      2001 – Terrorists attacked The World Trade Center resulting in the closure of San Francisco
        International Airport and San Jose International Airport.
      1995 – Tanker truck rolled over and caught fire on Highway 92. Foster City opened its EOC
        during this incident.
      1989 – Loma Prieta Earthquake. Minor damage to City owned facilities.
      Seasonal Weather – Summer heat and winter cold. During weather extremes San Mateo
        County Office of Emergency Services monitors the situation with cities that are affected.

Hazard Analysis                                                Chapter 7: Local Hazard Mitigation Plan/Safety Element
6 HAZARD ANALYSIS
6.1       Overview
This chapter defines and maps significant natural hazards that impact the people, built environment,
economy and society of Foster City. Each section describes a different natural hazard, including how it
has affected the Bay Area and Foster City in the past and how it is likely to impact Foster City in the
future. Most of the information in this chapter is adapted from the “Risk Landscape” document prepared
by ABAG to assist local governments in the preparation of their LHMPs.
In the Bay Area, earthquakes are the hazards that have the highest combined likelihood to cause
extensive, multi-jurisdictional damage. All of the Bay Area is exposed to earthquake hazard, and
impacts can cause region-wide disruptions. Disruptive earthquakes also have high likelihood of
occurring at any given time. With the combined likelihood and extent of earthquakes, much of the focus
of this chapter is on earthquake hazards.
Flooding is another major hazard that the Bay Area and Foster City are exposed to, although Foster
City has been very successful in minimizing or eliminating flooding in the past through a combination of
levee protection and use of the Foster City Lagoon for storm drainage. Globally, sea levels are rising
due to thermal expansion caused by the ocean warming and the melting of land‐based ice such as
glaciers and polar ice caps. Regionally and locally, the rate of sea level rise is affected by other
processes.
Other hazards beyond earthquakes and flooding/sea level rise may be less widespread or less frequent
in the Bay Area and Foster City, but can still cause significant local impacts and have cascading effects
on the region. Other hazards potentially affecting Foster City include dam failure of the Lower Crystal
Springs Dam, drought, extreme heat, fire and hazardous materials.
Climate change has begun to increase the severity of some hazards. Changes in extreme weather
events are the primary way that most people experience climate change. Human-induced climate
change has already increased the number and strength of some of these extreme events. Over the last
50 years, much of the United States has seen an increase in prolonged periods of excessively high
temperatures, more heavy downpours, and in some regions, more severe droughts.4

6.2       Hazard Identification and Screening
The Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Team considered the full range of potential hazards and their
relevance to Foster City and determined which hazards warranted further discussion, as indicated in
Table 6-1. For each hazard detailed in Table 6-1, the planning team identified the geographic areas, the
extent, previous occurrences and probability of future events. While multiple hazards were identified,
earthquakes (particularly shaking) and flooding were ranked as highest priorities based on past
disasters and expected future impacts, as they pose the most significant risk for potential loss.
The planning team defined the probability of hazards as “highly likely” which is defined as occurring
every 1-10 years, “likely” as occurring every 10-50 years, and “unlikely” as occurring at intervals greater
than 50 years. For some hazards, due the wide variations of type and magnitude, there is no formal
way to estimate the probability of these events, which will be noted throughout this section.
Table 6-1. Identification and Screening of Hazards
    Hazard Type                   Explanation
    Dam Failure                   Foster City lies within the inundation area mapped for the Lower Crystal
                                  Springs Reservoir.
    Drought                       Prolonged drought could limit water availability.
    Earthquake                    Foster City lies within areas mapped as potentially affected by earthquake
    -Shaking                      shaking and liquefaction. Tsunami mapping shows areas affected outside
    -Liquefaction                 the City’s levees. Earthquake related landslides and surface fault rupture
    -Tsunami                      are not relevant to Foster City because there are no slopes susceptible to
                                  landslides and active earthquake faults are several miles away.
    Extreme Heat                  Climate change experts predict more extreme heat days in the future.
    Fire (Urban)                  Urban fires and fire following earthquake could potentially affect Foster
                                  City.
    Flood                         Foster City is potentially affected by flooding from San Francisco Bay.
    Levee Failure                 A failure of the City’s levee would result in flooding from San Francisco
                                  Bay.
    Sea Level Rise                Foster City is potentially affected by sea level rise.
    (see Flood)
    Other: Hazardous              Hazardous materials are transported on roadways in Foster City and are
    Materials                     stored at some commercial facilities.
    Other:                        Foster City is in close proximity to main Highways 101 and 92 and the San
    Transportation                Francisco Airport.
    Accidents
    Other: Crime                  Although crime in Foster City is low compared to other areas, crime
                                  prevention efforts can continue to reduce crime.
6.3       Earthquakes
Earthquakes occur when two tectonic plates slip past each other beneath the earth’s surface, causing
sudden and rapid shaking of the surrounding ground. Earthquakes originate on fault planes below the
surface, where two or more plates meet. As the plates move past each other, they tend to not slide
smoothly and become “locked,” building up stress and strain along the fault. Eventually the stress
causes a sudden release of the plates, and the stored energy is released as seismic waves, causing
ground acceleration to radiate from the point of release, the “epicenter.”

Hazard Analysis                                            Chapter 7: Local Hazard Mitigation Plan/Safety Element
The Bay Area is in the heart of earthquake country. Major faults cross through all nine Bay Area
counties. Every point within the Bay Area is within 30 miles of an active fault, and 97 of the 101 cities in
the Bay Area are within ten miles of an active fault. Figure 6-1 shows the location of active faults that
are mapped near Foster City under the Alquist-Priolo Act. There are no known active, potentially active,
or inactive faults located within Foster City. The closest active faults are the San Andreas Fault, located
approximately 5.7 miles southwest of Foster City, and the Hayward Fault, approximately 12.8 miles
northwest of Foster City.
The total amount of energy released in an earthquake is described by the earthquake magnitude. The
moment magnitude scale (abbreviated as M) is logarithmic; the energy released by an earthquake
increases logarithmically with each step of magnitude.5 For example, a M6.0 earthquake releases 33
times more energy than a M5.0, and a M7.0 earthquake releases 1,000 times more energy than a M5.0
event.
The quantified size or measurement of an earthquake is dependent on factors that include the length of
the fault and the ease with which the plates slip past one another. In the Bay Area, technical specialists
have observed varied fault behaviors, giving some sense of which faults may or may not produce a
large, damaging earthquake. Earth scientists are most concerned about the San Andreas and Hayward
faults, believed most likely to produce large, regionally damaging earthquakes. There are, however,
many other Bay Area faults that can produce localized damage.
Additionally, earthquakes are often not isolated events, but are likely to trigger a series of smaller
aftershocks along the fault plane, which can continue for months to years after a major earthquake,
producing additional damage.
The energy released in earthquakes can produce five different types of hazards:
     Surface Fault rupture
     Ground shaking
     Liquefaction
     Earthquake-induced landslides
     Tsunamis and seiches
Each of these hazards will be discussed in greater detail later in Section 6.3.2.

6.3.1 Historic Bay Area Earthquake Occurrences
The Bay Area has experienced significant, well-documented earthquakes. In 1868, a significant
earthquake occurred on the Hayward fault with an estimated magnitude of 6.8-7.0. The fault ruptured
the surface of the earth for more than 20 miles and significant damage was experienced in Hayward
and throughout Alameda County, and as far away as San Francisco, Santa Rosa, and Santa Cruz. The
M7.8 1906 earthquake on the San Andreas Fault, centered just off the coast of San Francisco,
devastated San Francisco and caused extensive damage in Oakland, San Jose, and Santa Rosa. More
recently, the M7.1 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake caused severe damage in Santa Cruz and the
surrounding mountains, where it was centered, as well as fatal damage 50 miles away in Oakland and
San Francisco. Moderate earthquakes are much more common in the Bay Area; twenty-two have
occurred in the last 178 years, averaging every eight years.6 The 2014 South Napa earthquake is a
reminder of the strong shaking that even a moderate magnitude 6.0 earthquake can produce in a
localized area.
Figure 6-2 illustrates Bay Area earthquakes over the past 165 years. Because the 1906 earthquake
released so much energy and stress on regional faults when it ruptured, the last 100 years have been
relatively seismically quiet. As faults restore their stress and energy builds again, the region may have a
more seismically active future.

6.3.2 Earthquake Hazards
Earthquakes can trigger multiple types of seismic hazards, causing varying severity of damage in
different locations. The following sections describe each earthquake hazard in greater detail, including
where and how it is likely to affect the Bay Area and more specifically, Foster City.
6.3.2.1 Surface Fault Rupture
A fault is a point of displacement along the fractures of the earth’s crust caused by shifting tectonic
plates. When an earthquake occurs, there is a rupture on a fault as built-up energy is suddenly
released. Active faults are those that have ruptured in the past 11,000 years.8 Often the rupture occurs
deep within the earth, but it is possible for the rupture to extend to the surface and create visible above-
ground displacement, called “surface rupture.” The California Geological Survey (CGS) publishes maps
of active Bay Area faults that could produce surface rupture, as required by the Alquist-Priolo

Earthquake Fault Zoning Act (1972).9 These maps show the most comprehensive depiction of fault
traces that can rupture the surface, and the zones directly above and surrounding the fault traces.
Cities and counties require special geologic studies within these zones to prevent construction of
human-occupied structures.
As previously indicated, there are no known active, potentially active, or inactive faults located within
Foster City. The closest active faults are the San Andreas Fault, located approximately 5.7 miles
southwest of Foster City, and the Hayward Fault, approximately 12.8 miles northwest of Foster City.
Surface fault rupture is therefore not a potential hazard in Foster City.
6.3.2.2 Ground Shaking
When faults rupture, the slip generates vibrations or waves in the earth that are felt as ground shaking.
Larger magnitude earthquakes generally cause a larger area of ground to shake, and to shake more
intensely. As a result, one principal factor in determining anticipated levels of shaking hazard in any
given location is the magnitude of expected earthquakes. The intensity of ground shaking felt in one
area versus another, however, is based on the magnitude and other factors including distance to the
fault; direction of rupture; and, the type of geologic materials at the site. For example, softer soils tend
to amplify ground shaking, while more dense materials limit ground shaking impacts at the site surface.
Ground shaking is commonly characterized using the Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) scale, which
illustrates the intensity of ground shaking at a particular location by considering the effects on people,
objects, and buildings. The MMI scale describes shaking intensity on a scale of 1-12. MMI values less
than 5 don’t typically cause significant damage; MMI values greater than 10 have not been recorded.

As described, there are a number of different faults that contribute to the seismic hazard in the Bay
Area. The Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) and the United States Geological Survey
(USGS) worked collaboratively to characterize which fault contributes most to an area’s seismic hazard.
Figure 6-3 maps which fault contributes most to an areas seismic risk, taking into account the locations
proximity to various faults, and the likelihood and severity of each fault. The map characterizes the fault
with the greatest hazard, but many locations in the region can be severely impacted by multiple faults.

Earthquake Shaking Scenarios
In addition to this effort, ABAG and USGS have developed several shaking scenario maps that depict
shaking intensity for specific, plausible earthquake scenarios with a given magnitude on a fault. These
maps show possible levels of ground shaking throughout the Bay Area in a single likely earthquake,
taking into consideration the earthquake magnitude; rupture location and direction; and soil conditions
throughout the region. The scenarios that are most likely to cause strong shaking in Foster City are
shown in Figure 6-4. The map indicates that an earthquake on the San Andreas Fault has the greatest
contribution to seismic hazard for Foster City.
Scenario maps are helpful to model the expected shaking of an individual event, but they do not depict
the likelihood of the event occurring or whether it is the most significant event for a particular location. A
Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Assessment (PSHA) Map incorporates the likelihood of ground shaking
from all nearby fault sources, and accounts for the frequency of each event. The PSHA Map in Figure
6-5 illustrates the 10 percent or greater chance in a 50 year period that each location on the map will
exceed the MMI shown at least once.
In terms of risk characterization, it is equivalent to a 500-year flood. A 10 percent in 50 years hazard
level was chosen as it most closely aligns to the levels of shaking used in the current building code.
Seismic hazard maps are not intended to be site-specific but depict the general risk within
neighborhoods and the relative risk from community to community.
Events with strong shaking can still occur in areas with low probabilities shown in a PSHA map. The
area damaged by the 2014 South Napa Earthquake is one example of a strong earthquake occurring in
a location with lower risk probability than other areas within the region.

6.3.2.3 Liquefaction
Soil that is loose, sandy, silty, or saturated with water can result in soil liquefaction if it is shaken
intensely for an extended period. When ground liquefies in an earthquake, it behaves like a liquid and
may sink, spread, or erupt in sand boils. This can cause pipes to break, roads and airport runways to
buckle, and building foundations to be damaged. Liquefaction can only occur under certain
circumstances:11
Loose Soils              The soils must be loose, such as uncompacted or unconsolidated sand and silt
                         without much clay. This happens most often in the Bay Area along the Bay
                         shoreline, near creeks or other waterways, on dry creek beds, and in areas of
                         man-made fill, such as the Marina District in San Francisco or parts of Alameda.
Soggy Soils              The sand and silt must be soggy and saturated with water due to a high water
                         table.
Ground Shaking           The ground must be shaken long and hard enough by the earthquake to trigger
                         liquefaction.
Liquefaction may not necessarily occur even if all three conditions are present. Additionally, if
liquefaction does occur, the ground may not move enough to have significant impact on the built
environment. As with ground shaking, several types of maps depict liquefaction potential. Liquefaction
susceptibility maps show areas with soil types known to have the potential to liquefy with intense
shaking.
Figure 6-6 illustrates liquefaction susceptibility for Foster City based on USGS soil type maps.
However, site-specific investigations are required per Foster City regulations to confirm liquefaction
susceptibility on any given site.
Unless areas of liquefaction susceptibility are subject to significant ground shaking, they are not likely to
liquefy. Liquefaction hazard maps express where the ground is both susceptible to liquefaction, and
where the ground is likely to be shaken long and intensely in an earthquake. In 2015, ABAG produced
maps that combine liquefaction susceptibility with USGS-generated earthquake scenario maps to
identify areas where there is a significant hazard of liquefaction. Figure 6-7 is a representative example
which shows the liquefaction potential in a M7.8 San Andreas earthquake. The map combines the
liquefaction susceptibility and San Andreas shaking information into a scenario-based liquefaction
potential map.
Lateral Spreading/Lurching
Lateral spreading/Lurching is horizontal/lateral ground movement of relatively flat-lying soil deposits
towards a free face such as an excavation, channel, or open body of water; typically lateral spreading is
associated with liquefaction of one or more subsurface layers near the bottom of the exposed slope.
As failure tends to propagate as block failures, it is difficult to analyze and estimate where the first
tension crack will form. A review of soils reports for various projects in Foster City indicate that the
potential for lateral spreading/lurching is low, and site-specific mitigation measures are incorporated to
minimize the potential for this to occur.

Cyclic Softening of Cohesive Soils
As noted on p. 11, Foster City is underlain by Quaternary Holocene-aged Bay Mud and man-made
artificial fills. Bay mud consists primarily of clay and silt. As described in Boulanger and Idriss (2004)12
“The term ‘liquefaction’ is used to describe the onset of high excess pore water pressures and large
shear strains during undrained cyclic loading of sand-like soils, while the term ‘cyclic failure’ is used to
describe the corresponding behavior of clay-like soils. The stress-strain behavior of a sand specimen
that develops liquefaction can look quite similar, in some cases, to that of a soft clay specimen that
develops cyclic failure.”13

6.3.2.4 Earthquake-Induced Landslides
Ground shaking can also lead to ground failure on slopes, triggering earthquake-induced landslides.
Landslides tend to occur in weak soil and rock on sloping terrain. Foster City does not have sloping
terrain and therefore has no potential for earthquake-induced landslides.
6.3.2.5 Tsunamis/Seiches
The terms tsunami or seiche are described as ocean waves or similar waves usually created by
undersea fault movement or by a coastal or submerged landslide. Since tsunamis have high velocities,
the damage from a particular level of inundation is far greater than in a normal flood event. A seiche
occurs when resonant wave oscillations form in an enclosed or semi-enclosed body of water such as a
lake or bay. Seiches may be triggered by moderate or larger local submarine earthquakes and
sometimes by large distant earthquakes. The greatest hazard results from the inflow and outflow of
water, where strong currents and forces can erode foundations and sweep away structures and
equipment.
Tsunamis can result from off-shore earthquakes within the Bay Area or from distant events. It is most
common for tsunamis to be generated by offshore subduction faults such as those in Washington,
Alaska, Japan, and South America. Tsunami waves generated at those far-off sites can travel across
the ocean and can reach the California coast with several hours of warning time. Local tsunamis can
also be generated from offshore strike-slip faults. Because of their close proximity, the Bay Area would
have little warning time. However, the Bay Area faults that pass through portions of the Pacific coastline
or under portions of the Bay are not likely to produce significant tsunamis because they move side to
side, rather than up and down, which is the displacement needed to create significant tsunamis. They
may have slight vertical displacements, or could cause small underwater landslides, but overall there is
a minimal risk of any significant tsunami occurring in the Bay Area from a local fault. The greatest risk
to the Bay Area is from tsunamis generated by earthquakes elsewhere in the Pacific.
Though the Bay Area has experienced tsunamis, it has not experienced significant tsunami damage. In
1859, a tsunami generated by an earthquake in Northern California generated 4.6 meter wave heights
near Half Moon Bay. The M6.8 1868 earthquake on the Hayward fault is reported to have created a
local tsunami in the San Francisco Bay. In 1960, California experienced high water resulting from a
magnitude 9.5 earthquake off the coast of Chile. The tsunami generated by the 1964 Alaskan
earthquake caused wave heights of up to 1.1 meters along the coasts of San Francisco, Marin and
Sonoma Counties. The 2011 tsunami created by the M9.0 Tohoku earthquake did not cause damage
inside the Bay, but did cause damage to marinas and ports in both Santa Cruz and Crescent City.
California has been fortunate in past distant-source tsunamis (1960, 1964, and 2011) that the events
occurred during low tides.14
In 2013, the USGS, in partnership with the US Department of the Interior, published a tsunami scenario
as part of the Science Application for Risk Reduction (SAFRR) series.15 In the scenario, the multi-
disciplinary team modeled a M9.1 offshore Alaskan earthquake to study impacts to California.
Assuming that the tsunami reaches the central coast at high tide, the Bay Area can expect heights
ranging from two to seven meters near the shore. The study suggests that this scenario inundation is
only likely to occur once in a 100 year period.

In addition to the scenario inundation maps, CalOES developed tsunami evacuation maps indicating
areas that should evacuate if a warning is given. The CalOES tsunami maps are not associated with a
particular event but instead represent the worst-case scenario at any given location by combining a
suite of extreme, but plausible, inundation scenarios. Additionally, the maps include no information
about the probability of a tsunami affecting an area at any given time. Because of this, it is not intended
to show locations of probable inundation but should be used for evacuation planning only. In general,
the CalOES tsunami evacuation map is more conservative than the USGS SAFRR study; however,
there are a few locations where the SAFRR study shows greater inundation.
For Foster City, the tsunami maps prepared by CalOES in Figure 6-8 indicate that only the areas
outside of the City’s levee system are at risk for tsunamis, including the adjacent marshlands, tidal flats
and former bay margin lands that are now artificially filled but are still at or below sea level.
Although the potential size of seiches has been forecasted for other large bodies of water, such as
Lake Tahoe16 and the Great Lakes, Staff has not been able to find any data forecasting potential
seiches on the San Francisco Bay. For the purposes of this plan, seiches are considered similar to
tsunamis.

6.3.2.6 Fire Following Earthquake
Earthquakes are often responsible for igniting fires which can contribute to a considerable share of the
overall damage in a disaster. The fires can start from a variety of sources: appliances with natural gas
pilot lights may tip, damaged electrical equipment may spark, and gas line connections may break.
Recently in the South Napa Earthquake a number of mobile homes were destroyed and damaged
when the gas connection to a home broke. In the Loma Prieta Earthquake, 36 fires broke out in San
Francisco alone, but luckily were contained quickly in large part due to the abnormally calm wind that
evening, and the fires’ proximity to the bay which allowed a fire boat to pump water to the fire where the
water lines had failed. In the 1906 earthquake over 3.5 square miles of San Francisco burned,
representing 80% of San Francisco’s property value at the time.
Fire following earthquake is especially sensitive because there are often multiple ignitions at once
(overwhelming fire crews), typical water supply for fighting fire may be reduced or unavailable, and
maneuvering fire crews to the ignition can be difficult if streets are blocked by road damage or by
debris. Fire following earthquake is an issue that could impact any Bay Area community that
experiences an earthquake – both urban and rural. The problem is heightened for urban environments,
where many simultaneous ignitions can lead to a firestorm, and single fires can more quickly and easily
move structure to structure.
A few characteristics can make a specific community more vulnerable to fire following earthquake. If
there is a higher likelihood of building damage, there is also a higher likelihood that an ignition occurs. If
a building collapses there is a high risk for gas or electrical lines to start “seed” fires that then impact
undamaged neighboring structures. Areas of liquefaction are more vulnerable to fire because of the
greater potential for underground gas mains to break due to the ground displacements, and because
the water lines in the area may also be damaged – preventing the ability to fight a fire with regular water
resources. Areas that are largely wood frame or shingle roof may be less prone to earthquake damage,
but are a heightened risk for the spread of fires. There is added concern in areas with hazardous
materials with the potential for explosion, or with the potential to produce toxic smoke. Industrial
facilities and labs are a high concern because of the hazardous and flammable materials they store at
their facilities.
In Foster City, the buildings with labs and the potential for more hazardous materials are generally
located on the north side of SR 92. These types of uses are typically located in newer buildings or in
buildings with newer tenant improvements that are therefore subject to the more recent building codes.
The building codes have been strengthened over time to include additional safety features, such as
flexible utility connections, leak detection systems, more advanced sprinkler systems, more stringent
ventilation requirements and spill notification systems.
6.3.3 Probability of Future Earthquakes
A powerfully damaging earthquake similar to the 1906 earthquake or 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake is
rare but likely to occur in the next 30 years. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimates
there is a 72% chance of one or more magnitude 6.7 or larger earthquakes in the next 30 years on one
of the Bay Area’s faults.17 Smaller magnitude earthquakes are more likely to occur, potentially
producing significant local damage, as experienced in the 2014 South Napa earthquake.

Scientists continually study which Bay Area faults are more likely to produce large earthquakes, and
how often. In March 2015, the USGS released an update to its 2008 earthquake probabilities for
California faults. The Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast 3 (UCERF3) provides detailed
assessment on the likelihood of each fault segment producing M6.7, M7.0 and M8.0 and greater
earthquakes. These probabilities are based on data such as fault length; how much energy the faults
release annually through fault slip; and, known historical return periods for the fault. Table 6-4
summarizes the probabilities of future earthquakes in California.

6.4        Flooding & Sea Level Rise
Flooding is a temporary condition that causes the partial or complete inundation of land that is normally
dry. Flooding occurs when streams, rivers, lakes, reservoirs, or coastal water bodies are abnormally
high and overflow into adjacent low-lying areas.
The magnitude of flood used as the standard for floodplain management in the United States is a flood
having a probability of occurrence of one percent in any given year, also known as the 100‐year flood
or base flood. The most readily available source of information regarding the 100‐year flood is the
system of Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) prepared by FEMA. These maps are used to support
the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and show 100‐year floodplain boundaries for identified
flood hazards. These areas are also referred to as Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) and are the
basis for flood insurance and floodplain management requirements under the NFIP. FIRMs also show
floodplain boundaries for the 500-year flood, which is the flood having a 0.2 percent chance of
occurrence in any given year, as shown in Figure 6-9.
The rivers and streams for which FEMA has prepared detailed engineering studies may also have
designated floodways. The floodway is the channel of a watercourse and portion of the adjacent
floodplain that is needed to convey the base or 100‐year flood event without increasing flood levels by
more than one foot and without significantly increasing flood velocities. The floodway must be kept free
of development or other encroachments.
Existing coastal and riverine flood maps are available from FEMA, and include existing and preliminary
map products for the San Francisco Bay and the Outer Coast of California.18

Sea level rise, one of the effects of global warming, will contribute to the potential for flooding. In the
past century, average global temperature has increased by about 0.8°C (1.4°F), and average global
sea level has increased by 7 to 8 in (17 to 21 cm).19
6.4.1 Types of Flooding
Coastal flooding is generally associated with Pacific Ocean storms from November through February
when high tides coincide with strong winds both on the outer coast and within the Bay.
The following factors contribute to the frequency and severity of coastal flooding:
      Astronomical Tides
      Storm Surge
      Wind Waves
      El Nino Events
      Sea Level Rise
Riverine flooding, also known as overbank flooding, can occur if there is excessive rainfall especially
in conjunction with high tides and strong winds. Riverine floodplains range from narrow, confined
channels in the steep valleys of mountainous and hilly regions to wide, flat areas in plains and coastal
regions. The potential for flooding of a floodplain is a function of the size and topography of the
contributing watershed, the regional and local climate, and land use characteristics. Flooding in steep,
mountainous areas is usually confined, occurs with less warning time, and has a short duration. Larger
rivers typically have longer, more predictable flooding sequences and broad floodplains. The lower
portions of coastal rivers are more likely to flood during high tides with backwater conditions that lead to
overbank flooding.
The following factors contribute to the frequency and severity of riverine flooding:
      Rainfall intensity and duration  
      Antecedent moisture conditions  
      Watershed conditions, including steepness of terrain, soil types, amount, and type of vegetation,
          and density of development  
      The existence of attenuating features in the watershed, including natural features such as
          swamps and lakes and human‐built features such as dams  
      The existence of flood control features, such as levees and flood control channels  
      Velocity of flow  
      Availability of sediment for transport, and the erodibility of the bed and banks of the watercourse
Localized, or nuisance, flooding can occur in areas that typically do not flood during locally heavy
precipitation events, especially if ground water levels are high during extremely wet seasons or if storm
water storage or conveyance facilities are inadequate. Localized flooding tends to occur in flat,
urbanized areas that are highly impermeable and can result in inundation of basements, low lying
roads, and parking lots from street drainage.
Flooding associated with severe storms has been among the most common disaster in the Bay Area
during the period from 1950 to 2015, occurring on average 1.3 times a year over the past 60 years.

Often heavy rainfall brings many areas of localized flooding, especially in low lying areas of the region.
Many other locally significant floods have occurred during this time period.
Extensive flooding in the Bay Area occurred in 1950, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1962, 1963, 1964, 1965, 1966,
1969, 1970, 1973, 1980, 1982, 1983, 1992, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 2005, 2006, and 2008.
6.4.2 Potential Future Flooding
Globally, sea levels are rising due to thermal expansion caused by the ocean warming and the melting
of land‐based ice such as glaciers and polar ice caps. Regionally and locally, the rate of sea level rise
is affected by other processes, including changes in land elevation (subsidence or uplift), coastal
erosion, wind and ocean currents, ocean temperature and salinity, atmospheric pressure, and large‐
scale climate regimes.20 Sea level at the San Francisco tide gauge has risen 8 in (20 cm) over the past
century.21
The National Research Council (NRC) Sea-Level Rise for the Coasts of California, Oregon, and
Washington study, released June 2012, provides regionally specific sea level rise projections for the
Coasts of California, Oregon, and Washington. Because there is significant uncertainty in how much
sea level will rise, the range in projected values increases over time.

Sea level rise has the potential to influence the impact of coastal, riverine and localized nuisance
flooding. In particular, without intervention rising sea levels may cause:
       More frequent floods: Rising sea levels can lead to more frequent flooding of existing flood-
          prone areas, including more frequent overtopping and overbank flooding of riverine systems that
          already flood when rainfall coincides with high tides due to the increased backwater effect. In
          addition, gravity drained and pumped systems that discharge storm water into flood control
          channels can have reduced performance, causing backups and flooding of streets and
          basements.

        More extensive, longer-duration flooding: As sea levels rise there is the potential that storm
         events will flood larger areas for longer periods of time and that there will be new overtopping
         and overbank flooding of riverine systems that do not currently cause flooding.
        Shoreline erosion and overtopping: Sea level rise can cause shoreline protection, such as
         levees, berms and revetments, to be damaged or fail due to increased tidal and wave energy.
         There is also the potential that shoreline protection will be overtopped during storm events when
         there are extreme tide levels and wind-driven waves, flooding inland areas, including homes
         and community services that are currently protected.
        Elevated groundwater and increased salinity intrusion: As sea levels rise, groundwater and
         salinity levels are also predicted to rise. This will cause damage to below grade living spaces,
         finished basements, and electrical/mechanical equipment that is below or at-grade. In addition,
         increasing groundwater levels may increase liquefaction susceptibility, and require the use of
         pumping of storm water for flood management, which will increase both operations and
         maintenance costs.
        Permanent inundation: Sea level rise can cause areas that are not currently exposed to
         regular high tide inundation to be flooded, resulting in the need to either protect or move people
         and infrastructure, and the loss of trails, beaches, vistas, and other shoreline recreation areas.
         In addition, increased tidal scour due to increased tidal prism in riverine systems can trigger
         changes in channel geometry and sediment transport processes.
The Foster City Levee Protection Planning Study (see Appendix E) evaluated whether the Belmont
Slough levee should be considered a coastal levee or a riverine levee. The cursory analysis contained
in the Study concluded that the required coastal levee height is greater, indicating that the coastal
process dominates within the Slough.24

In the Bay Area, the potential for new or prolonged flooding as sea level rises will not be confined to the
shoreline. Sea level rise will increase the likelihood of major flood events around the Bay Area because
higher water levels in tidal creeks and flood control channels will reduce capacity to discharge rainfall
runoff. While some creeks already flood when rainstorms coincide with high tides, rising sea levels will
cause flooding during smaller, more frequent rainfall events.
Sea level rise inundation maps help to visually assess under what conditions assets may be impacted
by sea level rise and storm events and how far reaching the consequences may be if they are
impacted. However, the City has found that the models currently available for estimating impacts of sea
level rise do not accurately reflect the actual heights of the Foster City levee. For this reason, there are
no maps of Sea Level Rise included within this document. Foster City is working with the FEMA Region
IX Risk Management Division and the Mitigation Division to include more accurate topographic data
regarding the Foster City levee in the available computer models. To understand these factors it is
helpful to evaluate a range of possible future sea level rise scenarios. The “total water level” approach
presented below simplifies this process.
A total water level of 36 inches above mean higher high water (MHHW)25 can represent a new “daily”
high tide with 36 inches of sea level rise. This amount of sea level rise, which is a likely projection for
2100, could result in regular, e.g., permanent, tidal inundation. This total water level can also represent
today’s 50-year extreme tide level, a one-year extreme tide level with 24 inches of sea level rise, or a
five-year extreme tide level with 12 inches of sea level rise, which is a likely 2050 projection. Extreme
tide events that are larger than daily high tide levels can result in episodic, short duration, or temporary,
flooding.
The matrix of numbers presented in Table 6-6 can be used to understand a range of total water levels,
from 0 to 95 inches above MHHW, represented both in terms of today’s tides and future tides as sea
level rises. Each total water level represents a combination of sea level rise (0 to 60”) and tide levels
(MHHW to a 100-year extreme event). As an example, the likely mid-century daily high tide is projected
to be 12” above today’s high tide, or 12”+MHHW. This total water level is approximately the level
observed during King Tide, which is an astronomical tide that occurs approximately twice per year
when the moon and the sun simultaneously exert their gravitational influence on the Earth.
Because of the uncertainties associated with modeling and mapping sea level rise, it is reasonable to
allow for a +/- 3-inch range when interpreting the total waters in Table 6-6. As an example, the likely
end-century high tide is projected to be 36 inches above today’s high tide, or 36”+MHHW. Water levels
ranging from 33 to 39 inches can be used to understand what other combination of tides and sea level
rise that may result in the same amount of flooding or inundation as 36”+MHHW.
The values presented in Table 6-6 are generally applicable to central San Francisco Bay26 and are
therefore appropriate for local and regional scale climate adaptation planning, although it may not be as
precise for some areas of North and South Bay. In addition, because tide levels do vary around the
Bay, additional information about tide levels should be used for site-scale planning. Finally, the values
in Table 6-6 are based on an analysis that does not include the effects of local wind waves and
assumes that future storms will behave like past storms.
25
   Mean higher high water (MHHW) is calculated as the average of the higher of the two daily high tides over a 19-year tidal
epoch.
26
   Existing condition water levels in the first row of Table 6-6. are based on FEMA model results for Central San Francisco
Bay, http://www.r9map.org/Pages/San-Francisco-Coastal-Bay-Study.aspx, and are being used by Alameda and San Francisco
Counties. Existing water level conditions for the other counties in the Bay Area will be available by the end of 2015.

6.4.3 Probability of Future Flooding
The probability of future flooding is dependent on improvements made to the levee system. Using the
results of the California Coastal Analysis and Mapping Project (CCAMP), as summarized in the “Central
San Francisco Bay Coastal Flood Hazard Study” prepared in July 2014, FEMA has concluded that
portions of the levee would need to be raised to restore FEMA’s accreditation of the levee system that
protects the City from a 100-year flood. The primary flood risk is wave overtopping during an extreme
storm surge that could potentially compromise the levee system. Throughout Foster City’s history, the
lagoon system has functioned to prevent local flooding by receiving storm water which is then conveyed
to San Francisco Bay, therefore, widespread flooding due to rainfall falling on the City is unlikely.
6.5       Levee Failure
Foster City is protected from the waters of San Francisco Bay by a levee system. The original perimeter
levee system in Foster City was put in place in the early 1900s to reclaim tidal mud flats for agricultural
use. The levees were formed with dredged bay mud deposited on the outboard side of a perimeter
channel system formed by the dredging. The development of Foster City in the 1960s made use of the
existing perimeter levee system to provide protection for the new development.27
The stability of levees is a function of several variables. Three main loading functions related to levee
failure are water level changes, ground shaking and static loading.28 Six main failure mechanisms are
described in the State of California Multi-Hazard Mitigation Plan as a function of the three loading
functions. Several of these potential failure mechanisms relate more to riverine levees like those in the
California Delta than coastal levees, such as in Foster City. The failure mechanisms identified in the
State’s Multi-Hazard Mitigation Plan are as follows:29

Hazard Analysis                                                     Chapter 7: Local Hazard Mitigation Plan/Safety Element
         1. A bearing failure in levees is typically deep-seated and is most likely induced by seismic
             ground shaking. Failure is commonly triggered by a seismic event that either causes a loss
             of soil strength or produces destabilizing inertial loading conditions.
         2. A sliding failure may occur if the foundation soil has a weak or brittle zone resulting in a
             preferred failure plane. Both seismic-induced inertial loading and high water levels can
             cause sliding failures.
         3. Slumping and spreading can be generated by two loading conditions. Cyclic loading from
             earthquakes may generate increased pore pressures and reduced soil strength, leading to
             volumetric and/or deviatoric strains in the foundation. The same results can also occur due
             to increased pore pressures from high water levels and increased seepage.
         4. Seepage is one of the most common failure mechanisms in levees. Levees are built in
             fluvial depositional environments, and it is common to find levees with an existing sandy
             layer beneath the foundation. The sandy layer can be a conduit for flow underneath the
             levee, resulting in critical conditions at the inboard (or landside) toe. This leads to erosion of
             the foundation during high water or a consistent weakening of the foundation over a long
             period of time, both eventually leading to failure. Biogenic agents can also lead to
             destabilizing seepage. This can include rodent holes, tree roots, or other biological activity
             that create conduits for seepage.
         5. High velocity flows can erode material from the outboard or waterside of the levee, which
             may lead to instability and failure. Erosion can occur at once or over time as a function of
             the storm cycle and the scale of the peak storms.
         6. The failure mechanism of overtopping occurs when high water exceeds the elevation of the
             levee crest. The water energy is then concentrated at the inboard toe of the levee, leading to
             soil erosion and decreased levee stability. Overtopping failure can be exacerbated by
             decreased levee crest height due to land subsidence.
Title 44 of the Code of Federal Regulations (44 CFR) Section 65.10 provides the minimum design,
operation, and maintenance standards levee systems must meet and continue to meet in order to be
recognized as providing protection from the base flood on a Flood Insurance Rate Map. For levees to
be recognized by FEMA, evidence that adequate design and operation and maintenance systems are
in place to provide reasonable assurance that protection from the base flood exists must be provided.
These are discussed further in Section 8, Capability Assessment.
The Foster City Levee system provides protection for very short-duration, extreme high tides coupled
with infrequent storm events. Unlike a riverine levee, which is required to retain flood water for many
days, the upper elevations of the Foster City Levee would only retain flood water for a matter of hours.
6.5.1 Probability of Levee Failure
Despite the recent loss of levee certification and accreditation by FEMA, the probability of levee failure
is low due to the robust armoring of those portions of the levee system exposed to wave hazards, which
protects against erosion due to wave action. The City is actively pursuing a project to restore the
required freeboard, verify the levee system’s ability to resist the various loads placed on it, and meet all
geotechnical performance standards to be in compliance with 44 CFR 65.10.30

6.6      Fire
Fires are typically characterized into three categories: urban fires, wildland-urban interface fires, and
wildland fires.
      Urban fires occur within a developed area and pose a direct risk to development.
      Wildland-urban interface (WUI) fires occur where the built environment and natural areas are
         intermixed (the fringe of urban areas).
      Wildland fires exist in wilderness land.
Fires in the urban environment and in the wildland-urban interface result in direct damage to the built
environment and can injure or kill residents. Wildland fires can cause damage to linear infrastructure
systems that serve the Bay Area, causing outages downstream of the failure; can impact the air quality
in cities during the duration of the fire; and can impact water quality in watersheds impacted by a
wildland fire. Wildland and wildland-urban interface fires can also damage natural environments, such
as recreational areas, and can cause lasting impacts to slopes and soils.
In the Bay Area, fire areas generally fall into two categories – State Responsibility Areas, where the
California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CALFIRE) is responsible for fire protection, and
Local Responsibilities, where local fire departments and fire protection districts have responsibility.
Foster City does not include any wildlands or State Responsibility Areas and therefore will address
only urban fires subject to local responsibilities in the LHMP/Safety Element.
6.6.1 Urban Conflagration
While the primary fire threat in the Bay Area is from wildfire, urban conflagration, or a large disastrous
fire in an urban area, is a major hazard that can occur due to many causes such as wildfires,
earthquakes, gas leaks, chemical explosions, or arson. The urban fire conflagration that followed the
1906 San Francisco Earthquake did more damage than the earthquake itself. A source of danger to
cities throughout human history, urban conflagration has been reduced as a general source of risk to
life and property through improvements in community design, construction materials, and fire protection
systems.
Fire hazards in industrial buildings are also mitigated by increasingly stringent requirements over time.
These types of uses are typically located in newer buildings or in buildings with newer tenant
improvements that are therefore subject to the more recent building codes. In Foster City, the building
codes have been strengthened over time to include additional safety features, such as flexible utility
connections, leak detection systems, more advanced sprinkler systems, more stringent ventilation
requirements and spill notification systems. These changes in the codes have evolved based on
problems experienced and lessons learned from fires resulting in losses of life and property.
6.6.2 Probability of Future Fire
Due to multiple variables including cause, weather, and location, there is no formal way to estimate the
probability of fire within the scope of this document.
6.7      Drought
A drought is a gradual phenomenon that occurs over several dry years, depleting reservoirs and
groundwater basins without the expected annual recharge from winter precipitation. While drought does

Hazard Analysis                                                        Chapter 7: Local Hazard Mitigation Plan/Safety Element
not have any primary impacts in the Bay Area, prolonged periods of drought can cause secondary
impacts that can affect the region, including:
      Reduced water supply for crops and livestock feed, impacting the economy centered around the
          agriculture industry as well as impacts to the general economy related to cost of food
      Increased wildfire hazard, including more fire starts and more prolonged conflagrations fueled
          by excessively dry vegetation and reduced water supply for firefighting purposes
      Subsidence due to a lowering water table
      May be correlated to high heat conditions
Drought is not localized, but occurs simultaneously across the region, and may extend statewide or
across a larger expanse of western states. This has been the case in California since 2013. While the
drought exists in every county, the impacts of the drought are locally unique, based on local water
supply systems, soil conditions, and the typical climate and vegetation land covering. The effects of
drought are managed in the Bay Area through the importation of water and the storage of water in
reservoirs.
6.7.1 Historic Bay Area Drought Occurrences
Major droughts occurred in California that affected the Bay Area in 1973, 1976-77, 1987-1991, and
2007-09. Drought conditions in 1973 led to a state-declared disaster in Glenn, San Benito, and Santa
Clara counties, resulting in $8 million in agricultural loss. Between 1976 and 1977, California
experienced one of its most severe droughts. 1977 was the state’s driest year on record, and according
to the California Department of Water Resources, and in the Bay Area, Contra Costa, Napa, San
Mateo, and Marin counties were four of the several counties where a state disaster was declared.
Statewide, $2.67 billion in damages occurred in the two-year period. Marin, Solano, and Sonoma
counties were also affected in the 1987-1991 drought, which caused $1.7 billion in crop losses
nationwide. The 2007-2009 drought did not directly affect Bay Area counties, but caused $300 million in
crop loss statewide.31
In January 2014, the Governor declared a State of Emergency in California in response to current
drought conditions, which began in 2012. As of June 2015, statewide reservoirs were at 18-67 percent
of average and Sonoma County had declared a local Emergency Proclamation.32
6.7.2 Drought Hazard in the Bay Area
Drought can impact the entire Bay Area, not just one particular county or city. In addition, shortages in
precipitation in the Sierra Nevada can have a more pronounced impact on water supply in the region
than a drought in the Bay Area itself because of the reliance of the region on water from the Tuolumne,
Mokelumne, Sacramento, and San Joaquin watersheds. Thus, drought is not a hazard that can be
depicted by a Bay Area map; rather a map of Northern California is necessary to understand the impact
of drought on Bay Area water supply.
Figure 6-10 illustrates where the largest water districts in the region collect water. Only a third of the
water used in the Bay Area is from local rainfall collection and groundwater pumping; the remainder
comes from runoff in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Figure 6-11 highlights the severity of the current
drought in watersheds Bay Area districts are dependent on for their water. In 2015, portions of the Bay
Area were downgraded slightly because of average rainfall in micro climates of the region. Other

6.7.3 Probability of Future Drought – Climate Influenced
Climate change is likely to increase the number and severity of future droughts. The cumulative impact
of climate change impacts will result in drier conditions, and will alter the timing and efficiency of the
Bay Area water supply. An increase in temperature and a reduction in snow pack are the two most
direct effects of climate change that will result in a drier state with fewer natural water resources than
historically have been available.
In the Bay Area temperatures are projected to increase between 3 degrees (low emission scenario) and
6 degrees Fahrenheit (high emission scenario).34 In the eastern regions of the state, the increase is 4 to
9 degrees.
The reduction in snowpack does not have direct impacts in the Bay Area as the region does not
accumulate meaningful levels of snow. The Bay Area is adversely impacted by the severe reduction in
snow pack in the Sierras, the source of two-thirds of the region’s water. By the end of the century the
spring snow pack in the Sierra could be reduced by as much as 70 to 90 percent of the historic
average.35
6.8       Extreme Heat
The Bay Area, especially away from the coast and bay, can experience extreme heat days, where the
Heat Index, a function of heat and relative humidity, is high. Extreme heat days pose a public health
threat, causing symptoms such as exhaustion, heat cramps, and sunstroke if the Heat Index is over
90F. The National Weather Service has developed a Heat Index Program Alert which gets triggered
when high temperatures are expected to exceed 105 to 110 for at least two consecutive days. Heat
emergencies occur when residents are subject to heat exhaustion and heatstroke, and are more likely
to occur in areas not adapted to heat and without air conditioning, cooling centers, or vegetation to
mediate heat impacts in exposed areas. Certain populations are typically the most at risk during
extreme heat emergencies, including people with disabilities, chronic diseases, the elderly, and
children.36
Extreme heat emergencies typically build over time with cumulative effects. Because of this, and the
fact that they do not cause substantial physical damage to the built environment, they do not elicit the
same immediate response that other hazards do. However, they claim many lives in comparison to
other disasters. The California Climate Adaptation Strategy, citing a California Energy Commission
Study, states that heat waves have claimed more lives in California than all other disaster events
combined.37
6.8.1 Historic Extreme Heat
No heat emergencies in California have been declared a disaster at the State or Federal level between
1960 and 2008.38 The Spatial Hazard Events and Loss Data for the United States estimates
approximately 47 heat events in California during this time. In 2006 a notable heat wave spread
throughout most of the United States and Canada, causing 140 fatalities in California.39

6.8.2 Extreme Heat Hazard in the Bay Area
The Bay Area has historically experienced 4 extreme heat days a year.40 Depending on low and high
emission scenarios, and the location within the region, in the future a Bay Area city may experience an
average of anywhere from 20 to 80 extreme heat days in a year. Cal-Adapt, California’s database of
climate data and visualization tools provides five different ways to define the extreme heat hazard: (1)
number of extreme heat days by year, (2) number of warm nights by year, (3) number of heat waves by
year (heat wave is defined as 5 consecutive extreme heat days), (4) timing of extreme heat days by
year (i.e. which months do extreme heat hazards occur), and (5) the maximum duration of heat wave
by year. These metrics are projecting both the intensity and the temporal nature of extreme heat.
6.8.2.1 Intensity
The intensity of extreme heat is defined differently for each location in the region. In San Francisco
County an extreme heat day is defined as a day above 78, while for inland portions of Solano County
extreme heat is defined as a day above 100. The threshold is the 98th percentile historic maximum
temperature. The threshold is set locally to recognize services and buildings in cooler climates that may
not be designed to handle moderate heat, while those areas where high heat has always been an
occurrence, already have measures to address their historic temperatures.
In addition to the number of extreme heat days expected to rise in the Bay Area, the temperature is
expected to increase well above thresholds over the next century. In San Francisco County by the end
of the century there could be multiple days a year where temperatures reach 95, while in Solano
County there may be multiple days above 115 each year.
According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Climate Summary Report
for the Redwood City Weather Station, maximum daily temperatures in excess of 90 degrees occurred
557 times between 1982 and 2012. Based on this data, Foster City can expect to experience
temperatures in excess of 90 degrees approximately 19 days a year.41
6.8.2.2 Temporal
Extreme heat is made worse when it is experienced over a longer stretch of time. The number of heat
waves (five or more consecutive days of extreme heat) will increase as will the length of heat waves.42
By the end of the century most of the region will average six heat waves a year, with the average
longest heat wave lasting ten days. In addition to the more frequent occurrence and duration of heat
waves, they are expected to occur in months the region historically hasn’t experienced extreme heat.
Historically, extreme heat occurs between July and August, but in the future extreme heat will be an
issue the region faces in both the spring and fall.43
Foster City’s location on the San Francisco Bay will mitigate the impacts of extreme heat relative to
more inland locations.

6.8.3 Probability of Future Extreme Heat
Climate change is expected to generate an increase in ambient average air temperature, particularly in
the summer. The outer Bay Area will likely experience greater temperature increases than coastal or
bayside jurisdictions, though likely not as great as in the eastern-most inland communities. The
frequency, intensity, and duration of extreme heat events and heat waves are also expected as regional
climate impacts.44
According to California Climate Change Center, by mid-century, extreme heat in urban centers could
cause two to three times more heat-related deaths than occur today.45 Statewide, temperatures could
increase anywhere from 3 to 10.5 depending on CO2 emission levels, leading to more frequent, hotter
days throughout the year.
6.9       Dam Failure
The dams built in the Bay Area over the last 150 years were built without seismic or government
regulation. Dams can be damaged by large storms and the associated runoff, an earthquake, slope
failures, or a terrorism event. While dam failure is rare, their failure can be catastrophic, destroying
downstream structures and killing people, while reducing water supply to the Bay Area until the dam is
rebuilt.
In 1972, California implemented Government Code § 8589.5 requiring dam owners to develop maps
depicting inundation areas that might be affected by dam failure. The law required that each map be
produced only once, without any requirements for updating. Further, the scenario used to create the
maps restricted the results to a worst case situation that does not fit the historical evidence of dam
failure.
The Lower Crystal Springs Dam is the only dam that could potentially affect Foster City and is the
largest of the dams that affect San Mateo County. Constructed in 1888, as a part of the water system
that brings water to the Peninsula from the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir in the Sierra Nevada Mountains,
this gravity dam was built on the San Mateo Creek. The dam impounds water to form the Lower Crystal
Springs Reservoir. The reservoir is a water supply for San Francisco and most cities within San Mateo
County. Despite its location directly on the San Andreas Fault, the dam has survived both the 1906 San
Francisco earthquake and the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.
The Division of Safety of Dams (DSOD) reviews and inspects the dams for potential failure due to a
major seismic event. According to the most recent report, the DSOD indicates that the dam is
structurally safe and will perform without failure. In 2010 the Lower Crystal Springs Dam was evaluated
for the effects of an 8.3 magnitude earthquake (on the Richter scale). Based on this evaluation, it was
determined the potential for dam failure would be low. If events caused a failure of the dam, the area of
potential inundation is shown in Figure 6-12.
In 1983, the DSOD mandated the maximum allowable water surface elevation of the Lower Crystal
Spring Dam reservoir be lowered by 8 feet until completion of hydraulic upgrades to the dam’s spill
capacity. This lower maximum operating elevation reduces the reservoir’s storage capacity by 16%, a
reduction of 2.6 billion gallons of water.

The San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC), in conjunction with the County of San Mateo,
completed these upgrades to Lower Crystal Springs Dam and the bridge that passes over the dam in
May 2012.
The purpose of the Lower Crystal Springs Dam Improvements Project is to comply with these DSOD
requirements including raising the existing parapet wall at the top of the dam, widening the dam’s
spillway and enlarge the stilling basin. These improvements will ensure that during an extremely large
flood event, the reservoir’s water is correctly directed through the dam’s spillway and into San Mateo
Creek.
As indicated in Figure 6-12, the inundation area resulting from a failure of the Lower Crystal Springs
Dam would reach Foster City. The map does not take into consideration the ability of the cities of San
Mateo and Foster City to lower the water levels in San Mateo’s Marina Lagoon and the Foster City
Lagoon by utilizing the pumps and tide gates.
6.9.1 Probability of Dam Failure
No quantitative probability information exists for the Bay Area dam failure hazard. When a dam is
known to have a failure potential, the water level is reduced to allow for partial collapse without
catastrophic loss of water, as required by the California Department of Water Resources, Division of
Safety of Dams (DSOD). For example, in 2001 the DSOD restricted the Calaveras Reservoir to
approximately 30% of its original capacity to avoid a catastrophic release of water until the deficiencies
are corrected. This decrease in capacity reduced the probability of failure resulting in damage to near
zero.46

6.10 Hazardous Materials
Releases of Extremely Hazardous Substances (EHS) can occur during transport and from fixed
facilities. Transportation-related releases are generally more troublesome because they can occur
anywhere, including close to human populations, critical facilities, or sensitive environmental areas.
Transportation-related EHS releases are also more difficult to mitigate due to the variability of locations
and distance from response resources.
In Foster City, a hazardous material incident is most likely to occur within the City’s industrial areas,
and along land and water transportation corridors. Trucks and vessels that use these transportation
corridors commonly carry a variety of hazardous materials, including gasoline, other petroleum
products, and other chemicals known to cause human health problems. Additionally, State Route 92
which bisects Foster City as it runs east-west is a major highway that carries large quantities of
hazardous materials.
Foster City is home to a number of biotech companies, which increases the vulnerability for hazardous
material incidents, and its proximity to residential areas would put a significant population at risk should
a serious release occur.
6.10.1           Probability of Hazardous Materials Exposure
Due to the wide variations among the type and magnitude of hazardous materials accidents, there is no
formal way to estimate the probability of these events within the scope of this document.
6.11 Transportation Accidents
Transportation accidents exemplify a hazard with a large number of low-impact events and a small
number of high-impact events. Every year more than 40,000 people die in transportation accidents in
the United States. The vast majority of these are the result of traffic accidents. Of the traffic deaths,
most occur on highways and rural roads. While individual accidents are not large incidents, they have a
large cumulative impact. Many programs and regulations have been established to improve safety. The
means to handle the most frequent incidents fall well within the scope of daily operations of local
government. Occasionally larger incidents occur that have a bigger, more lasting impact on the
community and challenge the response capabilities of local government.
A plane or jet crash in Foster City could cause serious damage and life loss requiring an immediate
and coordinated response by various law enforcement, fire, and emergency medical services. In the
case of a downed aircraft, the size and speed of the airframe, and highly flammable fuel magnify the
emergency response services required. The number of people killed and injured from an aircraft
accident is dependent on the location of the crash and the way the plane impacts the ground. If the
crash occurs in a populated area, the time of day affects the numbers of persons injured or killed on the
ground.
Law enforcement efforts in a major crash would focus on cordoning off the impacted location,
maintaining open traffic lanes for emergency vehicles, and keeping curious citizens at a safe distance
from the incident. Firefighting resources would be charged with fire containment, search and rescue,
patient triage and treatment. EMS would be responsible for additional patient triage, treatment and
transportation to area hospitals. Depending on local arrangements, the local response agencies will
affect a unified command organization. Mobile command and communication centers would be
established as needed.

Foster City is located approximately 5 miles southeast of San Francisco International Airport (SFO), the
seventh busiest international airport in the United States and twenty-second busiest in the world. SFO
is owned by the City and County of San Francisco and operated in San Mateo County. Aircraft landing
at SFO usually make their approaches to Runway 28 by flying west up the Bay, in close proximity to
Foster City.
Due to the close proximity of dwelling units and high density of the urbanized area, a downed jet liner
could cause a large number of fatalities and serious injuries. The immediate impact would be high and
the risk of fire spreading to both homes and Foster City’s economic centers would be significant.
While the above scenario would dictate a quick and multi-jurisdictional response, the probability of such
an event is low. According to national studies of airport accidents involving large aircraft, the vast
majority of airliner accidents occur either immediately before landing or within 1,000 yards of take-off.

Due to the wide variations among the type and magnitude of transportation accidents, there is no
formal way to estimate the probability of these events within the scope of this document.
6.12 Crime
Foster City has a very low crime rate and year after year, is ranked one of the safest cities in California
in which to live and work. According to the California Office of the Attorney General’s crime statistics for
2014, Foster City had 14 violent crimes, which results in a crime rate of 42.6 crimes per 100,000
inhabitants compared to rates of 209.4 for San Mateo County and 393.3 for California.

Vulnerability Analysis/Risk Assessment                  Chapter 7: Local Hazard Mitigation Plan/Safety Element
7 VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS/RISK ASSESSMENT
After a disaster, community vitality is dependent upon people, buildings, and utility and transportation
infrastructure. Each of these assets contributes unique benefits to the community, and each has
specific vulnerabilities to disasters. This chapter describes the role of these assets and how they are
each uniquely vulnerable. Without an understanding of the asset’s role, there is no basis to understand
what damage means for the community.
People (7.2) experience hazards through damage to buildings and interruption of infrastructure
services. While some people will be directly injured or killed by hazards, this is a small portion of the
impacts on people. The vast majority of impacts will be felt through a person’s ability to manage the
secondary impacts from the hazard.
        Social vulnerability describes characteristics that make people less able to adequately withstand
        and adapt to a hazard, such as limited mobility, income, and educational attainment. Social
        vulnerabilities are largely independent of the hazard type and can be applied similarly to any
        type of disaster.
Buildings (7.3) & Utility and Transportation Infrastructure (7.4) support community vitality. Impacts
to the built environment can have significant consequences to the people who live and work in the
buildings and depend on the functions the buildings and infrastructure provide. The built environment is
impacted by disasters primarily in two ways:
        Physical vulnerability describes how an asset can be physically damaged by a disaster.
        Because buildings and infrastructure are uniquely vulnerable to different hazards, they are
        described hazard by hazard.
        Functional vulnerability describes ways in which hazards can impact the ability of the asset to
        function as needed, either directly or indirectly, such as by limiting a sewer treatment plant’s
        ability to operate if power is unavailable.
7.1     Methodology
The planning team conducted a risk assessment to determine the potential impacts of hazards to the
people and built environments of Foster City. The approach used for the risk assessment was
conducted using available data, technology and resources. Each of the hazards noted in Section 6
were reviewed based on disaster declaration history and other studies, reports and planning documents
available, such as ABAG’s Risk Landscape documents and open data sources, the location and extent
of previous occurrences, and probability of future events.
Using a qualitative analysis method, the planning team conducted an exposure analysis to determine
which assets will be exposed to a specific hazard and provided a basic understanding of the magnitude
of possible damage or loss after a disaster. Examples of maps used in this analysis are shown in
Figures 7-2, 7-4 and 7-5. Due to Foster City’s small size and homogenous physical and environmental
characteristics, the extent of the hazards was also homogenous within the areas protected by the
levee. The planning team chose to use the Earthquake Ground shaking Scenario Map depicting a
Magnitude 7.8 earthquake on the San Andreas Fault to illustrate vulnerability due to the likelihood of
the scenario and impact on people, buildings and infrastructure.
88 | LHMP-Safety Element – Adopted-November 21, 2016

Vulnerability Analysis/Risk Assessment                  Chapter 7: Local Hazard Mitigation Plan/Safety Element
The remainder of the qualitative analysis utilized a risk assessment questionnaire provided by ABAG to
describe the physical, functional, and governance vulnerabilities of assets which were considered as
individual assets, asset classes, or representative assets. This assessment considered the anticipated
impact on society, the economy and the environment, and the planning team was able to prioritize
assets based on this analysis.
For the purposes of this plan, the discussion of vulnerability of people and economic resources is
included in Section 7.2, and the vulnerability of the built environment is included in Sections 7.3
(Buildings) and 7.4 (Infrastructure).
7.2      People
The character of Bay Area residents is responsible for the strong community vitality, distinctive culture,
and its unique economy. The Bay Area is especially diverse, showcasing many different lifestyles,
cultures, and languages that provide a wide variety of cultural experiences. Longtime residents of the
region have special knowledge, social networks, and cultural memories that make them strong
stewards for neighborhoods, parks, and trails. If a disaster forces Bay Area residents from their homes,
social networks will be broken, and the diverse culture of the region will change.
The Bay Area’s economy relies on service, labor, creative, and professional workers. The Bay Area
economy is unique in that it is home to one of the fastest growing and most innovative economic
sectors in the world. If a disaster impedes the ability of employees of any sector to stay in the region or
get to work, the impact will cascade beyond individual businesses and be felt not just across the region,
but globally. Employees from all sectors are needed to support one of the strongest and most
specialized economies in the world.
People are a critical asset for the functioning of a community and the economy; without residents a
jurisdiction loses its tax base and employers lose employees and customers. More importantly,
jurisdictions lose the culture, vibrancy, and sense of cohesiveness that make them unique. Jurisdictions
in the Bay Area should understand that people are the nexus of a resilient community, and many other
assets are designed to serve and support people.

7.2.1 Social Vulnerability
Unlike other asset classes like buildings and infrastructure, the vulnerability of people is not just due to
physical characteristics but rather social characteristics that make them less able to adequately
withstand and adapt to a hazard. People are also highly dependent upon the physical environment that
they are surrounded by; community members are much more vulnerable if the buildings and
infrastructure that they live in, work in, and rely upon fail.
In 2015, ABAG and the Bay Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC) published Stronger
Housing, Safer Communities, a report that identified ten primary indicators that represent
characteristics of individuals and households that affect their ability to prepare for, respond to, and
recover from a disaster.47 These indicators collectively present a picture of a community’s vulnerability
to stressors. Concentration of these indicators, or areas with multiple indicators, can inhibit the recovery
of a community. Using Census data, ABAG and BCDC mapped community vulnerability in the region.
In Foster City, because the Census blocks used in the maps are very large, the mapping of the data is
not useful. The concepts do, however, indicate possible vulnerabilities of some populations. Key
themes that emerged included age-related vulnerabilities, language and ethnicity vulnerabilities, cost-
burdened residents, housing tenure issues, and access to resources. Table 7-1 summarizes the key

As discussed in Section 5.3, several trends are expected to alter the demographics of Foster City in the
coming years, but these are anticipated to affect all areas of the City fairly evenly:
       Rise of the Millennials.
       Growing senior population.
       Worsening workforce-housing shortage.
       Increasing ethnic diversity.
       Increase of people with developmental disabilities.
Figure 7-2 shows the distribution of vulnerable populations throughout Foster City in the context of the
ground shaking hazard map. As discussed in Section 2.1, Foster City’s community is largely
homogenous with regard to distribution among neighborhoods and vulnerable populations are not
concentrated in any one area of the City. One item of note is that apartment developments that contain
units in the City’s Affordable Housing Program in the very low-income category include households with
less than 50% of the area median income. Also, the new Foster Square development (under
construction in 2016) adjacent to City Hall with approximately 400 senior housing units will result in a
greater concentration of seniors in this portion of the City.

7.3        Buildings/Structures
One of the most commonly reported disaster metrics is the number of damaged and destroyed
buildings. The overall extent of damage is telling, but not every damaged building will have an equal
impact on a community. Certain building uses, and the extent of damage to individual buildings, can
have a great influence on the ability of a community to recover from a disaster. Understanding the
function of the building stock and the potential for damage is central to understanding the impact that
disasters have on people’s lives and on the ability to recover.49
Housing, employment centers, and critical facilities are featured because of their important role in the
fabric of a community and because they can significantly affect recovery. Each building use has unique
functional vulnerabilities as the community relies on each building sector for different critical needs.
However, the physical vulnerabilities of the buildings are the same across different building uses and
instead vary by building construction type and by hazard. Different construction types may respond
differently to a disaster, and buildings may also respond differently to different disasters. When
assessing potential disaster impacts, it is important to consider both the physical vulnerability of the
building that could lead to damage in a hazard event and the functional vulnerability of the building,
including what services it provides and who it serves, that would be interrupted or displaced.
Beyond essential services, many communities’ buildings also contribute greatly to the character and
history of the community. In Foster City, the Recreation Center is identified as a key asset due to its
significance as a community/cultural resource as well as a potential emergency shelter site.
7.3.1 Building Uses
7.3.1.1 Housing
Retaining housing is crucial to expediting and ensuring an effective disaster recovery. Limiting
catastrophic housing damage and keeping residents in their homes not only helps people who may lack
the resources to effectively recover from a disaster, but also keeps communities intact.50 If residents
are able to stay in their community, they can continue to assist recovery and rebuilding efforts, and
support local businesses. Many community members, especially those who exhibit vulnerability
characteristics described in Section 7.2.1, are highly dependent upon the housing they live in as a
critical factor in their resilience to a major disaster.
Multiple studies have shown that population loss after a disaster significantly slows recovery time,51,52,53
thus, keeping housing intact is fundamental to community stability. In the aftermath of natural disasters,
the recovery of the region’s economy is interdependent with the recovery of the region’s housing. If
residents can stay in their homes, they will be better able to participate in the rebuilding of their
neighborhoods and cities, go to work and support local business, and improve the recovery trajectory of
the entire region.
Beyond providing shelter, homes are also a financial asset for homeowners. For most owners, their
home is their largest financial asset, and is something they leverage to finance other spending (cars,
tuition, etc.). For many, especially in the Bay Area housing market, a home represents the single

Vulnerability Analysis/Risk Assessment                  Chapter 7: Local Hazard Mitigation Plan/Safety Element
largest investment an owner will ever make.54 The damage or loss of housing is a real threat to the
investment that many homeowners have made, and many homeowners choose not to purchase
earthquake insurance, since it tends to have high premiums and deductibles. However, even if a home
is demolished, the homeowner is responsible for the remainder of the home loan. Following a major
disaster, owners with severely damaged or destroyed homes may have to default on their loan and
walk away from their property at a significant loss if they’re unable to accumulate enough financial
support to repair or rebuild.
While it is widely assumed that new housing is built to a standard that provides adequate protection for
residents, current code is designed to protect from loss of life, not necessarily reducing damage to the
building. Newly constructed homes may still experience significant damage, displacing and creating
financial hardship for residents. This is especially true for homes in liquefaction and flooding areas.
New housing and future growth should be given sufficient consideration for both current and future
hazards.
In Foster City, given the relatively young age of housing, many of the most vulnerable types of housing
structures are not part of the housing stock, such as unreinforced masonry, soft-story structures, cripple
wall structures, etc. However, as noted above, even newly constructed housing may still experience
significant damage.
7.3.1.2 Employment Centers
In a major natural disaster in the Bay Area, many businesses will close due to building damage,
inventory loss, utility outages, supply chain disruptions, inability of employees get to work, or a loss of
customer base. For businesses further removed from the hardest hit areas, disruption may last only a
few days or weeks. For harder hit businesses, disruptions could be much longer, forcing them to close
permanently or move elsewhere, either nearby or in an entirely different region.
Other factors likely to impact economic recovery include the dependency of businesses on our regional
infrastructure systems; water, sewer, power, and access to broadband and communication; which are
key to business operation and continuity. Ongoing infrastructure disruptions or unreliability will
challenge businesses. Public transit, roads and highways are essential for the workforce to travel to
work, particularly when more than half of Bay Area residents reside in a different county than where
they work. The recovery of the education sector is also key; K-12 schools not only provide education to
children, but provide the daycare that allows parents to return to work. Long school closures due to
structural damage or prolonged shelter use will delay return of employees to work.
The Bay Area functions as a single economic unit, meaning that among the counties in the region there
is a high degree of interconnectedness between where people work and live. Jobs as well as housing
are distributed widely throughout the region, but only 53 percent of residents work in the county in
which they live. All of the counties and sub-regions are highly dependent on one another for their
economic functioning and on the region’s transportation network. In addition, the Bay Area contains
clusters of highly specialized and interdependent businesses, such as the tech sector in Silicon Valley.
As these businesses are closely located, a disaster could have significant impact on an entire sector,
affecting not just the Bay Area but state, national, and global economies.
Other potential barriers to economic recovery include the disruption of vendors and supply chains to
and from the region and the repercussions for national and international markets. Business disruption
has upstream and downstream impacts on supply chains that can exacerbate impacts on the economy.

Vulnerability Analysis/Risk Assessment                   Chapter 7: Local Hazard Mitigation Plan/Safety Element
Just as different sectors are impacted differently, businesses of varying sizes can recover very
differently. A large portion of the Bay Area’s economic activity is based on small businesses. Small
businesses are valuable contributors to the economic and cultural vitality of the region, but an
estimated 25 percent of small businesses do not re-open following severe disruptions from a major
disaster.55 Many of these businesses provide the day-to-day necessities for residents such as
groceries, shopping, doctors’ offices, pharmacies, and restaurants. Essential services are mandatory
for getting residents to remain or return. Until essential goods and services are available, people will
stay away. Many operate out of a single facility, which if damaged or surrounded by damage, may be
unable to recover. Because they often rely more on local consumers, small businesses can be
particularly devastated by prolonged recovery. Small businesses with tight profit margins are also
unlikely to have any level of business continuity insurance, making even moderate disruptions difficult
to endure. Impacts to local small businesses can have a significant impact on the entire region’s
economy.
Large businesses have a different effect on the Bay Area economy. Large-scale enterprises can be
major employers for a single city. These businesses are essential to many local economies. During a
disaster, however, large national corporations, unlike small local businesses, have the capital
necessary to temporarily or even permanently move their operations out of the region. In addition, the
Bay Area regulatory environment, including zoning, permitting and environmental regulations may also
inhibit businesses after a disaster, making it too difficult to stay or rebuild. Such an exodus can have
disastrous consequences for local employment, as well as for a city’s or county’s tax base. Whether
small or large, local or national, businesses are a large part of what keeps the Bay Area thriving.
In Foster City, the major employers, such as Gilead Sciences and Visa, occupy relatively new
buildings that have been constructed under stringent building codes to be more resilient and to
maximize life safety. These more stringent codes do not necessarily mean that there will be no building
damage. Employment centers may still experience damage that results in loss of use of the buildings
and potential negative economic impacts. The City routinely collaborates with major employers to
improve emergency preparedness.
7.3.1.3 Critical Facilities
Some services such as healthcare, schools, and police and fire, are crucial for the functioning of
communities, especially in the immediate post disaster environment. Other essential facilities for
community functioning include public buildings that house community services such as libraries, or
privately owned grocery stores, gas stations, banks, parks, places of worship, and many others.
Understanding where these facilities are, and which communities they serve, is crucial to understanding
the consequence if they are damaged.

Hospitals and Health Care Facilities
Hospitals and health care buildings are important for two reasons: they treat those injured during the
hazard event, and they are housing or serving patients with specific medical needs. In Foster City,
although there are no hospitals, there are a few health care offices. San Mateo County Health System
manages the emergency preparedness concerns of the County-wide health system through its
Medical/Health Operational Area Coordinator Program.
Schools
Schools are particularly important community assets, as residents highly value the safety and education
of their children. Safe schools are important for the safety of children inside. A functional school
following a disaster is also important to continue providing educational services during a community’s
97 | LHMP-Safety Element – Adopted-November 21, 2016

Vulnerability Analysis/Risk Assessment                    Chapter 7: Local Hazard Mitigation Plan/Safety Element
recovery. If they are not operational, families may choose to move in order to enroll their children in
school. For families that stay, parents may be unable to return to work if schools are not in session.
The important role of a school expands beyond education. Schools can be the center of a community’s
social fabric. They are not just a space for youth, but a place for the community as a whole. Schools are
often where community meetings, performances, and events are held. Following disasters, some
schools can serve as temporary shelter sites, while others might house social services to support
disaster stricken communities. In Foster City there are four public schools and several additional
private schools and childcare centers.
7.3.2 Building Vulnerability
Some buildings are more susceptible to damage in hazard events than others. For example, a well
designed building neighboring a poorly designed building can experience the same flood level or the
same degree of shaking but have completely different outcomes.
Building use can be affected in a disaster by both direct damage as described in the sections above, or
by the interruption of necessary services. Most buildings and the services they house are only
functional if necessary infrastructure systems are also functional. If a restaurant requires electricity to
cook and store food, their building may remain closed is power is out. If water and wastewater services
are unavailable in a neighborhood for a length of time, people with undamaged homes may still be
forced to leave until services are restored. Some critical facilities and well-prepared organizations have
resources like storage or back-up generators to reduce these vulnerabilities to their building function.
7.3.2.1 Earthquake Ground Shaking
In general, ground shaking impacts buildings by exerting lateral forces on a building. Buildings are
primarily structurally designed to withstand vertical force (gravity) but may not be able to withstand
lateral forces as well. This is particularly true for older buildings that were built before building codes
recognized the types of forces that ground shaking exerts on buildings. However, depending on the
building construction type, the way that the building responds to lateral forces differs. In the Bay Area,
there are several older building types that have been identified as particularly vulnerable to ground
shaking.
Even if the structure performs adequately in an earthquake; it can still be unusable after an earthquake
because of non-structural damage. Chimneys, cladding, and parapets can fall off the outside of a
building. Windows may break and ceiling tiles and lights may fall. Heat and cooling systems and other
interior utilities may break. Broken water pipes and fire sprinklers can cause significant water damage.
Fallen shelves, file cabinets, pictures, and the contents of cupboards and cabinets can create a
significant mess. If these components are not properly anchored or braced, they can fall and injure
people, or can be damaged, limiting the utility of the overall facility. All buildings rely on interior services
that must be properly anchored and protected from other falling non-structural elements.
Given the relatively young age of Foster City buildings, the City does not have buildings of the most
hazardous types, specifically cripple wall buildings, pre-WWII homes not bolted to the foundation, multi-
story buildings with large openings on the first floor built before 1978, non-ductile concrete buildings
built before 1980 and unreinforced masonry buildings.
A relatively cheap and fast way to build a warehouse structure is to build concrete walls horizontally
first, and then tilt them vertically. Footings and the roof are the main structural elements that then keep
98 | LHMP-Safety Element – Adopted-November 21, 2016

Vulnerability Analysis/Risk Assessment                    Chapter 7: Local Hazard Mitigation Plan/Safety Element
the walls standing. These buildings are called tilt-ups, and are common as warehouses, strip malls, and
light industrial facilities. Many tilt-up warehouses have also been repurposed as offices, recreational
facilities, and even schools or assembly buildings. Most tilt-up concrete buildings built prior to 1995 lack
adequate connection between the roof and the walls. In an earthquake, the connection between the
roof and the walls can fail, resulting in walls falling outward, and the roof collapsing into the building.
In 1989, the City Council adopted a Seismic Hazards identification Program as part of an amendment
to Title 15, Building and Construction. The program calls for the Building Inspection Division to identify
buildings that meet any of the following criteria:
     Buildings constructed of unreinforced masonry.
     Buildings constructed prior to January 1, 1935 containing more than 99 occupants.
     Buildings constructed prior to August 1, 1976 containing 300 or more occupants.
This survey was completed in 1995 and found that no buildings in Foster City met the criteria. Foster
City does include some concrete tilt-up buildings, primarily in the Chess-Hatch area.
Although some tilt-up concrete buildings remain, many are being replaced as part of redevelopment of
the City’s older industrial areas. Additionally, in Foster City, site-specific geotechnical analysis is
required for all new construction to ensure that the most appropriate foundation design is utilized in
order to minimize impacts from geologic hazards, including ground shaking. Buildings are constructed
under stringent building codes to be more resilient and to maximize life safety. These more stringent
codes do not necessarily mean that there will be no building damage. Buildings may still experience
damage that results in loss of use of the facility and potential negative economic impacts.
Figure 7-4 shows the distribution of the City’s building stock including critical facilities, schools, religious
institutions and economic centers throughout Foster City in the context of the ground shaking hazard
map. Schools and religious institutions are spread throughout the City’s neighborhoods, while critical
facilities and most commercial buildings comprising the City’s economic base are primarily located
within the northern half of the City.
The local hazard mitigation planning team noted the exposure of the various buildings but determined
that the buildings’ use was the most important factor in prioritization of the assets and creation of
mitigation strategies.

7.3.2.2 Earthquake Liquefaction
Any structure in liquefaction prone areas may be susceptible to damage if the soil beneath liquefies.
When soils liquefy, buildings can settle unevenly, damaging the structure and requiring extensive
foundation work if the building is deemed salvageable, even if the building structure itself has been able
to withstand ground shaking. In many cases of severe liquefaction, buildings with damaged foundations
may require demolition and rebuilding. Single-family homes, commercial buildings under ten stories,
and industrial and commercial buildings are typically built with foundations that are more vulnerable to
liquefaction. However, even buildings with mat or pile foundations designed for liquefaction hazards are
at risk of settlement damage. Additionally, utility connections to the building can also be damaged by
liquefaction, causing the building to be unusable even if it remains intact.
Damage can be more severe if the liquefaction occurs on ground that also has a slope, as the building
can also slide on the slope, which was the case in San Francisco’s Marina District in the 1989 Loma
Prieta earthquake. Even with the only slight gradient in the Marina District, portions of the liquefaction
zone moved up to two feet,56 which was enough to damage buildings and break utility connections.
In Foster City, site-specific geotechnical analysis is required for all new construction to ensure that the
most appropriate foundation design is utilized in order to minimize impacts from geologic hazards,
including liquefaction and settlement. Buildings more than four stories in height are typically supported
on piles that would minimize impacts from liquefaction and ground shaking. Although ABAG and USGS
maps indicate that the City is in a high to very high potential for liquefaction area, specific soil studies
done in various areas indicate a moderate to high potential for liquefaction. The Foster City Public
Works Department reviewed several soil studies conducted in various areas of the City and for some
studies, after additional analysis, noted that the settlement due to liquefaction is negligible in some
areas to up to 1” of settlement anticipated. In some cases, the design of the foundations address
measures to minimize the potential for liquefaction. In addition, for slab on-grade homes, designs of
foundations are designed to minimize the impacts that could be caused by said settlement.
7.3.2.3 Tsunami/Seiche
Nearly all structures in California that are exposed to tsunamis will be damaged if the tsunami is large
enough. In areas with a greater threat of large tsunamis such as Japan, some structures have been
specifically designed to withstand tsunami forces. This level of design is not common in California;
therefore if a building is exposed to a tsunami, the design of the structure is not likely to influence its
performance. Protective measures (seawalls or bay levees) can try to reduce the exposure of the
tsunami, but building design in the Bay Area does not play a significant role. The tsunami inundation
projections in the Foster City area are that only the area outside the levees would be affected. There
are no structures in this area.
7.3.2.4 Flooding
Wood frame buildings are likely to receive significant damage as they are unable to withstand
hydrostatic pressure from flooding and wood is vulnerable to water damage. Structures with habitable
space below grade are vulnerable to sea level rise, storm events, and elevated groundwater. Essential
mechanical and electrical equipment in buildings are highly water and salt sensitive, and are often
located below-grade or on the ground floor.

Vulnerability Analysis/Risk Assessment                     Chapter 7: Local Hazard Mitigation Plan/Safety Element
Most residences, employment sites, and community facilities are highly susceptible to damage from
sea level rise because of their construction methods or materials. When flooding damages these
structures, the release of hazardous materials including paints, cleaners, oils, batteries, pesticides,
asbestos, and medical waste can occur.
Climate change is forecast to produce more flooding hazards in addition to sea level rise, due to more
intense storms.57
In Foster City, the City’s levees and lagoon system protect the City from flooding. The lagoon system
serves as the City’s storm water detention area, with the water level managed through the use of tide
gates and pumps. The City is in the process of designing levee improvements to protect the City from
flooding and future sea level rise.
7.3.2.5 Fire
Buildings in the urban environment are more prone to fires that start in the inside, or that grow from a
fire in a neighboring structure. There are many designs that have been implemented to reduce urban
fires, including fire sprinklers, which can extinguish small fires and reduce the speed at which large fires
spread.
One unique fire risk is the potential for fire following an earthquake. Natural gas pipelines that connect
at the street may break, or gas appliances in the house that shift or fall may also break gas lines. Gas
fires, or those caused by electric failures, may produce more ignitions than fire fighters have resources
to respond with. Some jurisdictions have required automatic gas shut off valves be placed on the street
to reduce this risk, and improvements to the building code to reduce regular urban fire risk (i.e.
sprinklers) have the potential to reduce the impact of a fire following an earthquake.
Foster City adopted stringent fire safety regulations for high rise buildings (75 feet) and in mid-rise
buildings four or more stories in height (but below 75 feet) before they were required by later codes.
The Fire Department conducts fire inspections annually on high rise buildings, in addition to company
level fire inspection programs, ongoing district familiarization and the identification of target hazards.
The use of residential sprinklers has improved the fire safety in buildings constructed since they were
required in 1982 under National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 13D standards.
7.3.2.6 Drought
Buildings are not directly damaged by drought, but their design can contribute to the hazard. In the
case of drought, buildings without low flow features and/or with water intensive landscaping will require
more water to function. Buildings and landscapes with water conservation designs improve the ability of
a community to withstand the water supply problem presented by droughts.
In Foster City, water conserving fixtures and landscapes are required in all permitted new construction
and/or encouraged through the water rate structure.

7.4      Utility and Transportation Infrastructure/Facilities & Systems
Disruptions to communications, water, and transportation networks can cause emergencies to cascade
into disasters. In day-to-day lives, Bay Area communities are heavily reliant on local, regional, state,
and interstate utility and transportation systems. For homes and businesses to remain functional, their
buildings must not only have minimal damage, but must also be connected to operating water, power,
and sewer systems.
Annual outages caused by winter storms are reminders of personal and business reliance on critical
infrastructure. In small emergencies, systems are disrupted for limited periods of time, or disruption is
isolated to a single system, making the outage manageable for most. In large disasters, outages can
last days, weeks, and months, and occur across multiple infrastructure systems at once. Because of
our reliance on expansive linear systems, a single failure can impact the entire system. This type of
failure can ripple and impact many more people that the hazard itself. For example, many portions of a
community may not experience damage from flooding, but if flooding damages a key transportation
corridor, a power substation, or sewage treatment plant, those outside of the flood zone will still be
severely impacted by loss of services.
Natural hazards can cause direct damage to infrastructure components. Because most infrastructure
systems are organized as a system, a single failure can result in a system outage (i.e. if a single portion
of pipeline breaks, the remainder of the system may be unusable). Additionally, the failure of one
system can also impact other systems all together (i.e. if an electrical outage causes water pumps to
fail). Regardless of the hazard type, linear components of different asset classes often perform similarly
(i.e. in an area with liquefaction or landslides; roads, rail, pipelines, and cables may all be severed by
the hazard). In some cases, linear components have undergone unique improvements (i.e.
waterproofing, increased flexibility at fault crossings, etc.) that make them less susceptible than the
average infrastructure component. Different fixed asset components, such as substations, generation
facilities, treatment plants, transit stations, or pumping stations, can also have similar challenges. For
example, most have fragile mechanical or electrical equipment below grade, or have above ground
structures with similar vulnerabilities as those mentioned in the buildings section.
Interdependence is often the term used to describe functional vulnerabilities between systems.
Infrastructure interdependence is the interaction of one system on another and is used to describe a
number of different interactions. The interaction between systems can result in cascading outages or
failures, where the outage of one system results in loss of service for another (i.e. a cell tower that is
not damaged cannot provide service because it lost electricity, and remains out of service until
electricity is brought back online.) The failure of one system can also result in damage to another
because of collocation (i.e. a water main break causes damage to a nearby sewer line, gas line, and
the roadway above), or by an inability of systems to safely shut down in an outage (i.e. a failure caused
by a hazard at one electric substation creates a surge elsewhere in the system, damaging components
at a substation not exposed to the hazard). The failure of systems can also make the restoration of
other systems more difficult. If roads are damaged by a landslide, it may be difficult for repair crews to
get to the site of other damaged infrastructure, delaying the system restoration.

Vulnerability Analysis/Risk Assessment                          Chapter 7: Local Hazard Mitigation Plan/Safety Element
7.4.1 Utility and Transportation Infrastructure Assets
7.4.1.1 Transportation
The Bay Area is reliant on roads, rail, and ports to connect homes, businesses, people, and goods.
Roads provide routes for personal vehicles, buses, bikes, and pedestrians. Both passenger and cargo
rail move passengers and freight throughout the Bay Area. Ports and airports are used for domestic
and international passenger and cargo movement. Each mode of transportation is required for a
functional region, and is critical during and after an event, to move people away from, and resources to,
a hazard. When they are severely damaged, the inability to move people and goods will impact
response to a disaster and greatly slow the recovery of the region.
At a regional level, there are multiple routes and modes that individuals can choose to get around the
region. The failure of any one component within the network will have cascading impacts across other
corridors and transportation modes. Corridors with no damage may become gridlocked when
transportation is rerouted around a damaged area. This was seen after the Bay Bridge deck failure in
the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake. In the weeks following the earthquake, the Golden Gate Bridge
experienced a record number of trips, and Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) set ridership records. While
this example highlights the partially redundant nature of some of the region’s transportation corridors,
some jurisdictions are reliant on a single mode or a single corridor that, if disrupted, will reduce the
ability of residents and goods to move throughout the region.
In Foster City, local transportation is primarily on the City’s streets and bridges and to a lesser extent
on pathways such as the levee pedway. These assets are vulnerable to impacts from earthquakes and
flooding from sea level rise. The Foster City Lagoon is primarily used for recreation but has limited
potential to be used for transportation. Foster City is reliant on the adjacent regional highways, bridges
and transit for access into and out of Foster City. These assets are also vulnerable to impacts from
earthquakes and flooding.

Vulnerability Analysis/Risk Assessment                             Chapter 7: Local Hazard Mitigation Plan/Safety Element
7.4.1.2 Fuel
Refined fuel products are used for a number of processes, with the majority going towards powering
motorized vehicles (cars, trucks, buses, trains, planes, boats). Some vehicle fleets have a growing
number of electric or natural gas powered vehicles; however the vast majority of vehicles are reliant on
refined petroleum fuel. The interruption of the fuel sector could be brief, caused by the inability to pump
gas at gas stations in the days after an event while electric pumps are down, or could be a prolonged
issue if the Bay Area fuel system is damaged in the event.
7.4.1.3 Natural Gas
Natural gas is used for heating and cooking in many homes and businesses, and is also supplied in
large quantities for many industrial processes. Natural gas also fuels two-thirds of regionally generated
electricity.58 An interruption of the natural gas system could directly impact the heating of homes and
businesses, and shut down dependent business sectors (restaurants and industrial facilities). Natural
gas systems, as with many other utilities, are also important because they themselves can be a hazard
if they are damaged. In the case of natural gas, the major fear is that a damaged pipeline leaking gas
may ignite, which can spread to nearby homes and businesses. The San Bruno gas pipeline explosion
is an example, where a 30-inch gas pipeline explosion killed 8 people, injured another 66 and
destroyed 38 homes. These assets are vulnerable to earthquakes.
While natural gas pipelines also run north – south along the eastern bay shore in San Mateo County,
an assessment of the information available has indicated that Foster City’s risk of exposure is low.
7.4.1.4 Electricity
Nearly all water, wastewater and communications utilities, transportation systems, homes, and
businesses rely on electricity to function. Many critical facilities have backup electric generators to
provide power in the case of electrical outages, as do a growing number of businesses and homes.
These backup generators are reliant on access to fuel, should the electrical outage last longer than the
stored fuel supply. Some of these fuel supplies can be located at some distance, and may not be
accessible when needed. Homes and businesses without backup power will remain in the dark and all
electronics (refrigerators, electric heating and cooling systems, computers, etc.) will remain off.
High voltage lines owned by PG&E bisect Foster City. They are located within easements that
preclude permanent structures within them. Parking, landscaping and recreation areas are commonly
located within the easements. PG&E is responsible for hazard mitigation related to these facilities. The
City maintains a working relationship with PG&E regarding activities potentially affecting the power
lines.
7.4.1.5 Water
Water is critical for basic survival and sanitation. It is also needed for agriculture, and many industrial
processes. Emergency supplies, stored by both individuals and emergency management agencies, will
likely only be enough for drinking needs for a limited time. Sanitation, agricultural, and industrial uses of
water will require the functioning of the water system. The availability of water resources is vulnerable
to droughts. In Foster City, the assets related to transport and storage of water are vulnerable to
earthquakes.

7.4.1.6 Wastewater
Wastewater services are typically provided at the sub-regional and local level in the Bay Area. Most of
the wastewater treatment facilities are located along the Bay shoreline, because the majority of the
systems are gravity fed, and all of them discharge to the Bay. Depending on where the system is
disrupted there could be either a complete loss of service, a partial loss of service, or a spill or
discharge of untreated or partially treated wastewater. This can become a public health issue, requiring
special actions be taken to contain and then clean up the discharge.
Foster City’s wastewater transport system is dependent on lift stations to move the wastewater
through the City and to the Wastewater Treatment Plant located in San Mateo. The wastewater
transport system is vulnerable to earthquakes and power outages. The Wastewater Treatment Plant is
vulnerable to earthquakes and flooding from sea level rise. See Section 8.1.6, Wastewater, for more
information.

7.4.1.7 Solid Waste
After a disaster, damage to buildings and utilities will result in a huge amount of waste material that
must be sorted and recycled or disposed of. Individual homes and businesses are likely to have
additional waste removal needs, as will jurisdictions struggling to clear debris. Debris removal will be
needed to make roads passable, and to allow for more rapid repairs and reconstruction in areas with
damaged and destroyed properties and infrastructure.
7.4.2 Utility and Transportation Vulnerability
7.4.2.1 Earthquake Ground Shaking
Ground shaking is typically less damaging to linear infrastructure pipelines, cables, and at-grade
roadways than other earthquake hazards such as liquefaction. It is the nodes of infrastructure systems
that are often damaged by earthquake shaking. Just as with buildings, above ground facilities
(refineries, water treatment stations, pumping stations, power plants, train stations) can all be damaged
by the strong accelerations experienced in earthquakes. These facilities can also be damaged by
liquefaction or fault rupture.
Figure 7-7 shows the distribution of the City’s infrastructure in the context of the Ground Shaking
Hazard Map. Transportation, storm water, wastewater and water infrastructure and facilities are spread
fairly evenly throughout the City. Some critical facilities are primarily located within the northern half of
the City such as the levee, lagoon pump station and major wastewater lift stations. The local hazard
mitigation planning team noted the exposure of the various infrastructure assets and determined that
the assets’ use was the most important factor in prioritization and creation of mitigation strategies.

7.4.2.2 Earthquake Liquefaction
Earthquakes are particularly damaging to infrastructure systems, especially when surface fault rupture
and liquefaction occur. Underground pipelines, cables, and other linear elements can be broken by the
ground displacement caused by liquefaction. This is especially pronounced in the transition area
between zones that liquefied and those that did not, resulting in differential movement, as well as in
locations of lateral spreading where pipes and other underground elements can be pulled apart by the
ground settling or sliding down a slope. Areas where pipelines cross river channels are vulnerable
because these areas are often the most prone to liquefaction, and also due to a slope along the river
bed.
Pipelines that are more buoyant than the soil can also rise out of the ground as a result of liquefaction.
In past earthquakes, sewer pipelines can raise multiple feet while the soil liquefies, resulting in severe
damage to the pipe, as well as to the roadway above where manholes stick up feet above the roadbed.
Infrastructure elements like roadways, rail, cables, and pipelines that are at the surface are also
vulnerable to the displacement that can occur from liquefaction. For above-ground components, breaks
are easier to find, and are often an easier fix. Above-ground lines routed along poles can be damaged
if the poles fall over; however, this is rare except in severe cases of liquefaction or fault rupture.
7.4.2.3 Tsunami
In many ways, tsunami impacts to infrastructure are similar to those due to flood, only the impact may
include greater current forces as the water inundates and then recedes rapidly. These forces are
especially strong along stream channels and in marinas with small inlets. Historically, tsunamis have
been particularly damaging to ports because they often create strong current flows in marinas, which
can cause boats to be thrown about, which may then damage the marina infrastructure as well.
7.4.2.4 Current and Future Flooding
Flooding can impact infrastructure in a number of ways, including getting non-waterproof elements wet,
exposing corrodible elements to salt water, filling elements with water, and causing scour and erosion.
Although some below-ground, and even at-grade, infrastructure is designed to be wet, most elements
cannot be submerged in water and many cannot get wet at all. Underground infrastructure, and
particularly pipelines, can float if flooded when more buoyant than water. If floodwaters are saline, such
as with inundation from the Bay, infrastructure elements that are not corrosion-resistant can be
damaged beyond repair. In addition, the energy of strong water flows can scour and erode, damaging
and destroying infrastructure elements. Bridge abutments in particular can be damaged if water, wind,
wave, or tidal energy erodes the soil surrounding the structure. Other infrastructural elements that
become exposed as soil erodes around them may be damaged by moving floodwaters.
Sea level rise will increase the likelihood that infrastructure elements are exposed to the impacts of
flooding during storm events. In addition, sea level rise will begin to cause “sunny day flooding” in
particular, affecting infrastructure that relies on below ground systems that are often gravity drained or
have limited pumping capacity, such as storm water and wastewater systems. For example, most
wastewater facilities in the Bay Area are built along the Bay shoreline as they discharge treated
wastewater to a deep Bay location. As sea level rises, wastewater treatment plants will have shorter
windows of opportunity to discharge into the Bay, and will be required to increase either flow storage or
pumping capacity. Storm water collection and conveyance facilities will lose capacity both as the Bay
and groundwater levels rise, and backups at higher than current high tides will cause street, basement,
and parking lot flooding.

Vulnerability Analysis/Risk Assessment                      Chapter 7: Local Hazard Mitigation Plan/Safety Element
7.4.2.5 Fire
Fire can impact any infrastructure element. Depending on the intensity of the fire, underground
components may be more protected than those on the surface or attached to poles. For above ground
facilities, vulnerability is very similar to buildings, with the added damage potential that smoke can
affect sensitive electrical equipment used to operate infrastructure systems. Fuel and natural gas
infrastructure systems are especially important to consider because of their own flammability that could
contribute to the fire hazard, and the ability of fire crews to extinguish the fires.
7.4.2.6 Drought
Drought has a direct impact on the amount of available water in the region. It indirectly influences the
portfolio of energy generation available to the state, as many reservoirs are also hydroelectric facilities
that produce a share of the region’s power. With less water passing through these facilities, there is
less electricity generated from these facilities.
7.5      Summary Tables of Exposures
The following table provides a summary of the exposure of Foster City’s urban land, infrastructure,
locally owned buildings, bridges and interchanges, and schools to hazards. The local hazard mitigation
planning team reviewed maps and determined that the data below represents the best assessment
available. Calculation of sea level rise, flood and tsunami exposures were based on the acreage of the
low lying land areas outside the area protected by the City’s levee system. Additionally, as discussed in
Sections 7.3 and 7.4, buildings and infrastructure are not directly exposed to drought.
Although the ABAG and USGS maps designate Foster City as having high or very high liquefaction
susceptibility areas, site-specific studies and historical evidence indicate that the risk may be overly
stated in the ABAG and USGS maps.

8.1.1 Seismic Safety
The high potential for seismic related events in the region poses a variety of geologic hazards to
structures and people. Ground shaking from earthquakes can cause significant structural damage of
buildings. Severe structural damage to buildings can lead to structure failure, which places people at a
significant risk to injury or death. As future development and infrastructure projects are considered by
the City, each project will be evaluated for conformance with the seismic design standards contained
within the California Building Code, Foster City’s General Plan, Zoning Ordinance, other applicable
regulations and the City’s Standard Conditions of Approval (SCOAs). Compliance with all applicable
regulations and seismic design standards, which are required for all construction projects in California,
and the City’s SCOAs, would ensure that future projects are not unduly susceptible to the effects of
seismic ground shaking.
In the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake, Foster City experienced some broken utility lines, minor local
bridge damage (no local bridges were closed) and minor building damage (no buildings were declared
uninhabitable). Although the underlying geology of the area results in mapping that shows a relatively
high exposure to seismic hazards such as ground shaking and liquefaction according to USGS maps,
the review of individual geotechnical reports prepared for various projects indicates that the risk for
liquefaction is minimal in some areas and in areas with higher risk can be mitigated with appropriate
building design that has been incorporated into projects.
The Safety Element of the existing General Plan establishes policies and programs that are designed to
protect structures, improvements, and people, from geologic hazards, including seismic related
hazards. Policy S-1 requires the use of the most current uniform codes to review permits for new and
modified structures. Policy S-2 requires the City to educate the public about seismic hazards in Foster
City. Policy S-3 requires the City to take measures to prevent damage to the City’s infrastructure and
emergency facilities resulting from seismic and geologic hazards. Program S-a requires site specific
geotechnical and engineering reports for new structures. Program S-c requires the City to include
seismic safety education in the Fire Department’s public education programs. Program S-d requires the
City to include an assessment of non-structural seismic hazards as part of annual inspections of
businesses as part of a public education program. Additionally, the City’s adopted Standard Conditions
of Approval are designed to protect structures, improvements, and people, from geologic hazards
including seismic related hazards. Specifically, SCOA 2.2 requires a site-specific, design level, fault
zone geotechnical report with recommendations to minimize seismic damage prior to the issuance of a
building permit.
8.1.2 Flood Protection
Foster City is protected from flooding hazards by approximately 43,000 linear feet (8 miles) of levees
that surround the perimeter of the City. Foster City has recently prepared a Levee Protection Planning
Study59 of flood hazards, the levee system, sea level rise and potential levee improvement alternatives.
The information in this section is taken from that study. The Levee Protection Planning Study concluded
that the levee surrounding Foster City will have to be raised by approximately 2.5 to 5.5 feet, depending
on the location, to meet FEMA accreditation requirements. There are opportunities to conduct levee
improvements to meet Sea Level Rise freeboard projections (11 inches by 2050, 3 feet by 2100),
accommodate future settlement, and provide a margin of safety regarding future FEMA restudies. The
Council will provide policy direction whether or not to address Sea Level Rise and to what extent.

Flood Hazard Mitigation in Foster City
Approximately 9,000 properties in Foster City are protected from the one-percent annual chance of
flooding by the City’s levee system. An additional 8,000 properties in the City of San Mateo are also
protected by the Foster City levee system. Conversely, the approximately 9,000 properties in Foster
City are protected from the one-percent flood by San Mateo’s levee and floodwall systems south of San
Mateo Creek.
The City’s lagoon system also minimizes the potential for flooding due to storm water flows. Storm
water in Foster City flows to the Foster City Lagoon (except for a small area that flows to San Mateo’s
Marina Lagoon), where the water level is managed with tide gates and pumps. As a result, Foster City
has not experienced flooding during flood events that have impacted other areas of San Mateo County.
Foster City does not have any “repetitive loss” properties. A Repetitive Loss (RL) property is any
insurable building for which two or more claims of more than $1,000 were paid by the National Flood
Insurance Program (NFIP) within any rolling ten-year period, since 1978. A RL property may or may not
be currently insured by the NFIP.
Foster City participates in FEMA’s National Flood Insurance Program through the adoption of Chapter
15.36, Floodplain Management Regulations, of the Foster City Municipal Code. These regulations
apply to properties located within a special flood hazard area as designated on the Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM) prepared by FEMA. In Foster City the only properties that are in a special flood
hazard area are outside the levee system.
History of Levee System
The original perimeter levee system in Foster City was put in place in the early 1900s to reclaim tidal
mud flats for agricultural use. The development of Foster City in the 1960s made use of the existing
perimeter levee system to provide protection for the new development.
In 1984 FEMA issued a new Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for the City which significantly altered
the presumed level of flood protection provided by the levee system. The City appealed the new maps
and hired Robert H. Born Consulting Engineers, Inc. to prepare an analysis of the levee system. Foster
City raised the levee system by about 18 inches in 1995 in response to the recommendations made in
the Born Report.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) certified
Foster City’s levee in 2007 as providing protection from the one-percent annual chance (base) flood.
This flood is often called the “100-year flood,” but should not be confused with an event that is expected
to occur only once every 100 years. It is the event that has the one-percent chance of occurring every
year.
Currently, land within the Foster City limits and “behind” the levee system is classified as Shaded Zone
X, where mandatory flood insurance is not required. In 2011 the City of San Mateo improved its levee
system south of San Mateo Creek and received FEMA accreditation in March 2012. This accreditation
is still recognized.
The FIRM for San Mateo County that became effective October 16, 2012 shows all of Foster City
outside of the Central Lagoon and “behind” the levee system classified as Shaded Zone X. This
designation shows the area protected from one-percent flooding by an accredited levee system.
FEMA recently updated its analysis of the flood hazards posed by San Francisco Bay through the
California Coastal Analysis and Mapping Program (CCAMP). Details of this study are provided in the
Foster City Levee Protection Planning Study. FEMA has indicated that once new maps become
effective (anticipated in 2016), Foster City’s levees will no longer be considered accredited against
coastal flood hazards. When the new maps become effective in 2016, Foster City will be designated as
a high-risk Special Flood Hazard area. However, provided progress is made to the satisfaction of FEMA
through the Seclusion Mapping Process to improve the levees, property owners will not be required to
purchase flood insurance. The purpose of seclusion mapping is to recognize that the Foster City levees
are no longer accredited by FEMA and while there are no immediate changes to the mapped flood
hazards and no change in the need for mandatory flood insurance, FEMA reserves the right to remap
the area bound by the seclusion in the future as additional study warrants. Seclusion mapping allows
the properties in Foster City to remain outside of the flood zone provided that sufficient progress is
being made to correct inadequacies of the levee system. The City is currently working on a project to
raise the levee to meet FEMA requirements. The City has awarded contracts for preliminary design,
consulting services related to funding options and environmental impact report. The City’s timeline for
completion of the improvements is mid-2020.
Evaluation of Existing Levees
The Levee Protection Planning Study evaluated the entire Foster City levee system using the stated
requirements from 44 CFR 65.10 to analyze the freeboard based on the 100-year stillwater and
maximum wave runup elevations determined by FEMA through CCAMP. Based on this analysis, it was
found that 36,000 feet or roughly 85 percent of the levee system does not meet FEMA’s freeboard
requirements. Furthermore, 2,000 feet of the levee system would be overtopped by the one-percent
Stillwater elevation. The average height increase required is about two feet and the maximum height
increase is four feet. These values do not consider sea level rise or settlement, which could amount to
an additional 1.5 feet.
Protection Against Levee Failure
The City is proactively maintaining the Levee system to minimize the potential for levee failure. Failure
of the levee would result in flooding for Foster City. The City performs quarterly inspections of the levee
as called for in the City’s Levee Operation and Maintenance Manual as revised in 1994 and using
inspection protocols and forms updated in 2010.60 The quarterly inspections review overall operations
regarding:

Evaluation of Future Sea Level Rise
The Levee Protection Planning Study examines the resiliency and adaptability of the Foster City levees
to provide flood protection against coastal hazards from San Francisco Bay when considering future
sea level rise that may result from global climate change. Resiliency refers to the robustness of a flood
protection solution should San Francisco Bay water levels increase over time in response to certain sea
level rise scenarios. Adaptability refers to how easily the protective elements could be altered to
accommodate those sea level rise scenarios.
In March 2013, the State of California adopted the 2012 National Research Council Report, Sea Level
Rise for the Coasts of California, Oregon, and Washington: Past Present and Future (NRC Report) as
the best available science on sea level rise for the State and published guidance on incorporating sea
level rise into State planning. The California Coastal Commission (CCC) also supported the use of the
NRC Report as the best available current science. Low and high range projections are used to reflect
the uncertainty bounds inherent in developing the projections and applying them to a single location.
Table 8-2 provides a summary of the range of Sea Level Rise (SLR) projections contained in the 2012
NRC document.

Based on the best information available, the Levee Protection Study recommends the SLR planning
scenarios for Foster City as shown in Table 8-3.

Corrective action taken to restore FEMA accreditation should include an extra one foot of freeboard
with levee or floodwall foundations built to accommodate an extra two feet of freeboard in the future.
This is based on the understanding that the levee improvements will be built to last at least until 2050
and likely longer. So the inclusion of an extra one foot of freeboard should prolong future improvements
to incorporate SLR.
Levee Improvement Alternatives
The Levee Protection Planning Study concluded that the levee surrounding Foster City will have to be
raised by approximately 2.5 to 5.5 feet, depending on the location, to meet FEMA accreditation
requirements. There are opportunities to conduct levee improvements to meet Sea Level Rise
freeboard projections (11 inches by 2050, 3 feet by 2100), accommodate future settlement, and provide
a margin of safety regarding future FEMA restudies. The Council will provide policy direction whether
or not to address Sea Level Rise and to what extent. The following three alternatives for improving the
levee were presented:
     1. Raise the levee using imported soil ($50-$75 million)
     2. Construct a flood wall and earthen backfill ($40-$65 million)
     3. Construct sheet piles and earthen backfill – Hybrid Design ($35-65 million)
In September 2015, the City Council awarded contracts to begin design of the levee improvements and
evaluation of financing options. In October 2015, the City Council approved an agreement for
preparation of the environmental impact report (EIR) on the levee improvement project. The proposed
timeline includes design and permitting in 2016-2017 and construction in 2018-2020. The City’s
standard conditions of approval will require a site-specific geotechnical analysis for the levee
improvements in order to minimize potential impacts from geologic hazards. The site-specific
geotechnical analysis will address such hazards as settlement, liquefaction, and cyclic softening of
clays.

The Foster City Fire Department (FCFD) protects lives, property and the environment from fire and
exposure to hazardous materials, manages the City’s Emergency Operations Center (EOC), provides
emergency medical care, provides non-emergency services, educates the public regarding fire
prevention and emergency preparedness, responds to non-emergency service calls on an “as
available” basis, and enforces fire prevention codes.61
The FCFD is dispatched through Public Safety Communications along with other fire agencies in San
Mateo County, in which the closest unit responds to emergency calls, regardless of jurisdiction. The
FCFD also has an Automatic Aid agreement with the City of Hayward Fire Department for the San
Mateo Bridge. In addition, the FCFD participates in the Master Mutual Aid System for the State of
California, which provides fire resources throughout the State. The FCFD provides Advanced Life
Support (ALS) with a paramedic assigned to every fire engine.
The FCFD has 33 full time employee positions, including fire captains and firefighters, a management
coordinator, and an administrative secretary. The FCFD participates in a shared services model with
the City of San Mateo, which provides for the Fire Chief, Deputy Fire Chief, Battalion Chiefs and an
Emergency Preparedness Coordinator. In addition, Foster City and San Mateo have a contract for
service with the Belmont Fire Protection District for a Fire Chief, Administrative Battalion Chief and
Operational Battalion Chief services.
Fire Station 28 houses a minimum of one reserve truck that may be deployed with on duty personnel in
the event of a disaster or when additional personnel arrive. Foster City’s shared service relationship
increases its collective manpower and returning personnel can be directed to staff additional engine
and truck companies as needed.
From 2005 through 2014, annual calls received by the Fire Department ranged from a low of 1,513 in
2009 to a high of 2,243 in 2013. The majority of the calls received each year were for medical
emergencies. In 2014, medical emergencies accounted for 42 percent of calls, followed by 31 percent
classified as false alarms or non-emergency, 14 percent service calls, 11 percent other emergency, and
3 percent fire calls. FCFD has an average call response time of 4 to 6 minutes and achieves 98 percent
response rate for medical responses, meaning the FCFD responds to all medical calls within 6 minutes,
59 seconds, 98 percent of the time.

Every fire agency earns a rating calculated by the Insurance Service Office (ISO). This rating, known as
a Pubic Protection Classification (PPC), is utilized by many insurance providers to calculate insurance
premiums within the district. Ratings range from 1 to 10. Class 1 generally represents superior property
fire protection and Class 10 indicates that the area’s fire suppression program does not meet ISO’s
minimum criteria. An audit by the ISO upgraded the Foster City Fire Department from a Class 3 to a
Class 2 Fire Protection Rating, effective December 2000.
Foster City provides a Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) program including emergency
preparedness training. As of 2015, over 700 citizens have been trained through this program with over
350 active members. The program is being expanded to include a “Business CERT” program.

The Foster City Police Department consists primarily of the Administration and Field Operations/Patrol
Divisions. The Administrative Division is responsible for criminal investigations, crime prevention, youth
services, crime analysis, evidence and property control, budget preparation, press and community
relations. It is also responsible for records processing and storage, computer analysis and
maintenance, radio communications and dispatch services for the Police Department. The Field
Operations Division consists of the uniformed officers who enforce laws, make arrests, respond to calls
for service, and conduct investigations. The division includes the traffic unit, the canine unit, the bicycle
unit, field training officers, evidence technicians and community service officers. The Field Operations
Division also focuses on intervention and prevention of youth-related crime and violence, drug activity,
and domestic violence.
8.1.5 Water Supply
The Estero Municipal Improvement District (EMID) provides water and sewer service to Foster City and
water service to the Mariner’s Island area of San Mateo. EMID purchases all of its water from the San
Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) as a contractual member of the Bay Area Water Supply
Conservation Agency (BAWSCA).
The SFPUC’s water system consists of three regional water supply and conveyance systems: The
Hetch Hetchy system, the Alameda system, and the Peninsula system. The Hetch Hetchy system is
supplied by runoff from the upper Tuolumne River watershed on the western slope of the Central Sierra
Nevada Mountains. The Alameda system includes conveyance facilities connecting the Hetch Hetchy
aqueducts and the Alameda water sources to the Peninsula system. The Peninsula system includes

water facilities that connect the EMID and other Peninsula customers to the SFPUC distribution system
and the Bay Division Pipelines. EMID does not have any groundwater or recycled water sources to
supplement its supply.62
                                 Figure 8-4. Estero Municipal Improvement District Corporation Yard
The SFPUC’s water system has been undergoing a Water System Improvement Program (WSIP), a
$4.8 billion dollar, multi-year capital program to upgrade the SFPUC’s regional and local water systems.
The program will deliver capital improvements that enhance the SFPUC’s ability to provide reliable,
affordable, high quality drinking water in an environmentally sustainable manner to 2.6 million people in
the greater Bay Area. The program consists of 83 projects – 35 local projects located within San
Francisco and 48 regional projects, spread over seven counties from the Sierra foothills to San
Francisco. The objectives of the WSIP are to:
         Improve the system to provide high-quality water that reliably meets all current and foreseeable
          local, State, and Federal requirements.
         Reduce vulnerability of the water system to damage from earthquakes.
         Increase system reliability to deliver water by providing the redundancy needed to
          accommodate outages.
         Provide improvements related to water supply/drought protection.
         Enhance sustainability through improvements that optimize protection of the natural and human
          environment.
EMID does not hold any existing water rights – all of its water supply assurances are the result of its
contract with the SFPUC. In 1984, the SFPUC executed a Settlement Agreement and Master Water
Sales Contract with the members of BAWSCA. The Contract is governed by the Master Sales
Agreement (MSA), which expired in June of 2009. In August of 2009, BAWSCA and its member
agencies signed a new Water Supply Agreement and Individual Water Sales Contract with SFPUC.

Although the Master Agreement and accompanying Water Supply Contract expire in 2034, the Supply
Assurance (which quantifies San Francisco’s obligation to supply water to its individual wholesale
customers) survives their expiration and continues indefinitely.
According to SFPUC’s Water System Improvement Program (WSIP), the supply assurance is subject to
reductions in the event of drought, water shortage or earthquake, or rehabilitation/maintenance of the
system. Table 8-5 shows SFPUC’s projected deliveries to EMID for a single dry year or for five
consecutive dry years, based on the 2015 allocation of 6,608 acre-feet-per-year (AFY). The SFPUC
WSIP calls for 10 percent supply reductions in the first 2 dry years, followed by 20 percent reductions
for the next 3 dry years. The percent reductions should be the same for any given five consecutive dry
years. During the period of supply reductions, EMID would have to reduce demand by implementing its
Water Shortage Contingency Plan adopted in 1993.

The existing connection to SFPUC is via a single 24-inch main approximately 19,800 feet long which
travels, in San Mateo, along East Third Avenue, Ninth Avenue, and Crystal Springs Road to the
SFPUC’s Crystal Springs No. 2 pipeline. In addition to the 24-inch transmission main, EMID has two
separate 12-inch emergency supply connections with California Water Service Company (which serves
the City of San Mateo) and with Mid-Peninsula Water Agency (formerly called Belmont County Water
District, which serves the cities of Belmont, San Carlos, and part of Redwood City). EMID has
agreements with both agencies that allow EMID to use these connections during emergency situations.
EMID owns and operates three steel water tanks and one concrete tank. Each steel tank can store four
million gallons and the concrete tank can store eight million gallons, for a total storage of twenty (20)
million gallons.63

Booster pumps are necessary to pump water from the storage tanks into the distributions system. The
booster pump station has two electrical pumps and four engine driven pumps. The engine driven
pumps are powers by natural gas with propane backup.
EMID is required to prepare an Urban Water Management Plan every five years to project water
demand and supply availability as well as plans to address potential water shortages. EMID also is
required to prepare Water Supply Assessments for proposed developments.
Peakload Water Supply Requirements
The most recent Water Supply Assessment prepared by EMID64 includes a comparison of the supply
allocations and projected total system demand through the twenty year planning horizon as required by
SB 610. During a period of five consecutive dry years, the SFPUC’s plan calls for 10 percent reductions
in the first 2 years followed by 20 percent reductions for the next 3 years. To meet the reductions, EMID
will have to cut back its consumption in kind by implementing the Water Shortage Contingency Plan
based on the severity of the drought (see below for more detail).
The Water Supply Assessment concludes that there will continue to be sufficient supplies to meet all
projected demand, including the net additional demand generated from proposed development projects
in all conditions until year 2030. This conclusion is dependent on EMID implementing the mandatory
demand reduction as outlined in the EMID Water Shortage Contingency Plan.

EMID Water Supply Shortage Contingency Plan65
The EMID Water Shortage Contingency Plan was adopted in January 1993 in response to the
Assembly Bill X1-11 requiring all California urban water retailers supplying water to more than 3,000
customers, or supplying more than 3,000 acre-feet-per-year (AFY) of water, to adopt a water shortage
contingency plan as part of the Urban Water Management Plan. EMID’s Water Shortage Contingency
Plan includes four (4) stages with associated triggering levels.
Stage I: This is the normal stage where there is a continuing effort to conserve water regardless of
water supply. This stage involved public education and enforcement of current regulations such as
requiring the installation of ultra-low-flow toilets in new construction.
Stage II: This stage is triggered when the total volume of SFPUC water storage falls below the 2-year
demand base by 5 to 20 percent. The Stage II shortage will result in mandatory water conservation with
a goal of reducing water demand 5 to 20 percent as determined necessary by the EMID Board. A
resolution declaring a water shortage emergency with a list of prohibited water uses will be adopted by
the EMID Board of Directors. This stage will include increased public education, such as water bill
inserts advising customers how to conserve water.
Stage III: This stage is triggered when the total volume of SFPUC water storage falls below the 2-year
demand base by 20 to 30 percent. The Stage III shortage will result in mandatory water conservation
with a goal of reducing water demand 20 to 30 percent as determined necessary by the EMID Board. In
this stage and the next stage, a larger range of prohibited uses will be considered and a new rate
structure with progressive penalties for overuse will be implemented.
Stage IV: Stage IV is triggered when the total volume of SFPUC water storage falls below the 2-year
demand base by 30 to 50 percent. In this stage a mandatory rationing program will be initiated with a
goal of reducing water demand up to 50 percent.
Table 8-6 shows the 3-year estimated minimum water supply from SFPUC to EMID as a three-year
worst case supply projections (e.g., in case of drought or other causes of reduced water supply) based
on the 2010-2015 Urban Water Management Plan allocation. The calculated supply would not meet the
projected demand on any single dry year, from 2015-2030. In this case, EMID would implement
additional measures to reduce consumption (as described in the Water Shortage Contingency Plan of
the 2010-2015 Urban Water Management Plan). These measures could include enforcement of
regulations to reduce wasting of water, water conservation/public education programs, and water
rationing measures in periods of longer-term shortage.

Water Quality67
The major water source originates from the spring snowmelt flowing down the Tuolumne River to the
Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, where it is stored. This water source meets all Federal and State criteria for
watershed protection. Additionally, stringent disinfection treatment practices, extensive bacteriological-
quality monitoring, and high operational standards are maintained.
Hetch Hetchy water is supplemented with surface water from two local watersheds. Rainfall and runoff
from the Alameda Watershed – within the greater 128,424-acre Southern Alameda Creek Watershed
and spanning more than 35,000 acres in Alameda and Santa Clara counties – are collected in the
Calaveras and San Antonio reservoirs and treated at the Sunol Valley Water Treatment Plant.
Rainfall and runoff from the 23,000-acre Peninsula Watershed in San Mateo County are stored in
Crystal Springs, San Andreas, and Pilarcitos reservoirs and treated at the Harry Tracy Water Treatment
Plant in San Bruno.
In 2011, the Hetch Hetchy Watershed provided approximately 85 percent of the total water supply, with
the remainder contributed by the two local watersheds.
In order to ensure that tap water is safe to drink, the United States Environmental Protection Agency
(USEPA) and California Department of Public Health (CDPH) prescribe regulations that limit the
amount of certain contaminants in water provided by public water systems.
SFPUC Water Quality Division regularly collects and tests water samples from reservoirs and
designated sampling points throughout the system to ensure that the water delivered to customers
meets or exceeds Federal and State drinking water standards. In 2011, Water Quality staff conducted
more than 69,875 drinking water tests in the transmission and distribution systems. This monitoring
effort is in addition to the extensive treatment process control monitoring performed by treatment plant
staff and online instruments. In addition to monitoring done by SFPUC, EMID staff conduct water
quality monitoring and testing throughout EMID’s service area to assure compliance with the California
Department of Public Health standards.
66
   In a dry year where system-wide mandatory reductions are necessary, the SFPUC System-Wide Shortage Percentage is
calculated based upon the total system demand in the prior non-drought year and the total available water supplies. The
Wholesale Allocation is then determined based upon the Tier 1 Drought Allocation Plan. The EMID Allocation factor is
calculated from the Tier 2 Drought Allocation Plan, which is based on a variety of factors including each Wholesale Customer’s
historical water purchases over the last 3 years. The EMID Allocation Factor is based on the Tier 2 Drought Implementation
Plan (DRIP) value of 3.00% and a total system demand of 238 MGD as calculated for the 2010 Urban Water Management
Plan Tier 1 Drought Allocation Plan and the Tier 2 Drought Allocation Plan model runs. See Appendix F of the EMID 2010-
2015 Urban Water Management Plan.

8.1.6 Wastewater
Wastewater collection services for Foster City are provided by EMID and wastewater treatment is
provided at the jointly-owned San Mateo Wastewater Treatment Plant. EMID’s wastewater collection
system consists of more than 66 miles of sanitary sewer lines, more than 8.5 miles of sewer force
mains, 44 pumping stations, 15 permanent standby generators, and four portable generators. After
collection, wastewater is pumped to the San Mateo/EMID Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) for
treatment.
The San Mateo/EMID Wastewater Treatment Plant operates under a Joint Powers Agreement between
the City of San Mateo and EMID. EMID owns approximately 25 percent of the treatment plant. The
treatment plant has an average daily dry weather flow capacity of 15.7 MGD, of which 4.3 MGD is the
purchased capacity for EMID per the Joint Powers Agreement. In 2013, the WWTP had an average
daily dry weather flow of 12.3 MGD. EMID’s actual average daily flow was 3.1 MGD. In 2012, the
treatment plant’s maximum daily dry weather capacity was 22.0 MGD and its maximum peak hour dry
weather capacity is 39.5 MGD. According to the Foster City Public Works Director, the daily dry/wet
weather capacity of the plant, which has not been reconfigured since 2012, has not changed
significantly. Based on current flow data, average daily flows are below the capacities anticipated in the
Joint Powers Agreement.
                              Figure 8-6. San Mateo/EMID Wastewater Treatment Plant
The jointly owned WWTP is an aging facility that needs improvements to continue to meet current and
future flows and permit requirements. The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
permit issued to the WWTP in 2013 included special provisions requiring the development of a
comprehensive integrated Master Plan to address flow projections through the year 2035 by combining
San Mateo’s Collection System CIP with the WWTP Master Plan Improvements.

Capability Assessment                                       Chapter 7: Local Hazard Mitigation Plan/Safety Element
As a result, a comprehensive 20-year Integrated Wastewater Master Plan (Clean Water Program) was
developed by Carollo Engineers. The program addresses the following key elements:
      Repair and replacement of aging infrastructure
      Provide adequate capacity to treat projected flows
      Meet current and future regulatory requirements
      Meet the City’s sustainability objectives including recycled water
The estimated share of the WWTP costs for EMID is approximately $116 million. EMID is in the
process of evaluating the feasibility of the projects, reviewing cost allocations and developing a funding
strategy.
8.1.7 Evacuation Routes
Evacuation routes can include a roadway, waterway or trail that will allow an orderly removal of people
and possessions from an area endangered due to floods, hazardous materials or other emergency.
There are basically two types of evacuation routes: major evacuation routes (those that allow use by
automobiles) and minor evacuation routes (those that allow use by pedestrians and bicyclists).
Evacuation routes for Foster City are limited by the waterways and freeways that surround the City.
Foster City participates in the San Mateo County Smart Corridors Project, through a Memorandum of
Understanding adopted in 2008. The Smart Corridors Project includes as one of its objectives to
enhance the ability to respond to emergencies and incidents to improve safety and reduce impacts to
the transportation system.
The use of any particular evacuation route would depend on the type and location of a specific
emergency, which, if any, routes had sustained damage, and many other factors. Selection of
evacuation routes in an emergency would be under the purview of law enforcement and/or the City’s
Emergency Services Director, usually the City Manager.
Evacuation by water is not likely to be useful due to the fact that both the Foster City Lagoon and San
Mateo’s Marina Lagoon are enclosed waterways and that boats suitable for evacuation of large
numbers of people are not available. The use of Werder Pier for evacuation by boat is also not
considered likely due to the deterioration of the structure, ownership by San Mateo County and costs of
constructing facilities.
The San Francisco Bay Area Water Emergency Transportation Authority (WETA) is a regional public
transit agency tasked with operating and expanding ferry service on the San Francisco Bay and with
coordinating the water transit response to regional emergencies. WETA currently utilizes its existing
facilities and vessel fleet to provide emergency response and recovery transportation services and
considers the agency’s emergency response mandate when planning expansion terminals and routes.
Additionally, WETA provides emergency response through the provision of expanded ferry service on
its regular routes. WETA has criteria to assess potential ferry terminal locations that include whether
there it a market for the service and has concluded that there is not a suitable market in Foster City.
Even if Foster City decided to pursue a location for ferry services, the Werder Pier site is not
appropriate for ferry service for many reasons, including its location in a residential neighborhood
without adequate parking and its lack of accessibility to employment centers.

8.1.8 Minimum Road Widths
Government Code Section 65302(g) (1) requires Safety Elements to include a discussion of
“…minimum road widths and clearances around structures, as those items relate to identified fire and
geologic hazards.” In Foster City, minimum required roadway widths are 20 feet, in order to provide
adequate access for fire vehicles.

Mitigation & Adaptation Strategy                             Chapter 7: Local Hazard Mitigation Plan/Safety Element
9 MITIGATION & ADAPTATION STRATEGY
9.1     Overview
The development of the mitigation and adaptation strategy involved:
     Establishing mitigation goals that represent the vision for reducing or avoiding losses from the
        identified hazards
     Consideration and evaluation of potential mitigation actions that could help achieve the goals
     Assessment of capabilities to implement the mitigation strategies
     Prioritization of the potential mitigation actions to identify the highest priority items and which
        items should be accomplished in the near term vs. longer term
9.2     Safety/Mitigation Goals
     S-A. Strong infrastructure. Preserve the quality of life by ensuring the City’s infrastructure and
     municipal services are capable of withstanding reasonably foreseeable risks and hazards.
     S-B. Emergency Response. Maintain an effective emergency response program that anticipates
     the potential for disasters and ensures the ability to respond promptly, efficiently and effectively, to
     provide continuity of services during and after an emergency.
     S-C. Long-term community resilience. Ensure the long-term community resilience of the
     community by improving the resiliency to hazards and planning for post-disaster recovery.
     S-D. Empower residents and community groups. Provide on-going education/resources to
     empower residents and community groups to be better educated, prepared and self-reliant in order
     to protect themselves from unreasonable risk to life and property posed by the hazards specific to
     Foster City.
     S-E. Build sense of community. Build a strong sense of community and allegiance among
     residents, employees and visitors to Foster City by ensuring access to transparent, frequently
     updated hazard and emergency response information before, during and after any disaster event.
9.3     Capabilities to Implement Mitigation Strategies
The mitigation strategies are based on existing local authorities, policies, programs and resources, as
well as the ability to expand on and improve these existing tools. The planning team utilized the
Mitigation/Adaptation Strategy Evaluation tools provided by the ABAG Resilience Program to evaluate
potential strategies with respect to feasibility, social benefits, economic benefits, environmental
improvement and community objectives. These capabilities are discussed in Section 8.
9.4     Analysis of Mitigation Strategies
The development and analysis of mitigation strategies included identifying the highest priority measures
as indicated in Table 9-1 as well as ensuring that each identified hazard was addressed in the
mitigation strategies, as indicated in Table 9-2.
The decision on priority was made based on a variety of criteria, not simply on an economic cost-
benefit analysis. The planning team used the Mitigation/Adaptation Strategy Evaluation Worksheet
provided by ABAG, which included criteria such as technical and administrative feasibility, political
acceptability, social appropriateness, legal and economic soundness, and environmental

consciousness. The City has examined the hazard exposure to the vulnerable assets and City-owned
critical facilities mentioned in Section 7. The City has determined that the combination of construction
type, age and shaking exposure of the City facilities listed below is significant, and has prioritized these
specific mitigation tasks for the next five years. Project worksheets detailing the implementation
process, funding strategy, responsible agency and approximate time frame are included in Appendix F.
Some strategies are already in progress through the City’s Capital Improvement Program planning, and
those detailed project worksheets are attached in Appendix G.
The priorities will be provided to the City Council for adoption pending approval of this LHMP by FEMA.
During the discussion and implementation of future plans, City departments can nominate projects that
they believe will provide the greatest benefit when considering available funding. The City intends to
use this same approach in the review, preparation and implementation of future projects.

The previous sections of this plan have analyzed hazards, the vulnerability of the City to these hazards
and the existing capabilities to mitigate potential impacts from these hazards. The City has evaluated
this information and established the following goals, policies and mitigation programs to help create a
more resilient and disaster resistant community. Many ongoing mitigation programs are continued in
this plan as well as new programs added (see Table 4-2 for an assessment of existing mitigation
programs and whether they are carried forward in the new Plan).

9.6     Integration with Other Plans, Policies and Regulations
There are many ways the goals, policies and mitigation strategies contained in this LHMP/Safety
Element will be integrated with other plans, policies and regulations, including but not limited to:
       Capital Improvement Program Planning – The City Council annually approves a detailed
        Capital Improvement Plan for a five year period and identifies and begins to fund upcoming
        infrastructure projects on a 10-year horizon. The City Council annually appropriates funding for
        the current year phases of Capital Improvement Projects. Infrastructure projects identified in
        this document have been or will be included in the five year Capital Improvement Project Plan
        for the years in which they are planned for implementation.
       Annual Budget – The City Council annually adopts a Fiscal Year Budget which authorizes the
        funding for all operations, services and projects for the fiscal year planning. Priority projects
        identified in the Local Hazard Mitigation Plan/Safety Element that require an expenditure output
        will be included in the Annual Budget in the years in which they are planned for implementation.
        The Annual Budget includes the appropriation of funding for the Capital Improvement Program
        discussed above.
       Five Year Financial Plan – The City Council annually approves a Five Year Financial Plan
        which includes revenue and expenditure expectations for the five year period. Approved
        projects in the Capital Improvement Plan, including any related to the Local Hazard Mitigation
        Plan/Safety Element would be included in the five year plan to ensure that appropriate funding
        is available for project completion.
       Foster City Municipal Code – The City Municipal Code includes a number of ordinances that
        would directly impact mitigation measures identified in the Local Hazard Mitigation Plan/Safety
        Element, for instance updates to the Code may be required in order to implement the post-
        disaster response measures and/or building code recommendations. Chapter 15.36 includes
        the City’s Flood Plain Management Regulations related to the City’s participation in the National
        Flood Insurance Program.
       Estero Municipal District Code – The District Code includes a number of ordinances that
        would directly impact mitigation measures identified in the Local Hazard Mitigation Plan/Safety
        Element, for instance updates to the Code may be required in order to implement the post-
        disaster response measures and/or changes to the Water Distribution system or Wastewater
        Collection system.
       Crime Prevention Programs – Proactive crime prevention makes Foster City a place where
        residents and visitors are safe from crime. Foster City is frequently listed among the safest
        cities in the State of California because of the efforts that go into preventing crime before it
        happens.
       CERT – The Community Emergency Response Teams train regularly to be prepared for
        emergency response and recovery. Having these teams in place with training in triage, medical

Mitigation & Adaptation Strategy                             Chapter 7: Local Hazard Mitigation Plan/Safety Element
        response and search and rescue will enhance responsiveness after a disaster and mitigate the
        impact that effects would have had on individuals and property if left unattended.
       General Plan Annual Report – This annual report assesses progress in implementation of
        programs included in the General Plan and in turn, helps shape the City Council’s annual
        priorities for staff work efforts, the budget and the capital improvement program.
       Climate Action Plan – The Climate Action Plan was adopted by the City Council in February
        2016 and contains 40 measures that will be prioritized to improve the environmental
        sustainability of Foster City and the Bay Area region. Specific to the Local Hazard Mitigation
        Plan/Safety Element, the Climate Action Plan measures are intended to reduce the production
        of greenhouse gasses and mitigate the potential impact of sea level rise.

Plan Maintenance Procedures                                Chapter 7: Local Hazard Mitigation Plan/Safety Element
10 PLAN MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES
10.1 Implementation, Updating and Enhancement
The City has several planning mechanisms that will be utilized to implement the LHMP/Safety Element,
which include:
     General Plan
     Capital Improvements Plan
     City of Foster City Climate Action Plan
In addition, the City enforces the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA),
which, since 1988, requires mitigation for identified natural hazards. The City has used these pre-
existing programs as a basis for identifying gaps that may lead to disaster vulnerabilities in order to
work on the ways to address these risks through mitigation.
The Local Hazard Mitigation Plan/ Safety Element, as part of the General Plan will be included in the
Annual Report on the General Plan, which will evaluate progress in implementing the programs and
strategies to provide information to assist the City Council in establishing each year’s priorities. This
document is provided to City Council no later than April 30 of every calendar year.
As required by the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000, the City of Foster City will update this Plan at least
once every five years.
10.2 Monitoring
The City of Foster City will ensure that monitoring of this plan will occur on an on-going basis. However,
major disasters affecting Foster City, legal changes, and other triggers will be used. Finally, the plan will
be a discussion item on the agenda of the meeting of City department leaders at least once a year. At
that meeting, the department heads will focus on evaluating the plan in light of development trends,
technological and political changes during the past year or other significant events. The department
leaders will be responsible for determining the necessity of plan updates.
10.3 Plan Amendments
Any interested citizen may submit a request to have a proposed amendment of the plan considered.
State law restricts the number of amendments to any mandatory element to four each calendar year,
although each amendment may encompass a series of individual changes to the Plan. The City
Council, by resolution of a majority of its members, may also initiate a proposed amendment at any
time it deems suitable or appropriate. Plan amendments will be considered by the Planning
Commission, which will make a recommendation to the Foster City City Council. Since General Plan
Amendments are legislative actions, the final decision is made by the City Council following a public
hearing.
10.4 Continued Public Involvement
The public will continue to be involved whenever the plan is updated and as appropriate during the
monitoring and evaluation process. Prior to adoption of updates, the City will provide the opportunity for
142 | LHMP-Safety Element – Adopted-November 21, 2016

Plan Maintenance Procedures                                Chapter 7: Local Hazard Mitigation Plan/Safety Element
the public to comment on the updates. A public notice will be posted prior to the meeting to announce
the comment period and meeting logistics.
Additionally, the City of Foster City, led by the Fire Department, will survey the public annually during its
observance of National Preparedness Month in September of every year. The survey will include
questions related to the public’s perception of risk and recommended activities to mitigate against
hazards. Findings from this annual survey will be available to the department leaders during their
annual review of the plan as discussed in Section 10.2.

These portions of the plan, and principally the Land Use section, bring together all land use
issues, constraints and opportunities, balanced with the numerous needs and desires of the
community. The Land Use and Circulation Element includes policies and programs affecting
both development and redevelopment of land in Foster City.
The Land Use and Circulation Element also relates to many issues addressed in other parts of

and property from natural or human hazards.
This chapter is a major revision of the 1993 Land Use and Circulation Element of the Foster
City General Plan. Many of the development projects now completed or under construction
were envisioned at the time the 1993 Land Use and Circulation Element was adopted.
However, there have been some changes in the specific mix of housing and commercial
building types in several large scale master-planned projects, notably the Pilgrim/Triton and
Chess/Hatch areas, and the vacant land adjacent to the Civic Center.

Circulation Elements
A Circulation Element has been required as part of local general plans since 1955. Guidelines
adopted by the State Office of Planning and Research emphasize the need to develop a
"...balanced, multi-modal transportation system." Cost-efficiency and protection of
environmental quality require attention to non-auto transportation facilities and careful
coordination with the Land Use Element.
The functions of the Circulation Element are to:
   (1) Provide a comprehensive approach to handling the travel needs of the general public,
         commercial vehicles, service and emergency vehicles in Foster City.
   (2)   Set forth a plan for meeting those needs.
   (3)   Express community objectives for the desired level of mobility, willingness to pay for
         mobility and priorities for allocation of public resources among competing transportation
         demands.
   (4)   Address specific problems, such as congestion, maintenance and repair of public
         streets, emergency vehicle access, traffic impacts on neighborhoods, etc.
   (5)   Provide for the conveyance of resources and waste including water, energy and sanitary
         sewer systems.
Community Development Project Area
While Foster City has historically been a bedroom community, over the years, the City has
made an effort to broaden its tax base and provide a more balanced mix of uses. A substantial
amount of commercial and light industrial development has taken place in recent years, and
residential growth has also continued. The commercial growth was assisted by the creation of
the Community Development Agency (CDA) and the adoption of a redevelopment plan and
program in 1981, called the “Plan for the Foster City Community Development Project Area.” In
1999, two Project Areas were added to facilitate the redevelopment of the Marlin Cove and
Hillsdale/Gull (Port O’ Call Shopping Center – now Miramar Apartments) areas.
The Plan was a result of the City’s inability, due to limited resources, to address problems of
circulation, parking, economic obsolescence and the lack of and maintenance of public facilities
in the project areas. The original Project Area was set to sunset in 2011 and no longer collect
tax increment funds. Furthermore, at the end of 2011, the State of California eliminated
redevelopment agencies state-wide, and created “successor agencies” to administer
remaining funds and projects developed through the agency. Foster City elected to become
the Successor Agency to the Community Development Agency, administering the affordable
housing obligations of the former Agency.

Key Issues
Foster City is a highly desirable place to live, work or own a business because of its proximity to
San Francisco, the San Francisco Airport, its proximity to San Jose and “Silicon Valley”, its
location at the center of San Mateo County, its easy freeway access to other parts of the Bay
Area, its waterfront location, high quality schools and the quality of life and development in the
community. Foster City offers distinct business and commercial activity areas with services and
employment opportunities, while at the same time maintaining identifiable, high quality
residential neighborhoods with convenient neighborhood shopping, recreation and other
amenities. Issues critical to City build-out (over the next ten to 15 years), longer-term
development and potential redevelopment issues and ongoing needs related to maintaining
existing quality of life include (including some identified in the Foster City Snapshot 2011,
prepared for the Update of the Land Use and Circulation Element):
        Traffic tolerance
        Potable water availability
        Sewer system capacity
        Financial ability to maintain City/District infrastructure
        Parking availability (Chess Drive/Hatch Drive Area)
        Building scale, bulk, and intensity (“Neighborhood Fit”)
        Maintain availability of commercial and retail services

the development of the community. The salt ponds were
drained and dried in the early 1960's, and some 18
million tons of fill were added to raise the ground level of the future city by four feet. The native
soil consists primarily of soft compressible silty clay (bay mud) with varying amounts of decayed
vegetation to an estimated depth of between 45 to 80 feet below the original ground surface.
These soft soils are probably underlain by stiff clayey soils and will compress under the weight
of fill and building loads.
The present appearance of the City has been dictated by the natural, mainly water-oriented
constraints of the island. To develop the City, marshes and sloughs on the island were diked
and filled, and an artificial lagoon and lake were then created. Marina Lagoon and Belmont
Slough, which are natural waterways bordering the City, have been incorporated into the City
design.

Water Features
The City’s image as a “water-oriented” community is a major community identifier and focal
point. The original master plan for Foster City stated as one of its major development policies
that the City "will take advantage of its bayside location by providing recreational areas and
marina lots adjacent to the water and by developing a lagoon system for boating and other
aquatic activities." There are five water systems, each serving different functions, that comprise
the City’s water resource base.
San Francisco Bay. The Bay is the primary source of all the other water systems. It provides
the water for tidal action and drainage to Belmont Slough, Marina Lagoon, and Foster City
Lagoon. San Francisco Bay provides important recreational opportunities with the development
of the City bayshore pathway/park system.
An extensive levee system protects Foster City from the tidal action of San Francisco Bay.
Because of the levees, no land area of the City inside the levee system lies within a 100 year
flood plain, and, consequently, flood hazards do not pose a significant constraint to land
development. In 2014, FEMA completed the San Francisco Bay Coastal Flood Hazard Study
which indicates that the Foster City levee system will need to be raised in order to retain
accreditation. On July 27, 2015 the City Council reviewed an analysis of levee improvement
alternatives. The City Council stated their intent to work with FEMA to avoid a change in the
flood hazard designation by pursuing a plan to improve the levees. At the same time, the levee
improvements will be designed to address sea level rise. Flood hazards are also discussed in
the Safety Element of the Foster City General Plan.
Belmont Slough. This system serves three important functions. First, it provides a source of
water to the Foster City Lagoon, which maintains the natural viability of the lagoon; second, it
provides a similar action in the Marina Lagoon; and, third, it provides a natural wildlife refuge as
a result of its tidal action, mud flats, and marshland vegetation.
Approximately 57 acres of wetlands along Belmont Slough were established as a wildlife
sanctuary in 1976. The refuge provides feeding and resting habitat for numerous and diverse
migratory shorebirds and some species of waterfowl of the pacific flyway.
Foster City Lagoon. This lagoon was artificially constructed and is functionally a storm
drainage retention basin with tide gates at the south end and pumps at the north end, and
additionally offers opportunities for recreational use. The development of the lagoon paralleled
the development of the residential neighborhoods. The first segment of the lagoon was
completed in Neighborhoods 2 and 3 in 1964. Development of the lake at Leo J. Ryan park
followed. The final phases were completed in Neighborhoods 6 and 7. The lagoon was
designed with a number of "islands" in order to create as many waterfront lots as possible.
Marina Lagoon. Marina Lagoon forms part of the western boundary of Foster City and the City
of San Mateo. The Marina Lagoon was originally a slough converted by the City of San Mateo
to a lagoon. It serves as a storm water basin and boating area for people owning homes along
its shoreline. Its frontage in Foster City provides public access via a pathway system.

Land Use Background                                            Chapter 3: Land Use and Circulation Element
Vintage Park Lake. Since the completion of Foster City Lagoon, a second artificial water
system has been developed as part of the Vintage Park development. The Vintage Park Lake
has a public access easement along it and also serves as a drainage catch basin. The
completion of this lake completes the City’s waterway system.
Population and Employment Characteristics
Population Growth
Foster City was virtually undeveloped in 1961 when T. J. Foster submitted his first plan to the
County. Foster City experienced major growth in the 1970’s. Growth during the 1980-1985 time
period was at a much slower pace, however, growth accelerated again between 1985-1990. In
comparison, San Mateo County experienced significant growth in the 1960’s, with much slower
growth comparatively in the 1970’s and 1980’s, and only adding approximately 600 residents in
the 1990’s. Between 2000 and 2010, the City grew about 6.7 percent in population, consistent
with the growth rate in San Mateo County. As of the 2010 Census, the population of Foster City
was 30,567 (Foster City Snapshot).
The Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) projects the City’s population to be
approximately 32,000 persons in 2025 (Projections 2009). Average household size in Foster
City is expected to continue to edge downward as single adults, childless couples, elderly
households and small families assume a larger percentage of the population. The Plan
recognizes that there is much more diversity in family types than when the original plan was
prepared and thus a need for more than one type of housing to respond to those needs.
As of 2014, the overall average size of Foster City households is 2.60 persons. By the year
2025, the average household size is expected to be only 2.44 persons. The City’s population
could increase further if additional non-residential lands are rezoned for residential uses or
residential lands are rezoned for higher density. The Foster City Snapshot contains additional
population data regarding Foster City's residents.

Employment Growth
During the initial stages of Foster City’s development, new growth was mainly residential or
residential-serving in nature. Residents have historically commuted to work in other
communities. However, since 1980, several major commercial and industrial developments
have been completed, adding a substantial daytime work force population to the City, and
providing employment opportunities to Foster City residents.
Existing and projected employment for the City has been estimated by both ABAG and by City
staff. City staff estimates that there is approximately 3.53 million sq. ft. of office space, 1.98
million sq. ft. of industrial/research and development space, 626,345 sq. ft. of commercial space
and 497 hotel rooms currently built in the City.
Based on the Foster City 2010 record of business licenses, businesses in Foster City employ
approximately 16,000 persons. Based on the estimated increase in office, industrial and retail
space, total employment in Foster City, in the year 2025, is projected to be approximately
20,440 persons. In comparison, ABAG has estimated employment at 17,230 persons in 2025.
Jobs to Housing Relationship
The term jobs/housing balance is one heard often when discussing the Bay Area’s housing
problems. It refers to the ratio of jobs in a city in relation to the number of housing units. In
general, problems result when a community provides more job opportunities than housing
opportunities, resulting in the need for greater numbers of residents to commute between their
jobs and homes. However, the jobs/housing relationship is a complex issue. This is especially
important when housing costs as compared to worker income are factored in, which has region-
wide rather than just community-wide impacts.

opportunities. Prior to 1980, housing growth outpaced job growth. Since 1980, however, job
growth has outpaced housing production and increased the balance between jobs and housing
in Foster City. According to City business license data from 2010, there were approximately
16,000 total workers in Foster City. Based on the number of households and the number of
jobs, the City had a jobs to housing ratio of 1.3 in 2010, with more jobs than housing units.
When compared to the number of employed residents reported by the US Census Bureau for
2010 of 15,569, the jobs to housing ratio is 1.03. A one-to-one relationship including a match of
skill level is the commonly accepted ideal, when comparing working residents with employment
in the community.
Workers choose jobs based on a variety of personal, financial and locational reasons, not just
commute distance and time. Census data on employment and income show that a high
percentage of Foster City’s employed residents are professional level workers. Many of the
businesses created by commercial and industrial development in Foster City employ this type of
worker. There is insufficient information to determine the precise level of match between job
skills of existing and new residents and the job skills required by the jobs located in Foster City.
Land Use Patterns
There are many benefits of providing a balance of land uses which serve a wide range of
community needs. Since Foster City was planned largely as a residential community, the City
has actively pursued commercial and light industrial development over the years to achieve a
more balanced mix of uses. Providing adequate opportunities for commercial development
allows more flexibility for the business community, thus resulting in a wide range of goods and
services available to the City’s residents. Commercial, office and industrial development not
only provides a healthy and stable tax base, it also provides job opportunities within the City,
which in turn can help reduce commuting by residents of Foster City and other nearby
communities.

Hillsdale Boulevard consist mainly of offices, retail uses, and light industry. This portion of
Foster City is dominated by three master planned projects, Metro Center, Vintage Park and
Pilgrim Triton, and other light industrial parks and office campuses.
Contained below is a more detailed description of land uses.
Residential Neighborhoods
The original Foster City Master Plan
envisioned a mix of housing types in
each neighborhood in order to
achieve a range of design, housing
costs and tenure types, including
apartments,               townhomes,
condominiums and single family
detached homes (as depicted on the
original Land Use and Circulation
Plan map). See Map 3.1 showing
current Foster City Neighborhoods.
Single family detached housing currently comprises the largest single type of housing in the City
with 37 percent of all units. Multi-family comprises 63 percent of the housing in Foster City,
including townhouses/ condominiums and apartments, which comprise 33 percent and 30
percent, respectively. There are also duplexes in the City, but they make up less than one
percent of the total unit count. By providing such a wide range of housing types, the City
ensures a healthy diversity among its population.
The total housing mix has fluctuated over time, but the overall objective has been achieved.
Based on approved projects including the Pilgrim-Triton Master Plan and the Foster Square
development on the 15 acre parcel next to City Hall, as well new units added by allowing
increased density at existing residential developments as provided in the Housing Element, up
to approximately 14,500 housing units of various types are anticipated with implementation of
this General Plan.
Foster City has been a model of “smart-growth,” or development concentrated in compact,
walkable centers, with many amenities within walking distances of most neighborhoods. Maps
3.2 and 3.3 show a ¼ mile walking distance, which translates to a 5-10 minute walk, of
commercial centers and schools. These maps help illustrate the proximity of a variety of uses
within the community. The original plan for Foster City was designed with this proximity in mind
and new development opportunities should strive to retain the original intent of the plan and
balance the needs of the neighborhoods.
Neighborhood Commercial and Mixed Residential/Commercial
Changing economic patterns have brought the viability of some of the City’s neighborhood
commercial centers into question. By today’s standards, some sites could be considered
“underutilized” and could be redeveloped to a higher and better use in the future. Uses
appropriate for these commercial centers could include housing or a mixed use development of
housing and small scale neighborhood retail uses. In the recent past, some developments
including Marlin Cove and the Miramar Apartments have redeveloped from commercial uses to

Land Use Background                                               Chapter 3: Land Use and Circulation Element
commercial and housing, or housing exclusively. Policies are included in the Land Use and
Circulation Element to guide the evaluation of any proposed redevelopment of neighborhood
commercial centers. Reuse of any site would be considered in terms of compatibility with
existing adjacent land uses, supporting infrastructure capacity and overall City needs.
Two new mixed use developments have been approved to include ground floor commercial
uses: Pilgrim Triton and Foster Square.
Office Commercial
Regionally-oriented commercial office uses are located on the northwest side of East Hillsdale
Boulevard and include two areas:
    (1) Metro Center, a 100 acre mixed use development; and,
    (2) The East Hillsdale Boulevard corridor which includes those uses located along East
         Hillsdale between Metro Center and Bridgeview Park.
The East Hillsdale Boulevard corridor east of Metro Center includes office commercial uses.
The area extends along East Hillsdale Boulevard between Shell Boulevard to the west and
Beach Park Boulevard to the east, especially that area on the north side of East Hillsdale
Boulevard east of the Rainbow Bridge. This area contains some of the first commercial
buildings constructed in Foster City which tend to contain a small amount of square footage
relative to site area. Because of its location along and adjacent to major streets, this area could
be the focus of requests to redevelop sites with higher density commercial development than
currently exists.
While an intensification of the land uses would provide additional opportunity for transit service
in the corridor as well as the adjacent Metro Center, and bring additional economic benefits to
the City, higher density uses may not be viable due to street network capacity and infrastructure
constraints.
The City will maintain a policy of evaluating any requests for intensification of uses in this area
based on street network capacity, architectural design, infrastructure and service constraints,
but will balance decisions with the need to provide space for "incubator" or fledgling businesses,
or housing.
Metro Center and the East Hillsdale Boulevard corridor east of Foster City Boulevard are
discussed in different sections below.
Metro Center. Metro Center was intended to establish a commercial Town Center which would
function as the hub of the City’s commercial community and provide a central focal point for the
City. In keeping with the vision of providing a City core, Metro Center has emerged as a diverse
mixed-use development.
Light Industrial, Research and Development
Almost all industrial uses in Foster City are located on the north side of State Route 92. There
are three distinct areas which include light industrial and research and development uses:
Adopted, February 1, 2016                                                                           Page 3-12

Land Use Background                                             Chapter 3: Land Use and Circulation Element
        Hatch Drive/Chess Drive,
        Lincoln Centre and
        Vintage Park.
Hatch Drive/Chess Drive and Lincoln Centre. The City’s first industrial uses began locating in
the Chess Drive area in the late 1960’s and early 1970’s. This area consists of industrial uses in
the Chess Drive area and the adjacent Lincoln Centre development. Although the area has
remained primarily light industrial, there has been a trend towards locating offices and small
personal services in some of the multi-tenant buildings.
In addition, some of the older buildings are in need of renovation, repair and, in some cases,
replacement. Parking is also an issue in this area as many of the individual lots are small and
could not support enough parking for larger buildings or more intense uses. Introducing a
shared parking system or parking district could aid in the redevelopment of these sites. Several
proposals for building redesign have already been considered by the City, and more are likely
due to the area's location and potential for revitalization.
In 2009, a General Plan Amendment for properties in the Chess Drive/Hatch Drive area
adjacent to S.R. 92 was approved for a portion of this area to allow redevelopment of the older
industrial buildings to an office campus. A new Land Use Plan designation of Chess/Hatch
Office Research was applied. A Rezoning/General Development Plan for up to 800,000 sq. ft.
of office, biotechnology or research and development use was approved in 2013 and a Specific
Development Plan/Use Permit for Phase 1 consisting of up to 600,000 sq. ft. was approved in
2014.
The Lincoln Centre development, located near the east end of East Third Avenue, was
developed with a mix of one story concrete tilt-up buildings and a newer six-story office
structure. It is physically separated from the Chess Drive area by a lagoon channel. Following
the departure of Life Technologies in 2013, the current owner has demolished the one-story
buildings and has applied for a General Plan Amendment to increase the FAR allowed. That
proposed General Plan Amendment is not included in this General Plan Update and will be
considered separately.
Vintage Park. Vintage Park consists of 132 acres located north of State Route 92 between
Foster City Boulevard and the San Mateo City border. Gilead Sciences has purchased most of
Vintage Park and has received approval to increase the building area on their 72.5 acre campus
from 926,735 sq. ft. to 2,500,600 sq. ft. for their biopharmaceutical campus. The remainder of
Vintage Park includes offices, labs, hotels and restaurants.
Pilgrim Drive/Triton Drive and East Hillsdale Boulevard East of Foster City Boulevard.
This area is located between East Hillsdale Boulevard and State Route 92, east of Foster City
Boulevard and extending west to Beach Park Boulevard. The area was originally developed as
a light manufacturing district and has evolved into a mixed commercial area containing a mix of
housing, banks, restaurants, gas stations, self-storage warehouses, business services and
offices. In 2008, a Master Plan for the 20-acre Pilgrim Drive/Triton Drive area (formerly Lincoln
Executive Park) was approved to include up to 730 residential units and approximately 300,000
square feet of office and retail space. The first phase, The Plaza, consisting of 300 for-rent
apartments and approximately 10,000 square feet of retail was completed in 2013. The second

phase, One Hundred Grand (formerly Triton Pointe), consisting of approximately 43,000 square
feet of office, 12,000 square feet of commercial and 166 dwelling units, is under construction
with completion anticipated in 2015. The third phase, Waverly, is anticipated to be completed in
2016. The completion of the fourth and final phase is expected to occur in 2017 or later.
East Third Avenue/Bayside Towers. In addition to the light industrial/research and
development areas discussed above, there are two other sites designated Research/Office
Park: Mariners Point Golf and Bayside Towers. The Mariners Golf site is located north of East
Third Avenue, bordered by the San Mateo City limits and San Francisco Bay. This property is
owned by the City and leased to VB Golf. The intention was for the site to be used for
recreation purposes until at some point in the future, it could be considered for development
under the Research/Office Park designation.
The second site, known as Bayside Towers, is approximately 14.5 acres in size, located at the
terminus of East Third Ave, at the foot of the San Mateo Bridge. Bayside Towers is developed
with 280,000 sq. ft. of office space in two buildings.
Home Occupations
At the "small-scale" end of the business spectrum are home occupations. These are businesses
operated in houses. Home occupations typically involve services or product sales which are
provided on a limited basis or off- site, and are regulated on a performance basis. Home
occupations can augment the City’s economic diversity, and add to the City’s daytime
population, while maintaining the residential character of the neighborhoods in which these
businesses are operated.
Schools
Approximately 36 acres of Foster City’s land area is currently devoted to schools. There are
currently four operational public schools, three elementary K-5 and one middle school, which
are under the jurisdiction of the San Mateo-Foster City School District. Additionally, the San
Mateo County Adult Education program operates classes in Foster City at the Senior Center
and Saint Luke’s Catholic Church. Information regarding each school is given in the Table 3.1
below.

Land Use Background                                               Chapter 3: Land Use and Circulation Element
The school district plans improvements to the schools in order to meet the projected buildout
demand and replace aging facilities. The District is currently looking at opportunities to expand
enrollment in Foster City. The City maintains a joint-use agreement with the schools for use of
the facilities for recreation purposes.
There is no high school located within the City’s boundaries; the majority of Foster City students
attend either San Mateo or Hillsdale High Schools located in San Mateo. Although a high school
was a part of the original plan for Foster City, actual development of a high school has never
occurred. The San Mateo Union High School District has projected that their district will not need
a high school in Foster City. It therefore has no plans to construct one.
Parks and Recreation
Foster City currently has approximately 105 acres of land dedicated to community and
neighborhood parks. This includes the approximately 7.9 mile long pedestrian pedway atop the
levee which runs along the perimeter of the City. More passively used open space areas are
also found in the City. These areas include a wildlife refuge, which borders Belmont Slough on
the south west side of the City, established in 1976 and owned by the State. An undeveloped
marina site (of which a portion consists of submerged lands) is located east of Beach Park
Boulevard near Swordfish Street. All of these park and open space areas are described and
shown in the Parks and Open Space Element of the General Plan.
The proposed marina site is located adjacent to the wildlife refuge. The land use designation for
this site allows waterfront commercial uses. Much of the present passive open space value of
this property would be changed to active recreational use upon development of a marina. In
2014, an application was filed for development of a marina including housing. The inclusion of
housing would require a General Plan Amendment. That proposed General Plan Amendment is
not included in this General Plan Update and will be considered separately.
The City successfully negotiated with the County to acquire the property adjacent to Werder
Pier, including the parking lot and restrooms. The site is now referenced as Bridgeview Park.
Plans have been prepared for development of the Park, with construction anticipated to take
place in 2014-15.
An additional open space area is located along the northern boundary of the City, north of East
Third Avenue and adjacent to lands in San Mateo. The entire area north of East Third Avenue
with the exception of a continuous strip of land along the bayfront, has been designated for
industrial uses since the original master plan was developed. However, permits for filling have
been obtained only for the Mariners Golf portion of this area, because the remaining lands have
been identified as unsuitable for development due to wetland and other environmental concerns.
The area now designated as open space to the west of the Mariners Golf site is adjacent to
existing wetlands in San Mateo. The intention of this designation is to preserve this area as
passive open space and wetlands.
Recreation and parks play an important role in Foster City. Each neighborhood has an easily
accessible park or open space area. Additionally, the extensive lagoon system including 212
acres of waterways, and the San Francisco Bay provide water-oriented recreation such as
boating and windsurfing and passive enjoyment, to all City residents. The lagoons can be
reached from, and represent the major focus of many of Foster City’s parks.

Uses located on lands designated for Public and Semi-Public uses include seven religious
institutions, the Civic Center complex (including the City's Government Center, library and North

Land Use Map. The Land Use Plan, Map 3.4, and the policy text of the Land Use Element of
the General Plan are complementary; the written policies set forth the basic approach to be
taken while the map shows the intended spatial application of the written policies. The General
Plan Land Use Map land use designations may be subject to change at the initiation of a land
owner or the City, depending on City needs, environmental conditions and changes in
surrounding land uses.
Sphere of Influence. Foster City's Sphere of Influence shall continue to be co-terminus with
the City limits boundary. A Sphere of Influence is defined (Government Code Section 54774) as
the ultimate probable physical boundaries and service area of a local agency.
Definitions of Land Use Categories. Land use categories are generalized groupings of land
uses and titles that define a predominant land use type. All proposed projects must meet
density and Floor Area Ratio standards for that type of use and other applicable development
standards, such as height, setbacks and lot coverage, established by the City’s Zoning
Ordinance. Exceptions to these standards may be allowed in some instances as allowed by the
Adopted, February 1, 2016                                                                          Page 3-16

Zoning Ordinance, consistent with the goals and policies of the Foster City General Plan. Some
listed uses will be conditional uses under the Zoning Ordinance and may be allowed only in
limited areas or under limited circumstances.
Residential Categories
Single-Family Residential. Allows up to 8 dwelling units per acre (du/ac). This is the single
largest residential category, and single family homes are located in every residential
neighborhood except one.
Two-Family Residential. Allows up to 10 dwelling units per acre. This designation recognizes
the small percentage of existing duplex homes in the City. The designation has been applied to
a small area in the northeastern portion of the City, on Comet Drive (Neighborhood #1).
Duplexes serve as a transition area between traditional single family detached homes and
higher density multi-family developments. The density range and zoning requirements have
been established in recognition that duplexes are an existing housing type intermediate to
single-family detached homes and townhomes. Duplexes should provide the outward
appearance of a single-family neighborhood, but at densities closer to those of townhomes.
Townhouse Residential. Allows up to 15 dwelling units per acre. Townhomes in Foster City
generally function as attached single family homes and usually provide some private open
space in addition to common areas.
Condominium Residential. Allows 15-35 dwelling units per acre. Condominium
developments are usually constructed at a higher density than townhomes. Any open space
areas are common to all residents.
Apartment Residential. Allows 20-35 dwelling units per acre. Apartment developments in
Foster City generally provide the highest density living environment, although some apartment
and condominium developments are very similar with respect to density and amenities.
Additional density is permitted above the density ranges described above pursuant to California
Density Bonus Law, Chapter 17.86 Density Bonuses, and other incentives designed to provide
affordable housing. See the Housing Element for more information.
Commercial and Industrial Categories
Town Center Commercial. This designation is reserved for the area located northwest of East
Hillsdale Boulevard, bounded by Foster City Boulevard to the north and State Route 92 to the
west. The area includes a 100-acre development known as Metro Center, in addition to
Parkside Towers and other office developments. Metro Center is intended to serve as Foster
City’s downtown core. The highest intensity uses in the City would be allowed, with Floor Area
Ratios (FAR) for office developments ranging from .55 to 2.0 FAR. Town Center office
developments located outside Metro Center, have lower FARs which range from .18 to 1.5 FAR.
Neighborhood Commercial. Reserved for small neighborhood convenience shopping centers
whose primary focus is servicing the immediate neighborhood. Although uses allowed in the
centers are mostly limited to neighborhood serving uses, a percentage of the floor area of each
center may be occupied by uses which are community serving in nature. In addition, the City
will allow housing or a mix of housing and commercial development at specifically designated

“housing opportunity sites”, consistent with Housing Element Policies. FARs of neighborhood
commercial centers generally range between .20 and .30 FAR.
Service Commercial. Includes a mix of uses providing general services. The area bounded by
Foster City Boulevard, East Hillsdale Boulevard, and State Route 92 is designated Service
Commercial and contains a mix of research and development firms, storage and professional
offices. Also located in this area are food establishments, including several fast food
restaurants, and a community theatre (Hillbarn). Land use intensities vary greatly in this area,
from relatively low FAR of .03 to .12 FAR for restaurant and gas station uses, to higher intensity
office developments with FAR’s ranging from .20 to .98 FAR (although most developments fall
in the lower end, .20 to .40 FAR, of this range).
Waterfront Commercial. This designation allows only for commercial development which is
directly related to, and enhances the public use of, the waterfront without damaging
environmental effects. Appropriate commercial uses would avoid impacting wetlands and could
include restaurants, commercial recreation, marine-related retail and offices and marina berths.
The site could also be used to expand the wetland areas in order to provide mitigation for off-
site projects. At the present time, only the proposed Foster City Marina site is designated for
waterfront commercial uses.
Light Industrial. Includes wholesale facilities, storage warehouses and the manufacturing,
processing, repairing, or packaging of goods. Emission of fumes, noise, smoke or other
pollutants or nuisances are strictly controlled. A limited amount of general office use is
acceptable in this area provided the uses meet the requirements established for the M-1 (Light
Industrial) zoning district. The M-1 zoning district is proposed to be amended to allow general
office uses part of this element. FARs for developments in the industrial area range from .20 to
.60 FAR.
Research/Office Park. Areas with this designation contain office, research and development,
and manufacturing establishments whose operations are clean and quiet. Mixed-use projects
which include some retail and residential uses in addition to office and research uses may,
under certain conditions, be considered compatible with this designation. Such conditions
include compatibility of uses and project design (land planning, architecture, etc.). Vintage Park,
the Lincoln Centre area, the Mariners Golf site and the Bayside Towers development are all
designated for Research/Office Park use. The intensity of development varies, with FARs
generally ranging from .30 along Foster City Boulevard, to .44 for Bayside Towers to a campus-
wide average of .79 for the Gilead Campus within Vintage Park. The intensity of development
for the vacant Vintage Park sites is anticipated to have an FAR up to 1.0.
Chess/Hatch Office Research. Areas with this designation allow commercial, office, industrial,
biotechnology and other such compatible uses, including vehicle parking in both parking
structures and at-grade parking lots on the project site. Incompatible uses such as housing,
schools, day care, and other uses serving primarily children are prohibited. Vertically and
horizontally mixed-use developments that maximize the use of land, organize land uses and
pedestrian/vehicular circulation in a safe, logical and functional manner and establish a safe,
logical and functional design relationship with adjacent land uses is allowed within this
designation. Uses must meet the requirements of Chapter 17.68, General Performance
Standards, of Title 17, Zoning, of the Foster City Municipal Code. FARs for developments in
this area would range from 0.6 to 1.55 FAR.

Other Categories.
Civic Center Mixed Use. This land use designation applies to the City-Owned 15-acre parcel
between Civic Center Drive and Balclutha Drive, and Foster City Boulevard and Shell
Boulevard. This parcel is the remaining piece of the Civic Center Master Plan and is planned for
a focal point for the City, capitalizing on its proximity to Leo Ryan Park, the Recreation/Senior
Center, the Library and the North Peninsula Jewish Campus. A plan for the site was endorsed
by the City Council in 2011 and includes approximately 400 age-qualified dwelling units,
consisting of a mix of for-sale units, rental apartments and assisted living units; 30,000 square
feet of commercial space including restaurants and retail establishments; as well as a public use
component including a neighborhood square designed to host public and private events,
outdoor seating, a farmers market, art displays and entertainment events. This designation
allows a range of 20-35 dwelling units per acre in a multifamily setting, combined with a
commercial component up to 0.5 FAR. Building heights will range from four to seven stories.
School. Includes only those properties owned by public school districts which have operational
schools located on them.
Parks and Recreation. This designation is for improved open space lands whose primary
purpose is recreation, and includes all local and regional parks.
Open Space. Open lands which are vacant of structures and improvements, and which are
primarily maintained in their natural condition, are designated as open space. In some cases,
maintained pathways or parking areas which enhance access to the open space areas are
considered compatible with this designation. The pedway along the perimeter of the City which
provides access to San Francisco Bay is designated open space, as well as a large parcel of
land located north of East Third Avenue along the northern boundary of the City and adjacent to
San Mateo City wetlands.
Public and Semi-Public. Reserved for uses which are generally public serving in nature,
including religious institutions, private schools, government offices, and fire and police facilities.

One of the goals of this plan is to reduce dependence on the automobile, and the number of
single passenger trips within the City. Providing increased job opportunities in the City for
residents, requiring employers to encourage use of alternative modes of transportation, and
improving the City's system of bicycle and pedestrian pathways are several of the ways in
which Foster City can move closer to this goal.
As a planned community, Foster City has a history of smart growth and comprehensive
circulation systems. City services, parks and schools are within walking distance to
neighborhoods, commercial centers are located approximate to residential neighborhoods, and
streets are designed to accommodate all modes of transportation. Most streets have sidewalks,
and handicap accessibility is continually being improved. The Levee-Pedway is a complete trail
system for bicyclists and pedestrians that connects to the regional Bay Trail. The very layout of
the City encourages walking, bicycling and short vehicular trips.
This plan includes policies and programs to implement the Complete Streets Policy adopted by
the City Council in 2012. Complete Streets describes a comprehensive, integrated

transportation network with infrastructure and design that allows safe and convenient travel
along and across streets for all users, including pedestrians, bicyclists, persons with disabilities,
motorists, movers of commercial goods, users and operators of public transportation, seniors,
children, youth and families.
There are benefits and value for the public health and welfare of reducing vehicle miles traveled
and increasing transportation opportunities by walking, bicycling, and public transportation.
Foster City recognizes that the planning and coordinated development of Complete Streets
infrastructure provides benefits for local governments in the areas of infrastructure cost savings;
public health; and environmental sustainability.
Circulation System Characteristics
Street Classification
The Foster City street system consists of a hierarchy of streets serving different land uses. The
classification system takes into account the type of trip being made and the roadway's
relationship to the land uses it is serving. Pavement width, sight distance and travel speed
generally increase as one moves from minor local streets to collectors and arterials. Map 3.5
shows the street network system in Foster City and Table 3.2 below shows the number of miles
of each type of street. The General Plan Environmental Impact Report Traffic Impact Analysis
contains a complete listing of Foster City streets by classification.

Freeways. Freeways are designed to carry large volumes of traffic over long distances. They
have limited access points, separate crossings and median strips separating the two way traffic.
State Route 92, which passes through the City generally in an east-west direction, has generally
three travel lanes in each direction east of US 101 and two travel lanes in each direction west of
US 101, with auxiliary lanes between interchanges. SR 92 has partial interchanges (hook
ramps) with Fashion Island Boulevard, Edgewater Boulevard, Metro Center Boulevard and
Chess Drive. U.S. Highway 101 does not pass directly through Foster City, but borders the City
to the west and provides connections to several Foster City access points. It is an eight lane
freeway in the vicinity of the City with one or two auxiliary lanes between interchanges and
travels in a north-south direction. US 101 interchanges providing access to Foster City are
located at East Hillsdale Boulevard and East Third Avenue.
Arterial Streets. Arterials feed heavy volumes of through traffic to freeways and are generally
designed with such traffic controls as medians, traffic lights and separate turning lanes. Access
to arterials from curb cuts should be limited and located a minimum of between 125-150 feet
away from intersections where possible. Arterial streets in Foster City are East Hillsdale
Boulevard, Foster City Boulevard, Beach Park Boulevard, Shell Boulevard, Metro Center
Boulevard, East Third Avenue, Vintage Park Drive and Edgewater Boulevard. Standards for

Circulation Background                                               Chapter 3: Land Use and Circulation Element
arterial streets generally call for a right-of-way width of 80' to 110', depending on whether there
is on-street parking, allowing for four to six travel lanes.
Collector Streets. Collectors are designed to channel traffic from local streets to arterials, and
to handle short trips within neighborhoods. They are typically two-lane streets with a right-of-
way width ranging from 60' to 80'. Examples of collectors in Foster City are Gull Avenue, Marlin
Avenue, and Port Royal Avenue
Local Residential Streets. Local Residential streets provide direct access to residential uses.
These streets are generally designed for low travel speeds and to protect residents from
through traffic. In Foster City, all streets which are not either arterials or collectors are classified
as local residential streets. These streets can either be public or privately owned streets (in
general, privately owned streets are designated as "Lane").
      Publicly-Owned Local Residential Streets: Standards for publicly owned residential streets
      require a 50' to 60' right of way, with parking on both sides.
      Privately-Owned Local Residential Streets: Private streets typically are cul-de-sac or loop
      streets, with a narrow right of way - 26' for streets without parking, 32' if parking on one
      side, and 40' if parking on both sides. Approximately one third of the City's residential
      streets are in private ownership.
Traffic Generation
To understand the link between land use decisions and their effect on roadway capacity, it is
helpful to know the volume of traffic which is generated by different land uses. Residential uses
dominate the City's land area, representing nearly 50 percent of all uses. In general, homes in
single family subdivisions generate more daily trips per unit than do other housing types. Multi-
family housing developments, specifically those located in "mixed use" developments, generate
less daily trips due to demographic factors (such as smaller family size), and reduced necessity
of trips for services.
Traffic generation for commercial and industrial developments can vary quite a bit, depending
on the specific use of a building. Peak hours of traffic generation can also vary greatly by land
use, from 12:00 -1:00 p.m. for a fast food restaurant, to 5:00 – 6:00 p.m. for a commercial office.
Table 3.3 below shows the number of vehicle trips which can be expected from different kinds
of residential, commercial and industrial land uses in Foster City.

excessive delays. Typically, LOS E represents “at-capacity” conditions and LOS F represents
“over-capacity” conditions. At signalized intersections operating at LOS F, for example, drivers
may have to wait through multiple signal cycles.
Existing intersection levels of service described here reflect 2012 levels. Future projected
traffic levels reflect the time period between 2012 and the year 2025. A combination of vehicle
delay and vehicular flow simulation were used to evaluate signalized intersection operations.
Future traffic conditions were calculated for the City using a traffic model which takes into
account future land use development projected by the Land Use section of this Element, year
2025 development projected for the City of San Mateo, and regional traffic increases projected
for the Bay Area.
Table 3.4 summarizes the relationship between delay and LOS for unsignalized intersections.
Generally, the delay ranges for each LOS are lower than for signalized intersections because
drivers expect to have less delay at unsignalized intersections. The results show the general
operating conditions of Foster City roads.

Historical Traffic Patterns
Foster City has historically been a residential community, with large number of employed
residents working outside the City. Because of this, existing traffic flow patterns are
characterized by outbound traffic in the morning hours and inbound traffic during the evening.
The charts below identify in general where Foster City residents work, and where people who
work in Foster City live. It is notable that ten percent of the working residents live and work in
Foster City.

Intersections
Table 3.6 illustrates the existing and future level of service (LOS) for various important
intersections in Foster City. Existing LOS are for 2012 conditions.
Three intersections in Foster City, or providing access to Foster City, are not currently operating
at a peak hour LOS to the City’s standard of D or better (as established by Policy LUC-3.1).

During the morning peak hour, the intersection of State Route 92 ramps and Chess Drive is
operating at LOS E and the intersection of East Third Avenue and Norfolk Street (which is
located outside the City limit) is operating at LOS E. During the evening peak hour the Foster
City Boulevard/Metro Center Boulevard/Triton Drive intersection is operating at LOS E. All other
intersections within Foster City are currently operating at, or above acceptable levels of service.
Future Roadway System Demand
Traffic Model
A traffic model is a mathematical way of describing the characteristics of the transportation
system and simulating future traffic conditions. It is a useful tool for long-range transportation
planning because it forecasts future traffic conditions based on a specific set of projected land
use assumptions.
For purposes of the model, projected traffic volumes are calculated using the total amount of
housing units and building square footage projected by the Land Use section of this Element.
This information is divided into traffic zones and translated into traffic volumes using various trip
generation rates for different types of land use, as described previously. Traffic volumes are fed
onto local streets, arterials and highways using a formula that determines which route traffic will
                                          take to reach a given destination. The model then calculates
                                          the traffic volumes and estimates intersection levels of service
                                          based on the future capacity of individual roadway segments

Intersections
The traffic model indicates that, with all the improvements discussed below completed, five
intersections will operate below LOS D during the morning and/or evening peak period:
         East 3rd Avenue and Norfolk Street – LOS F in the AM peak hour, LOS E in the PM peak
          hour
         Vintage Park Drive and Chess Drive – LOS E in the PM peak hour
         SR 92 Westbound Ramps and Chess Drive – LOS F in the PM peak hour
         Foster City Boulevard and Chess Drive – LOS in the PM peak hour
         Foster City Boulevard and Metro Centre Boulevard/Triton Drive – LOS F in the PM peak
          hour
Table 3.6 identifies the morning and evening peak hour LOS for the controlled intersections in
Foster City under Existing Conditions and Cumulative Plus General Plan Buildout Conditions.
Traffic volumes at study intersections along East 3rd Avenue and Foster City Boulevard were
adjusted to account for projected growth in cut-through traffic between US 101 and the San
Mateo Bridge, which has significantly increased in 2014-15, resulting in increased congestion at
several intersections.

                                                         San Mateo Intersections
There are two intersections located in the City of San Mateo whose operations are of concern to Foster City and for which there is shared
responsibility with the City of San Mateo.
East Hillsdale Boulevard and Norfolk Street. This intersection, a major entry point into Foster City, is currently operating at LOS C during the
morning peak period as well as during the evening peak. Future projections, which take into account both local and regional traffic, indicate this
intersection will continue to operate at LOS C. If the level of service of this intersection were to worsen beyond acceptable levels, mitigation
measures would need to be coordinated with the City of San Mateo, since it is not under the control of the City of Foster City.
East Third Avenue and Norfolk Street. This intersection provides a second, although less significant, entry to Foster City. Currently, the
intersection operates at LOS D during the morning and evening peak period. Future projections indicate the service level will remain at LOS D
during the morning and evening peak period.
   Roadway Improvements
   Planned Improvements
   The City Public Works Department has identified several major street improvements needed to
   increase roadway capacity to handle future expected increases in traffic. A number of needed
   intersection modifications have also been identified. The traffic model used to project the future
   traffic conditions discussed above assumed that all of these improvements were completed.
   Planned roadway improvements are listed in Table 3.7 and located on Map 3.6:

Alternative Transportation
Public Transit and Shuttles
There are several possible reasons why transit does not currently play a major role in Foster
City’s transportation network. Transit usage and population densities are directly related. While
Foster City densities are higher, on average, than other similar suburban cities, the overall
density of the City is low by transit service standards. The physical location of the City does not
warrant great transit ridership because Foster City is not located on the main transit corridor.
Additionally, car ownership is very common in Foster City. Although transit does not currently
play a major role in Foster City's transportation network, many efforts are being made to
improve the systems in place.
The following chart identifies primary modes of transportation for people living and working in
Foster City. Clearly, the major mode of transportation is from single-occupant vehicles.
Public transit service in Foster
City is provided by the San
Mateo County Transit District
(Samtrans) and the Alameda
Contra-Costa Transit District (AC
Transit). Samtrans provides three
local bus routes, two of which
connect to BART or Caltrain. AC
Transit provides one route across
the San Mateo Bridge to the East
Bay. The transit routes are
described in Table 3.8 and
illustrated in Map 3.7. In addition
to bus service, a fixed rail

Circulation Background                                              Chapter 3: Land Use and Circulation Element
commuter line (CalTrain) operates between San Francisco and San Jose, passing through San
Mateo. The transit station for this commuter line is located off West Hillsdale Boulevard, just
west of U.S. Highway 101 in San Mateo, and is accessible to Foster City residents by private
auto or by bus or shuttle. The closest BART station to Foster City is the multi-modal station in
Millbrae.

There is a shuttle system currently operated by C/CAG and The ALLIANCE (The San Mateo
County Transit District (SamTrans), the Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board (JPB), and the
Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD), and participating employers) that
connects riders in Foster City to the regional transit stations. These shuttles are available to any
member of the general public, including residents, employees of local businesses and visitors.
Three of these shuttles are currently operating.

         Redi-Wheels Paratransit, operated by SamTrans for persons with disabilities who cannot
          independently use regular bus service, is also a transit alternative.
Bicycle Facilities
Bicycle facilities include Class I bike paths, Class II bike lanes, and Class III bike routes. These
facilities are described as follows:
      Class I bike paths are paved pathways that are separated from roadways by space or a
          physical barrier.
      Class II bike lanes are lanes on the outside edge of roadways that are intended for the
          exclusive use of bicycles and are designated with special signing and pavement
          markings.
      Class III bike routes are roadways designated for bicycle use with only a bike route sign.
The bicycle facilities in Foster City are shown on Figure 3.8. The bicycle facilities are intended
to link Foster City's neighborhoods, schools, and parks. A bicycle/pedestrian pathway has been
developed which circles Foster City. The trail follows the outer lagoons and bay and includes a
segment located within the City of San Mateo. A portion of this bike/pedestrian pathway is part
of the San Francisco Bay Trail, which when complete, will encircle San Francisco and San
Pablo Bays with a continuous 500-mile network of bicycling and hiking trails. The City also has
small scale auto-free pedestrian links between schools and their surrounding neighborhoods
and parks.

Pedestrian facilities include sidewalks, marked and enhanced crosswalks, curb ramps, median
refuges and pedestrian-scale lighting. Sidewalks are provided along both sides of many streets
within Foster City, with marked crosswalks and curb ramps at intersections. One exception is
along East Third Avenue, which has sidewalks only on the south side of the street.
There are crosswalks at controlled intersections throughout the City. These are locations where
there is a signal, stop sign or yield sign. Pedestrian signals with pedestrian activated push
buttons are provided at signalized intersections. Medians are often present on the wide
boulevards, but median curb cuts are rarely provided for pedestrian refuge.
There are also multiple uncontrolled intersections which legally allow pedestrians to cross the
street at these locations. However, the City does not promote the installation of crosswalks at
uncontrolled intersections, especially on arterials and collectors, because it can create a false
sense of security for pedestrians. City policy is to encourage pedestrians to cross at controlled
locations. At some locations where crosswalks have been installed at uncontrolled locations, a
rectangular rapid flashing beacon (RRFB) system has been added. This system has been
installed on Edgewater Boulevard at Port Royal Avenue (north) and is planned for two other
locations on Beach Park Boulevard near Bowditch Middle School.
Balancing Circulation Needs
Overall, the City strives for a convenient and efficient circulation system that promotes a
balance of all modes of transportation. Foster City’s Circulation goals and policies support
connected networks that facilitate pedestrian, bicycle and vehicular movement throughout the
City. Emphasis is placed on well planned infrastructure to support a mix of uses and modes of
transportation, as well as walking and bicycling as a practical solution for everyday mobility.
Additionally, improving the City’s transit network and traffic reduction programs will continue to

offer viable alternatives to the automobile, potentially resulting in reductions in per-capita vehicle
miles traveled over time, as well as reduced greenhouse gas emissions.
The Complete Streets Principles adopted as part of the City’s Complete Streets Policy provide a
framework for making alternatives to the automobile easier to use and more accessible to
everyone. These principles are as follows:
     1. Complete Streets Serving All Users. Foster City expresses its commitment to creating
          and maintaining Complete Streets that provide safe, comfortable, and convenient travel
          along and across streets (including streets, roads, highways, bridges, and other portions
          of the transportation system) through a comprehensive, integrated transportation
          network that serves all categories of users, including pedestrians, bicyclists, persons
          with disabilities, motorists, movers of commercial goods, users and operators of public
          transportation, seniors, children, youth, and families.
     2. Context Sensitivity. In planning and implementing street projects, departments and
          agencies of Foster City shall maintain sensitivity to local conditions in both residential
          and business districts as well as urban, suburban, and rural areas, and shall work with
          residents, merchants, and other stakeholders to ensure that a strong sense of place
          ensues. Improvements that will be considered include sidewalks, shared use paths,
          bicycle lanes, bicycle routes, paved shoulders, street trees and landscaping, planting
          strips, accessible curb ramps, crosswalks, refuge islands, pedestrian signals, signs,
          street furniture, bicycle parking facilities, public transportation stops and facilities, transit
          priority signalization, and other features assisting in the provision of safe travel for all
          users, such as traffic calming circles, transit bulb outs, and road diets, as well as other
          features such as striping, signage and lighting.
     3. Complete Streets Routinely Addressed by All Departments. All relevant departments
          and agencies of Foster City shall work towards making Complete Streets practices a
          routine part of everyday operations, approach every relevant project, program, and
          practice as an opportunity to improve streets and the transportation network for all
          categories of users, and work in coordination with other departments, agencies, and
          jurisdictions to maximize opportunities for Complete Streets, connectivity, and
          cooperation. The following projects provide opportunities: pavement resurfacing,
          restriping, accessing above and underground utilities, signalization operations or
          modifications, and maintenance of landscaping/related features.
     4. All Projects and Phases. Complete Streets infrastructure sufficient to enable reasonably
          safe travel along and across the right of way for each category of users shall be
          incorporated into all planning, funding, design, approval, and implementation processes
          for any construction, reconstruction, retrofit, maintenance, operations, alteration, or
          repair of streets (including streets, roads, highways, bridges, and other portions of the
          transportation system), except that specific infrastructure for a given category of users
          may be excluded if an exemption is approved via the process set forth in section C.1 of
          this policy.
Providing a convenient and efficient system that promotes a balance of all modes of
transportation requires efforts to improve all aspects of the system. In addition to the roadway
improvements listed in this Element, a variety of efforts are needed, as described below.

Improvement of Bicycle and Pedestrian Circulation
In September 2014, the City Council directed staff to conduct a study of all intersections in the
City from a holistic perspective which would consider the needs of pedestrians, bicyclists and
motorists. The study should include an examination of potential options to address not only
current conditions but also conditions anticipated by future development. The study should
identify cost implications, as well as pros and cons associated with each identified option.
Also in September 2014, the City Council directed staff to conduct a study with the following
goals: 1) identify bike routes that may need enhancements that would increase cyclist safety
going to schools; and 2) identify major thoroughfares and any enhancements to those roadways
that would allow cyclists to get to the levee safely. Staff was further directed to prepare a study
that reviews highly used intersections by pedestrians that are going to Foster City schools and
recreational amenities such as the levee and identify ways to increase pedestrian safety at
those intersections. As staff conducts the study, it should not only identify potential
improvements which could be implemented but also explain the rationale for the proposed
improvements, the traffic impacts/mitigations associated with each proposed improvement, the
pros and cons associated with each proposed improvement and the cost implications.
Improvement of Public Transit Opportunities
In areas of higher density, especially areas with large daytime work force populations, transit
ridership can be improved in several ways, as described below:
     Bus Routes and Transit Infrastructure. The provision of bus stops and sheltered waiting
     areas can help make transit more convenient to use. Off-street facilities located at
     developments which are considered large, but unsteady, traffic generators (such as
     shopping centers, centers of worship, and recreational facilities) can also help to improve
     ridership levels. This Element includes Policy LUC-E-7 that encourages coordination with
     transit agencies that serve Foster City to improve the public transit system and
     infrastructure.
     Park and Ride Lots. Transit service providers have found that where park and ride lots
     have been established, the result is faster trip times for the passenger and more efficient
     transit operations. Currently, there are no park and ride lots located in Foster City.
Transportation Demand Management Programs. Transportation Demand Management
programs are strategies to reduce driving by promoting alternatives such as public transit,
carpooling, bicycling, walking and telecommuting. The programs can also include on-site
support services such as child care facilities or cafeterias. Formal programs have been required
of larger employers as mitigation for traffic linked to development. Any development creating
more than 100 peak hour trips is required to provide a Transportation Demand Management
Program. Examples of measures include:
      Bicycle lockers and racks
      Showers and changing rooms
      Participation in regional shuttle services
      Subsidized public transit passes
      Carpool/vanpool incentives like preferential parking and/or financial incentives
      Emergency ride home program
      Commute assistance center

       Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)
       ITS are advanced applications which aim to provide innovative services relating to different
       modes of transportation and traffic management, enabling users of all modes to be better
       informed and make safer, more coordinated use of transport networks. ITS improves
       transportation safety and mobility and enhances vehicle movement efficiency through the
       integration of advanced communications technologies into the transportation infrastructure and
       in vehicles. ITS can encompass a broad range of high-tech communications-based information
       and electronics technologies such as signal timing and synchronization, sensing technologies
       and emergency vehicle notification.
       Parking Needs
       The majority of trips into and within Foster City are made by automobile. The end result of each
       trip is the need to find a parking space. Because Foster City is a relatively "well-planned" City, it
       does not experience significant parking problems, as do some other older peninsula cities.
       Residential development has always been required to include parking at standards such that
       there are no parking problems. In addition, commercial properties have frequently used the
       concept of shared parking with adjacent uses, allowing commercial businesses to capitalize on
       available parking when other uses may not need it.
                                                               Flexible Parking Requirements
The City Municipal Code allows for some flexibility in the provision of parking. Required off-street parking for any residential, commercial or office project may
be reduced if any of the following measures are used by the developer, subject to approval by the City:
  (1) Shared Parking Facilities
  (2) In-lieu fees and off-Site Parking Facilities
  (3) Planned Development Districts which allow flexibility in development standards

  Land Use and Circulation
  Goals, Policies and Programs
                                    Introduction
                                    The Land Use and Circulation portions of the Foster City
                                    General Plan have historically been integrally related to each
                                    other. Although the character of Foster City has been
                                    established by land use decisions, there are still many
                                    decisions to be made in the near future. Maturity in the
                                    character of a city does not necessarily mean the city is
                                    stagnant or that there are no future land use decisions to be
                                    made.
                                    This section of the element draws upon the background
                                    information to establish goals and policies that will guide
                                    future City actions related to Foster City’s development and
                                    any changes in land uses or redevelopment. The impacts of
                                    future actions must be measured against the City’s goals. The
                                    land use policies and programs contained in this document
                                    are intended to guide the future development of vacant lands,
                                    underutilized parcels, and redevelopment projects in the City.
                                    Additionally, based on an analysis of existing development
patterns, the land use categories and designations establish a variety of housing and population
density and building intensity standards consistent with the existing pattern of development in
the City.
To carry out the goals and policies, implementing programs are also recommended. These are
specific actions the City will undertake to put the Land Use and Circulation Element into
practice. The time period envisioned for the goals, policies and implementation measures is 10-
15 years. This time period should include build-out of the City and some redevelopment or
change-of-use activities. The focus of the General Plan must be on managing changes so that it
continues to achieve the community’s vision. The Goals, Policies and Programs provide
direction for decisions related to all land uses, as well as for those related to specific land use
designations.
Goals and policies of the Land Use and Circulation Element are organized around the themes of
Neighborhood Compatibility, Land Use, Transportation and Mobility, Sustainability and Smart
Growth, Redevelopment and Public Facilities and Services. These goals and policies, and their
associated implementing programs, describe the priorities and strategies for the City’s vision for
the future.

Goals, Policies and Programs                                 Chapter 3: Land Use and Circulation Element
NEIGHBORHOOD COMPATIBILITY
Foster City residents enjoy a high quality of life – directly related to the livability and character of
the residential neighborhoods. The General Plan encourages new structures, remodels and
uses that are contextually appropriate, both in land use as well as in scale and design. Policies
for neighborhood compatibility promote connections and transitions to existing neighborhoods
through the design of public spaces, as well as upholding high standards of design for new or
remodeled buildings. These policies protect Foster City’s physical assets to maintain and
enhance the City’s identity.
Components for neighborhood compatibility include architectural review policies and
procedures, preservation of the character of neighborhoods and code enforcement. The City will
continue to implement thorough procedures for reviewing plans for new homes and additions.
The character of the residential neighborhoods has shaped the City since its inception and
should be carefully considered when evaluating new projects. Architectural styles and trends
change over time, and materials such as roofing, siding or windows modernize. The City should
respect progress in architecture and design and balance the individual preferences with City
goals and the context of the existing neighborhood.
LAND USE
In a built-out city like Foster City, the land use patterns are critical for maintaining a mix of uses,
traffic flow, and provision of services. Land use patterns represent our experience in the built
environment.
Typically, residential densities are measured as the number of persons per acre. However,
since the number of persons in a household fluctuates over time, densities in this plan are
established using units per acre as the variable. Units per acre can be translated into person per
acre by applying the average number of persons per household. The 2010 estimate by the
California Department of Finance was 2.6 persons per household.
A general plan must seek to identify the intensity of use allowed on sites designated for
commercial and industrial uses. Intensity of use refers to the amount of activity allowed on any
specific parcel. For instance, an office park with a significant number of employees is a more
intensive use of the land than a park or recreation area.
One of the most common ways to measure the intensity of commercial
and industrial development is the use of Floor Area Ratios (or FARs).
Floor Area Ratio is the ratio of the total building floor area to the size of
the lot (gross floor area divided by lot area equals FAR). For example,
a building with a total area of 20,000 sq. ft. on a 40,000 sq. ft. lot has
an FAR of .50. Floor Area Ratios can be used as a regulatory tool,
either alone or in conjunction with other development standards, such
as lot coverage, Building height, or bulk restrictions. While Foster City
does not use Floor Area Ratios specifically into its regulatory
mechanisms for commercial or industrial projects, they are useful in

Goals, Policies and Programs                               Chapter 3: Land Use and Circulation Element
establishing a measure of building intensity which can be expected on a parcel designated for a
specific commercial or industrial use. A description of existing FARs is included for each
commercial and industrial land use category definition.
TRANSPORTATION AND MOBILITY
Foster City’s Transportation and Mobility Goals, Policies and Programs support connected
networks that facilitate pedestrian, bicycle and vehicular movement. Transportation and mobility
is integrated with land use to move goods and people into, out and around the City. Future
roadway improvements will expand the City’s transportation networks to ensure an integrated,
well-connected system to increase walking, bicycling and transit opportunities. Goals, Policies
and Programs related to transportation and mobility focus on maintaining and improving the
City’s circulation system as well as making transportation options available to people who live
and work in Foster City. Additionally, improving the City’s transit network will offer viable
alternatives to the automobile, resulting in reductions in overall greenhouse gas emissions.
SUSTAINABILITY AND SMART GROWTH
The quality of the environment that surrounds us, whether it is rural, suburban or urban, affects
quality of life, and physical and emotional wellbeing. Sustainably oriented Goals, Policies and
Programs emphasize environmentally responsible construction techniques and conservation of
resources. They encourage sustainability and “smart growth” measures for both new and
existing development, ranging from those that encourage green building practices and energy
conservation to encouraging infrastructure for electric vehicles, in a healthy, cost-effective way
to improve the community. Since Foster City is a planned community, development is focused in
concentrated, compact, walkable urban centers that avoid sprawl and advocate supporting land
uses such as schools, shops and community gathering places within short distances to
residential neighborhoods.
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
Fiscal health and business development are critical objectives of Foster City. Goals, Policies
and Programs aimed at economic development help maintain successful businesses, and
therefore encourage a strong tax base, services and fiscal sustainability. The fiscal impacts of
any new growth could have City-wide implications. Fiscal sustainability of new growth, as well
as the City’s role in supporting innovation and expansion of existing and new businesses, helps
determine the feasibility of providing services and infrastructure development.
REDEVELOPMENT
Since Foster City is essentially a built-out community with distinct boundaries, new development
will primarily come from redevelopment of underutilized infill sites at higher densities and
intensities than they enjoy today. Intensifying existing development will result in a more efficient,
sustainable use of limited land and resources, as well as maximizing opportunities for mixed
uses and future transit without impacting the character of existing neighborhoods. The Goals,

Goals, Policies and Programs                                 Chapter 3: Land Use and Circulation Element
Policies and Programs related to redevelopment will help ensure land uses and the amount of
development are compatible with existing uses and fulfill a need in the community.
PUBLIC FACILITIES AND SERVICES
Existing and new neighborhoods should have access to a full complement of parks, public
facilities, and utilities such as water, sewer, electricity and gas, as well as other public services
for everyday living. The Goals, Policies and Programs related to public facilities and services
promote the provision of adequate public services, parks and open space, and community and
cultural facilities, including the pedway and Lagoon.

1 - NEIGHBORHOOD COMPATIBILITY
Foster City residents enjoy a high quality of life – directly related to the livability and character of the residential neighborhoods. The
General Plan encourages new structures, remodels and uses that are contextually appropriate, both in land use as well as in scale and
design.
         Preserve the Quality of the City's Residential Neighborhoods
         Preserve and strengthen the identity and qualities of Foster City's residential neighborhoods and assure that: (1) all new development,
         renovation or remodeling are harmoniously designed and operated to integrate with the existing neighborhood; (2) noise, traffic and
LUC-A    other conflicts between residential and non-residential land uses are eliminated or minimized to the extent possible; (3) each residential
         neighborhood has access to a developed park or park-like recreational area within walking distance to most residents, and that park
         facilities are well maintained, diverse and adequate to meet the needs of residents; and (4) maintain availability of commercial and retail
         services.
                          Preservation of Residential Neighborhoods. Preserve existing residential neighborhoods by maintaining their residential
          LUC-A-1         design and character and appropriate uses. The City will prohibit the conversion of single-family residences along major
                          streets to any uses other than residential uses (except that home occupations meeting City requirements shall be allowed).
                          Preservation of Views. The City will use the design review process to balance the ability of the property owner to
          LUC- A-2        improve/expand their property with the desire of the owners of neighboring Bayfront or waterfront houses to continue to
                          enjoy views of the San Francisco Bay or the Foster City Lagoon.
                          Code Enforcement and Property Maintenance. Continue to implement a neighborhood preservation program consisting
          LUC-A-3         of a code enforcement strategy for all neighborhoods and a design review strategy for new developments or property
                          improvements monitored and enforced through property maintenance requirements.
                                        Continue Code Enforcement Program. The City will continue its code enforcement program to ensure
                                        that residential, commercial and industrial properties are maintained. This responsibility will include, but
                                        not be limited to, periodic spot checks of property throughout the City and follow-up investigation of

                                        property maintenance complaints. Property maintenance standards shall be enforced, including weed
                                        abatement, painting/staining of buildings, trash and debris removal from yards, and planting and

                         they are located or detract from the residential character of their surroundings. Home occupations will be limited to the
         LUC-A-4         production of goods or services which are incidental to the residential use of the dwelling and which employ or engage no
                         persons other than residents of the dwelling. No external advertising or signs denoting the use of the property for business
                         purposes will be allowed. Title 17 of the Municipal Code contains standards and limitations for home occupations.
        Promote Proper Site Planning, Architectural Design and Property Maintenance
LUC-B   Ensure high quality site planning and architectural design for all new development, renovation or remodeling and require property
        maintenance to maintain the long- term health, safety, appearance and welfare of the community.
                         City Approach to Design (Architectural) Review. The City will establish a continuing program of civic beautification, tree
                         planting, maintenance of homes and streets, and other measures which will promote an aesthetically desirable environment
                         in order that neighborhood areas appear attractive both within and without. The City will use a design review process (called
                         Architectural Review) whereby the design of most public and private development proposals, including those for individual
                         residences, are subject to review and approval by the City. The primary objective of this review is to preserve the character
                         of the neighborhood and community regarding appropriate and acceptable design for property improvements. Design review
                         shall address, among other things, the following issues:
         LUC-B-1
                         a.   Preservation of the architectural character and scale of neighborhoods.
                         b.   That the development is well designed, in and of itself, and in relation to surrounding properties.
                         c.   Preservation of waterfront views.
                         d.   Minimizing impacts on the privacy and access to sunlight of adjacent properties.
                         e.   Minimizing impacts due to excessive noise or undue glare.
                         f.   Screening of unsightly uses including trash, loading docks/areas, roof top equipment, and special ventilating
                              systems.
                         g. Use of setbacks, open space, and landscaping.
                         h. Exterior colors and materials.
         LUC-B-2         Residential Design Review Process. The design review process shall be used to ensure compatibility of new residential

2 - LAND USE
In a built-out city like Foster City, the land use patterns are critical for maintaining a mix of uses, traffic flow, and provision of services.
Land use patterns represent our experience in the built environment. The focus of the General Plan must be on managing changes so
that it continues to achieve the community’s vision. The Goals, Policies and Programs provide direction for decisions related to all land
uses, as well as for those related to specific land use designations.
           Maintain a Variety of Land Uses
           Maintain land designated for a variety of residential, commercial, light industrial, recreational and public institutional purposes which: (1)
 LUC-C     provide a mix of housing types, densities and tenure; (2) ensure that a variety of commercial and industrial goods, services and
           employment opportunities are available in Foster City; (3) offer a range of recreational and public facilities to meet the needs Foster
           City's residents; and (4) maintain availability of commercial and retail services.
                             Planned Development Zoning. The Planned Development zoning designation may be applied to any designated multi-
                             family, commercial or industrial site to allow a mixed-use project, subject to the following standards:
                             a. In residential zones, commercial establishments provide goods or services primarily to residents of the project in which
                                  the establishment is located and to the residents in the adjacent neighborhoods.
            LUC-C-1          b. In residential zones, commercial uses are limited to the ground floor of a multistory residential building or to single-story
                                  buildings.
                             c. Advertising or identification signs are limited in size and number, and regulated by a project-specific sign program.
                             d. Any residences located in the development are protected by landscaping, open spaces, or other design features
                                  from the noise and traffic generated by commercial establishments.
                             e. Off-street parking for residents, employees, and customers is provided in accordance with the Municipal Code.
                             f. An adequate amount of open space for use by any residents of the project is provided. Such open space area should be
                             protected to provide a private area for residents.
                             Jobs/Housing Balance. The City will continue to strive to maintain a balance between the number of jobs in the City and
                             the number of housing units available to house workers. To achieve and maintain such a balance, the City will encourage
            LUC-C-2
                             and support, through other policies and programs of this Element and the Housing Element, mixed use projects which
                             provide both housing and employment opportunities, and whenever possible, the development of affordable housing.
                             Live/work or loft housing units. Encourage a range of housing units, including some less conventional choices such as
            LUC-C-3
                             live/work units, lofts, or single-room occupancy units.

Goals, Policies and Programs                                                                         Chapter 3: Land Use and Circulation Element
                     Mixed Use Residential/Commercial Projects. The City will encourage housing production by allowing mixed
                     residential/commercial projects to be built with the residential portion of mixed use projects built at an appropriate density
    LUC-C-4
                     to reduce trips to and from and within the City, per Policy H-D-4-a. In allowing higher residential densities for mixed use
                     projects, the project must comply with the goals and policies of the General Plan.
                     Residential Density Ranges. All residential densities are expressed in gross area density, which includes streets. There
                     is no guarantee that any individual project will be able to achieve maximum densities. In some special cases, densities can
                     be increased above the high end of the range shown. The following parameters should provide a starting point in
                     establishing project-specific densities:
                     a. Densities of undeveloped sites should be estimated at the middle of the range, rather than at the high end of the
    LUC-C-5
                          range.
                     b. The low end of the range will be appropriate for "problem" sites, such as those with restrictive easements, difficult
                          shape, or other physical or infrastructure problems.
                     c. The high end of the range is achievable under General Plan policies and the "PD" Zoning designation only
                          when excellence of design in accordance with prevailing residential densities of adjacent developed areas is
                          achieved.
                     d. In accordance with policies established in this Plan, mixed use developments may be allowed on a site designated
                          for multifamily use, as long as that site is zoned for “Planned Development” and the project meets the standards as
                          set forth in the policies and the City’s zoning ordinance.
                     Density of Residential Projects. The City will allow for a range of residential densities and housing types. Densities
                     should be calculated based on gross square footage of parcels, unless circumstances require the use of net buildable
                     land instead. The maximum allowed density may be achieved by use of the "PD" zoning designation or through mixed
                     use residential/ commercial development in appropriate locations. The maximum residential density for a particular type of
                     housing may be approved if the following are included:
    LUC-C-6          a. Excellence in architecture, site planning and landscape design is achieved through creative solutions to building
                          location and/or design, the preservation of views or vistas, the creation of usable open areas for public and/or private
                          enjoyment, the provision of pedestrian/bicycle pathways for links to existing or proposed routes, the preservation of
                          Bay wildlife resources, and the conservation of energy resources (through solar siting, clustering, etc.).
                     b. Recreational facilities are provided on-site for the enjoyment of project residents.
                     c. Traffic, noise, or visual effects of the higher density development will not significantly affect adjacent or nearby
                          residences, or the overall streetscape.
                     d. Very-low, low and moderate income units are included in the project.

                     Specialized Land Use Needs. Special City needs for a particular type of land use, such as water-oriented recreation,
    LUC-C-7          commercial services presently lacking in the City, or the need for low and moderate income housing must be considered in
                     the evaluation of appropriate land uses for vacant sites.
                     City-Owned and Controlled Lands. City-owned and controlled lands will be held or “banked” until such time as a
                     beneficial use can be made. Banked City lands should also be used to meet City service needs (on lands adjacent to City
                     Hall) and recreation and open space needs (on lands with water access). The City will not sell or exchange land at less
                     than fair market value, except in exchange for the provision of low or moderate income housing. Development and design
                     standards shall apply as in any private development, including the allowance of higher densities for residential projects
                     which include low or moderate income housing. The City will consider the following criteria in determining the most
                     beneficial use of City lands and will consider the exchange or sale of land for private development if such development can
    LUC-C-8          meet City needs based on these criteria:
                     a.   Revenue generating potential of the land use.
                     b.   Extent for which general public access and use is provided.
                     c.   Preservation of open spaces or important natural habitats as part of the project design.
                     d.   Extent to which the project fulfills important City needs, such as for unmet commercial or public services, low or
                          moderate income housing, recreation, or public facilities.
                     e. Compatibility of proposed land use(s) with existing/proposed adjacent properties use(s).
                     f. Protection of public views of the San Francisco Bay or Foster City Lagoon.
                                      City-Owned and Controlled Lands. The City will study and adopt a policy resolution guiding the use of
                                      City-owned or controlled lands. Such land will be retained by the City until a plan for its beneficial use can
                                      be prepared.

                     Water-Oriented Uses Along San Francisco Bay. To enhance the water-oriented environment of Foster City,
   LUC-C-10          development proposals may include water-oriented commercial activities on undeveloped properties along the San
                     Francisco Bay. Such uses could include restaurants, boat rental and repair facilities, boat slips, uses typically associated

                     spaces.
                     Permitted Land Uses on Vacant Sites. Permitted land uses on vacant sites should be compatible with the existing uses
   LUC-C-11          of land surrounding the vacant parcel, environmental characteristics of the site, the capacity of public facilities, streets and
                     infrastructure serving the site, and the need to maintain a balance between residential, commercial, and public land uses.
                     Density and Intensity of Uses. Allow and encourage change that responds to the current and potential market and
                     employment needs of businesses and that result in greater density and intensity of land uses and broad array of land uses
   LUC-C-12          including multi-family housing, commercial, retail, office, biotechnology and light industrial uses, and compatible uses, but

                          is located north of East Hillsdale Boulevard (The Marketplace). These centers shall emphasize goods and services which
                          are intended to meet the needs of the adjacent neighborhoods. However, in order to ensure a diversity of retail goods for
         LUC-D-3
                          the City’s residents, up to 25 % of the leasable area within each center shall be allowed to be occupied by uses serving
                          City-wide needs. Specialty commercial centers are those centers located north of East Hillsdale Boulevard, which in
                          addition to serving nearby residents, also provide goods and services which have a City-wide or sub-regional market,
                          including the “big box” Costco and OSH stores in Metro Center, the specialty center at 1000 Metro Center Blvd., and the
                          specialty center at Parkside Towers.
                          Neighborhood Commercial Centers. Re-evaluate the land use designations for the City’s neighborhood centers if, at a
                          future date, any of these neighborhood commercial centers are no longer viable. Because of the desirability of maintaining
         LUC-D-4          neighborhood access to basic goods and services, the redevelopment of these neighborhood commercial centers will be
                          encouraged only if neighborhood-oriented businesses cannot effectively compete with the newer commercial centers in
                          Foster City. If mixed use developments including residential uses are considered, criteria for determining the appropriate

                          in the AM and PM peak hours.
                     c. Availability of public infrastructure, services and facilities.
                     d. The ability of the project to provide landscaping for parking areas, facade modulation, and orientation of buildings which
                          would ensure privacy for, and minimize impacts on, any adjacent single-family homes, and reduce the perception of
                          density in a multifamily project.
                     e. The ability of the project to provide an appropriate transition from the public rights-of-way given the type of street and
                          mass and scale of buildings.
                     f. The ability of the project to provide the appropriate ratio of commercial square footage to housing units to be a viable

                     to existing eating establishments serving “fast foods” and convenience foods shall be required to utilize an architectural
                     design which fits in with the character of surrounding development rather than utilize trade or “corporate” style architecture.
    LUC-D-6
                     Design standards will be imposed to ensure that traffic circulation problems do not occur. Such uses shall be allowed only
                     in existing commercial shopping centers and in industrial or commercial areas northwest of East Hillsdale Boulevard, and
                     will be encouraged to locate in existing buildings rather than build new freestanding structures.

Transportation and mobility is integrated with land use to move goods and people into, out and around the City. Future roadway improvements will
expand the City’s transportation networks to ensure an integrated, well-connected system to increase walking, bicycling and transit opportunities.
Goals, Policies and Programs related to transportation and mobility focus on maintaining and improving the City’s circulation system as well as
making transportation options available to people who live and work in Foster City.

                     Complete Streets. The City will plan for a balanced, multimodal transportation network that meets the needs of all users of
                     the streets, roads, and highways for safe and convenient travel. The City will be guided by the following Complete Streets
                     Principles:
                          1. Complete Streets Serving All Users. Foster City expresses its commitment to creating and maintaining Complete
                             Streets that provide safe, comfortable, and convenient travel along and across streets (including streets, roads,
                             highways, bridges, and other portions of the transportation system) through a comprehensive, integrated
                             transportation network that serves all categories of users, including pedestrians, bicyclists, persons with disabilities,
                             motorists, movers of commercial goods, users and operators of public transportation, seniors, children, youth, and
                             families.
                          2. Context Sensitivity. In planning and implementing street projects, departments and agencies of Foster City shall
                             maintain sensitivity to local conditions in both residential and business districts as well as urban, suburban, and rural
                             areas, and shall work with residents, merchants, and other stakeholders to ensure that a strong sense of place
                             ensues. Improvements that will be considered include sidewalks, shared use paths, bicycle lanes, bicycle routes,
                             paved shoulders, street trees and landscaping, planting strips, accessible curb ramps, crosswalks, refuge islands,
                             pedestrian signals, signs, street furniture, bicycle parking facilities, public transportation stops and facilities, transit
    LUC-E-2
                             priority signalization, and other features assisting in the provision of safe travel for all users, such as traffic calming
                             circles, transit bulb outs, and road diets, as well as other features such as striping, signage and lighting.
                          3. Complete Streets Routinely Addressed by All Departments. All relevant departments and agencies of Foster City
                             shall work towards making Complete Streets practices a routine part of everyday operations, approach every
                             relevant project, program, and practice as an opportunity to improve streets and the transportation network for all
                             categories of users, and work in coordination with other departments, agencies, and jurisdictions to maximize
                             opportunities for Complete Streets, connectivity, and cooperation. The following projects provide opportunities:
                             pavement resurfacing, restriping, accessing above and underground utilities, signalization operations or
                             modifications, and maintenance of landscaping/related features.
                          4. All Projects and Phases. Complete Streets infrastructure sufficient to enable reasonably safe travel along and
                             across the right of way for each category of users shall be incorporated into all planning, funding, design, approval,
                             and implementation processes for any construction, reconstruction, retrofit, maintenance, operations, alteration, or
                             repair of streets (including streets, roads, highways, bridges, and other portions of the transportation system),
                             except that specific infrastructure for a given category of users may be excluded if an exemption is approved via the
                             process set forth in section C.1 of this policy.

                                 Plan Consultation and Consistency. Maintenance, planning, and design of projects affecting the
                                 transportation system shall be consistent with local bicycle, pedestrian, transit, multimodal, and other
                                 relevant plans, except that where such consistency cannot be achieved without negative consequences,

4 - SUSTAINABILITY AND SMART GROWTH
Sustainably oriented Goals, Policies and Programs emphasize environmentally responsible construction techniques and conservation of
resources. They encourage sustainability and “smart growth” measures for both new and existing development, ranging from those that encourage
green building practices and energy conservation to encouraging infrastructure for electric vehicles, in a healthy, cost-effective way to improve the
community. Since Foster City is a planned community, development is focused in concentrated, compact, walkable urban centers that avoid
sprawl and advocate supporting land uses such as schools, shops and community gathering places within short distances to residential
neighborhoods.
                 Foster a More Sustainable Community
   LUC-H         Strive to be a community that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their
                 own needs by promoting land use strategies that decrease reliance on automobile use, increase the use of alternative modes of
                 transportation, maximize efficiency provision of services and reduce emissions of GHGs.
                                 Promote sustainability. Encourage sustainability efforts of residents and business owners. Foster the use of
                  LUC-H-1        technology to improve sustainability, e.g., irrigation controls coordinated with the weather, sustainable remodeling
                                 guidelines for homes, use of recycled water for landscaping irrigation, infrastructure for electric vehicles, etc.
                                                 Green Building Guidelines and Incentives. The City will support the use of green building practices
                                                 by:
                                                 a. Providing information, marketing, training, and technical assistance about green building practices;
                                  LUC-H-1-a      b. Considering guidelines for green building practices in residential and commercial development; and
                                                 c. Implementing sustainable practices where feasible in public buildings and spaces.

                  LUC-H-2
                                 supporting trip reduction programs and encouraging the use of alternative fuels and transportation technologies.
                                  LUC-H-2-a      Climate Action Plan. The City will prepare, adopt and implement a comprehensive Climate Action Plan
                                                 (CAP) to achieve its fair share of statewide emissions reductions for the 2020 timeframe consistent with
       Adopted, February 1, 2016                                                                                                                  Page 3-62

                                           AB32. The CAP will specify the strategies, measures and actions to be taken for each inventory sector
                                           (transportation, electricity, solid waste, etc.) to achieve the overall emission reduction target, and include
                                           an adaptive management process that can incorporate new technology and respond when goals are not
                                           being met.

           LUC-H-3        facilities, parks and open space, personal services and shopping opportunities within walking distance of existing and
                          new residential neighborhoods.
                          Development Fair Share. Ensure that all new development and redevelopment participate in appropriate impact fee
                          or other reimbursement programs related to development impacts or circulation improvements, so that the
           LUC-H-4
                          improvement costs such as roadway improvements or provision of services is not born solely by the City or one
                          development.
                          Tree and Landscape Planting. Look for opportunities throughout the City to increase tree and landscape planting or
           LUC-H-5        enhance landscaped areas by promoting drought tolerant species that grow well in Foster City, pursuant to the
                          Outdoor Water Conservation Ordinance and other landscaped related guidelines.

5 - ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
Fiscal health and business development are critical objectives of Foster City. Goals, Policies and Programs aimed at economic development help
maintain successful businesses, and therefore encourage a strong tax base, services and fiscal sustainability.
              Provide for Economic Development
              Provide for economic development which: (1) maintains the City's ability to finance City services and construction and maintenance
  LUC-I       of public improvements; (2) offers local employment opportunities for Foster City residents so that inter-city commuting can be
              reduced; (3) assures the availability and diversity of resident-serving goods and services; and (4) allows for specialized commercial
              uses, such as automobile service stations, water-oriented commercial uses and day care facilities.
                                Economic Development Plan. Work with the Chamber of Commerce and area stakeholders to develop and adopt a
                LUC-I-1
                                strategy for economic development that promotes commerce, business health and diversity of existing and new
                                businesses in Foster City.
                                               Enhance existing retail centers & opportunities. Promote retail opportunities through coordinated sign
                                               guidelines and way-finding programs to create a “sense of place” in older shopping centers.

6 - REDEVELOPMENT
Since Foster City is essentially a built out community with distinct boundaries, new development will primarily come from redevelopment of
underutilized infill sites at higher densities and intensities than they enjoy today. The Goals, Policies and Programs related to redevelopment will
help ensure land uses and the amount of development are compatible with existing uses and fulfill a need in the community.
            Encourage Redevelopment of Under-utilized Properties
 LUC-K      Encourage the aggregation and redevelopment of under-utilized properties and/or outdated buildings under multiple ownerships in the
            older commercial/industrial areas of the City, specifically the Chess Drive/Hatch Drive area.
                                Redevelopment Opportunities. The City will continue to look for opportunities for potential redevelopment properties
              LUC-K-1
                                and proactively work with property owners on options for site reuse or redevelopment.
                                              Monitor Neighborhood Retail Centers. To determine the viability of existing neighborhood retail
                                              centers, the City will monitor vacancies and the physical condition of these centers. A General Plan
                                              amendment would be necessary at the time conversion to any other use is considered.

                          The mathematical modeling of transportation systems (e.g., freeway
 Vehicle Flow Simulation  junctions, arterial routes, roundabouts, downtown grid systems,
                          etc.) through the application of computer software to better help
                          plan, design and operate transportation systems.
                          Running a vehicle's engine when the vehicle is not in motion. This
                          commonly occurs when drivers are stopped at a red light, waiting
 Vehicle Idling
                          while parked outside a business or residence, or otherwise
                          stationary with the engine running. When idling, the engine runs
                          without any loads except the engine accessories.
 Vertical Mixed Used
                          Combination of different uses on different floors within the same
 Development

                          A measure of the operating capacity of a roadway or intersection, in
                          terms of the number of vehicles passing through, divided by the
                          number of vehicles that theoretically could pass through when the
                          roadway or intersection is operating at its designed capacity.
                          Abbreviated as "v/c." At a v/c ratio of 1.0, the roadway or
 Volume to Capacity
                          intersection is operating at capacity. If the ratio is less than 1.0, the
                          traffic facility has additional capacity. Although ratios slightly greater
                          than 1.0 are possible, it is more likely that the peak hour will
                          elongate into a "peak period." (See "Peak Hour." and "Level of
                          Service.")
                          A process to convert wastewater - which is water no longer needed
 Wastewater Treatment     or suitable for its most recent use - into an effluent that can be
                          either returned to the water cycle with minimal environmental
                          issues or reused.
                          Certain wildfowl of the order Anseriformes, especially members of
 Waterfowl                the family Anatidae, which includes ducks, geese, and swans. The
                          term is sometimes expanded to include unrelated aquatic birds such
                          as coots, grebes and loons.
 Waterfront               The land or the part of a town next to the water of an ocean, lake,
                          etc.
                          A transitional area between terrestrial and aquatic systems where
                          the water table is usually at or near the surface or the land is
 Wetlands
                          covered by shallow water. Under a "unified" methodology now used
                          by all federal agencies, wetlands are defined as "those areas meeting
                          certain criteria for hydrology, vegetation, and soils.”
 Wholesale                The sale of merchandise to retailers rather than directly to the
                          public.
