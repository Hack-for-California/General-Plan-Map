                                                 City of Westmorland 2007 - 2013 Housing Element
I.     INTRODUCTION
       The City of Westmorland recognizes and supports the State Legislature’s
       identification of decent housing and suitable living environment as a priority of utmost
       importance. In pursuing this goal, this Housing Element sets forth the City’s strategy
       to preserve and enhance the community’s desirable residential character, expand
       housing opportunities for all economic segments, and provide guidance and direction
       for local government decision making in all matters related to housing. The Housing
       Element is one of the seven required elements of the General Plan required by State
       Law and is intended to be used as a tool for the provision of adequate housing. The
       Housing Element must contain specific data relating to the identification and analysis
       of existing and future housing needs for all segments of the community at all income
       levels.
       COMMUNITY PROFILE
       Westmorland is a small rural community located in the northwestern portion of
       Imperial County. The City is approximately 190 Miles South of Los Angeles, and 26
       miles North of Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico. Rising housing costs and changing
       demographics all illustrate the need to develop an approach and strategy to
       producing housing that matches the needs of the existing and future population of the
       community. Based on the most up-to-date data, resources, and knowledge available,
       the City has undertaken the task of planning to meet housing needs for the period
       from 2008 to 2012. The result of this effort is the updated Housing Element of the
       General Plan.
       CALIFORNIA HOUSING ELEMENT LAW
       The Housing Element is mandated and governed by the State of California
       Government Code Article 10.6 Sections 65580 to 65589.8. Pursuant to Section
       65583, the Housing Element must contain:
                An assessment of housing needs and an inventory of resources and constraints
                relevant to the meeting of those needs;
                A statement of the community’s goals, quantified objectives and policies relative
                to the maintenance, improvement and development of housing; and
                A program which sets forth a five-year schedule of actions the City is
                undertaking or intends to undertake to implement the policies and achieve the
                goals and objectives of the Housing Element through the administration of land
                use and development controls, provision of regulatory concessions and
                incentives, and the utilization of appropriate Federal and State financing and
                subsidy programs when available.

                                                  City of Westmorland 2007 - 2013 Housing Element
       The City is required to update the Housing Element at least once every five (5) years.
       The General Plan was first adopted in 1973 and the existing Housing Element was
       last updated in 1999. Previous revisions of the Element are necessary for the
       adequate evaluation of the progress in the implementation of past goals, objectives
       and policies.
       The City must also meet its ―fair share‖ of the regional housing needs as determined
       by the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG). The Regional
       Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) delineates the five-year housing growth needs
       by income category. The City is required to submit this Housing Element to the State
       Department of Housing and Community Development for additional review and
       compliance. The law requires:
                Analysis of population and employment trends in relation to regional trends;
                Analysis of the City’s fair share of the regional housing needs;
                Analysis of housing and household characteristics;
                An inventory of land suitable for residential development, including vacant sites
                and potential redevelopment sites, with an analysis of the relationship of zoning
                and public facilities and services to these sites;
                Analysis of governmental and non governmental constraints on the
                improvement, maintenance and development of housing for all income levels;
                An analysis of opportunities for energy conservation; and
                Analysis of low-income housing developments at risk of conversions to market
                rate housing
       The purpose of these requirements is to develop an understanding of the existing and
       projected housing needs within the community and to set forth policies and schedules
       promoting the preservation, improvement, and development of diverse housing types
       available at a range of costs in Westmorland.
       RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER ELEMENTS
       The Housing Element works in conjunction with the goals and objectives of all other
       elements of the General Plan. State law requires that each of the elements be
       comprehensive, integrated consistent with each other, and have a compatible
       statement of policies. This Housing Element was updated concurrently with the update
       of the entire General Plan, and every effort was taken to ensure balance and
       compatibility among all the elements.
       However, recommended zone and program changes are so significant; a consistency
       study will be required once the new zoning ordinance is prepared.

                                                City of Westmorland 2007 - 2013 Housing Element
       In carrying out the responsibilities of this update, the other General Plan elements will
       build upon policies set forth in this Housing Element. The Land Use Element identifies
       the general distribution and intensity of residential uses. It also sets standards for
       residential growth and preserves the quality of life in residential areas. The
       Conservation, Open Space, Noise and Safety Elements address the environmental
       quality affecting residential areas. The Circulation, Public Facilities and Fiscal
       Elements establish programs and policies to provide adequate levels of infrastructure
       and public services to foster residential growth.
II.    EVALUATION OF EXISTING HOUSING ELEMENT
       As part of the five-year update of the Housing Element, local governments, under
       California Government Section 65588, must review the current Housing Element to
       assess progress implementing goals, objectives and policies set forth. The progress
       should be quantified where possible (e.g. rehabilitation results and number of new
       construction for low-income housing), or qualitative where necessary (e.g. mitigation of
       governmental constraints). Westmorland’s share of the regional housing needs
       allocation (RHNA) is determined by the Southern California Association of
       Governments (SCAG). Westmorland’s RHNA portion during the 1999 – 2007 planning
       period was to plan for the development of 34 residential units as follows:
                       Very Low Income Units              7
                       Low Income Units                   8
                       Moderate Income Units              7
                       Above Moderate Income Units       12
       ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND RESULTS
       Generally, the City of Westmorland did comparatively well meeting its housing goals
       and implementing the policies of the previous Housing Element. Following are some of
       the more important highlights of the City’s performance over the past five (5) years.
            There were a total of 19 building permits issued for new residences since 2001; 11
            of the units constructed were by private developers and eight units were built using
            a combination of CDBG and RLA funds. Of the eight families assisted four were
            TIG and four were LTIG.
            Between 2001 and 2005 the City utilized $465,495 in CDBG funding to subsidize
            water/sewer assessments for 124 households in the City of Westmorland. Of these
            households 55 were TIG and 69 were LTIG. In addition, six (6) (4 TIG and 2 LTIG)
            families have been assisted with funding for housing acquisition.
            In 2003/2004, funding was obtained from the Imperial Valley Association of
            Governments (IVAG) to construct sidewalks and handicap ramps at various City

                                                  City of Westmorland 2007 - 2013 Housing Element
            street locations. IVAG provides transit services throughout Imperial County and the
            City of Westmorland is a major contributor for these services. CDBG funding was
            also utilized to assist one (1) family with the provision of a handicap accessible
            bathroom.
            In 2002, Westmorland was awarded $3,400,000 in HOME funds to develop a 65
            unit low income, multifamily apartment complex; with 26 units targeted for very low
            income households. A General Plan Amendment and Zone change was required
            for the development of the Westmorland Family Apartments. The rental rates for
            the 26 HOME units are specifically structured to meet low/very low income rents for
            a period of 55 years.
            Since 2000, over $2,800,000 has been secured from the Department of Housing,
            Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) component to complete various
            projects, i.e. public works infrastructure, community facilities, housing rehabilitation,
            and housing acquisition.
            The City significantly reduced governmental constraints by adopting all of the
            zoning ordinance changes that were proposed in the 1999 Housing Element and
            completing a Service Area Plan.
            In addition to the above quantified objectives that were met, the City was also very
            successful in continuing the implementation of on-going policies. These policies
            include the implementation of an ongoing housing rehabilitation and housing
            acquisition program of anti-discriminatory regulations.
       ADEQUATE HOUSING SUPPLY
       In order to ensure the availability of housing supply, the 1999 Housing Element
       identified the need to construct, preserve, and rehabilitate at least six units per year.
       Two units were to be available for very low income households and two units per year
       for low income households. The remaining two units would be made available for
       moderate to above moderate income households. The Element also identified the
       creation of an R-3 Zone to allow a density of 30 units per acres.
       This would serve as an incentive to reduce the cost for developers in new housing unit
       construction. Instead, the City updated the Zoning Ordinance in October 1999 to
       include development standards for R-4 zoning. The Zoning Map showed an R-4
       designation but was not included in the text. The amendment incorporated the entire
       goals intended for the creation of an R-3 zone without creating the separate R-3 zone
       itself.
       The City completed the zoning changes and general plan amendments for the R-4
       designation for the development of the Westmorland Family Apartments. Construction

                                              City of Westmorland 2007 - 2013 Housing Element
       of the Westmorland Family apartments was completed in 2004 and has been
       structured to meet low income rents for a period of 55 years.
       Because of the low amount of interest in residential development in the City of
       Westmorland, it is difficult to analyze the extent of constraints placed by land use
       controls.
       HOUSING COSTS AND AFFORDABILITY
       Programs set forth by the 1999 Housing Element to promote an adequate supply of
       affordable housing included State and Federal Programs such as CDBG, HOME, and
       US Department of Agriculture Rural Development Programs. This aided in the
       construction of new affordable housing, the utilization of HUD Section 8 rent subsidies,
       increased funding for the construction of subsidized rental units, and funding for the
       replacement of dilapidated housing occupied by low or very low income families. The
       City has successfully utilized CDBG funds for the rehabilitation and replacement of
       dilapidated homes occupied by income-qualified households. Through the assistance
       of the Imperial Valley Housing Authority, Section 8 subsidies currently help at least 134
       low and very low-income households. HOME funds provided ten families with first time
       home-ownership benefits.
       MAINTENANCE AND REHABILITATION
       The 1999 Housing Element also identified the need for the maintenance and
       rehabilitation of existing housing stock. Implementation actions include the continual
       identification of housing units in need of repair and the utilization of CDBG funds to
       identify and rehabilitate these homes. As stated earlier, the City has and continues to
       rehabilitate homes through the CDBG program.
       SPECIAL HOUSING NEEDS
       In accordance with provisions set forth by State law, the 1999 Housing Element
       addresses the needs of all social and economic segments of the population. This
       population includes but is not limited to low income households, the elderly,
       handicapped accessibility, and the City, through CDBG funding, actively renovates
       homes for the removal of architectural barriers. Furthermore, the City continues to
       provide increased housing opportunities for large families in the form of room additions
       in single-family residences. The City, has not, however, enacted a homeless shelter
       ordinance to allow homeless shelter facilities in the R-3 zone as set forth in the 1999
       Housing Element. The City, however, continues to be an active participant in the
       County’s Regional Homeless Task Force. Additional information is included further in
       this Element.

III.   POPULATION AND HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS
       POPULATION
       The State Department of Finance provides municipalities with yearly estimates on
       population and housing stock. These estimates are based on construction activity,
       electrical hookups and other variables. Actual figures are only available every ten
       years through the Federal Census. Official State estimates were used for the
       preparation of this Housing Element.
       Historically, there has been relatively little growth in Westmorland’s population since
       1990 (as shown in Table 1). There was a significant decrease in the population from
       1960 to 1970, but the population has been stable since 1980. Current estimates by
       the Department of Finance showed that Westmorland had 2,372 persons as of
       January 1, 2007. Official State estimates since 2000 indicate that Westmorland has
       experienced an average annual growth rate of approximately 5%.

                                                   Year
       Population projections for the next twenty years are used in determining the need for
       additional housing units. The Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG)
       population forecast (adopted in July 2007) and the California Department of Finance
       population estimates show that there will be a steady but slow increase over the next
       20 years. The population for the year 2010 is projected to be 3,290 and the year 2020
       will see a population of 5,080.

       HOUSEHOLD COMPOSITION
       The Census defines a household as all persons who occupy a housing unit, which may
       include families related through marriage or blood, unrelated individuals living together,
       or individuals living alone, Persons living in retirement or convalescent homes,
       dormitories, or other group living situations are not considered households.
       Planning needs for the City can be best analyzed by the statistics that indicate
       household size, trends, income, overcrowding, and utilization of the housing stock.
       Also, the number of large families and single persons can identify additional housing
       needs such as availability or larger housing units for large families and affordable
       smaller units for single persons.
       According to the Census, Westmorland had 625 households in 2000. Families
       represented the City’s predominant household type by 80.3 percent, with single person
       households representing the second largest household group at 16 percent. Among
       the single person households, approximately 8.5 percent are elderly households.
       RACE/ETHNICITY
       The racial and ethnic make-up of a population affects housing needs based on the
       unique household characteristics of different groups, particularly household size. As

       illustrated in Table 3, the City is a predominantly Hispanic community, with Hispanic
       persons comprising over 80% of the population in 2000. Non-Hispanic Whites
       comprised the second largest group in the City at 16% (percent). Blacks, Asians,
       Native Americans and persons of other races together represented less than one
       percent of the total City population in 2000.

       AGE AND GENDER DISTRIBUTION
       The need for additional housing is further reflected in age and gender distribution of the
       population. The population chart on the next page (Table 4) shows that 64% of the
       population in Westmorland is 18 years and over. More than 50% of the City’s residents
       are over 21-years of age. That segment of the population is proportional to that of the
       under-20-year-old segment.

       This indicates that the working age group stays in the City of Westmorland. Since
       these figures are based on the 2000 census, those within the ages of 10 and 20 have
       since reached working age and the current need for additional housing is increased.
       HOUSEHOLD CHARACTERISTICS
       Household Size
       According to the 2000 US Census, there are 625 households in the City of
       Westmorland. Significant portions of the households (23.7%) are in 5-or-more person
       households and an equal amount (23.7%) is in 2-person households. The prevalence
       of larger sized households suggests the possibility of overcrowding.

                                                City of Westmorland 2007 - 2013 Housing Element
       Household Income
       Household income is indicative of housing affordability and the supply of affordable
       housing must be proportional to income categories for all segments of the population.
       Those with higher incomes have more discretionary income to spend on housing while
       those in the low and moderate income groups are more limited in the housing they can
       afford. The City’s median household income was $23,365 in 2000, compared to the
       County’s median household income of $37,086. An income survey completed in 2005
       identified that a total of 80 percent of the population was within the low- to very low-
       income categories (income less than 80% of the City’s median, as defined by the US
       Department of Housing and Urban Development and the California Department of
       Housing and Community Development).
       Household Tenure
       The ratio between owner and renter occupied units is almost one to one. In 2000, 317
       households (50.7%) were owner-occupied units. While another 308 households
       (49.3%) were renter-occupied units.
       Extremely Low Income Households
       Extremely low income is defined as households earning less than 30 percent of Area
       Median Income (AMI). Currently, in 2008, the AMI for a four-person household in
       the El Centro MFI is $45,100.
       A four-person household with extremely low income earns less than $16,150
       annually. Households with extremely low income have a variety of housing needs.
       It is not uncommon for households receiving public assistance such as Social
       Security Insurance, or disability insurance to be considered extremely low income.
       According to HUD’s 2000 Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS)
       data, 170 households in Westmorland are considered to be extremely low income.
       As depicted in the table below, over-payment was higher among renters than
       owners for extremely low income households.

       To calculate existing housing needs, the City assumed that 50 percent of its very-low
       income regional housing need is extremely low income. The City was allocated a
       total very-low income housing need of 61 units. Assuming 50 percent of this need is
       for housing targeting extremely low income households, there is a need for 30 units
       in the City targeting households with extremely low incomes. Those seeking rental
       housing are most likely to face overpayment, overcrowding, or substandard housing.
       In 2002, the City obtained HOME funds from the State of California Small Cities
       Program to assist a 65 unit affordable multifamily housing project. The units were
       completed in 2004 and 26 units are affordable to very low income families. Any
       additional affordable multifamily projects will require several levels of local, regional,
       state, and federal financing including State multifamily funds, bond money, and low
       income housing tax credits. Each of these types of financing requires that at least a
       percentage of the total units be affordable to households in the extremely low income
       category.
       Extremely low income households are also considered to be at-risk of homelessness.
       To address the needs of extremely low income households, the City will develop a
       program to promote a variety of housing types, including single-room occupancy
       units (SRO’s) and supportive housing.                  In addition, the Imperial Valley Housing
       Authority will continue to acquire Housing Choice Vouchers to both preserve public
       housing opportunities and to allocate to extremely low income households.
       Single-room occupancy units are allowed in the Commercial Center zoning district by
       right. The City has no specific zoning standards for single-room occupancy units,
       thus there are no constraints in this district to constructing SRO units. SRO buildings
       have to meet the same requirements as other commercial buildings.
       It is the intent of the City to impose no undue constraints to the development of
       supportive housing and transitional housing and to treat these types of housing as
       multifamily housing, allowed by right in all districts where multifamily housing is
       allowed. However, the City’s Zoning Ordinance does not specifically identify

       transitional and supportive housing as specifically permitted uses in multifamily
       zones. A program is included in this Housing Element to amend the Zoning
       Ordinance to specifically identify transitional and supportive housing as permitted
       uses in multifamily zoning districts.
       SPECIAL NEEDS GROUPS
       Certain segments of the population may have difficulties in finding decent, affordable
       housing due to special needs. These special-needs groups are often low-income and
       include the elderly (those over the age of 65) include close proximity to retail, medical
       and other services and special housing maintenance. The 2000 US Census showed
       that there were 125 elderly persons in the City (9% of the population) and 87 of the
       elderly were heads of households (22% of the households). Eight years have passed
       since the 2000 Census and there is now an estimated 149 elderly residents (based on
       current death rate and estimated rate of out-migration). This segment of the population
       may continue to fluctuate within the next five years as people continue to age, die or
       relocate. Of the 98 householders over the age of 65, 63 (64.3%) are owners and 35
       (35.7%) are renters.
       There is currently only one senior citizen housing complex in the City of Westmorland.
       This complex has only 15 units, but the need for additional senior housing is not
       apparent.
       Handicapped
       Those with physical disabilities, especially those with mobility impairments have
       special needs not typically met in housing of conventional design. There are 143
       disabled persons and 42 persons are unable to work (1990 US Census). This accounts
       for 10% of the City’s population. Title 24 of the California Administrative Code requires
       that a specified number of units must be handicapped accessible on residential
       projects consisting of five or more units. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and
       the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA) further address the provision of affordable, barrier-
       free housing. Currently, only the Arredondo apartments and the senior housing
       complex are available for the handicap. However, the City makes grants available
       through the State Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) to improve handicap
       accessibility in single-family residences.
       Large Families
       Nuclear families are typical in Hispanic households, and, as is reflective of the large
       Hispanic population, there is a prevalence of large families in the City. As stated
       earlier, there are 94 large family households (those with 5 or more persons); this
       accounts for 23.6% of all the households. The needs of large households are often

       unmet because of the lack of adequately sized affordable housing units. Thus, large
       families are more susceptible to overcrowding.
       This need is currently being addressed through the construction of additional
       bedrooms by utilizing CDBG funds in situations where overcrowding exists. The
       Imperial Valley Housing Authority also provides assistance in the form of Section 8
       subsidies for larger low-income families. Furthermore, constructions of new, larger size
       housing units are also available to qualified families through the US Department of
       Agricultural Rural Development (formerly known as FmHA—Farmers Home
       Administration) loan program.
       Female- Headed Households
       Single parent households require nearby access to day care, health care and other
       similar facilities. Female-headed households are more likely to have lower incomes.
       These factors contribute to added difficulties in acquiring adequate housing. The 1990
       US Census shows that there are 88 female-headed households, which is a 28%
       increase from 1980. The Imperial County Welfare Department estimates that
       approximately 95% of these households receive TANF (Temporary Aid to Needy
       Families; formerly AFDC – Aid to Families with Dependent Children) welfare
       assistance. The City also provides grants and low-interest loans to assist these
       households.
       HOUSING FOR SPECIAL NEEDS GROUPS
       Emergency Shelters
       Each year the Imperial County Task Force on Homelessness conducts a ―point in
       time‖ survey. In January 2008 there were no homeless persons identified in the City
       of Westmorland. According to the Continuum of Care application to HUD, there were
       a total of 318 homeless identified in Imperial County; 89 were sheltered, 229 were
       not.
       Chapter 633, Statutes of 2007 considerably strengthened the requirements on zoning
       for emergency shelters and transitional housing, with an effective date of January 1,
       2008. For example, emergency shelters must now be permitted without a conditional
       use permit (CUP) or other discretionary permits, and transitional housing and
       supportive housing are considered residential uses and must only be subject to the
       same restrictions that apply to the same housing types in the same zone. Also,
       regardless of the need, at a minimum, all jurisdictions must have a zone in place to
       permit at least one year-round emergency shelter without a CUP or any discretionary
       permit requirements.

       The City will be updating its Zoning Ordinance during the later part of 2009 and will
       include provisions to specifically permit an emergency shelter in the Industrial (I)
       Zoning District without a CUP during this planning period. This zone has sufficient
       capacity to accommodate the need for emergency shelters and at least one year-round
       emergency shelter. Currently, there are 50 acres of vacant Industrial-zoned land in the
       City. Existing or proposed permit procedures, development, and management
       standards would have to be objective and encourage and facilitate the development of,
       or conversion to, emergency shelters.
       The City will not condition the use of the site or structure. The only conditions
       imposed are those associated with zoning, set backs, and similar items. These
       conditions run with the land and may continue under successive owners. The
       conditions of a typical approval are as follows:
                   Daily clean up of litter, trash and debris
                   Building permits are required for structural improvements
                   Total occupancy shall be consistent with the Uniform Building Code
                   and Uniform Housing Code.
                   A minimum of five off street parking spaces shall be provided
                   At least one staff person shall be on site at all times
                   If there are more than six clients on the site, the site shall be landscaped
                   The building shall comply with the disability accessibility requirements

                   required for the facility
                   A fire alarm system shall comply with CFC & CBC requirements
                   Based on the number of applicants, the appropriate fire sprinkler
                   system may be required within 90 days. Contact the Fire Marshal
       A program is included in this Housing Element to ensure that the City complies with
       this legislation.
       There are emergency, transitional housing, and supportive services providers in
       Imperial County providing shelter, food and clothing, counseling, classes, housing
       referral, job training, medical assistance and similar assistance. A complete list, as
       located in the Imperial County Housing Element, dated June 13, 2008, is appended
       to this document as Attachment 1.
       Transitional Housing
       Transitional Housing facilities and Supportive Housing complexes are not currently
       explicitly mentioned in the Zoning Ordinance. The City will amend all residential
       zoning districts to permit transitional and supportive housing as a residential use,

       Supportive Housing
       Supportive housing is defined by Section 50675.14 of the Health and Safety Code as
       housing with linked on-site or off-site services with no limit on the length of stay, and
       is occupied by a target population as defined in Health and Safety Code Section
       53260 (i.e. low income person with mental disabilities, AIDS, substance abuse or
       chronic health conditions or person whose disabilities originated before the age of
       18). Services linked to supportive housing usually focuses on retaining housing, living
       and working in the community, and/or health improvement.
       At the present time, supportive housing is not specifically mentioned in the code. A
       new provision will be developed designating supportive housing as a residential care
       facility. Definitions will be developed and specific land use zones will be identified
       that will permit those uses with a Conditional Use Permit.
       Single Room Occupancy (SRO)
       SRO unit fill a much needed gap in the housing continuum, particularly for the
       homeless and at risk single adult. As noted earlier, there were no homeless persons
       identified in the County’s point-in-time survey conducted in January 2008. However,
       to provide for the eventual need, the City of Westmorland’s zoning ordinance will be
       amended to accommodate transitional housing and supportive housing.
       They will be permitted without a conditional use permit, in multifamily zoning districts,
       provided they comply with the development standards of the district.
       Farmworker Housing
       Even though the City of Westmorland is surrounded by large expenses of agricultural
       land, according to the 2000 US Census only about one-third of the workforce (112
       persons) were employed in occupations classified as ―agriculture, forestry, and
       fishing.‖ Others could be employed in positions with the Bureau of Land
       Management, State Department of Conservation, or with Fish and Game, all of which
       are located in Imperial County.
       Agricultural workers are traditionally categorized into three groups: 1) permanent, 2)
       seasonal and, 3) migrant. Permanent farm workers are typically employed year round
       by the same employer. A seasonal farmworker works on average less than 150 days
       per year and earns at least half of his/her earned income from farm work. Migrant
       farm workers are seasonal farm workers who have to travel to do the farm work so
       that he/she is unable to return to his/her permanent residence within the same day as
       persons whose primary incomes are earned through permanent or seasonal

       agricultural labor. Permanent workers can work in the fields, processing plants, or in
       support activities on a generally year-round basis.
       When workload increases such as during harvest periods, the permanent labor force
       is supplemented by seasonal workers, often supplied by a labor contractor.
       The special housing needs of agricultural workers arise from three main factors:
       limited income, overcrowding, and substandard housing conditions. According to the
       2007 data from the State Employment Development Department occupational profile,
       farm workers and laborers earn an average hourly wage of $8.32 an hour. They,
       however, do not often work full-time year round. The low and very low-income levels of
       these workers qualify them for all rent subsidy programs.
       As a result of these very low incomes, farm workers have limited housing options and
       often double or triple-up to be able to afford prevailing rental rates and, when they do
       locate housing it is often in substandard condition.
       Although there are agricultural operations within the City’s Sphere of Influence,
       once agriculture land is proposed for annexation to the City, it is a requirement
       of the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) that land be pre-zoned to
       some use other than agriculture.
       There are no farm labor designated housing units in the City of Westmorland. The
       68-unit Redondo Apartments were initially constructed with USDA Section 515
       funding, but were not restricted to agricultural workers.
       The Imperial Valley Housing Authority (IVHA) operates three existing farm worker
       housing complexes, two in El Centro and one in Brawley.
       The City of Westmorland will work with the Imperial Valley Housing Authority to
       identify a site for farm labor housing. The City’s zoning ordinance will be amended
       and updated to permit farm labor housing in any zone that permits the type of
       housing being built (i.e., multifamily or single family) without any special conditions
       as the result of it being for farm workers. Further the City will review Health and
       Safety Code Section 17021.5 and 17021.6 to ensure compliance with the Employee
       Housing Act.
       Manufactured Housing
       Government Code Section 65852.3 requires that manufactured homes and
       manufactured home subdivisions be permitted and regulated in the same manner as
       conventional or stick-built structures. These regulations include, but are not limited
       to, building setback standards, side and rear yard requirements, standards for
       enclosures, access and vehicle parking, aesthetic requirements, and minimum
       square footage requirements.

       The City of Westmorland zoning ordinance will be amended to comply with this
       requirement.
IV.    ECONOMIC AND EMPLOYMENT PROFILE
       EMPLOYMENT CHARACTERISTICS
       Employment trends identify the prevalence of increasing or decreasing income levels
       and unemployment rates, thus reflecting housing affordability. The availability of
       employment opportunities within city limits also affect the populations as people move
       to locations where they can find jobs.
       PRIMARY EMPLOYMENT SECTORS
       As with many cities in Imperial County, Westmorland’s economic base is primarily
       derived from agriculture and agricultural related industries. This accounts for 27.2% of
       the City’s labor force. Although lower than the County’s 37%, it is still a major indicator
       of the community’s economic situation. Technical, sales and administrative support
       occupations comprise 24.6% of the City’s labor force is employed as operators,
       fabricators, assemblers, and inspectors.
       The predominance of agricultural and the lack of employment availability in the City of
       Westmorland are reflective of the travel time to work. According to the 2000 Census,
       28.7% of the labor force worked within the City of Westmorland and 18.1% spent more
       than 30 minutes commuting to work. Those working outside city limits are prone to
       relocating to where the jobs are and where the availability of affordable housing may
       be greater.
       In an effort to improve the economic base and to improve Westmorland’s overall well
       being, the City is actively recruiting major employers. The City has initiated a Business
       Loan Assistance Program through the State Economic Development Block Grant. Low
       interest loans are available to businesses for the creation of jobs. To date, 8 full- time
       equivalent jobs have been created as result of this program. The jobs created do not
       necessarily have to be filled by residents of Westmorland, so there exists a possibility
       of population increase.
       UNEMPLOYMENT
       As with many cities in the Imperial Valley, unemployment is one of the biggest
       concerns in the City of Westmorland. Imperial County as a whole has a significantly
       higher unemployment rate than the rest of the State and the Nation. In 1997, the

                                                               City of Westmorland 2007 - 2013 Housing Element
          County’s unemployment rate was 26.5%1 which is more than four times the State
          unemployment rate (6.3%2).
          That is more than five times the Nation’s unemployment rate 4.7%3). The problem of
          unemployment is further compounded by seasonal employment due to the cyclical
          nature of the agricultural industry.
V.        HOUSING AVAILABILITY/ AFFORDABILITY
          In June 1998, The City of Westmorland, through a private consulting firm, undertook a
          housing condition survey of all the residential units within city limits. The results of this
          survey, along with data from the 1990 US Census were used to determine the
          availability and affordability of existing housing stock.
          HOUSING STOCK
          The housing condition survey resulted in an actual count of 648 residential units 4 in the
          City, compared to the 432 housing units reported by the 1990 US Census. This
          suggests an increase in the number of residential units in the past 8 years, but the
          survey only identified 159 newly constructed homes. The discrepancy may be
          attributed to the Census’s exclusion of 2 motels converted into apartment complexes
          and the use of mobile homes/travel trailers and other secondary dwelling units as
          separate dwelling units.
          The survey also revealed that 20% of the residential units are subsidized housing: 62
          units are operated by the Imperial Valley Housing Authority (IVHA) and another 68
          units (the Arredondo apartments) are privately owned subsidized housing.
          Westmorland’s housing stock is predominantly single-family residences, accounting for
          63% of the units in the City. An additional 22% of the dwelling units are multi-family
          residences, which includes two motel conversions, the IVHA units, a senior housing
          complex and the Arredondo apartments. The remaining 11% are residences
          comprising between 2 and 4 unit complexes.
          HOUSING CONDITIONS
          Throughout a period of four months beginning in June 1998, all residential units were
          inventoried and evaluated based on guidelines set forth by the State of California

  Every attempt was made to count all residential units but there may be some that were overlooked. Units that are not
easily identified and consequently not counted may include second units that are attached to single family homes,
structures intended primarily for non-residential use which may contain housing units such as caretaker’s facilities.

        Department of Housing and Urban Development: each residence was assigned a
        numerical value based on the condition of the foundation, roofing, siding/stucco,
        windows and electrical systems.
        The numerical value was used to determine whether a residence was in sound
        condition or needed minor, moderate or substantial repair, or was dilapidated. The
        primary purpose of the housing condition survey was to assess and identify residential
        units needing repair. Of the entire housing stock, only 7.5% were considered
        dilapidated or needed substantial repairs.
        COST OF HOUSING/OVERPAYMENT
        According to the 2000 US Census, the median housing value in Westmorland is
        $60,800 and the median gross rent is $306. This is relatively lower than the County’s
        median housing value of $72,100 and the median gross rent of $394. This would
        indicate that although housing costs are low, they are not necessarily affordable when
        compared with household incomes. The cost of housing is actually high and many
        households are overpaying.
        Overpayment occurs when a household devotes more than 30% of their income
        towards housing costs thereby leaving limited funds available for food, clothing, and
        healthcare. According to the 1990 US Census, overpayment only occurred in 24.7% of
        all the households. However, among households with income less than $20,000,
        45.7% were overpaying. Furthermore, the proportion of overpayment for renter-
        occupied households with incomes less than $20,000 is even greater at 51.6%.

        OVERCROWDING
        The California Department of Finance shows that there was an average of 3.41
        persons per household in 2000. The 2000 Census shows that a majority (37.7%) of the
        housing units have three bedrooms and a significant portion (28.1%) of the residences
        have two bedrooms. Dwelling units with four or more bedrooms represent only 17.6%
        of the existing housing stock and those residences with only one or no bedrooms
        account for 24.7%.
        With the high incidence of larger family households of 4 or more persons, this lack of
        larger size housing may be indicative of overcrowding. There were 81 households
        (19.9%) with more than one person per room. Out of 81 overcrowded households, 32
        (39.5%) households were owner-occupied, while 49 (60.5%) were renter-occupied.
        HOUSING VACANCY
        According to the State Department of Finance, the vacancy rate in the City of
        Westmorland for 1999 was 6.3%. This was a slight increase from the 1994 vacancy
        rate of 5.72%. The Department of Finance further shows that there are 42 unoccupied
        housing units, but this does not necessarily indicate housing availability. The housing
        conditions survey identified at least 10 dilapidated, uninhabitable homes, which may
        have been included in the Department of Finance’s estimate of vacant housing units.
        Furthermore, there are indeed several new homes that have remained vacant for an
        extended period of time, but many of these homes are higher priced and are not
        necessarily available to low income families.

         AT RISK HOUSING
         There are no government assisted rental properties in the City of Westmorland
         that may be at risk of opting out of programs that keep them affordable to very low
         and low income households over the Housing Element Period (2007 - 2013) and
         for the subsequent five years (2018). Generally, the inventory consists of USDA
         Section 515; State tax credits and 4% tax exempt bonds, State of California Small
         Cities HOME Program, and public housing projects. The City Redevelopment
         Agency has never had sufficient funds to contribute to housing production. Target
         levels include the very low, low, and moderate income groups.

the combined projects are now known as Imperial County Housing Partners and include a complex in
Calipatria which was part of the application for the Preservation funding that provided rehabilitation funds.

       Cost Analysis
       Even though there are no ―at-risk‖ units in the City of Westmorland for this housing
       element update period, costs have been determined for both rehabilitation and
       new construction.
       Rehabilitation
       The factors used to analyze the cost of unit preservation include per unit cost of
       acquisition, rehabilitation, and financing costs. These figures are estimates since
       actual costs will depend on condition, size, location, existing financing and
       the availability of financing. Local developers have provided the following
       information.

                  Rehabilitation                                    $25,000
                 Financing/Other                                    $20,000
           TOTAL COST PER UNIT                                      $165,000
       New Construction/Replacement
       The following cost estimates are estimates based on recent new apartment
       construction in Westmorland. These are 2004 actual costs on an $8.7-Million
       Dollar project. Future cost will be subject to variables such as the number of
       units, location, density, unit sizes, on and off-site improvements, and the cost of new
       financing.

       RESIDENTIAL ZONING AND DENSITY
       The City of Westmorland presents a dichotomy of demand versus availability of vacant
       land. Located along State Route 86 in northern Imperial County it is an agricultural
       community at the ―front door‖ of the fertile Imperial Valley. It is a small community and

                                                 City of Westmorland 2007 - 2013 Housing Element
       has remained that way as retail/commercial/governmental development has taken place
       in the cities and communities to the south closer to the International border between the
       United States and Mexico.
       Demand for housing has been small, actual population growth is about 30 persons a
       year and commercial development has reflected this low growth rate. The City’s
       primary advantage is being the first developed community south of the Salton Sea area,
       and that advantage is expressed in the demand for transit and tourists services such as
       gasoline, auto and truck service, and fast food outlets.
       The City is surrounded by large amounts of low cost, easily developed vacant land;
       however, a majority is in not in the incorporated boundaries of the City of Westmorland.
       The most easily developed sites are in the current Sphere of Influence and two of the
       larger sites have been approved for annexation by the Local Agency Formation
       Commission (LAFCO).
       As a result of the minimum demand for residential development, the City of
       Westmorland Zoning Ordinance is out-of-date and does not address the need for all
       types and densities of housing. One of the primary Housing Element Goals will be the
       preparation of a new Zoning Ordinance that will accommodate all levels, types, and
       densities.
       The housing industry has generally responded to market demand and the City meets
       regularly with both non-profit and market rate developers and lenders. This resulted
       in the development of a 65-unit family affordable apartment complex in 2004 which
       essentially doubled the number of units available for low and very low income
       households. The City welcomes residential development and will continue to do so.
       At the present time there are only three residential zones:
       R-1 – for single family homes at up to 6 units per acre
       R-2 – for duplex units and second units on the same site up to 15 units per acre
       R-4 – for multifamily developments up to 23 units per acre and mobile home
       parks with a conditional use permit (CUP)
       The only other zone that permits residential development is Open Space (OS)
       which allows one unit per 10 acres.
       The City’s Zoning Ordinance does not currently recognize the potential for infill
       construction. The City does, however, have 7.3 acres of small-lot vacant land
       throughout the City (see Table 14). The minimum lot size in the City varies by
       zone from 6,000 in R-1 zones to as small as 2,000 sf in the R-2 zone. At the
       time of the zoning ordinance update, the City Council will consider allowing

       multifamily development on lots with minimum lot sizes of 1,000 square feet in the
       downtown area. This makes it possible to build units at maximum density on infill lots
       without requiring the assembling of large parcels of property. Since most of
       these lots are in the downtown area, the policy could specifically designate a
       ―downtown density‖ program.
       The City’s RHNA for the 2007-2013 housing element periods is for 256 units. The
       City will be able to develop a new zoning ordinance and incorporate other identified
       programs and policies long before 2013, and will provide the required annual update
       to HCD to show progress.

       To conform to housing element law that requires sites for emergency shelters,
       transitional housing, and supportive housing, the City of Westmorland will be required
       to update the zoning ordinance within one year of the date of housing element
       adoption (anticipated February 18, 2009). Some of the amendments to be included
       are as follows:
        (1) the development of the R-3 zone as a medium density zone to accommodate
             developments from 15 du/ac up to 23 du/ac;
        (2) suspend (for future use) the R-4 zone;
        (3) removal of the mobile home overlay from the R-4 zone and the development of a
             MH (mobile home) overlay zone with appropriate allowances and development
             guidelines that will be consistent with Section 65852.7 of the Government
             Code, to allow mobile home parks and subdivisions on all land designated by
             the General Plan for residential use;
        (4) development of a planned unit development (PUD) overlay which can be used in
             any zone to provide for various densities and uses within a defined specific area;
             and
        (5) R-E, Residential Estate Zone that will designate specific areas for residential
             development that will permit limited livestock (horses and 4-H program livestock).
        The following zones and densities, or similar zones and densities will be drafted as
        part of the zoning ordinance update.

       As noted earlier, the City of Westmorland will ensure its zoning does not constrain
       the ability for emergency shelters and transitional housing to locate in the City.
       Based on a survey of available land and areas where transportation and other
       services could reasonably be expected to be extended in the future, it was
       determined that emergency shelters could be accommodated in the Industrial (I)
       zone.
       The City’s development standards are applicable to residential zoning districts.
       Development standards include, but are not limited to, building height, yard setbacks,
       lot area, site plan review, parking space requirements and parkland
       requirements. These requirements were adopted through the public hearing
       process and reflect the minimum standards thought necessary for protection of the
       public.
       The City has adopted a local subdivision ordinance that implements the
       requirements of the State of California Subdivision Map Act. This ordinance sets
       forth the rules and requirements for the division of real property. The City has limited
       discretion when acting on a subdivision map. Other than implementing the State Map
       Act requirements, the City primarily insures that the map is in compliance with the
       conditions of the California Environmental Quality Act, and that the map is consistent
       with the General Plan and zoning.
       Density Bonus
        When a developer proposes a housing development, state law requires that the
       City provide incentives for the production of low-income housing. A density bonus
       agreement between the developer and City is used to set forth the incentives to
       be offered by the City and the requirements of the developer. The City will
       adopt a density bonus ordinance in compliance with Gover nment Code
       Section 65915.

       Other Provisions
       (1) The City allows second dwelling units on owner-occupied lots with approval by the
            Planning Commission Board.
       (2) Group homes for six or fewer persons are permitted within a residential zone.
            The City follows state law with respect to group homes of seven or more people
            and they are permitted in all commercial zones and in residential zones with a
            CUP approved by the Planning Commission. As the living situation becomes
            more institutional in nature, the City makes sure that the facility is ADA compliant
            and the fire department has to conduct inspections.
       AVAILABLE RESIDENTIALLY ZONED LAND
       The vacant land survey for the City of Westmorland was completed in two separate
       surveys: (1) In-fill lots in the downtown area and (2) large lot vacant land anywhere
       in the incorporated boundaries and in the adopted sphere of influence.
       “In-Fill” Vacant Residential
       The first survey looked at in-fill residential sites which would be suitable for the
       development of single family homes targeting moderate to above moderate income
       households. The City’s 2007-2013 RHNA is for 40 Moderate and 113 Above
       Moderate Income Units, for a total of 153 units.
       Currently, 3.17 acres of in-fill vacant land is zoned R-1. At seven dwelling units per
       acre, 21 units can be accommodated. In addition there is 4.18 acres zoned R-2
       which permits up to 20 dwelling units per acre; 80 units can be accommodated.
       However, some of the sites included in the vacant land inventory, particularly some of
       the R-2 sites, are smaller sites with less than one acre and may not be suitable for
       dense development. Therefore, the City will adopt a housing element program that
       will encourage lot consolidation.
       All in-fill parcels identified in Table 14 have immediate access to land development
       utilities, infrastructure and services; none are subject to environmental concerns and
       building permits for residential units can be issued immediately. Map appended as
       Attachment 2.

       “Large Lot” Vacant Residential
       The second survey identified and analyzed all vacant residential lots just outside the
       downtown area. This includes some currently within the incorporated boundaries of
       the City of Westmorland, some recently annexed, some with annexation approval
       pending in February 2009 and, two lots that have been previously identified for
       annexation during 2010.
        All vacant residential sites identified within the City of Westmorland are served by
       sewer, water, gas, and electricity and telephone lines and have an immediate
       development potential. The City sphere of influence extends out in all directions from
       the city limits, generally the northern boundary is at Bannister Road to the north; the
       southern boundary is ½ mile south of Baughman Road; it extends to Highway 86 and
       Dean Road to the east; and to Kingsley Road on the west.
       There are approximately 272 acres of land within the incorporated boundaries of
       Westmorland and an additional 1,288 acres in the Sphere of Influence.
       Realistic Development Capacity
       Government Code Section 65583.2(c) requires, as part of the analysis of available
       sites, that a local government demonstrates the projected residential development
       capacity of the sites identified in the housing element can realistically be achieved.
       Based on the information provided in subdivision (b), a city or county shall determine
       whether each site in the inventory can accommodate some portion of its share of the
       regional housing need by income level during the planning period, as determined
       pursuant to Section 65584. The number of units calculated shall be adjusted as
       necessary, based on the land use controls and site improvements requirement
       identified in paragraph (4) of subdivision (a) of Section 65583.
       Of the 736 units that ―could‖ be constructed in Westmorland under current zoning,
       160 units are suitable for very low or low income housing.

                                               City of Westmorland 2007 - 2013 Housing Element
       During the public hearings for this housing element, the City Planning
       Commission and City Council indicated they would initiate zone changes to
       approximately ten acres of R-1 land currently in the City.
       The two parcels of land are at the corner of Seventh Street and ―B‖ Street.
       During the update of the City zoning ordinance, the two sites can be up -zoned
       to R-3 (up to 23 units to the acre) the sites would accommodate 200 low and
       very low income units. The current RHNA for low and very low is 103 units.
       The second most feasible site for low-income development is the eight acre site in
       the east-central area of the City south of Highway 86 west of Dean Road, adjacent to
       the school. When annexation is initiated in late 2009 or early 2010, the site will be
       pre-zoned R-3. Even though that zone would permit 176 units, a realistic capacity is
       about 80 units to provide for more than adequate set-back from the State Highway.
       Specific density and timing will be subject to market/feasibility demand. Its location
       adjacent to the school and ball fields makes it a good location for a family project.
       The demand for moderate and above moderate homes can most feasibly be
       met by the residential development planned in the west-central portion of the
       City, just north of and adjacent to the large planned Gateway Truck Stop/Tourist
       Center. That Center will be located on the northwest corner of Martin Street and
       Highway 86 and is the subject of an Over-The-Counter Grant application pending
       submittal by the City. This is also the site for which the annexation will be completed
       in spring 2009 and the pre-zoning for nine of the 18 acres is to the City’s current R-2
       zone, which will permit up to 15 dwelling units per acre or a total of 135 units. The
       remaining 9 acres will be designated Commercial.
       Remaining development potential varies based on the geographical location of land.
       Realistic Capacity: While it is permissible for a developer to build to the density
       allowed by the zoning district, the most recent project is the Westmorland Family
       Apartments which was developed at 15 units to the acre. This is consistent with
       other apartment complexes in the small rural City of Westmorland. With a regular
       density of 23 dwelling units to the acre, current projects are being developed at about
       65 percent of capacity.
       Environmental Concerns: developable land in the City of Westmorland is fairly free
       from significant environmental concerns: the land is flat, there are no known water
       courses or rivers in the City, and most of the vacant land has always been vacant so
       there are few man-made obstacles. In addition, during 1999-2000 the City received
       funding to up-grade both the water and waste-water facilities and there is sufficient
       capacity of both for build-out of the current boundaries and sphere of influence,
       including the entire RHNA.

       Status of Annexation: There are three sites pending annexation approval of LAFCo
       or application by the City.
       1.       18 acres at the northeast corner of State Route 86 and Martin Road,
                mentioned above as nine acres of Commercial and nine acres of R-2. It is the
                intent of the developer to build garden-homes for sale to moderate and above
                moderate income households. The annexation has been heard at the Imperial
                County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCo) and has received a
                conditional approval. It is anticipated that the annexation will be completed in
                late spring or early summer 2009.
       2.       8 acres at the southwest corner of State Route 86 and Dean Road mentioned
                above as the good future site for affordable housing. The site is surrounded
                on the north, east, and west by incorporated land; it is adjacent to the City’s
                elementary school and ball fields; and, is in a residential area. The City has
                not yet initiated annexation procedures, but plans to do so in early 2010.
       3.       80 acre site at the southwest corner of Baughman Road (aka Weston Avenue)
                and Center Street for which annexation proceedings were initiated by the
                property owner during 2008. It is anticipated that the annexation will be
                completed sometime in mid-2009. The current plans are to zone the property
                R-1, but the City Council would consider pre-zoning a portion R-2 or R-3.

       PUBLIC FACILITIES AND SERVICES
       Adequate levels of service for infrastructure and other public services is an important
       factor in identifying sites available for housing development. In September 1997, a
       Water Distribution System Master Plan was developed to identify specific
       improvements needed to meet future development of the City. The Plan projected a
       population of 8,215 residents by the year 2035, including the ultimate annexation and
       build-out of the current Sphere of Influence. The improvements to both the water and
       waste water systems were completed in 2000.
       ENERGY CONSERVATION
       The cost of energy is a major concern because of the extreme high temperatures
       experienced in desert climates. In order to maximize energy efficiency, Title 24 of the
       California Code of Regulations requires energy calculation for all new construction.
       This addresses such items as insulation values, sizes of heating and cooling systems,
       energy consumptions, etc.
       In older homes, energy costs are one of the largest household expenses. Upgrading
       insulation, weather stripping and other weather protection measures can significantly
       reduce energy expenses thereby increasing a household’s available income. However,
       the consolidated cost of energy improvements is out of reach for most low-income
       households. The City makes loans and grants available to low-income-qualified
       households for energy-efficiency improvements. Improvements done under the
       program include:
                Dual glazed windows;
                Fluorescent lights;
                Insulation blanketing for water heaters;
                Night set-back type thermostat for heating, ventilation and air conditioning
                (HVAC) systems;
                Installation of energy conserving HVAC systems; and
                R-30 insulation in ceilings, R-19 insulation in exterior walls and R-30 insulation
                in raised floors.
VI.    HOUSING NEEDS
       Westmorland must target its housing programs to those exhibiting the greatest need so
       that adequate housing is available for all segments of the community. To that extent,
       the City recognizes the importance of housing for low and very low-income groups,
       especially those special needs group discussed previously. The following section
       outlines the existing and projected needs of the City of Westmorland based on
       population and employment trends.

                                               City of Westmorland 2007 - 2013 Housing Element
       LOCAL HOUSING NEEDS
       The Housing Conditions Survey (discussed in a previous section) shows that there is a
       high incidence of substandard housing that there is need for rehabilitation programs to
       preserve the existing housing stock. Nearly 41% of all the housing stock needs varying
       degrees of rehabilitation and 7.5% were dilapidated.
       The demand for housing is expected to increase as economic development and job
       creation programs begin to yield results. There is currently very little employment base
       in the City of Westmorland. However, there exists a great potential for an increase in
       the availability of jobs because of the City’s strategic location along State Highway 86,
       a major thoroughfare connecting Imperial Valley to Los Angeles and Riverside
       Counties. The proposed Gateway Project and the possible Solar Farm on the west
       side of the City will bring in several hundred jobs. Westmorland’s existing housing
       stock will not be able to accommodate any significant increase in demand for new
       housing; however, as noted, above, there is sufficient zone land in the City to
       accommodate over 730 units.
       REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS
       The City must also address its ―fair share‖ of the region housing needs as delineated in
       SCAGs regional housing needs assessment (RHNA). Due to lack of funding, however,
       the latest RHNA has only been recently released and spans over a seven and a half
       year period. The RHNA takes into account unmet housing needs and anticipated
       housing demand generated by employment growth and population increase. A major
       function of the RHNA is to assure a fair distribution of housing among cities, sub
       regions, and counties. The RHNA also assures a mix of newly built housing that is
       affordable to low and moderate-income households is equitably shared and located in
       proximity to jobs. As shown in the following table, Westmorland’s fair share of the
       regional housing is 256 units to be planned for by 2013. This number can easily be
       accommodated with the current land available, subject to a zone change for high
       density low income units. Objectives and programs have been developed to ensure
       the properly zoned land will be available by February 2010.

       GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
       Policies enacted by the City have a significant impact on the maintenance,
       improvement and development of all types of housing. Many of these policies are
       intended to improve the overall quality of housing, but land use controls, building and
       zoning codes, exaction fees, and permit procedures, availability of infrastructure, and
       State and Federal funding programs may sometimes act as constraints in housing
       development.
       General Plan
       Westmorland’s General Plan was adopted in 1999 and City Council has made the
       commitment to a total update as funding becomes available. Amendments to the
       General Plan have taken place as necessary to accommodate annexations. Due to
       legislated timing, the housing element will be adopted as an amendment to the
       General Plan and incorporated at the appropriate time.
       While, as written, the General Plan appears to be a constraint to housing development,
       the City has been responsive to all requests to amend the general plan to
       accommodate new annexations and has not denied any request submitted to them.
       Land Use Controls and Zoning Ordinance
       It is recognized that the City of Westmorland zoning ordinance is out-of-date and is
       required to be updated to include various land use requirements previously identified in
       this document. Zoning regulations are designed to protect and promote the health,
       safety, and general welfare of residents as well as implement the policies of the
       General Plan. It also serves to preserve the character and integrity of existing
       neighborhoods.
       At the same time, Government Code Section 65583(a) requires ―An analysis of
       potential and actual governmental constraints upon the maintenance, improvement,
       or development of housing for all income levels, including land use controls,‖
                Density: the City zoning ordinance allows up to 23 units per acre in the R-4
                zone. This is not a constraint on the development of affordable housing.
                Parking Requirements: 1.5 on-site spaces per unit do not constitute a
                constraint to affordable housing.
                Lot Coverage: The current standard for all residential zones is a maximum
                50% coverage. This could pose a constraint to multifamily development on
                assembled downtown lots or for affordable housing. A program will be
                developed to provide for varying lot coverage restrictions based on zone.
                Height Limits: The zoning ordinance allows a maximum of 35 feet height or
                three stories. This does not present a constraint to housing development.

                Lot Size Requirements vary by zoning district and are not a constraint to
                housing development.
                There are no Unit Size Requirements in the Westmorland zoning ordinance.
                There are no Floor Area Ratios in the Westmorland zoning ordinance.
                Set Backs required in all zones do not constitute a constraint to housing
                development.
                The Westmorland zoning ordinance does not include open space
                requirements.
                There are no growth controls identified in the City of Westmorland.
       The following table summarizes the property development standards for the various
       residential zoning designations.

       Permit Procedures
       Government Code Section 65583(a) requires ―An analysis of potential and actual
       governmental constraints upon the maintenance, improvement, or development of
       housing for all income levels, including local processing and permit procedures…‖
       The City of Westmorland has clear development procedures for single family and
       multifamily residential development in the R-1, R-2, and R-4 zones. There are
       ministerial procedures for multifamily uses in multifamily zones – a CUP is not
       required.

       The few permit requests have been processed in a timely manner. The City does not
       have layered reviews nor does it have separate design review, architectural, or
       landscape committees.
       The City of Westmorland has a one-stop front counter to expedite permit processing.
       All necessary City forms and meetings with decision-making personnel are available
       on request. The City encourages concurrent permit processing and expedites
       requests for affordable housing. Upon completion of the necessary forms, a
       developer meets with the City’s building official and planner. A site visit is planned
       and completed and if the proposal meets specific criteria, the building official can
       issue the appropriate permits. Projects requiring environmental review, zone
       changes or general plan amendments are processed through the City Planning
       Commission in compliance with legislative review periods.
       The primary constraint is that the City does not have the programs, policies, and
       procedures in place to accommodate the permitted uses such as mobile homes,
       emergency shelters, transitional housing, and other residential uses identified in this
       report. This constraint will be eliminated by the development of an updated zoning
       ordinance and appropriate general plan amendments.
       Both zoning and building permit applications for single-family developments can
       typically be processed in less than two months. This is comparable to permit
       processing times in other cities throughout Imperial County and therefore does not
       severely constrain housing affordability. The City of Westmorland encourages
       development by streamlining development processes whenever possible. The City has
       the option of waiving Planning Permit Fees for multifamily residential development.
       The City has not adopted a second unit ordinance but approves and allows the
       creation of second units pursuant to Code of California Regulations (CCR) 65852.1 et
       seq. This is evident in the number of second dwelling units identified in the Housing
       Conditions Survey. Furthermore, the Zoning Ordinance has neither provisions for
       density bonuses nor incentives for low-income housing or homeless shelters as
       required by Article 10.6 commencing with 65583 CCR. The updated Zoning Ordinance
       should rectify these issues.
       Policies, procedures, and goals will be included in this document to address these
       constraints and the City zoning ordinance will be completely revised during 2009.
       Building Code and Enforcement
       Government Code Section 65583(a) requires ―An analysis of potential and actual
       governmental constraints upon the maintenance, improvement, or development of
       housing for all income levels, building codes and their enforcement …‖

       The City of Westmorland has not yet adopted the ICC 2006 International Building
       Code, which is planned to be updated in March 2009. The City will include the adoption
       of that code as part of the zoning ordinance update planned for 2009. The ICC Code
       is the minimum requirement necessary to protect the public health, safety and general
       welfare. The City does not have a municipal-sponsored housing rehabilitation program
       any rehabilitation is subject to the provisions of the building permit and inspections by
       the City’s Building Official.
       There are no code enforcement officers in the City of Westmorland. New construction,
       housing rehabilitation, and complaints pertaining to structures are inspected by the
       Building Official/Building Inspector. Failures to comply with the directives of the City
       inspectors are adjudicated through civil process. Concerns and complaints about fire
       hazards are referred to the City Fire Chief.
       The City of Westmorland will develop and adopt universal design elements that
       address limited lifting or flexibility (such as rill-in showers and grab bars), limited
       mobility (such as push/pull lever faucets, wide swing hinges, lower level light and
       electrical switches; lower height counters); and limited vision (such as additional
       lighting and noise activated lighting, door bells, and safety equipment).
       Site Improvements
       At the same time, Government Code Section 65583(a) requires ―An analysis of
       potential and actual governmental constraints upon the maintenance, improvement,
       or development of housing for all income levels, including site improvements,‖
       The City does not have an adopted code or ordinance setting forth on-site and off-
       site improvements, but replies on past approval and negotiations with the developer.
       The last two new subdivision annexations had ―typical‖ 60 foot right-of-way on
       residential streets, which would provide for 40 feet of paved roadway, 6 inches of
       curb and 4.5 feet of sidewalk, and a 5 foot right-of-way area for utilities which can be
       landscaped.
       These requirements are standard for Imperial County development and are not a
       constraint to housing development.
       The City will be determining the date and financing for a complete up-date of the
       General Plan and will include on-site and off-site improvements in the appropriate
       element and then reflect them in the updated zoning ordinance.
       The availability of off-site and on-site improvements such as streets, curbs, gutters,
       sidewalks, water lines and wastewater lines can affect the cost of residential
       development. The cost of infrastructure is typically borne by the developer and thus
       affects housing affordability. The City upgraded its water and wastewater facilities to

       comply with new Federal regulations to provide adequate service to all sites in the City
       of Westmorland. In the past, the City has utilized various funding mechanisms to assist
       any residential development. The City also has the option if waiving the Development
       Impact Fee related to infrastructure.
       Fees and Exactions
       Fees and exactions are typically imposed upon developers to offset the cost of
       processing permits and providing governmental services. The developer, in turn,
       offsets these costs by increasing the prices on housing units. Fees and exactions in
       the City of Westmorland are reasonable and relatively lower than some of the
       surrounding communities. Thus, the impact on housing affordability is minimal, if any.
       The following table summarizes the fee schedule for residential developments in the
       City of Westmorland.

                                                City of Westmorland 2007 - 2013 Housing Element
       State and Federal Funding
       Although not necessarily a constraint, the lack of State and Federal funding can have a
       significant impact on the quality and availability of affordable housing. State and
       Federal funds continue to be widely used in the community to assist lower-income
       households with decent housing. The amount of public funds has been steadily
       decreasing over the past several years. The City of Westmorland relies heavily on
       these funds, particularly the State Small Cities Community Development Block Grant
       Program. The lack of public funding or the decrease in funding levels can severely
       constrain the production or retention of affordable housing within the next seven years.
       The City will continue to pursue State and Federal funds, but to circumvent the
       problem of decreasing funds; the City should seek private funding sources while
       continuing joint ventures with IVHA and USDA. Furthermore, the City can utilize self-
       sustaining mechanisms of the revolving loan fund-to-fund housing programs.
       Constraints on Housing for Persons with Disabilities
       The City of Westmorland does not have an updated zoning ordinance and the current
       ordinance does not address (1) constraints for persons with disabilities, (2) definitions,
       (3) reasonable accommodation procedures, (4) densities for residential care facilities,
       and (5) site planning or (6) parking requirements to accommodate persons with
       disabilities.
       The City will be updating the zoning ordinance during 2009. These documents will
       ddevelop formal procedures for reasonable accommodation for housing for persons
       with disabilities in accordance with fair housing and disability laws. Amend the City’s
       Municipal Code to provide for clear rules, policies, and procedures, for reasonable
       accommodation in order to promote equal access to housing.
       Policies and procedures will be ministerial and include but not be limited to identifying
       who may request a reasonable accommodation (i.e., persons with disabilities, family-
       members, landlords, etc.), timeframes for decision-making, and provision for relief
       from the various land-uses, zoning, or building regulations that may constrain the
       housing for persons of disabilities.      The City can take steps to ensure that the
       requested accommodation would not impose an undue financial or administrative
       burden on the City.
       The City of Westmorland is small but welcoming. There are three full-time staff
       persons and another part-time consultant who doubles as the City Building
       Official/Inspector and City Planner. Whenever any development project is proposed,
       staff members meet with the applicant and applicable provisions and requirements are
       decided upon and encoded in the appropriate specific document.

                                                 City of Westmorland 2007 - 2013 Housing Element
       The City has been complying with required provisions by doing the ―right thing‖ but now
       recognize that they must codify, prepare, advertise, publish, and enforce state
       mandated requirements.
       Both State and federal laws have defined ―family‖ as one or more persons occupying
       one dwelling unit and living together as a single housekeeping unit.                  This
       accommodates different household types including unrelated persons living together.
       This definition does not constrain the development and rehabilitation of housing for
       persons with disabilities.
       The federal Fair Housing Act (FHA) and the California Fair Employment and Housing
       Act (FEHA) impose an affirmative duty on local governments to make reasonable
       accommodations in their zoning laws and other land use regulations and practices
       when such accommodations ―may be necessary to afford‖ disabled persons ―an equal
       opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.‖ (42 U.S.C. Section 3604(f) (3) (B) and
       Government Code Section 12927(c) (1), 12955(1).)
       Further, the City of Westmorland recognizes that mobility impaired individuals require
       special housing or structural needs. These include, but are not limited to, wheelchair
       ramps, widened doorways, grab bars, and access ramps. The City will establish
       procedures and policies to consider and approve such requests at the staff level and
       will create a minor modification process to streamline approval process.
       NON-GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
       Financing
       The market interest rate if a significant factor in attaining affordable housing. A typical
       interest rate of 12% would make it difficult for even moderate and upper income
       households to afford homeownership. However, over the last two or three years,
       mortgage interest rates have been between 6% and 7% which significantly increases
       the number of persons who may qualify for a loan. However, concurrent with the lower
       interest rates, the cost of single family homes has been increasing. This makes it hard
       for lower income households to qualify for conventional. Local governments have no
       control over interest rates and market rate housing costs determined by the market and
       national policies and economic conditions. However, the City of Westmorland can
       identify, promote and implement government insured loan programs to increase
       homeownership opportunities for lower income households or implement subsidy
       programs. Such programs could reduce down-payment requirements to less than the
       10%-20% required through conventional financing.
       The City can also offer interest write-downs through State Programs or the
       redevelopment agency to extend the availability of affordable housing. The USDA RDA

       Section 502 Program provides Federal subsidies to bring the effective interest rate
       down to as low as 1%.
       Land and Land Cost
       The cost of raw, undeveloped land has a direct correlation of a new home. As
       mentioned in previous sections, there is approximately 7.8 acres of vacant sites
       available for residential use. The market value of undeveloped land has been relatively
       stable within the past several years and does not appear to be a constraint on the
       construction of affordable housing. However, as an incentive to promote private
       development of all forms of housing, especially low-income housing, the City along
       with the Rural Development Agency could utilize funding for land write-downs. Sites
       can be acquired at market value and sold to private developers, through write-downs,
       at a lower cost.
       Construction Costs
       The single largest cost in housing production is the cost of building materials and
       actual construction. This accounts for approximately 40%-50% of the sales prices of
       new homes. Because of the unavailability of materials, construction costs are
       constantly fluctuating but typically range from $45-$60 per square foot for low to
       moderately priced new single family homes.
       Multifamily construction exceeding 15 units begin at $42 per square foot and decrease
       as the number of units increase based on the economy of scale. Construction costs for
       single-family residences can be reduced with the use of pre-manufactured homes such
       as modular homes or mobile. Lower housing costs can be further achieved by reducing
       amenities and quality of building materials without compromising the safety and
       structural integrity of the house.
       Quantified Objectives
       The Quantified Objectives for the City of Westmorland for the period 2007 – 2013
       reflect the actual number of housings the City believes can be developed or
       rehabilitated over the housing element period.

                      persons and should not impose limitations on the number of persons
                      that may constitute a family. Include a definition of ―family‖ in the
                      emergency ordinance to further accommodate persons with disabilities.
                      That definition will read ―A family is one or more persons occupying one
                      dwelling unit and living together as a single housekeeping unit.‖

                      Authority.
                      Program H-3-4-2: At the time any affordable housing project is
                      approved for development, that approval will be conditioned upon the

CITIZEN PARTICIPATION
1.     The jurisdiction must make a diligent effort to include all economic segments of the
       community and/or their representatives in the development and update of the
       housing element.
       A copy of the housing element workshop agenda was posted in all the City’s regular
       places plus a copy was provided (1) to the management of all multifamily complexes
       with a request they post it in the office; (2) to all public utilities or service providers;
       and (3) to senior centers, youth centers, and community centers.
       A total of 28 persons were in the audience during the housing element workshop held
       on January 7, 2009. There were some general questions about the process but only
       one substantial question. That question was from the developer of the proposed
       Gateway project and he needed a clarification that the housing being proposed on
       his site was single family for sale to moderate and above moderate income

       households. The City Council assured him that was their understanding. A copy of
       the attendance sheet is appended as Attachment #5.
       Copies of the Final Draft of the housing element were sent to the County of Imperial,
       the City of El Centro, the City of Brawley, and the Imperial Valley Housing Authority
       requesting their comments and inviting them to participate in public meetings or
       workshops.
       A notice of the intent to adopt the housing element on February 18, 2009 was
       included in the January water bills of all 400+ residences in the City. Attachment 6.
2.     The element should clearly describe how public participation was encouraged (types
       of outreach, meetings, etc.) throughout the development and implementation of the
       housing element process.
       The City of Westmorland is a small community (2,372 persons); members of the
       Planning Commission and City Council were requested to personally advise their
       neighbors, family, friends, and acquaintances about the availability of the Public
       Review Draft.
       The City conducted one public workshop; one public meeting to adopt the
       environmental documents (CEQA); and one public meeting to adopt the housing
       element. All meetings and workshops were posted and advertised.
3.     Describe who was invited to participate, which group’s actually participated, general
       comments received and how comments were incorporated into the housing element.
       Everyone in the City was invited to attend the workshop and public meetings.
       Comments received are incorporated into the document as Attachment 7; however,
       comments that affect the content and which were adopted by the City Council were
       incorporated into the appropriate section of the element.
4.     Describe any ongoing efforts to engage the public and stakeholders in the
       implementation of the housing element.
       Westmorland will initiate periodic workshops to evaluate the implementation of housing
       programs. These workshops will include presentations to various local community
       groups. Encourage the continuance of the annual public hearing about housing issues
       in Westmorland.
       The initial workshops will be associated with the updating and amendment to the City’s
       zoning ordinance (see Program A-2) prior to the first anniversary of the adoption of the
       housing element...
