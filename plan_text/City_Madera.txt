                    CHAPTER 1.0:
                    INTRODUCTION AND
                    VISION
                    This General Plan represents the product of
                    years of efforts on the part of residents and
                    businesses in the community working to main-
                    tain and improve Madera’s quality of life and
                    implement the community’s shared vision for
                    the future.
                    This Introduction provides a brief overview of
                    the Plan itself, the key ideas which are ad-
                    dressed in the City’s policies, and notes about
                    how this Plan will be implemented over time
                    (and how it can be amended to reflect chang-
                    ing realities).
                    VISION 2025
                    Recognizing the need to create a roadmap to
                    the City’s future, the Madera community em-
                    barked on a process in 2005 that began with
                    the preparation of Vision Madera 2025. This
                    community-based effort was undertaken to
                    create an improved sense of unity in Madera,
                    generate more effective decision-making, and
                    provide the City with guidance for long-range
                    planning. The Vision Madera 2025 report
                    (available as a separate volume) listed hun-
                    dreds of ideas and actions developed by the
                    community—this General Plan builds on and
                    implements these community values. Key

CHAPTER 1     INTRODUCTION AND VISION
                   statements of principles and ideas from Vision 2025 are excerpted below,
                   and are described in more detail in Chapter 2.0 – Vision 2025.
                   The statement of principle titled A Well-Planned City is concerned with the
                   physical aspects of Madera’s growth. Affordable housing, balancing residen-
                   tial, commercial and agricultural needs and providing efficient services are
                   significant concerns for a rapidly growing community. Open communications
                   between the community and City/County government and within those gov-
                   ernments are vital to a healthy city.
                   The statement of principle titled Good Jobs and Economic Opportunities
                   recognizes the need for good jobs, a well-trained, well-paid workforce and a
                   broad spectrum of business opportunities. The vision underscores the need
                   to attract commercial and retail businesses and to encourage residents to buy
                   locally.
                   The statement of principle titled A Strong Community and Great Schools
                   highlights development of leadership, expansion of educational opportunities,
                   support for the arts and recognition of the Madera’s unique culture. Support
                   for Madera’s youth in education, after-school programs and sports activities
                   reflects the community’s desire to create a caring environment in which to
                   raise a family.
                   The statement of principle titled A Safe, Healthy Environment emphasizes
                   the community’s desire to protect Madera’s natural resources, enjoy a secure
                   community and provide healthy educational and recreational activities. The
                   Vision recognizes the need for Madera’s parks and open spaces to be con-
                   venient and well-maintained. This statement also emphasizes excellent
                   health care and related services for all community members.

   INTRODUCTION AND VISION                                            CHAPTER 1
GUIDING PRINCIPLES
The City of Madera recognizes and acknowledges the ability of planning to
affect the quality of lives of residents, the success of the local economy, the
appearance of the community, the ability of Madera to respond to changing
economic circumstances, and the extent to which the city can help in state-
wide and national efforts to reduce energy consumption and reduce green-
house gas emissions. In light of these potential affects, and taking queues
from the four pillars of Vision Madera 2025, the Madera General Plan embo-
dies several guiding principles throughout its ten elements.
    •   Be proactive, addressing important issues as early as possible, when
        the City’s actions can have the most effect;
    •   Think ahead, working to identify important issues and to continually
        seek out the best practices of other cities and communities and im-
        plement them in a way that is meaningful to Madera;
    •   Recognize Madera’s Heritage by conserving the agricultural uses
        that have been a part of the City’s fabric since its beginnings;
    •   Support Madera’s transition from a small town to a contemporary
        small city, while retaining its sense of community;
    •   Embrace diversity in all aspects of the city—its people, its housing,
        its economy—in recognition of the strength and flexibility it provides;
        and
    •   Ensure the long-term viability of Madera both from an economic
        standpoint and from the perspective of the physical systems—land,
        water, air, and so forth—that are critical to a healthy city.

CHAPTER 1     INTRODUCTION AND VISION
                   COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT IN THE GENERAL PLAN
                   Citizen participation played an important role in preparing this General Plan.
                   Because the General Plan needs to reflect community goals and aspirations,
                   citizens were involved, from the onset, with issues identification and goal for-
                   mulation. One of the most important parts of this process was the General
                   Plan Public Advisory Committee, whose members met monthly throughout
                   the preparation of the Draft General Plan to bring their own expertise to the
                                process and to encourage participation and comments from all
                                segments of the community.
                                A wide variety of civic and professional organizations were con-
                                sulted during the Plan preparation stage whenever possible. Nu-
                                merous public meetings were held in various locations throughout
                                the community to discuss the Plan.
                                Citizen groups and individuals participated in preparation of the
                                General Plan through attendance at General Plan Public Advisory
                                Committee meetings, at General Plan public workshops, in focus
                                group meetings, and at public hearings with the Planning Com-
                                mission and City Council.
                   ROLE OF THE GENERAL PLAN
                   The General Plan is a broad framework for planning the future of the City of
                   Madera. The General Plan is the official policy statement of the City Council
                   to guide private and public development of the City, as well as the City’s own
                   operations and decisions.
                   State law requires that the City’s ordinances regulating land use be consis-
                   tent with the General Plan. The Zoning Code, individual project proposals,
                   and other related plans and ordinances must be consistent with the goals and
                   policies in this General Plan. In addition, all capital improvements and public
                   works projects must also be consistent with the General Plan.

   INTRODUCTION AND VISION                                          CHAPTER 1
Periodic review and possible amendment of the General Plan to adjust to
changing conditions and priorities is required. This General Plan, while pre-
pared with a time horizon of at least 20 years in mind, is not unchangeable.
As circumstances or the City’s desires change, this General Plan may be
amended by the City Council following review by the Planning Commission.
THE TEN ELEMENTS OF THIS GENERAL PLAN
State law requires that General Plans address seven topics: Land Use, Circu-
lation, Housing, Conservation, Open Space, Noise, and Safety. This General
Plan covers all of these topics plus several additional issues, which are orga-
nized in the following chapters, commonly referred to as elements:
     •  Community Design (Optional Topic);
     •  Circulation (Required Topic, per state law);
     •  Conservation (Required Topics of “Conservation” and “Open Space,”
        per state law);
     •  Health and Safety (Required Topic of “Safety,” per state law, plus ad-
        ditional topic of “Health”);
     •  Housing (Required Topic, per state law);
     •  Land Use (Required Topic, per state law);
     •  Noise (Required Topic, per state law);
     •  Historic and Cultural Resources (Optional topic);
     •  Parks and Recreation (Optional Topic);
     •  Sustainability (Optional Topic).
          CITY OF MADERA GENERAL PLAN | OCTOBER 7, 2009                    1-5

CHAPTER 1     INTRODUCTION AND VISION
                   Together, these Elements provide the City’s policies on a broad range of is-
                   sues related to the future of Madera, its livability, and its desire to become a
                   model for other Central Valley communities.
                   THE PLANNING AREA
                   This General Plan addresses a “Planning Area” that extends outside the cur-
                   rent city limits (see Figure I-1, on the following page). This Planning Area
                   was defined during the initial stages of the 2008/2009 General Plan Update,
                   and represents the area which the City envisions may ultimately be included
                   either in a Sphere of Influence or in the incorporated city limits.
                   Outside the city limits, this General Plan is purely advisory, although it does
                   provide a statement of the uses the City desires in these areas. While the
                   City has no jurisdiction over these areas, it can advise the County of Madera
                   on land use policy, and can provide input to the County on projects taking
                   place in the Planning Area.

    •    Unless otherwise defined by Policy, the standard definitions of words
         and terms shall be used. The Glossary to this General Plan provides
         definitions of many commonly used planning terms; these may be
         used as a starting point in resolving disputes about the meanings of
         words in Goals or Policies.
    •    Some information in this General Plan (e.g. population figures) is ex-
         pected to become outdated in the normal course of events. Where
         this information is critical to the use of this Plan’s Goals or Policies,
         the most up-to-date information should be used, even if it comes from
         sources other than this General Plan.
The following specific conventions are used in this General Plan:
    •    Where the word “City” is capitalized, the reference is generally to the
         City of Madera as a governmental agency, as in “The City’s offices
         are located in the Downtown District.”
    •    Where the word “city” is lowercase, the reference is generally to the
         geographic place, as in “There are many parks in the city.”
    •    References to current facts and figures should generally be consi-
         dered to refer to the years 2008-2009, unless specifically stated oth-
         erwise.
AMENDMENTS TO THIS GENERAL PLAN
Recognizing the need for the General Plan to remain up-to-date and reflec-
tive of local issues and policies, State law allows the City to amend the Gen-
eral Plan to ensure that it is consistent with the conditions, values, expecta-
tions, and needs of the community. The State’s General Plan Guidelines
note:
           CITY OF MADERA GENERAL PLAN | OCTOBER 7, 2009                     1-9

CHAPTER 1     INTRODUCTION AND VISION
                   “The General Plan is a dynamic document because it is based on community
                   values and an understanding of existing and projected conditions and needs,
                   all of which continually change. Local governments should plan for change by
                   establishing formal procedures for regularly monitoring, reviewing, and
                   amending the General Plan.”
                   Periodic revision of the Housing Element is required by state law, but there is
                   no required regular update for any other portion of the General Plan.
                   IMPLEMENTING THIS GENERAL PLAN
                   While this General Plan seeks to guide Madera’s growth and decision-
                   making, it is not intended to answer every question which will be faced by the
                   City over the lifetime of the Plan. This General Plan is not a step-by-step
                   guidebook for its own implementation; instead, it will rely on the diligence, in-
                   genuity, and hard work of Madera’s elected officials, residents, and staff to
                   find ways to apply its policies to situations which will be unpredictable and
                   new.
                   THE ZONING ORDINANCE
                   The City of Madera Zoning Ordinance is a key implementation tool for the
                   General Plan. Many of the Goals, Policies, and Action Items in this General
                   Plan are achieved through zoning, which regulates public and private devel-
                   opment. The City is responsible for ensuring that the Zoning Ordinance and
                   this General Plan are in conformity. In most instances, this will mean that
                   land is designated in the General Plan and zoned for similar uses with similar
                   development standards (i.e. similar densities and minimum parcel sizes).
                   Where zoning and General Plan land use designations are not identical, poli-
                   cies of this General Plan should be consulted carefully for guidance in
                   amending the Zoning Ordinances to be consistent with the General Plan.

                     COMMUNITY DESIGN
                     ELEMENT
                     This Element of the General Plan addresses
                     the key issue of community design. A key
                     outcome of Vision 2025 was a desire on the
                     part of the City and its residents to improve
                     the quality of design for public and private de-
                     velopment projects.       That commitment to
                     “raise the bar” and continually strive to im-
                     prove the quality of Madera’s built environ-
                     ment is reflected in the goals and policies in
                     this Element.
                     MADERA’S URBAN FORM
                     Several key features make up Madera’s cur-
                     rent urban form:
                         •   Madera’s Downtown has a compact,
                             grid street system and serves as the
                             governmental center for the County of
                             Madera.
                         •   State Highway 99 is a key economic
                             and transportation corridor of the San
                             Joaquin Valley, as well as a significant
                             historic and cultural feature. However,
                             the highway does create a disconnec-
                             tion between the east and west sides
                             of Madera.

                                VISION 2025
                                In the summer of 2005 the City conducted a community-wide visioning project
                                called “Vision 2025”.2 The visioning process was undertaken to create an im-
                                proved sense of unity within the community, generate more effective deci-
                                sion-making and provide the City of Madera with guidance for long-range
                                planning. Vision statements were developed to describe the desires of the
                                community:
                                                •   A well-planned city;
                                                •   Good jobs and economic opportunities;
                                                •   A strong community and great schools; and
                                                •   A safe, healthy environment.
                                           The community’s vision for 2025 identifies Downtown Madera as the
                                           lively heart and soul of the community with diverse businesses, din-
                                           ing, entertainment and cultural opportunities by the year 2025.
                                As described in Vision 2025, the community envisions safe, well-maintained
                                parks and recreational centers are conveniently located throughout the com-
                                munity, and are accessible. Vision 2025 describes the Vern McCullough
                                Fresno River Trail as a recognized feature of the city, providing valued
                                recreation, access and mobility opportunities for pedestrians, runners and bi-
                                cyclists. In the vision for the future, increasing parkland keeps pace with a
                                growing population.
                                Taken together, these urban form elements contribute to the sense of com-

 children can play in the streets and people know their neighbors, a transpor-
 tation system that provides easy access to goods, jobs and services in Made-
 ra and other local cities, a downtown that is rich in history and tradition, and
 an abundance of parks and schools that serve as focal points of community
 life.
 In an effort to preserve and enhance Madera’s character and implement the
 goals of Vision 2025, this Community Design Element has been included in
 the General Plan.
 In addition to Vision 2025’s goals, this Community Design Element also im-
 plements the “Building Blocks” concept from the Land Use Element by speci-
 fying how new development should look, feel, and function.              “Building
 Blocks” are the Neighborhoods and Villages along with Special Districts that
 will form the Madera of the future. The Building Blocks concept supports the
 overall goals of creating walkable, livable, and sustainable development in
 both existing and new areas of the community.
 URBAN DESIGN PRINCIPLES
 Urban design addresses the image or character of the City’s built environ-
 ment. It considers the relationship between the location of uses, and the vis-
 ual appearance and character of the built environment with the ultimate goal
 of attaining a strong sense of place.
 Urban design principles that should be followed to attain a sense of place in-
 clude human-scale design, community focal points, edges, landmarks, siting
 buildings to “hold corners,” and pedestrian-orientation. To the extent possi-
 ble, these principles should be applied at all scales of the city from individual
 buildings to larger development projects and should apply to new develop-
 ment, as well as the redevelopment of existing areas. However, it is fre-
 quently not possible to incorporate all principles into every development. Ba-
 sic urban design principles are discussed in detail below.

                                            HUMAN-SCALE DESIGN
                                            People feel most comfortable and secure in environ-
                                            ments that are designed at the scale of the individual.
                                            At a neighborhood level, this translates into shorter
                                            block lengths that are walkable and provide more
                                            connections throughout a neighborhood. At a site or
                                            building design level, human-scale design involves the
                                            massing of buildings, articulation of building façades,
                                            organization of buildings on a site, landscaping of
                                            public and private areas, and use of color and mate-
                                            rials. Generally, this means avoiding or minimizing
                                            the use of soundwalls and cul-de-sacs in future resi-

                                            office and commercial development presents an at-
                                            tractive “face” to the street.
                                            GATHERING PLACES
                                            Gathering places are locations that serve as meeting
                                            places where people gather. Examples of focal points
                                            include shopping areas, restaurants, plazas, parks or
                                            community centers.
                   Courthouse Park and the Frank A. Bergon Senior Citizen Center are gather-
                   ing points in public places; private facilities, such as restaurants or coffee
                   houses, can also serve this function.
                   Gathering places are important components of a community because they
                   provide a common location for people to meet, talk, shop and play. They are
                   locations to sit and relax, read or converse.

 EDGES
 Two types of “edges” are important in the creation of a community’s
 character.
                The first type helps to define space. This type of edge can
                be created by buildings, freeways, rivers, railroad rights of
                way, or a row of trees. They are usually, but not quite al-
                ways, the boundary between two kinds of areas.
                These edges can have differing degrees of permeability.
                For example, an edge created by a wall would be consi-
                dered “impermeable.” A building can create a “semi-
                permeable” edge with a feature such as a columned ar-
                cade, which allows people visual and physical access be-
                tween the sidewalk area and the private property. Ensuring
                that buildings, trees or other architectural features provide
                edges or definition to the street enhances the vitality and
                feeling of safety and security in urbanized areas. Edges are
                particularly important in areas with high pedestrian traffic,
                such as the Downtown.
                The second “edge” is the edge of the urban portion of a city.
                Cities are defined by their edges or (in many areas) by the
                lack of edges where cities blend together. The edge of a
                city can be “hard,” where there is an abrupt or clearly de-
                fined transition between urban and rural or undeveloped
                uses or “soft,” where the transition between urban and rural
                is more gradual.
                VISUAL LANDMARKS AND ENTRYWAYS
                A visual landmark or entryway is an element by which
                people orient themselves and can help create a unique
                identity for an area. Examples of visual landmarks include

                   above), the water tower north of the Fresno River is a highly visible local
                   landmark).
                   Entryway design treatments can include fountains, attractive signage or natu-
                   ral features such as rows of trees.
                   Attractive entryways and visual landmarks that signal a sense of arrival to
                   Madera are important components that contribute to the City’s character.

                                           “Holding corners” refers to the practice of placing de-
                                           velopment on sites located at the corner lots of inter-
                                           sections built close to or at the front lot line. This
                                           practice results in slightly different solutions in urban
                                           and suburban situations, but the intent is the same: to
                                           improve the appearance of roadways and their inter-
                                           sections.
                                           Downtown Madera has several examples of how
                                           “holding corners” looks in an urban setting. The two-
                                           story buildings at Yosemite Avenue and D Street in
                                           the downtown are examples how buildings help “hold
                                           the corner” at this important intersection
                   In a suburban setting, buildings can also be used to “hold corners,” but with
                   more landscaping. Buildings used in this way outside of downtown Madera
                   may have landscaped areas at the street, with parking located behind the
                   buildings.
                   Strategically placing development on corner sites gives better definition to an
                   intersection, which makes pedestrians feel less exposed to the adjacent traf-
                   fic. Ensuring that buildings in Madera are designed to hold the corners of key
                   intersections will enhance the visual quality and the safety of the pedestrian

          environment as compared to development that provides “a
          sea of asphalt” to passersby.
          PEDESTRIAN ORIENTATION
          Designing places that are pedestrian-oriented rather than
          automobile-oriented contributes to creating a sense of place
          because it encourages people to use public spaces. Pede-
          strian orientation involves providing good physical connec-
          tions between destinations, a mix of uses where possible, as
          well as a safe walking environment.
          In terms of building design, pedestrian orientation can be
          achieved by orienting buildings to the street and providing
          pedestrian amenities such as awnings, benches and attrac-
          tive street lighting.
          Increasing pedestrian-orientation not only enhances the at-
          tractiveness and safety of an area, it also provides greater
          opportunities to some segments of the community that
          benefit from not having to depend on auto travel, such as
          senior citizens, people with disabilities and children.
          One challenge in increasing development that fosters pede-
          strian activity is to design places that are pedestrian-oriented
          while recognizing the automobile will continue to play an im-
          portant part in transportation modes.

                connectivity of the neighborhood. Examples of design features which can
                achieve these objectives include, but are not limited to, accommodating pe-
                destrians through the gated area of the subdivision in a paseo feature, or
                limiting the size of individual gated subdivisions to allow easy access
                around the gated areas on local streets.
                    Action Item CD-23.1
                    Consider an amendment to the Zoning Code to only allow gated com-
                    munities when findings are made identifying specific circumstances that
                    justify a unique public need for the project to be gated.

 Policy CD-24►       Wherever possible, the City shall use public rights of way and other fea-
                     tures (including the Fresno River, utility easements, and drainage ways) as
                     part of a citywide system of off-street walking and bicycling trails. The City

Policy CD-30►   Lot size and building placement on lots shall be designed to reduce the ap-
                pearance of large homes close together on small lots. Potential techniques
                include:
                     •  Attention to detail in architectural design, materials, etc.
                     •  Varying lot widths to accommodate building footprints.
                     •  Variety in residential designs within individual projects.
Policy CD-31►   Residential building setbacks from

 Policy CD-32►       Garages for new single-family houses,

                     subordinate in visual importance to the
                     house itself, especially the entry. This
                     may be achieved in a number of ways,
                     such as by locating garages toward the
                     back of the properties, constructing al-
                     leys, building garages as separate struc-
                     tures from the house, requiring garages to be set back from the front facade
                     of the house and encouraging the orientation of garage doors at 90 degrees
                     to the street.
 Policy CD-33►       The exterior of residential buildings shall be varied and articulated to pro-
                     vide visual interest to the streetscape.
                         Action Item CD-33.1

                         cluding any façade or building treat-
                         ment alternatives that are designed
                         to be utilized with each model. When
                         builders propose to utilize façade al-
                         ternatives to implement Policy CD-33, every home constructed shall in-
                         corporate one of the approved facades or exterior treatment alterna-
                         tives. Builders may not offer the buyers an option for a “base” or “stan-
                         dard” model which fails to provide variation and articulation in the exte-

                    that allow Madera to function. Issues in this
                    Element are:
                        •   Circulation – Roadways, bicycling,
                            walking, airports, and railways;
                        •   Water – Domestic water service for
                            homes and businesses;
                        •   Sewer – Wastewater collection and
                            treatment;
                        •   Solid Waste – Disposal of waste

                                         Transportation—the movement of people and goods and the
                                         facilities needed to accommodate them (roads, railroads, bi-

                                         Vision 2025 described the Madera transportation system that
                                         the community seeks to create:
                         “Madera's comprehensive transportation system connects local neighbor-
                         hoods and districts with efficient, affordable mass transit. Madera is a friendly
                         community for pedestrians and bicyclists. There is a well-developed system
                         of walking and bicycle trails throughout the city. Safe, clean and attractive
                         streets accommodate traffic, providing easy access to all parts of the city.”
                         Major features of Madera’s circulation system include these:
                             •   Madera’s Downtown District has a compact, grid street system that
                                 features short block lengths and provides the choice of many routes
                                 for motorists, pedestrians, and cyclists.
                             •   State Highway 99 is a key economic and transportation corridor of the
                                 San Joaquin Valley.

                                    town, and then turns south of the city’s downtown toward Kerman.
                                •   Madera Municipal Airport is a general aviation airport that serves per-
                                    sonal and business aircraft.
                                •   Two railroad lines run parallel to State Highway 99 through the city. A
                                    major freight line passes through the city just east of Hwy 99. A
                                    second line, used by freight trains and the Amtrak passenger rail sys-
                                    tem, passes east of Madera.
                            As is the case in region and the nation, most Maderans (more than 90%) tra-

                            work, but the rate of carpooling (about 23%) is almost twice the national av-

                                                 WALKING
                                                 Walking has always been a part of the transportation
                                                 system in Madera.          Automobiles were not widely
                                                 available when the city was founded, and for many years
                                                 the city remained compact enough that the average man
                                                 could easily walk from one edge of the city to the other.

                                                 walk, and the many intersecting roads make it easy to
                                                 select the best route from point A to point B.
                                                 With the rise in the popularity of the automobile, walking
                                                 in Madera (and in most cities in the US) began to fall into
                                                 disfavor. Today, as noted earlier, more than 90 percent
                                                 of Madera’s workers now travel to their jobs in cars; fewer
                                                 than 2 percent walk to work.

                                  However, walking as an increasingly important part of life in Madera is one of
                                  the major facets of the City’s goals to become a healthier and more livable
                                  place. The Building Blocks concept described in the Land Use Element of
                                  this General Plan is built around walkability, and calls for the creation of
                                  neighborhoods sized to the walking ability of the average person. This
                                  Circulation Element contains numerous policies intended to make walking
                                  easier and more acceptable.
                                  BICYCLING
                                  Bicycle use in Madera in 2008, as in most California cities, makes up only a
                                  small portion of travel. Less than two percent of workers in Madera use bi-
                                  cycles to commute to work.
                                                      Bicycle use is likely reduced by a relative lack of bicycle
                                                      facilities (such as on-street bike lanes and off-street trails),
                                                      but the city’s flat topography and relatively compact size
                                                      (the urban area is only about five miles across, well within

                                                      create the opportunity for increased bicycle use. At a pub-
                                                      lic workshop in 2008, audience members overwhelmingly
                                                      favored more bicycle use, and most said they would ride
                                                      several miles for daily shopping or other needs if there
                                                      were safe routes to ride.
                                                      Increasing bicycle use is part of the City’s overall strategy

  INFRASTRUCTURE ELEMENT
The City’s Water Division is responsible for 16 groundwater wells (with
another new well under construction as of 2008), the Loy E. Cook 1-million
gallon water storage tower, and more than 200 miles of water distribution
pipe lines.
The Sewer Division maintains approximately 140 miles of sanitary sewer
mains in a system that includes five sewer lift pump stations and main
pipe lines ranging in size from 6" to 48". The Wastewater Treatment Plant is
the regional facility for disposal of waste water. The treatment plant handles
waste water and sewage from approximately 10,000 residential, commercial
and industrial accounts.
                      SOLID WASTE
                      City of Madera Solid Waste Division provides all
                      residential customers with solid waste and greenwaste
                      services. There are several recycling companies in
                      Madera that accept beverage containers and other
                      recyclables. The City also recently (2008) launched a
                      “blue can” curbside recycling system, making it easier for
                      Maderans to recycle paper, bottles, cans, and other
                      recyclables.
                      Computer monitors and television sets containing
                      hazardous waste is accepted at the Fairmead Landfill in
Chowchilla. The landfill also accepts many recyclables free of charge, and
some at reduced rates.
There are several locations in Madera County to recycle used motor oil and
filters.

Policy CI-3► The following are general descriptions of the roadway types shown on the
             Circulation Master Plan:
             Freeways: Limited-access facilities designed for high speed regional mobil-
             ity. Freeways may include up to eight lanes (four lanes in each direction).
             Madera Loop: This is a system of arterial streets intended to provide for
             easy intra-city travel by providing links along the perimeter to the city to the
             Freeway 99 corridor. The arterials on the Madera Loop will generally be up
             to four lanes wide (two in each direction). To help speed the flow of traffic
             and improve safety, direct access to the Madera Loop is more restricted
             than on other arterial roadways and interruptions such as signals will be re-
             duced compared to other arterial roadways.

                                   tial, commercial, and industrial areas. The primary function of collector
                                   streets is to collect and distribute traffic between local streets and the ar-
                                   terial roadway system. Collectors will generally include up to four lanes
                                   (two in each direction). To reduce traffic interruptions and improve safety,
                                   direct access via driveways is generally not permitted.
                                   Local/Branch Collector: Single lane streets which collect traffic from Local
                                   Streets and feed into the Collector and Arterial system. Design speeds are
                                   lower than for Collector roadways (potentially through the use of meanders,
                                   roundabouts, narrower road sections, etc.). To reduce traffic interruptions
                                   and improve safety, direct access via driveways is generally not permitted.
                                   Local Streets: Roadways which provide access to individual homes and
                                   businesses. Local streets have one lane in each direction. Local streets
                                   are shown on the Circulation Map for informational purposes only; the Gen-
                                   eral Plan does not define the desired alignments of local streets.

              INFRASTRUCTURE ELEMENT
Policy CI-4► The City shall seek to locate arterials or other major roadways, including the
             Madera Loop, inside the edge of the City’s desired urban growth area.
             These roadways shall be designed to serve development on both sides, ra-
             ther than be constructed as a single-loaded road on the edge of the urban
             area. Note to the Reader: Please see the Land Use Element for policies re-
             lated to the Urban Growth area.
                                      Single Loaded Roadway
                A “single-loaded” street serves property on one side only. In the
                example above, a single-loaded roadway allows homes to face a
                parkway and the adjacent river, increasing visibility of the river and
                making it (and the adjacent linear park) part of the neighborhood.
                This type of roadway could be used adjacent to the Fresno River in
                Villages B, C, D, and E and the Downtown District (see the Land
                Use Element for more information).

             ROADWAY IMPLEMENTATION POLICIES
Policy CI-5►   The City shall require the dedication or irrevocable offer of dedication of
               right of way for all arterials and collectors at the earliest opportunity in the
               development process in order to implement the Roadway Master Plan.
               Generally, the earliest opportunity to implement this policy will be the first of
               the following discretionary approvals which is available:
                   •    Change of Zoning or General Plan Land Use Designation;
                   •    Approval of a Comprehensive Plan, Specific Plan, or other master
                        plan;
                   •    Any subdivision map (such as a parcel map or tentative tract map);
                   •    Conditional Use Permit;
                   •    Site plan or design approval.
               If any of these discretionary approvals is not being sought, right of way de-
               dication may be required as a condition of building permit approval.
Policy CI-6►   The City shall protect future right-of-way needed for freeways, arterial and
               collector streets, and interchanges and railroad corridors and crossings from
               encroachment by development or other incompatible uses or structures.
Policy CI-7►   In order to ensure adequate circulation capacity of collectors, arterials and
               larger streets, turning movements and driveway approaches to adjoining
               properties and onto local streets shall be limited so through traffic speeds
               are not reduced by more than 10 (ten) miles per hour based on the street
               design speed. This policy will not be applied where the City determines that
               existing land use patterns and unique site constraints make it impossible.
               Direct access to sites along arterial and larger streets should typically be

                    provided from adjacent local streets or signalized shared access points.
                    This should be implemented as early as possible in development when zon-
                    ing and parcels are established.
                        Action Item CI-7.1
                        Amend the City standards to limit the spacing of driveway approaches
                        and turn lanes as called for in Policy CI-7
 Policy CI-8►       Priority will be given to upgrades on those streets where any of the following
                    exist:
                        •    High current and projected traffic volumes are involved;
                        •    Joint funding is possible;
                        •    Significant contributions of private or assessment district funds are
                             involved as part of the cost of developing adjacent lands; or
                        •    Where the rate of serious accidents has been high and where ha-
                             zards to public safety are great;
                        •    Where circulation improvements can help stimulate economic growth
                             consistent with this General Plan.
 Policy CI-9►       The City will work cooperatively with Caltrans to implement improvements to
                    the state highway system in Madera.
                        Action Item CI-9.1
                        Review proposed development projects with Caltrans to facilitate the
                        acquisition of right of way for ultimate improvements and to avoid and/or
                        minimize potential traffic conflicts between State facilities, city streets,
                        and private drives.

                INFRASTRUCTURE ELEMENT
Policy CI-10► The City will maintain a high level of coordination with the County of Madera
              and Caltrans, through the Madera County Transportation Commission, in
              implementing the Circulation Master Plan. The City will participate in the
              planning of regional roadway and transportation facilities, particularly those
              that indirectly or directly affect Madera, including the State Route 152-East/
              Freeway 65 corridor.
Policy CI-11► Development projects shall be required to provide funding or to construct
              roadway/intersection improvements to implement the City’s Circulation Mas-
              ter Plan. The payment of established traffic impact or similar fees shall be
              considered to provide compliance with the requirements of this policy with
              regard to those facilities included in the fee program, provided that the City
              finds that the fee adequately funds all required roadway and intersection
              improvements. If payment of established fees is used to provide com-
              pliance with this policy, the City may also require the payment of additional
              fees if necessary to cover the fair share cost of facilities not included in the
              fee program.
Policy CI-12► New development shall provide funding acceptable to the City for the con-
              struction and permanent maintenance of all roadway facilities. Potential
              funding mechanisms may include assessment districts, community facility
              districts, or other methods.
Policy CI-13► Where the installation of a single-loaded street cannot be avoided (such as
              in locations where lands on one side of a roadway are not planned to be de-
              veloped), the City will include funding in its impact fees to provide for the
              construction of the portion of the roadway located on lands which are not
              being developed.

                         Update the City’s Standards and Specifications to implement Policy
                         CI-14.
 Policy CI-15►      To the extent possible, major traffic routes for residential areas should be
                    separate from those used by the city’s industrial areas, with the purpose of
                    avoiding traffic conflicts and potential safety problems. Residential areas
                    should not be accessed primarily through an industrial area, even if residen-
                    tial and industrial traffic are not in conflict.
 Policy CI-16►      Proposals to allow left turn lanes from collector and arterial streets shall be
                    evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and allowed only where an engineering
                    analysis confirms that traffic operations and safety conditions are not nega-
                    tively impacted.
                         Action Item CI-16.1

Policy CI-17► Shared driveways, driveway consolidation, reciprocal access easements,
              and cross access easements to commercial centers shall be required along

              lopment or redesign of existing development to minimize traffic hazards as-
              sociated with driveways and curb cuts.
Policy CI-18► Direct access from a residential lot onto an arterial, collector, or local/branch
              collector is allowed only where there is no feasible alternative. Backout
              driveways onto arterial, collector, and local/branch collector streets are pro-
              hibited even if access is allowed.

              traffic signals where applicable.
              LOCAL STREETS
Policy CI-20► To keep Local street volume within design capacity, street length (not block
              length) shall be kept under 1,600 feet or two blocks where possible unless
              interrupted by an arterial or collector street.
Policy CI-21► Installation and maintenance of curb, gutter, sidewalk and paving on Local
              streets shall be the responsibility of affected property owners.

                INFRASTRUCTURE ELEMENT
                  Action Item CI-22.1
                  Consider, during the review of proposed development projects, how to
                  shift travel demand away from the peak period, especially in those situa-
                  tions where peak traffic problems result from a few major generators
                  (e.g. outlying employment locations).
                  Action Item CI-22.2
                  Perform routine, ongoing evaluation of the efficiency of the urban street
                  traffic control system, with emphasis on traffic signal timing, phasing and
                  coordination to optimize traffic flow along arterial corridors. Use traffic
                  control systems to balance arterial street utilization (e.g., timing and
                  phasing for turn movements, peak period and off-peak signal timing
                  plans).
                  Action Item CI-22.3
                  As funding allows, expand traffic signal timing and synchronization pro-
                  grams where emission reduction benefits can be demonstrated.
Policy CI-23► Projects contributing traffic to roadways exceeding the desired level of ser-
              vice per Policy CI-22 may be required to fund system wide traffic improve-
              ments, including cumulative traffic mitigation at off-site locations (as appli-
              cable), and to assist in promoting non-vehicular transportation as a condi-
              tion of project approval.
              GRID STREET SYSTEM
Policy CI-24► The City shall seek to use a modified grid system for the roadway network,
              particularly in new development. The City defines a “modified grid” road sys-
              tem as follows:
                        CITY OF MADERA GENERAL PLAN | OCTOBER 7, 2009                     4-25

CHAPTER 4
               CIRCULATION AND
               INFRASTRUCTURE ELEMENT
                        •  The roadway system shall have a system of arterial roadways in the
                           form of a grid of arterials that will distribute traffic evenly and will
                           avoid excessive concentrations of traffic in any given area.
                        •  Arterials should be generally spaced at one (1) mile increments and
                           collector roads generally at one half (½) mile increments.
                        •  Collector and smaller roadways shall be designed to encourage
                           access to retail centers from residential areas.
                        •  Residential blocks shall be designed to limit traffic speeds and en-
                           courage pedestrian and bicycle safety through the design of the
                           roadways or the use traffic calming measures (such as narrower
                           streets).
                        •  The grid system may be modified as necessary to adjust for topo-
                           graphy, watercourses, existing development, or other factors as
                           deemed appropriate by the City.
                    PARKING
 Policy CI-25►      Parking for all uses shall be provided on-site and shall not require the use of
                    parking spaces in the right of way of a public or private street to provide re-
                    quired parking. The following are exceptions to this policy:
                        •  In the Downtown District, where limited space is available for off-
                           street parking, a portion of required parking may be provided on-
                           street or in parking lots or garages that may be established in the fu-
                           ture.
                        •  Parking for non-standard uses (that is, those requiring either more or
                           less parking than typical uses) may be determined and imposed on a
                           case-by-case basis.

              shall be allowed only when the City determines that there is a demonstrated
              need for additional parking.
                   Action Item CI-26.1
                   Amend parking and other standards in the Zoning Code to reflect a bal-
                   ance between the need for parking and the desire of the City to achieve
                   its goals regarding efficient land utilization, walkability, and increased
                   opportunities to create additional space for landscaping and other amen-
                   ities.
              MOBILITY AND ALTERNATIVE MODES OF TRANSPORTATION

Policy CI-31► The City’s roadway cross-sections shall
              incorporate “complete streets” concepts
              and be designed to safely accommodate
              vehicles, cyclists, pedestrians, diverse
              and disabled users, and transit. “Com-
              plete streets” are defined as streets that
                                                              A “complete street” accommodates

                  Action Item CI-31.1
                  Develop “Complete Street” standards for new arterial, collector, and lo-
                  cal street construction. “Complete street” standards should include op-
                  tions for narrower travel way widths (on existing streets only, where
                  needed to fit all uses into the existing right of way) and curb return radii,
                  bike lanes, landscape strips, sidewalks that complement adjacent land
                  uses, bus turnouts, and similar features. Note: Proposed narrower travel
                  way widths may not apply to State Highways.
Policy CI-32► To maintain walkability and pedestrian safety, the City shall consider road-
              way width and roadway design features such as islands, pedestrian refuges,
              count down timers, and other such mechanisms. This policy applies to new
              roadway construction and existing roadways where pedestrian hazards may
              occur due to roadway design or width.
                  Action Item CI-32.1

               CIRCULATION AND
               INFRASTRUCTURE ELEMENT
 Policy CI-34►      Where sufficient right-of-way is available, bicycle lanes should be added to
                    City roadways when repaving or upgrading of the roadway occurs, provided
                    that the bicycle facility would implement the City’s Bicycle Master Plan. The
                    City shall encourage Caltrans to follow these same guidelines on state
                    highways in Madera.
                        Action Item CI-34.1
                        The City shall implement the Bicycle Master Plan through repaving, re-
                        striping, providing additional paving for bicycle lanes, or other methods
                        as appropriate.
 Policy CI-35►      The City shall encourage grade-separated crossings or enhanced at grade
                    crossings where Class I bicycle facilities intersect arterial roadways at key
                    locations to maximize the safety and attractiveness of bicycling and walking
                    routes. Underpasses are preferable to overpasses in new development
                    areas.
 Policy CI-36►      The City shall encourage an increase in bicycle ridership and pedestrian
                    trips over automobile traffic, as a way to improve traffic safety, air quality
                    and the health of Madera residents.
 Policy CI-37►      The City encourages the use of ridesharing and other Transportation De-
                    mand Management (TDM) tactics for reducing area traffic congestion and
                    improving air quality.

              RAILROADS
Policy CI-38► The City supports the development of the statewide high speed rail system
              with the following attributes:
                  •   The high speed rail system through (or in the vicinity of) the General
                      Plan Planning Area should be established within a rail corridor which
                      is located west of the city limits and located so as to minimize im-
                      pacts to agricultural lands outside the Growth Boundary. To the ex-
                      tent such an alignment is determined to be infeasible and an alterna-
                      tive alignment must be utilized, the High Speed Rail project should
                      specifically avoid the placement of facilities adjacent to the Union
                      Pacific (UP) tracks which bisect the City.
                  •   The design and final alignment of the high speed rail system through
                      the General Plan Planning Area should take into consideration, and
                      reflect the need for, compatibility with existing and planned land uses
                      and circulation features.
                  •   The construction of the high speed rail system through the General
                      Plan Planning Area should include all necessary features to ensure
                      the operability of all existing and planned transportation corridors as
                      called for in the General Plan Circulation Element.
                  Action Item CI-38.1
                  The City will work with the High Speed Rail Authority to ensure that is-
                  sues relative to the location, alignment, design, and construction within
                  the Planning Area are addressed through the High Speed Rail planning
                  process.

                  ment Policy CI-43. This may include relocating Highway 145, providing
                  additional control to the City with regard to roadway design and/or oper-
                  ation, or some other method.
                  Action Item CI-43.2
                  In conjunction with Policy CI-43, the City shall determine the best road-
                  way design for downtown. If Highway 145 is rerouted outside of down-
                  town, the City may consider reducing the number of travel lanes through
                  the downtown to two lanes and increasing the width of the pedestrian
                  corridor, including amenities and landscaping along roadways in the

 Policy CI-47►      All major development projects shall identify the size and cost of all infra-
                    structure and public facilities and identify how the installation and long-term
                    maintenance of infrastructure will be financed consistent with the policies in
                    this General Plan.
 Policy CI-48►      To improve the appearance of the City’s commercial and residential neigh-
                    borhoods, the City will require that all utility lines be placed underground in
                    conjunction with new development projects, unless determined by the City
                    to be infeasible. Additionally, the City will seek to place existing above-
                    ground utility lines underground in the parts of the City which have been
                    largely built-out.

                  Action Item CI-48.1
                  Consider adoption of a program for the undergrounding of existing utility
                  lines. The program should establish priorities and address issues asso-
                  ciated with undergrounding, including:
                  •   Timing, phasing, and priorities;
                  •   Guidelines and standards;
                  •   Cost and financing;
                  •   Fee exemptions for low-income and other special needs households.
                  Action Item CI-48.2
                  Consider amending the City’s codes as appropriate to provide clear
                  standards and requirements for the undergrounding of existing utility
                  lines when adjacent properties are developed or redeveloped. Issues to
                  be addressed may include:
                  •   Thresholds for requiring undergrounding of utility lines;
                  •   Fees or waivers in lieu of placing lines underground.
Policy CI-49► The City shall require secure financing for all components of the transporta-
              tion system through the use of special taxes, assessment districts, develop-
              er dedications, or other appropriate mechanisms in order to provide for the
              completion of required major public facilities at their full planned widths or
              capacities in one phase. For the purposes of this policy, “major” facilities
              shall include the following:
                  •   Any roadway of a collector size or above, including any roadway
                      shown on the Circulation Plan in this General Plan;
                  •   Wells, water transmission lines, treatment facilities, and storage
                      tanks;

Policy CI-55►   The City shall seek to protect the quality and quantity of groundwater re-
                sources, including those which serve households and businesses which rely
                on private wells.
Policy CI-56►   The City shall require that water flow and pressure be provided at sufficient
                levels to meet domestic, commercial, industrial, and firefighting needs.

                no less than two separate water mains (or ideally two water sources) are
                connected, thereby enabling adequate fire flow to be maintained should one
                water main be removed from service. The City may allow development to
                proceed without connection to a looped water system when it determines
                that such connection is infeasible based on the specific circumstances as-
                sociated with the project, and where a water system analysis shows suffi-
                cient fire flow is available.
              SEWER SERVICE POLICIES
Policy CI-58►   Sewage conveyance and treatment capacity shall be available in time to

                           available to accommodate the subdivision plus existing develop-
                           ment, and other approved projects using the same conveyance lines,
                           and projects which have received sewage treatment capacity com-
                           mitment.

                    through a variety of means when feasible, including:
                        •  Adopting requirements for the use of recycled base materials (e.g.,
                           recycled raw batch materials, rubberized asphalt from recycled tires,
                           and other appropriate materials), if practicable, in requests for bids
                           for public roadway construction projects.
                        •  Procurement policies and procedures, which facilitate purchase of
                           recycled, recyclable, or reusable products and materials where feas-
                           ible.

                 This Conservation Element examines several
                 topics which are all related to how resources of
                 various types are used in Madera (or are af-
                 fected by human activities) and how their use
                 can be managed to ensure a sustainable fu-
                 ture. This Element examines:
                     •  Water Supply and Quality;
                     •  Soils and Agriculture;
                     •  Biology;

CHAPTER 5           CONSERVATION ELEMENT
                Planning in California and Climate Change: Madera Leads the Way
 With the growing awareness of the relationship between local decisions and global climate, the re-
 quirements for cities to implement “smart growth” planning ideas are expanding. Example: California
 Senate Bill 375, signed by Governor Schwarzenegger while the 2009 updating of this General Plan
 was under way.
 SB 375 emphasizes the use of the types of forward-thinking policies that are the foundation of this
 plan, including more compact growth and an emphasis on energy conservation, walking, bicycling,
 and sustainable practices—all of which are included in this General Plan.
 Madera, as the first agency in Madera County to update its General Plan under these new require-
 ments, is leading the way for the county and the Central Valley.
                                                WATER SUPPLY AND QUALITY
                                                Water is fundamental to life. It is also crucial to the
                                                health and well-being of Madera. Water must be availa-
                                                ble in sufficient amounts for daily living, farming, firefight-
                                                ing, and industrial uses, and must be of a high enough
                                                quality to allow its use by residents (for drinking and other
                                                domestic uses), farmers (for crops and livestock), and
                                                industry (for industrial processes that use water).
                           SOURCES OF WATER AND LOCAL HYDROLOGY
                           One of the more prominent natural features of the Madera landscape is the
                           seasonal Fresno River. The Fresno River, the channel of which traverses the
                           city of Madera, is dry for much of the year. The Planning Area also gains sur-
                           face water from Cottonwood Creek, Dry Creek, and Schmidt Creek.

                                        Upstream from Madera on the Fresno River, the Hidden Lake Dam forms
                                        Hensley Lake, operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for flood con-

                                        Urban development in the Planning Area obtains its water supply from wells
                                        drilled into the Madera groundwater subbasin. According to the City’s 2005
                                        Urban Water Management Plan, the Madera Subbasin has been in a state of
                                        overdraft1 for several years. However, because 97% of all groundwater use
                                        in Madera County is for agricultural purposes, the overdraft is most likely not
                                        tied primarily to urban use in Madera. While a significant portion of the agri-
                                        cultural water demand in the area is met by surface water through the Made-
                                        ra Irrigation District, many farms use groundwater from on-site wells for some
                                        or all of their irrigation needs.
                                                                The water table under Madera fluctuates depending on

                                                                groundwater table is generally dropping (in part due to
                                                                drought conditions).2 As the water table drops, the
                                                                amount of energy needed to pump water (and the cost)
                                                                increases. Some wells may also run dry if they are not
                                                                drilled deeper to reach the lowered water table.

       In June 2008, the Governor issued Executive Order S-06-08 declaring a statewide drought, and directed state agencies and
    departments to take immediate action to address the serious drought conditions and water delivery reductions that exist in
    California. He also issued a Central Valley State of Emergency Proclamation for nine Central Valley counties (Sacramento,
    San Joaquin, Stanislaus, Merced, Madera, Fresno, Kings, Tulare and Kern) to address urgent water needs. Source: California

                                According to the Integrated Regional Water Management Plan, almost all ur-
                                ban water used in the county comes from wells. About three-fourths of agri-
                                cultural use is from wells; the rest is from surface water.
                                Based on 2006 figures in the Integrated Regional Water Management Plan,
                                per-capita water use in Madera (230 gallons per day) is about the same as
                                the countywide average.
                                WATER QUALITY
                                Madera’s water quality is excellent and meets all regulatory standards. Do-
                                mestic water in Madera meets all standards for quality. 3
                                To help maintain the quality of water in Madera, the City in 2004 adopted a
                                “Storm Water Quality Management Plan” that uses six basic strategies to
                                help prevent the pollution of storm runoff (and the underground water table in-
                                to which stormwater percolates). These measures are:
                                1. Public Participation/Involvement
                                Providing opportunities for citizens to participate in program development and
                                implementation, including effectively publicizing public hearings and/or en-
                                couraging citizen representatives to attend storm water management pro-

2. Public Education and Outreach
Distributing educational materials and performing outreach to inform citizens
about the impacts polluted storm water runoff discharges can have on water
quality.
3. Construction Site Runoff Control
Developing, implementing, and enforcing an erosion and sediment control
program for construction activities that disturb 1 or more acres of land (con-
trols could include silt fences and temporary storm water detention ponds).
4. Illicit Discharge Detection and Elimination
Developing and implementing a plan to detect and eliminate illicit discharges
to the storm drain system. This includes developing a system map, informing
the community about hazards associated with illegal discharges and improper
disposal of waste, and enforcement measures.
5. Pollution Prevention/Good Housekeeping
Developing and implementing a program with the goal of preventing or reduc-
ing pollutant runoff from municipal operations. The program must include mu-
nicipal staff training on pollution prevention measures and techniques, which
might include such things as regular street sweeping, reduction in the use of
pesticides or street salt, or frequent catch-basin cleaning.
6. Post-Construction Runoff Control
Developing, implementing, and enforcing a program to address discharges of
post-construction storm water runoff from new development and redevelop-
ment areas. Applicable controls could include preventative actions such as
protecting sensitive areas (e.g., wetlands) or the use of structural BMPs such
as grassed swales or porous pavement.

CHAPTER 5     CONSERVATION ELEMENT
                        •  In 2006, Governor Schwarzenegger signed AB 32, which established
                           the first set of limits on GHG emissions for the state of California and
                           put into place the regulatory framework needed to reach those tar-
                           gets. AB 32 set the 1990 GHG emissions level as a target to be
                           achieved by 2020. In order to meet this goal, CARB is required to de-
                           velop greenhouse gas emissions reporting procedures and adopt
                           rules and regulations for reducing emissions by January 1, 2011, en-
                           forceable by January 1, 2012.
                        •  In 2008, Governor Schwarzenegger signed SB 375, which sets out
                           planning concepts intended to reduce vehicle travel by promoting
                           more compact development (ideas which are incorporated in this

                           emissions.
                   Taken together, both S-3-05 and AB 32 set the emission targets that Madera

                   ments have yet to be developed, various state agencies have begun to ex-
                   amine proposed land use plans and specific projects for their potential GHG
                   impacts.
                   ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE
                   Two important steps in helping to reduce climate change impacts are the cre-
                   ation of an inventory of existing greenhouse gases and a plan to reduce
                   these emissions.
                   Step 1: Greenhouse Gas Inventory
                   A Greenhouse Gas Inventory allows a city or community to understand the
                   level of greenhouse gases they emit, where these emissions come from, and
                   how they are projected to increase over time. To calculate the lev-
                   el of harmful pollutants a City or community emits within a given year, data on
                   electricity use, natural gas consumption, waste production, and vehicle miles
                   traveled is collected and converted into an equivalent of carbon dioxide. This

provides a baseline against which a city can track its progress on lowering
greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, by taking into account population
and job growth rates, a City can predict what its GHG emissions will be in the
future if nothing is done to reduce GHG production.
Step 2: Climate Action Plan
A Climate Action Plan (CAP) is a guiding document to identify ways in which
a city, county, or community can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and
adapt to the inevitable effects of climate change. A common goal for a
CAP is a 15% reduction below 2005 levels by 2020. A CAP outlines trans-
portation, land use, energy use, and waste production measures to
achieve its target and proposes a timeline for implementation. CAPs are be-
coming increasingly popular as a way to spread awareness of climate
change, reduce an area's impact on the environment, and save money on
energy bills. Additionally, when referenced in General Plans and environ-
mental documents, CAPs signify a public agency's efforts to combat climate
change.
The use of compact growth, increased non-vehicle travel, energy efficiency,
and other policies in this General Plan will help to achieve reductions in
greenhouse gas emissions in Madera.
                      ENERGY AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY
                      In California, most of the energy used to power modern
                      society comes from three sources: electricity, natural gas,
                      and oil. To a lesser extent, energy is also derived from
                      renewable sources (such as solar energy), nuclear, and
                      other sources.
                      In the Planning Area, two of the three major sources—
                      electricity and natural gas—area supplied by Pacific Gas
                      and Electricity (PG&E).

   CHAPTER 5                 CONSERVATION ELEMENT
                                   The other major source of energy in Madera is oil, refined into gasoline and
                                   other fuels to power the cars and trucks used by residents and businesses.
                                   Some homes in the Planning Area rely on propane, delivered by truck to indi-
                                   vidual tanks.
                                   Although still a small part of the energy supply, solar power is gaining accep-
                                   tance as a source of power in the Madera area. One group exploring this al-
                                   ternative energy source is farmers, who use solar electricity for water pumps
                                   and other uses.
                                   As of 2008, PG&E was investigating the construction of a new transmission
                                   line south of Madera’s current city limits to provide additional service capaci-
                                   ty. To the extent that PG&E continues to consider new transmission facilities
                                   anywhere within the General Plan planning area, the City has indicated a pre-
                                   ference that such facilities be located outside the City’s growth boundary in
                                   order to minimize conflicts with planned urban land uses.

                                                       “Green Building” is broadly defined as the construction
                                                       or rehabilitation of buildings and homes in a manner that
                                                       conserves resources. Green building can include numer-
                                                       ous elements affecting virtually every aspect of the devel-

CHAPTER 5     CONSERVATION ELEMENT
                   Green building has a number of potential benefits:
                        •  Reduced Material Consumption;
                        •  Lower Energy Costs;
                        •  Lower Water Bills;
                        •  Low maintenance Due to Durability;
                        •  Increased Home Value;
                        •  Potential Lower Insurance Costs;
                        •  Potential Tax Credits & Incentives.
                   Perhaps the most important aspect of green building is that it provides bene-
                   fits even when it is used sparingly. Carefully selected and implemented, even
                   modest measures can result in significant conservation of resources.
                   Green building can also be tailored to match local conditions, including those
                   in Madera. Because climates, customs, availability of materials and prefe-
                   rences vary so much throughout the nation, green building measures that are
                   essential in some areas may not be appropriate for others. Green building
                   uses improvements from architects, construction management, engineering,
                   planning, and other fields to create a more efficient, practical, and environ-
                   mentally-friendly way to create and modify buildings.

                                                          key issues:
                                                              •   Storm water management;

                                  Examples of Low Impact Development include:
                                      •     Reducing impervious surfaces to decrease runoff and aid in ground-
                                            water recharge—replacing impervious pathways with pervious ones,

                                            systems such as bioswales and infiltration trenches.
                                      •     Incorporating natural features—such as trees and water features—
                                            into site design.
                                      •     Designing compact, walkable developments.

               physical effects of agricultural practices on urban uses, such as chemical
               spraying, noise, etc.
Policy CON-18► The City recognizes that some agricultural soils in the city and the Planning
               Area are proposed for future urban development; in these cases, the follow-
               ing apply:
                   •   Agricultural use should be allowed to continue as long as possible.
                   •   The purchase of fee interest, easements, or other measures which
                       would have the effect of permanently precluding the planned con-
                       version to urban uses consistent with the Land Use Map of this Gen-
                       eral Plan should be avoided.

                                   CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL CENTRAL CALIFORNIA
                                   The Children’s Hospital Central California is a not-for-profit, state-of-the-art
                                   children’s hospital on a 50-acre campus near Madera (southeast of the Plan-
                                   ning Area) with a medical staff of more than 450 physicians. The hospital is
                                   the second largest children’s hospital in the state. The 338-bed facility is one
                                   of the 10 largest hospitals of its type in the nation. It provides high quality,
                                   comprehensive health care services to children, regardless of their ability to
                                   pay.
                                            GEOLOGIC HAZARDS
                                            Five major active and potentially active faults are close to the Plan-
                                            ning Area: the San Andreas, San Joaquin, Ortigalita, Owens Valley,
                                            and Melones faults. Of these, the San Andreas and the Owens Val-
                                            ley faults are expected to be the sources of future major earthquakes.
                                            As shown in Figure HS-1, no active earthquake faults are located in
                                            the Planning Area—the closest active faults are 50 or more miles dis-
                                            tant. The lack of faults in the Planning Area means that the potential
                                            for buildings to be damaged if they are placed atop a fault does not
                                            exist. Madera is also not subject to liquefaction, a common earth-
                                            quake-related hazard.2
                                            No earthquakes of magnitude 5.5 or greater have ever been recorded
The San Andreas fault (above) is            in the Madera area, nor have there been reports of damage in the

                                            curred on May 30, 2003, with a magnitude of 3.1 and an epicenter
                                            located approximately 6 miles west-northwest of Madera.

      When liquefaction happens, the ground becomes liquid, causing buildings to settle or collapse. Liquefaction happens during
    earthquakes in some areas where the soil is saturated with water.

CHAPTER 6            HEALTH AND SAFETY ELEMENT
                            According to the California Department of Conservation, Madera is in an area
                            in which there is a 10 percent chance in the next 50 years for an earthquake
                            that would result in “strong” groundshaking (as felt by people) and “light”
                            damage to structures. (By comparison, portions of Los Angeles, an area of
                            much higher seismic risk, are expected to experience “violent” groundshaking
                            and “heavy” damage sometime within the next 50 years.)
                            Subsidence—the settling of soils that can result when underground water, oil,
                            or gas is extracted—is not a problem in Madera County.3

                                                  other fuels, but there were no spills. One train worker

                                                  have occurred in the Planning Area.

  However, flood maps prepared for the Madera area continue to show a po-
  tential for flooding along a narrow 100-year floodplain along the Fresno River
  through Madera. Areas in Madera subject to flooding based on the most re-
  cent (September 2008) FEMA mapping are shown in Figure HS-2.
  FEMA’s flood maps also show zones that could be affected by 100-year
  flooding along Cottonwood Creek in the southern portion of the Planning
  Area, and along Schmidt and Dry creeks in the northwestern and western
  portions.
  Note to the Reader: Although recent changes in state law require cities to
  identify areas subject to “200-year” flooding, FEMA has not yet (as of 2008)
  mapped these areas for Madera. These areas will be more extensive that the
  100-year flood zones shown in Figure HS-2.
  FLOOD CONTROL
  Regional flood control (or “storm drainage”) facilities in the Planning Area are
  provided by the Madera County Flood Control & Water Conservation Agency.
  The City of Madera does not build or maintain regional storm drainage facili-
  ties, but does regulate the construction of City storm drainage basins and on-
  site storm drainage retention basins, as provided for in the City’s Storm Drai-
  nage Master Plan.
  While it is not a flood control agency, the canals of the Madera Irrigation Dis-
  trict are used to carry storm water under the terms of an agreement with the
  City of Madera.
  DAM INUNDATION
  Madera’s location downstream of Hidden Dam also raises the potential for
  flooding in the highly unlikely event of a failure of the dam. A map of the area
  that would be flooded by a breach of the dam is shown in Figure HS-3.

                                                           create the possibility for accidents, which generally occur
                                                           when pedestrians or cars cross or are trapped on the rail

                                                           cars were struck by trains. Also in 2007, 82 persons will

  To reduce the risk of injuries on the ground, safety zones have been adopted
  for Madera Airport. These zones are also shown in Figure HS-4. (These
  zones have also been overlaid on the Land Use Map of this General Plan to
  highlight their importance in making land use planning decisions.)
  A summary of key features of the zones shown on the map is provided below.
  More detailed information can be found in the Airport Land Use Compatibility
  Plan:
  A:      Runway Protection Zone High risk, high noise levels. No structures.
  B1:     Approach/Departure Zone Substantial risk and noise. Agriculture,

                                 The Madera City Fire Department is administered by the California
                                 Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CDF) pursuant to a cooperative
                                 fire protection agreement. Policy direction remains with the Madera City

                           stations, but also have non-guaranteed volunteer companies.
                           The level of fire protection in Madera is currently (2008) rated “4” by the
                           Insurance Services Organization, which rates cities and counties on their fire
                           protection services. (The ISO rating is on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being
                           best.)
                           In 2008, a Fire Department Planning Study was prepared for the County of
                           Madera. The study included:
                           •    A Standard of Response Cover planning analysis (fire station and crew
                                deployment) to examine the levels of fire department service by
                                occupancy type and land use classification;
                           •    Fire station and staffing infrastructure “triggers”;
                           •    An analysis of fire protection/prevention systems, including the water
                                supply and urban-wildland interface fire prevention strategies; and
                           •    Finance options for changes to the Madera County Fire Department.8
                           Although the study, including its findings and recommendations, has not been
                           formally adopted, it provides information which may be utilized in long-range
                           fire master planning for the County of Madera, including in and around the
                           City of Madera.

 Policy HS-14►       Industries which store and process significant quantities of hazardous or
                     toxic materials shall provide a buffer zone between the installation that
                     houses such substances and the property boundaries of the facility suffi-
                     cient to protect the public in the event of the release or leak of the materials.
 Policy HS-15►       The City will coordinate with the California Highway Patrol, the Madera
                     County Department of Environmental Health Services, the Madera County
                     Sheriff’s Department, and all other appropriate local, state and federal
                     agencies in hazardous materials route planning, notifications, and incident
                     response to ensure appropriate first response to hazardous material inci-
                     dents.
 Policy HS-16►       The City will work with other responsible agencies on efforts to clean up or
                     contain identified soil or water contamination identified in the city limits.
                     This policy will extend to the former Oberti salt ponds and other related fa-
                     cilities at such time as they are annexed to the city.

Policy HS-17►   The City shall seek to avoid and minimize exposure of sensitive land uses
                to potentially hazardous emissions along truck routes and rail lines which
                may be used by surface vehicles and rail cars carrying hazardous or toxic
                substances. These truck routes include Avenue 12 and Highways 99 and
                145.     Rail corridors include the two primary lines running north-south
                through Madera, as well as the spur line which serves the industrial area in
                the southwest portion of the City.
Policy HS-18►   The City shall require written confirmation from applicable local, regional,
                state, and federal agencies that known contaminated sites have been
                deemed remediated to a level appropriate for land uses proposed prior to
                the City approving site development or provide an approved remediation
                plan that demonstrates how contamination will be remediated prior to site
                occupancy. This documentation shall specify the extent of development al-
                lowed on the remediated site as well as any special conditions and/or re-
                strictions on future land uses.
                SAFETY: DRAINAGE AND FLOODING
Policy HS-19►   The City shall not permit new development projects to result in new or in-
                creased flooding impacts on adjoining parcels in either upstream or down-
                stream areas.
Policy HS-20►   The City’s first priority in preventing risks to life and property resulting from
                flooding shall be to designate appropriate land uses in areas subject to
                flooding. Only when this land use-based approach is not sufficient to re-
                duce hazards to life and property to acceptable levels will the City support
                the construction of new flood control projects.
                         CITY OF MADERA GENERAL PLAN | OCTOBER 7, 2009                        6-25

CHAPTER 6      HEALTH AND SAFETY ELEMENT
 Policy HS-21►       The City shall require any development on land subject to a 100-year flood
                     event, based on Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or on
                     other updated mapping acceptable to the City, to conform to NFIP stan-
                     dards.
 Policy HS-22►       Creation of lots whose access will be inundated by flows resulting from a
                     10-year or greater storm shall not be allowed. Bridges or similar structures
                     may be used to provide flood-free access.
 Policy HS-23►       The City shall limit the number of crossings of natural streams in order to
                     reduce potential flooding, degradation, hydrological changes and property
                     access problems. Among the methods which may be used to reduce the
                     number of crossings is a shared access drive serving two or more parcels.
 Policy HS-24►       Parcels shall not be created on which the presence of easements, flood-
                     plain, marsh or riparian habitat, or other features would leave insufficient
                     land to build and operate structures. This policy shall not apply to open
                     space lots specifically created for dedication to the City or another appro-
                     priate party for habitat protection, flood control, drainage, or wetland main-
                     tenance.
 Policy HS-25►       New and modified bridge structures shall not cause an increase in water
                     surface elevations of the 100-year floodplain exceeding one foot, unless
                     analysis clearly indicates that the physical and/or economic use of up-
                     stream or downstream property will not be adversely affected.
 Policy HS-26►       The City shall require all new urban development projects to incorporate ru-
                     noff control measures to minimize peak flows of runoff and/or assist in fi-
                     nancing or otherwise implementing comprehensive drainage plans. All
                     such control measures will consider potential affects to adjacent property
                     owners.

                          As necessary, impose requirements on projects to implement appropri-
                          ate CPUC recommendations.
                     SAFETY: AIRPORTS
 Policy HS-31►       The City shall consider the compatibility criteria in the Airport Land Use
                     Compatibility Plan for the Madera Airport and the Madera Municipal Airport
                     Master Plan in the review of potential land uses or projects. Projects shall
                     be approved only where consistency with the compatibility criteria in the
                     Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan can be demonstrated.

Policy HS-37►   The City will seek to maintain and enhance communications between com-
                munity residents and the police through regular meetings and a visible
                community policing program.
Policy HS-38►   The City encourages the design of neighborhoods and buildings in a man-
                ner that discourages crime and provides security and safety for people and
                property.
Policy HS-39►   The City encourages the use of Crime Prevention Through Environmental
                Design (CPTED) principles in the design of private development projects
                and public facilities. These basic principles include:
                Natural Surveillance
                A design concept directed primarily at keeping intruders easily observable.
                Promoted by features that maximize visibility of people, parking areas and
                building entrances: doors and windows that look out on to streets and park-
                ing areas; pedestrian-friendly sidewalks and streets; front porches; ade-
                quate nighttime lighting.
                Territorial Reinforcement
                Physical design can create or extend a sphere of influence. Users then de-
                velop a sense of territorial control while potential offenders, perceiving this
                control, are discouraged. This experience is promoted by features that de-
                fine property lines and distinguish private spaces from public spaces by us-
                ing landscape plantings, pavement designs, gateway treatments, and
                “CPTED" fences.
                Natural Access Control
                A design concept directed primarily at decreasing crime opportunity by de-
                nying access to crime targets and creating in offenders a perception of risk.
                This is gained by designing streets, sidewalks, building entrances and

                    neighborhood gateways to clearly indicate public routes and discouraging
                    general access to private areas through structural and design elements.
                    Target Hardening
                    Accomplished by features that prohibit entry or access: window locks, dead
                    bolts for doors, interior door hinges.

                  HOUSING BACKGROUND
                  REPORT
                  The City of Madera last updated its Housing
                  Element in March 2004. The Element was
                  subsequently certified as legally adequate by
                  the California Department of Housing and
                  Community Development (HCD). The docu-
                  ment was originally intended to serve the 5-
                  year Housing Element planning period of
                  2000 to 2005, which was part of the greater
                  1998-2005 RHNA planning period. However,
                  state law extended the Housing Element
                  planning period to 2002 due to a statewide
                  slowdown in housing construction during the
                  1990s.This Housing Element is a comprehen-
                  sive update of that 2004 Housing Element
                  and is intended to serve a planning period
                  from 2009 to 2014 as part of the 2007 to 2014
                  RHNA planning period. Upon its adoption, this
                  Element will become part of the General Plan,
                  which was updated in 2009.
                  OVERVIEW OF STATE REQUIREMENTS
                  State law recognizes the vital role local gov-
                  ernments play in the supply and affordability
                  of housing. Each local government in Califor-
                  nia is required to adopt a comprehensive,
CITY OF MADERA GENERAL PLAN | OCTOBER 2009               7-1
CHAPTER 7     HOUSING ELEMENT
                    long-term general plan for the physical development of the city or county. The
                    Housing Element is one of the seven mandated elements of the local general
                    plan. State law requires local government plans to address the existing and
                    projected housing needs of all economic segments of the community through
                    their housing elements. The law acknowledges that, in order for the private
                    market to adequately address housing needs and demand, local govern-
                    ments must adopt land use plans and regulatory systems that provide oppor-
                    tunities for, and do not unduly constrain, housing development. As a result,
                    housing policy in the state rests largely upon the effective implementation of
                    local general plans and, in particular, local Housing Elements.
                    The purpose of the Housing Element is to identify the community's housing
                    needs, to state the community’s goals and objectives with regard to housing
                    production, rehabilitation, and conservation to meet those needs, and to de-
                    fine the policies and programs that the community will implement to achieve
                    the stated goals and objectives.
                    State law requires cities and counties to address the needs of all income
                    groups in their Housing Elements. The official definition of these needs is

                    State housing law (Government Code Section 65580) requires an assess-
                    ment of housing needs and an inventory of resources and constraints rele-
                    vant to meeting those needs. The assessment and inventory must include all
                    of the following:
                        •   Analysis of population and employment trends and documentation of
                            projections and a quantification of the locality's existing and projected
                            housing needs for all income levels. Such existing and projected
                            needs shall include the locality's share of the regional housing need in
                            accordance with Section 65584.
                        •   Analysis and documentation of household characteristics including
                            level of payment compared to ability to pay, and housing characteris-
                            tics including the extent of overcrowding and an estimate of housing
                            stock conditions.

    •   A site-specific inventory of land suitable for residential development,
        including vacant and underutilized sites, and an analysis of the rela-
        tionship of zoning, public facilities, and city services to these sites.
    •   Analysis of potential and actual governmental constraints upon the
        maintenance, improvement, or development of housing for all income
        levels. These constraints include land use controls, building codes
        and their enforcement, site improvements, fees and other exactions
        required of developers, and local processing and permit procedures.
    •   Analysis of potential and actual non-governmental constraints upon
        the maintenance, improvement, or development of housing for all in-
        come levels, including the availability of financing, the price of land,
        and the cost of construction.
    •   Analysis of any special housing needs populations, such as those with
        disabilities, the elderly, large families, farmworkers, the homeless, and
        single-parent households.
    •   Analysis of opportunities for energy conservation with respect to resi-
        dential development.
The Housing Needs Assessment of the Housing Element identifies the nature
and extent of the City’s housing needs that in turn provide the basis for the
City’s response to those needs in the Policy Document. In addition to identify-
ing housing needs, the Background Report also presents information on the
setting in which the needs occur, which provides a better understanding of
the community and facilitates planning for housing.
The following sections satisfy state housing law requirements and provide the
foundation for the goals, policies, implementation programs, and quantified
objectives. The Housing Element Background Report is organized as fol-
lows:

                        •   Evaluation of Existing Housing Element Accomplishments
                    These chapters draw on a broad range of informational sources. Information
                    on population, housing stock, and economics comes primarily from the 2000
                    U.S. Census, the California Department of Finance 2008 projections, and City
                    of Madera records. In addition to the public databases researched to update
                    demographic data, the City incorporated projections reported by Claritas.
                    Claritas is a marketing firm that utilizes an array of original data sources
                    (Census, postal activity, State Departments and other publicly available data)
                    as a basis to calculate demographic projections for localities. Claritas is used
                    as a source throughout Madera’s Housing Element Update for 2008 demo-
                    graphic updates. Information on available sites and services for housing
                    comes from numerous public agencies. Information on constraints on hous-
                    ing production and past and current housing efforts in Madera comes from
                    City staff, other public agencies, and some private sources.
                    General Plan and Housing Element Differences
                    The Housing Element is one of seven state-mandated elements that every
                    general plan must contain. Although the Housing Element must follow all the
                    requirements of the general plan, the Housing Element has several state-
                    mandated requirements that distinguish it from other general plan elements.

                     HOUSING ELEMENT                                   CHAPTER 7
Whereas the state allows local government the ability to decide when to up-
date their general plan, state law sets the schedule for periodic updates (5-
year time frame) of the Housing Element. Local governments are also re-
quired to submit draft and adopted Housing Elements to the California De-
partment of Housing and Community Development to review for compliance
with state law and ensure that the Housing Element meets numerous state
mandates. Upon satisfaction of these requirements, the state will certify that
the City’s Housing Element is legally adequate. Failure to comply with state
law could result in potentially serious consequences (e.g., reduced access to
infrastructure, transportation, and housing funding; vulnerability to lawsuits)
that extend beyond the realm of residential land use planning.
DEMOGRAPHIC AND EMPLOYMENT CHARACTERISTICS AND TRENDS
The purpose of this discussion is to establish the baseline population and
employment characteristics for the City of Madera. Some data is presented
to show a trend over time (2000 to 2008 where possible) and other data is
presented alongside comparable data for Madera County and the State of
California depending on availability of data. This facilitates an understanding
of the City’s characteristics by illustrating how the City is similar to, or differs
from, the county and the state in various aspects related to demographic cha-
racteristics and needs.
Population
Table I-1 indicates the historic population trends for the City of Madera. As
shown in the table, during the past 10 years the City has experienced the
greatest rate of growth since the 1950s. Between 1990 and 2000, the City
experienced a 48 percent population increase. The State Department of Fi-
nance estimates that the annual average population growth between 2000
and 2008 (3 percent) was slower than the growth experienced in the 1990 to
2000 decade (4.8 percent). Claritas projects that the average annual popula-
tion growth between the 5-year time period, 2008 to 2013, will be lower than
the 2000 to 2008 period, signaling that there is a decline in the rate at which
the City will grow.

                                             Between 2000 and 2008, the proportion of the City’s population in the 25 to
                                             35 age group grew most rapidly, increasing its share from 15.7 to 17.5 per-
                                             cent of the total. This group was followed by the 35 to 44 age group, which
                                             increased from 12.6 to 13.8 percent of the total. The group with the greatest
                                             decline in share of Madera’s population was the 20 to 24 age group, which
                                             declined from 9.0 to 6.8 percent. The 15 to 19 age group population saw an
                                             increase of 9.39 percent in 2008. The 55 to 85+ age population did not ex-
                                             perience significant change between 2000 and 2008, with 14.4 percent and
                                             14.2 percent respectively. The percentage share of the population between
                                             the ages 25 and 59, shows that over the 8 year period the City experienced
                                             positive growth within this age cohort.. In 2000 the total percentage share for
                                             the 25-59 age groups was 41 percent. In 2008 the percentage share in-
                                             creased to 46.0 percent.

                                              changed only slightly from 2000. In 2000, there were approximately 600

                                              57.6 percent in 1990. The “other” population group has also increased, from
                                              43 percent in 2000 to 47 percent in 2008. The black population in Madera
                                              has declined from 3.8 percent in 2000 to 2.9 percent in 2008. The Asian or
                                              Pacific Islander populations also declined from 3 percent in 2000 to 2 percent

                        The increase in total households between 2000 and 2008 was 27.9 percent,
                        greatly exceeding the increase of households in the U.S. (8.7 percent). The
                        U.S. Census divides households into two different categories, depending on
                        their composition.
                            •   Family households are those which consist of two or more related
                                persons living together.
                            •   Non-family households include persons who live alone or in groups
                                composed of unrelated individuals.
                        Between 1990 and 2000 the share of family households in Madera increased
                        from 75.9 percent to 78.8 percent. As demonstrated in Table I-2, the ratio of
                        families to nonfamilies remained unchanged between 2000 and 2008.

Table I-3 shows the income distribution of 2000 and 2008 households for the
City of Madera. All households earning less than $35,000 decreased in
overall percentages in 2008 versus in 2000. Those households earning less
than $15,000 saw the greatest reduction in percentage; in 2000 this group
represented 22 percent of the total population, while in 2008 this group repre-
sented 18 percent. Most of these households would be considered extremely
low-income. Based on the 2008 Madera County State Income Limits, the
Area Median Income, for a family of four considered extremely low-income is
less than $16,500. According to 2008 income information, that would include
all of the households in the “less than $15,000” category and some in the
“$15,000-$24,999” category or approximately 3,002 households. The house-
holds that earn $35,000–$50,000 remained consistent between 2000 and
2008 at 18 percent of the total population. All households earning over
$50,000 have also increased in percentages, with the largest percentage in-
crease realized by those persons earning between $50,000 and $75,000. The
median household income also increased significantly by 27 percent from
$31,033 in 2000 to $39,330 in 2008. These are income figures for the City
based on the 2000 Decennial Census and projections based on those Cen-
sus numbers. The median income is the midpoint of all incomes reported in
the City during the Census. In 2000 the U.S median household income was
$41,994 and in California it was $47,493. In 2008 the U.S. median income is
expected to grow 60 percent and is estimated to be $67,019. The 2008 Cali-
fornia median household income is estimated to be $70,712, which is an in-
crease of 48 percent.

                             force of Madera County and has half of the total unemployed persons in the
                             County. The December 2008 unemployment rate at 15.6 percent for the City
                             of Madera is significantly higher than the 11 percent rate within the County as
                             a whole. In June 2007, the County of Madera’s unemployment rate was 7.5

                                that the unemployment rate in the U.S. had increased to 7.2 percent and in

                             2008. The sales and office sector was the major employment sector for the
                             City, accounting for 21.62 percent of the City’s employment. As shown in the

                             ment sector for the City, accounting for the City’s fairly large farmworker pop-
                             ulation. The significant employers in all sectors included the City of Madera,

                     3 percent for the Construction sector, which experienced an increase due to
                     the housing boom that occurred within Madera after the 2000 data was col-

                              fastest growing occupation groups in the Madera Metropolitan Statistical Area
                              (MSA). During the next six years, the Madera Metropolitan Statistical Area
                              expects new employment to be concentrated in a variety of occupations rang-
                              ing from construction occupations to healthcare professions. According to
                              HCD’s annual income limits, the AMI in Madera for a family of four in 2008
                              was $53,800. Many of the faster growing occupations pay wages that are
                              lower than this median income figure. For a family with only one income,
                              these common, lower paying jobs may cause difficulty to afford housing, but
                              for a family with two able workers and two incomes, two of these jobs would
                              likely allow that family to afford safe and decent housing. However, it is im-
                              portant to note that two of the largest employment sectors, Farming, Fishing
                              and Forestry Occupations, and Office and Administrative Support Occupa-

                              HOUSING AND HOUSEHOLD CHARACTERISTICS
                              Table I-8 shows the Department of Finance-estimated population and hous-
                              ing units for the City of Madera. As indicated in this table, the City has had a
                              steady annual increase in population. Between 1990 and 2000 there was a
                              total population increase of 13,922 and between 2000 and 2008 there was a
                              total increase of 13,505. The City has also experienced a similar pace in the
                              growth of its number of housing units during that same period. One can see
                              a period of growth in both the population and housing units during 2005 to
                              2007, with 2007 showing a very strong growth rate. In 2008 the City experi-
                              enced a significant decrease in housing production as did the State and the
                              U.S. Staff estimates that new housing units in 2009 would reflect less than a
                              1% growth rate. The limited access to financial capital and increased financial
                              risk associated with constructing new residential units has led to a decline in
                              development activity.

CHAPTER 7     HOUSING ELEMENT
                    Table I-9 compares the City of Madera with Madera County and California
                    using the 2000 U.S. Census and 2008 Department of Finance estimates for
                    population, household and housing unit growth.
                    The City of Madera experienced a 4 percent annual average population
                    growth rate from 2000 to 2008, which is actually somewhat higher than what
                    was experienced by Madera County (3 percent) and twice the growth rate for
                    California (2 percent) as a whole during this period. The total number of
                    households and the number of housing units also increased at a significantly
                    higher annual rate than was the case with California.
                    In the City of Madera, the 2000 and 2008 average household size was 3.57
                    persons, significantly higher than its 1990 size of 2.97. The household size
                    in the City is somewhat higher than both the Madera County and state aver-
                    ages of 3.19 and 2.9 persons, respectively.
                    HOUSING AND HOUSEHOLD CHARACTERISTICS
                    Housing Stock Characteristics
                    Table I-10 presents comparative data on the housing stock in the City of Ma-
                    dera, Madera County, and California. The table breaks out the total housing
                    stock in each area according to the type of structures in which units are lo-
                    cated, total occupied units, and vacancy rates.
                    As shown in the table, single-family detached housing units account for the
                    majority of housing for the City of Madera, Madera County, and the entire
                    state. However, the City of Madera has a slightly larger proportion of single-
                    family detached units than the state. This category for the City of Madera in-
                    creased from 65 to 70 percent single-family detached units. All other catego-
                    ries for the City of Madera, County of Madera, and State of California re-
                    mained consistent from 2000 to 2008.

In the absence of a recent housing condition survey, the City must estimate
the condition of its housing stock according to the age of the stock. The U.S.
Census provides data on the age of a community’s housing stock. This data
is an acceptable indicator of the likely condition of the housing stock. Accord-
ing to Claritas and seen in Table I-11, 26 percent of the housing stock was
less than ten years old, a substantial increase from 2000 that accounts for a
strong housing construction cycle the City experienced during this time. Ap-
proximately 43 percent of housing units were built before 1970. It is probable
that many of these older units require some level of rehabilitation and some
would require replacement. A poll of City Staff concluded that as much as 17
percent of the housing stock may need substantial repair or renovation s such
as new roofs, replacement of HVAC systems. Overall, the City of Madera’s
housing supply increased by 4,308 housing units from 1999 when the 2000
Census data was collected to 2008, a 26 percent increase for this area. The
current estimated median year for structures built in the City of Madera is
1985.

 1   The 2000 Census recorded housing units through March 2000 in the “1999 to March 2000” category and the California Department of
     Finance provides a housing unit number for the entire year of 2000. The data for the first three months of 2000 cannot be separated so
     there may be some overlap, which would explain the slightly different total housing unit number in this table compared to Table I-8.
                                  Housing Utilization – Overcrowding and Tenure
                                  The number of households in Madera increased by nearly 30 percent be-
                                  tween 2000 and 2007, establishing a strong growth trend that continued until
                                  the dramatic market changed that caused a reduction in production in 2008.
                                  The City is expected to host a higher proportion of owner-occupied house-
                                  holds than renter-occupied households. As shown in Table I-12, between
                                  2000 and 2008, the proportion of owner-occupied households was estimated
                                  to have increased by one percentage point.

               Data on housing overcrowding are available from the 2000 U.S. Census in
               the form of the number of persons per room in occupied housing units. Table
               I-13 compares data for Madera with data for the County as a whole. Typically,
               a housing unit is considered to be overcrowded if there are more than 1.0
               persons per room and is considered severely overcrowded if there are more
               than 1.5 persons per room. A “room” in this context includes bedrooms and
               living rooms but not kitchen or bathroom facilities. A family of five living in a
               three bedroom home with one living room would be calculated as 1.25 per-
               sons per room and therefore, would technically be considered “overcrowded”.
               In total, 74 percent of the City of Madera’s occupied housing units were not
               overcrowded (having 1.0 or less persons per room) in 2000, which means 26
               percent would be considered overcrowded. This 26 percent is made up of
               the following percentage (out of the total housing units):
                    •   11 percent had between 1.01 and 1.50 persons per room,
                    •   7 percent had between 1.51 and 2.0 persons per room, and
                    •   8 percent had more than 2.0 persons per room.
               Regarding tenure, more than 33 percent of the overcrowded households are
               owner-occupied. Only 16 percent (1,019) of the owner households had 1.01
               or more persons per room, while approximately 37 percent (2,091) of Made-

                        than 1.0 persons per room. These statistics reveal a higher rate of over-
                        crowding in City of Madera than in the County, which can be expected of the
                        main urban center in a rural county.

                         tained 3 or 4 bedrooms. In 2008, this number greatly increased to 68 percent
                         of homes containing 3 or 4 bedrooms. The percentage of 1- and 2-bedroom
                         homes decreased in 2008, as it would appear the housing market favored the
                         construction of 3 or more bedroom homes. The 3-bedroom house saw the
                         greatest increase from 2000 to 2008, at 12 percent.

 N.B. – In 2008, 73 housing units were constructed that contained “No bedrooms.” Although this figure is less than 1 percent of
 the housing stock in Madera, it may be interesting to observe if this trend continues, with studio apartments as a viable, afford-
 able housing option in the future.

Housing Vacancy Rates
Vacant units are essential to the healthy function of the housing market. Va-
cancies are necessary to facilitate population mobility. They also have an
important role in market pricing mechanisms. Too few vacancies can have
an undesirable upward effect on prices. Conversely, excessive vacancy
rates can have an inhibiting effect on investment in housing, including main-
tenance of rental properties. There are several types of vacancy rates. For
determining shortages and surpluses in the housing market, the most impor-
tant of these is the “market vacancy rate.” This term refers to the number of
vacant units that are for sale or rent as a percentage of the market (all occu-
pied units and all vacant for sale or rent units).
There is no vacancy rate that is an appropriate market vacancy rate in all
housing markets. However in most urban housing markets, a market vacancy
rate of about 4 percent balances both the mobility needs of consumers and
the investment interest of property owners. An extremely low vacancy rate,
such as 1.5 percent for apartment units, will tend to raise rents and can result
in household overpayment, inability to qualify, and possibly overcrowding.
There are vacant units that are not for sale or rent, such as second homes,
units held off the market, seasonal units, and units for migratory workers.
Collectively, these types of vacant units are often referred to as "other va-
cant" units. The vacancy rates which include these vacant units are called
“gross vacancy rates.”
Five percent is often used as a rule of thumb for a desirable gross vacancy
rate. However, 5 percent is not suitable for use in all geographic areas. A 5
percent total vacancy rate is appropriate in most urban areas because it al-
lows for about a 4 percent market vacancy rate and about a 1 percent “other
vacancy” rate. In areas with significant numbers of second homes or migra-
tory units, however, 5 percent is far too low a total vacancy rate because it
would indicate a serious shortage of market units. A 5 percent rate would
probably be appropriate for Madera.

                      To supplement and provide a comparison of the California Department of Fi-
                      nance (DOF) vacancy data shown in Table I-10, the 2000 Census vacancy
                      data is shown in Table I-15. As revealed in Table I-15, vacancy rates are
                      much lower and are most likely a more accurate reflection of the vacancies
                      that are present in Madera, Madera County, and California. This table also
                      shows that vacancy rates for the City of Madera are somewhat lower than
                      Madera County but almost similar to the state as a whole.

                      Table I-15a reveals that in 2006 approximately 90 percent of the housing
                      units in Madera were occupied. The homeowner vacancy rate was 4.7 per-
                      cent and is consistent with a rate considered appropriate for Madera. The
                      rental vacancy rate was lower, just over 2 percent, which may be low for this
                      area and could potentially contribute to higher rents and less affordable hous-
                      ing options available at that time.

                Table I-16 identifies the housing costs reported for the City of Madera in
                2006. It is important to note that the greatest majority of the population, ap-
                proximately 25 percent, pays between $1,000 and $1,500 per month for
                housing costs. At $12,000 to $18,000 per year, this cost can equate to a
                large portion of a household’s monthly expenses. Considering that the me-
                dian household income in 2008 was $53,800, these housing costs equate to
                22 to 31 percent of a household’s income, not adjusted for inflation. Ap-
                proximately 18 percent of the population in 2006 paid more than this for their
                housing costs.

Table I-17 provides a summary of households that overpay for housing as a
percentage of household income. According to the data presented in Table I-
17, 38 percent of households currently overpay for housing. A household
that pays more than 30 percent of gross monthly income for rent or a mort-
gage payment overpays for housing. Households that pay more between 30
and 34 percent on shelter cost are considered to be burdened by the cost of
housing and households paying more than 35 percent on shelter cost are
considered to be severely burdened by the cost of housing. As seen in Table
17, 45 percent of all renter occupied households overpaid for housing in
2000, which was 14 percent higher than the percentage of owner occupied
households (31 percent) overpaying for housing. Approximately 2,991 of the
4,336 households that overpaid for housing earned less than $20,000, which
represented 69 percent of all households overpaying. The high percentage
of households earning less than $20,000 that were overpaying for housing
highlights the housing burden experienced by lower wage earners.
Housing Element law requires the City to quantify the total number of ex-
tremely low-income households that own versus rent their homes. In Made-
ra, extremely low-income households are those that earn up to $16,150 (4-
person household) and as shown in the table below, there are 1,260 house-
holds earning between $0 and $10,000 annually and approximately 943
households in the $10,001 to $19,999 category (62 percent of the $10,001 to
$19,999 category would fall into the extremely low category), for an approxi-
mate total of 2,203 extremely low-income households that rent their homes.
Approximately 837 extremely low-income households own their homes in the
City.

                            Within the general population, there are several groups of people who have
                            special housing needs. This section identifies the special needs households
                            in the City of Madera. This review is essential because a major part of the

riers to residents whose needs are not normally met by the private sector.
This segment of the City’s population is constrained by the housing market
not only because of lower incomes, but also because of the lack of housing
that is suitable to their special needs. When the housing market does not
meet their needs, families or individuals must settle for substandard housing
or must pay more than they can afford. These needs can make it difficult for
members of these groups to locate suitable housing. The following subsec-
tions discuss the special housing needs of six groups identified in state hous-
ing element law (Government Code, Section 65583(a)(7)). Specifically, spe-
cial housing needs groups include:
    •   senior households,
    •   persons with disabilities,
    •   large households
    •   single-headed households,
    •   homeless persons,
    •   farmworkers.
Where possible, estimates of the population or number of households in Ma-
dera falling into each group are presented.
Senior Households
Senior households are defined as households with one or more persons over
the age of 65 years. Table I-18 below presents a comparison of the number
of persons over the age of 65 years in Madera in 2000 and in 2008. The sen-
ior population decreased by 2.1 percent to 7.7 percent in Madera between
2000 and 2008. The male senior population declined 0.4 percent, the female
population declined by 1.7 percent.

                                 In 2000, 495 seniors were 85 years and older, which makes up 1.1 percent
                                of the Madera population as a whole. In 2008, this number slightly de-
                                creased, with those 85 years and older representing 1.0 percent of the Made-
                                ra population as a whole. According to the 2000 Census data, 946 seniors
                                lived alone (24.8 percent of the senior population).

 1 Total population is slightly higher than in previous tables that source the California Department of Finance because the
     population by age numbers are not available from that source for 2008 but are available from Claritas projections, which
     shows a slightly higher population.
                                In 2006, the majority of senior households in Madera were homeowners. Of
                                all 2006 households headed by a person 65 years or older, 76 percent owned
                                their homes and 24 percent rented. In contrast, the households headed by a
                                non-senior person are more evenly distributed between owners and renters,
                                at 50 percent and 49 percent respectively. One can deduce that many sen-
                                iors have purchased their homes and are less inclined to move than younger
                                populations.
                                Although there are many more senior homeowners, it is the renters who ex-
                                perience the greatest housing needs due to low, fixed incomes and rising ren-
                                tal rates. Senior homeowners, however, face the problem of maintaining their
                                homes, often on fixed incomes.

                             According to statistics from the American Community Survey conducted by
                             the U.S. Census Bureau in 2006, 11,127 households receive Social Security
                             Income in the Madera MSA, and 2,835 households collected Supplemental
                             Security Income (SSI) as well. (Note that this figure includes seniors who
                             may have qualified for SSI before age 65 because of a disability.) Retired
                             workers in California received an average monthly benefit of $1,002 in 2005.
                             SSI is a needs-based program that pays monthly benefits to persons who are
                             65 or older, are blind, or have a disability. Seniors who have never worked or
                             have insufficient work credits to qualify for Social Security disability often re-
                             ceive SSI benefits. The federal SSI payment is determined by the recipient's
                             countable income, living arrangement, and marital status. As of Janu-
                             ary 2006, the maximum monthly federal SSI payment for an individual living
                             in his or her own household and with no other countable income is $603, and
                             for a couple, $904. SSI is the only source of income for a number of low-
                             income seniors. With these maximum monthly benefit amounts, SSI recipi-
                             ents are likely to have difficulty in finding housing that fits within their budgets
                             since they can afford to pay only $181 for a single person or $271 for a cou-

                    The Senior Services Division, which is part of the City’s Parks and Commu-
                    nity Services Department, provides services countywide for senior citizens 55
                    years and older. Services include recreation, meals, special outings, health
                    services, and information and referral. The Senior Nutrition Program, funded
                    in part by the Fresno-Madera Area Agency on Aging, serves hot meals at two
                    centers in Madera, the Frank Bergon Senior Center and the Pan Am Com-
                    munity Center. The senior coordinator and staff at the centers made the fol-
                    lowing observations regarding seniors’ housing needs:
                        •   There is not enough affordable housing for seniors. The waiting lists
                            for the existing senior projects are too long.
                        •   Many seniors have extremely low incomes, such as from SSI, and
                            cannot afford to pay much rent.
                        •   Many of the units with rents low enough so that they are affordable to
                            seniors with extremely low incomes are substandard.
                        •   Some seniors need more services than are currently provided at the
                            existing senior developments. They need assistance with housekeep-
                            ing, transportation to medical appointments, and other supportive ser-
                            vices that could be arranged through a services coordinator, if such
                            services were provided for residents.
                    There are three existing senior housing developments in Madera, Valle de
                    Las Brisas, Yosemite Manor, and Madera Garden, with a total of 221 units.
                    In addition, the Madera Housing Authority manages 70 units of conventional
                    public housing that are designated for seniors. There are waiting lists for all
                    of these units.

                            Table I-20 presents information from the 2006 American Community Survey
                            on the disability status of persons 5 years and older. Small portions, 2 per-
                            cent, of those aged 5 to 15 have a disability. As shown, approximately 13
                            percent of Madera’s population 16 to 64 years of age has a disability. The
                            percentage of seniors (65 years and older) with a disability is much larger at
                            44 percent.

                            The statistics for the SSI program also provide information on the number of
                            persons with disabilities who may have housing needs because of their low
                            incomes. As of December 2005, there were 3,284 SSI recipients in Madera
                            who were receiving benefits because they are blind or disabled. Although
                            these figures can give a sense of the proportion of the population with differ-

                    ent types of disabilities, a much smaller proportion of the population may ac-
                    tually require specially adapted housing to accommodate disabilities.
                    The Department of Mental Health provides and coordinates housing services
                    for people who are mentally ill. The department works closely with facility
                    and service providers in the County, such as the Madera County Community
                    Action Agency and the Rescue Mission, to ensure that clients receive hous-
                    ing services and other supportive services.
                    Housing programs for persons with disabilities are primarily available through
                    the Madera Housing Authority. Many of the units identified for seniors are al-
                    so available to persons with disabilities.
                    Large Households
                    According to Table I-21, there were 1,518 large families (five or more mem-
                    bers) living in Madera in 2000. This total accounts for 29 percent of the total
                    number of households in the City. These households usually require housing
                    with 4 or more bedrooms, which is rare especially among apartment units and
                    rentals in general.
                    Table I-21 also depicts the updated 2008 figures for all households by
                    household size within Madera. Two-person households are consistently the
                    highest percentage of the demographic makeup of the community, although
                    in 2000 (Table I-2), non-family households had a slightly higher amount of
                    one-person households. Another trend to note is that in 2008, the one-
                    person, three-person, and four-person households were each approximately
                    16 percent of the total households. Madera maintains a consistent percent-
                    age of five-plus person households, just shy of 30 percent.

                             Large households require housing units with more bedrooms than housing
                             units needed by smaller households. In general, housing for these house-
                             holds should provide safe outdoor play areas for children and should be lo-
                             cated to provide convenient access to schools and child-care facilities. These
                             types of needs can pose problems particularly for large families that cannot
                             afford to buy or rent single-family houses, as apartment and condominium
                             units are most often developed with childless, smaller households in mind.
                             The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) defines a
                             large household or family as one with five or more members. According to the
                             2008 estimates, 4,439 households, or 29 percent of the total households in
                             Madera, had five or more members. Approximately 10 percent, or 1,588
                             households, had seven or more members. This is a dramatic increase from
                             the figures in the 2000 Census, where 6 percent of all households (538) had
                             seven or more members.

                         Table I-22 illustrates changes in tenure that occurred between the 2000 Cen-
                        sus and the 2006 American Community survey (this is the most up-to-date in-
                        formation available on tenure by household size). It appears a change oc-
                        curred from 2000, when most of the large households were renters (1,823 or
                        55 percent) compared to 45 percent (1,507) who were owners. In 2006, there
                        were 2,261 large households (24 percent) that were owner occupied, while
                        2,813 (34 percent) of large households were renter occupied. For both ren-
                        ter- and owner-occupied households, four-person households tend to be the
                        most common household size.

                         Single-Headed Households
                         According to the U.S. Census Bureau, a single-headed household contains a
                         household head and at least one dependent, which could include a child, an
                         elderly parent, or non-related child. As shown in Table I-23, the 2008 esti-
                         mate indicated that there are 2,066 households headed by a female, repre-
                         senting 14 percent of all Madera households. The majority (98 percent) of
                         these female-headed households (2,040) have children living in them who
                         are under 18 years of age. Within the households where there are no chil-
                         dren present, females consistently outnumber males, for both family and non-
                         family members. This may relate to women generally living longer than men
                         and residing with either family or non-family members.
                         Due to lower incomes, single-headed households often have more difficulties
                         finding adequate, affordable housing than families with two adults. Also, sin-
                         gle-headed households with small children may need to pay for childcare,
                         which further reduces disposable income. This special needs group will bene-
                         fit generally from expanded affordable housing opportunities. More specifi-
                         cally, the need for dependent care also makes it important that housing for
                         single-headed families be located near childcare facilities, schools, youth ser-
                         vices, medical facilities, or senior services.

                           Homeless Persons
                           As elsewhere in the nation, homelessness is usually the end result of multiple
                           factors that converge in a person's life. The combination of loss of employ-
                           ment, inability to find a job because of the need for retraining, and high hous-
                           ing costs lead to some individuals and families losing their housing. For oth-
                           ers, the loss of housing is due to chronic health problems, physical disabili-
                           ties, mental health disabilities, or drug and alcohol addictions, along with an
                           inability to access the services and long-term support needed to address
                           these conditions. The best available data on the homeless population in Ma-
                           dera comes from the Continuum of Care survey discussed below.
                           The cities and counties of Madera and Fresno have joined to form the Fresno
                           Madera Continuum of Care (FMCoC) to work together to prevent, reduce,
                           and end homelessness in the San Joaquin Valley. Among the Continuum of
                           Care’s goals are the following:
                               •    Enhance and stabilize the homeless service and housing provider or-
                                    ganizations within the area.

    •   Increase the amount of affordable, long-term housing for families that
        are completing transitional housing programs.
    •   Work with Community Development Corporations in Fresno and Ma-
        dera to increase the inventory of affordable housing in revitalization
        areas.
    •   Implement a Homeless Management Information System to be used
        for tracking, reporting and coordinating available resources and need.
    •   Develop and conduct a Homeless Survey to collect data required for
        gaps analysis and to secure funding.
The Continuum of Care sponsored the Homeless Access to Care Survey,
which was conducted March 26–27, 2002, by trained volunteers from multiple
agencies that administered surveys to clients visiting their offices. In addition,
many agencies sent volunteers out to administer surveys on the street in lo-
cations where homeless individuals commonly seek shelter. A total of 1,779
surveys were completed and tabulated for Fresno and Madera counties. Of
the 1,779 persons interviewed, 465 were from Madera County. Some facts
about the homeless population in the area based on the survey responses
are the following:
    •   Sex – About 52 percent of the homeless population is male.
    •   Race/Ethnicity – The majority (42 percent) is Latino, with whites at 33
        percent and African American at 15 percent.
    •   Employment Status – Approximately 17 percent of the homeless are
        employed.
    •   Veterans – Veterans make up approximately 17 percent of the home-
        less.

CHAPTER 7     HOUSING ELEMENT
                        •    Ex-Offender – Approximately 20 percent are ex-offenders.
                        •    Domestic – Twenty-four percent are the victims of domestic violence.
                        •    Prior Homelessness – Almost half of those surveyed (49 percent) re-
                             ported that they had been homeless before.
                        •    Current Housing – Almost 10 percent reported that they were living on
                             the street or in their vehicle, while 18 percent were living in an emer-
                             gency shelter. Others reported that they were in transitional housing
                             (27 percent) or living with a relative or friend (21 percent).
                    Facilities and services for homeless people in Madera are provided primarily
                    by the Madera County Community Action Agency, which operates two emer-
                    gency shelter facilities, a transitional shelter facility, two transitional housing
                    sites (Mount Laura Shelter and the Martha Diaz Center), and a motel voucher
                    program within the City. Additional services, such as motel vouchers through
                    Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), are provided by the Made-
                    ra County Welfare Department.
                    The biannual Point-In-Time Homeless Street Count was completed in the
                    Fresno and Madera region on January 26, 2007. This FMCoC study involved
                    a day-long data collection strategy, using the personal interview method of
                    individuals on the street, in areas known to be frequented by homeless per-
                    sons, including the perimeters of emergency shelters, soup kitchens, parks,
                    railways, and under bridges. More than 100 community members including
                    homeless service providers, private citizens, public agency representatives,
                    and justice and social service agencies participated in the one-day Point-In-
                    Time count of homeless on the street. Approximately 769 persons in Fresno
                    were interviewed, and 72 persons in Madera were interviewed. The results of
                    the Madera survey are as follows:
                        •    The majority of respondents resided in Madera less than a year, with
                             54 percent staying at an emergency shelter.

                     HOUSING ELEMENT                                CHAPTER 7
    •   Of those respondents who stayed in a shelter, 54 percent claim they
        were not offered services to assist with long-term housing.
    •   Approximately 80 percent of respondents were single, with 70 percent
        of respondents being men.
    •   Almost 60 percent of the respondents were aged 31 to 50 years old.
    •   53 percent of the population has been homeless for a year or more.
    •   44 percent of the respondents graduated from high school, with 17
        percent of respondents having some college education.
    •   67 percent of the population claimed to make between $0 and $500
        per month, with 31 percent of this income derived from food stamps,
        followed by Medicaid at 24 percent.
In addition to the shelter options provided by the Madera County Community
Action Agency, the Madera Rescue Mission provides services for men, wom-
en and children, including shelter, three meals a day, showers, and clothing
giveaways. According to the City’s 2005-2010 Consolidated Plan, there are
70 beds for individuals with emergency shelter needs, 34 transitional beds for
individuals, and no permanent supportive housing beds. For families, there
are currently no emergency shelter or permanent supportive housing beds,
but there are 12 transitional beds for families.
Farmworkers
Farmworkers accounted for 14 percent of the employed persons living in Ma-
dera in 2000. The 2000 Census reported a total of 1,972 Madera residents
who were employed in farming, forestry, and fishing occupations. Projections
for 2008 estimated the number of farming, fishing, and forestry jobs at 2,584,
which was about 13 percent of the workforce (persons aged 16 and older).

CHAPTER 7     HOUSING ELEMENT
                    A special report prepared for the Madera Housing Authority and the Darin M.
                    Camarena Health Centers Inc. provides current information on the needs of
                    farmworkers in Madera County. The study included surveys of agricultural
                    workers to assess the current health and housing options for agricultural
                    workers in Madera and to identify some of the problems that they are facing.
                    The special study consists of surveys of 200 agricultural workers, the Immi-
                    grant Voice Survey, and the Agricultural Worker Health and Housing Program
                    (AWHHP) survey, as well as three focus group sessions to discuss current
                    and future health and housing needs of these farmworkers.
                    Findings from this special study include the following:
                        •  Large and Growing Families – Average family size was 5.8 persons.
                           Most of the households had at least one child under the age of 10.
                        •  Household Income – A reasonable estimate of the typical hourly pay
                           (or piece work equivalent) for these agricultural workers would be
                           $6.75 to $8 per hour. This, combined with the high level of underem-
                           ployment, results in very low household incomes. The average
                           household income for AWHHP participants was $12,055.
                        •  Living Arrangements - The majority of the AWHHP participants were
                           living in houses (67), followed by apartments (24), single rooms (6),
                           and mobile homes (1).
                        •  Housing Quality - Almost half of the AWHHP respondents reported
                           problems with insects or vermin infestation. Other problems included
                           heating and cooling, plumbing, electrical wiring, and sewer. Approxi-
                           mately 10 percent in both surveys cited poor quality housing as the
                           reason for their last move.
                        •  Lack of Affordable Housing - The need for more affordable housing
                           options, as either apartment complexes or homes, was the focus of
                           much of the discussion at the three focus group meetings.

    •   Exploitation by Landlords - With their low incomes and in some cases
        undocumented status, many workers are vulnerable to being exploited
        by landlords. Landlords may fail to make necessary repairs, leaving
        tenants to make repairs on their own. In addition, rental deposits are
        often excessive.
The study points concludes that the very low wages paid to agricultural work-
ers, the seasonal nature of farm labor, and the rising housing costs in the
Central Valley pose serious constraints on the ability of Madera’s agricultural
workers to secure decent and affordable housing. The ineligibility of un-
documented workers for government-sponsored housing programs is a seri-
ous problem as well.
According to the City’s previous Consolidated Plan (2000-2005), City and
County staff routinely receive complaints of single-family units being occupied
by groups of farm laborers or families. Investigations by staff showed as
many as 10 to 20 residents in a single unit and adjacent sheds. These cir-
cumstances present serious health and safety problems and substandard
housing conditions, such as electrical hazards and inadequate toilet, shower,
heating, and kitchen facilities.
The Consolidated Plan also reported that approximately 1,500 people live in
substandard and illegal dwelling units during the summer. Because other
people live in legal units that may not be substandard, the total number of
farm laborers may be much higher. Many times farm laborers pay more for
substandard housing than would be paid for renting standard housing. Be-
cause the farm laborer’s stay is limited, standard rental housing is difficult to
obtain.
The City’s most recent Consolidated Plan (2005-2010) did not discuss the
needs of farmworkers at length but one can assume that the needs of farm-
workers are still present. The updated Consolidated Plan does list Housing
Authority homeownership programs, and one program specifically targets
farmworkers, the Down Payment Assistance Program-Farm Worker Housing

                    Grant. This program assists qualified farmworkers afford homeownership and
                    also helps to build and rebuild single-family neighborhoods in the City.
                    The Housing Authority of the City of Madera is responsible for providing as-
                    sisted rental housing through its public housing farmworker rental units. The
                    Housing Authority owns 100 units of farm labor housing. Residency is re-
                    stricted to farm labor families that are U.S. citizens or have residency. The
                    Housing Authority also operates the 50-unit Pomona Ranch Housing Center,
                    which is outside of the City limits, for seasonal farmworkers. In addition, Self
                    Help Housing operates the 40-unit Cottonwood Farm Labor complex.
                    Housing Authority
                    The Housing Authority is the primary provider of affordable housing in Made-
                    ra. The Housing Authority’s two main programs, Public Housing and Housing
                    Choice Vouchers (HCV), provide some housing opportunities for extremely
                    low-, very low-, low- and moderate- income families and individuals as well as
                    housing for people with other special needs (senior citizens). The demand for
                    the Housing Authority’s programs and services is evidenced by the program
                    waiting lists. Historically the waiting lists have contained thousands of house-
                    holds. For example, according to the 2005-2010 Consolidated Plan, there
                    were 2,784 families waiting for 260 family public housing units and 1,410 fam-
                    ilies were waiting for one of the City’s 725 Housing Choice Vouchers. Elderly
                    households are small but growing percentages of both waiting lists. In total,
                    there are more elderly families on the waiting lists than there are dis-
                    abled families. From the Housing Authority’s perspective, the greatest need
                    for housing assistance is among very low-income and moderate- income
                    (working poor) , renter-occupied households (particularly large related
                    households)
                    .

HOUSEHOLD INCOME CHARACTERISTICS
Housing Costs Compared to Ability to Pay
The following section discusses current (as of February 2008) income levels
and ability to pay for housing compared with housing costs. Housing is classi-
fied as “affordable” if households do not pay more than 30 percent of income
for payment of rent (including monthly allowance for water, gas, and electric-
ity) or monthly mortgage (including taxes). Since above moderate-income
households do not generally have problems locating affordable units, these
units are frequently defined as those reasonably priced for households that
are low- to moderate-income. Table H-24 shows the definition of housing in-
come limits as published by the State of California (based upon HUD income
limits published annually with some adjustment made for local factors) as
they are applied to housing units in the City of Madera.
Definitions of Housing Income Limits
Extremely Low-Income Unit is one that is affordable to a household whose
combined income is at or lower than 30 percent of the median income for the
Fresno MSA (Fresno and Madera Counties) as established by the U.S. De-
partment of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). For 2008, a Madera
household of four is considered to be extremely low-income if its combined
income is $16,150 or less ($1,346/mo. or $7.76/hr.).
Very Low-Income Unit is one that is affordable to a household whose com-
bined income is between 31 and 50 percent of the median income for the
Fresno MSA as established by HUD. For 2008 a Madera household of four is
considered to be very low-income if its combined income is $26,900 or less
($2,242/mo. or $12.93/hr.).
Low-Income Unit is one that is affordable to a household whose combined
income is at or between 50 percent and 80 percent of the median income for
the Fresno MSA as established by HUD. A household of four is considered to

                    be low-income in Madera if its combined income is $43,050 or less
                    ($3,587.50/mo. or $20.70/hr.) for the year 2008.
                    Median-Income Unit is one that is affordable to a household whose com-
                    bined income is at or between 81 percent and 100 percent of the median in-
                    come for the Fresno MSA as established by HUD. A Madera household of
                    four is considered to be median income if its combined income is $53,800 or
                    less ($4,483/mo. or $25.87/hr.) for the year 2008.
                    Moderate-Income Unit is one that is affordable to a household whose com-
                    bined income is at or between 101 percent and 120 percent of the median in-
                    come for the Fresno MSA as established by HUD. In Madera a household of
                    four is considered to be moderate-income if its combined income is $64,600
                    or less ($5,383/mo. or $31.00/hr.) for the year 2008.
                    Affordable Units are units for which households do not pay more than 30
                    percent of income for payment of rent (including monthly allowance for utili-
                    ties) or monthly mortgage and related expenses. Since above moderate-
                    income households do not generally have problems in locating affordable
                    units, affordable units are often defined as those that low- to moderate-
                    income households can afford.
                    Table I-24 shows the 2008 state area median income limits for very low-, low-
                    , median- and moderate-income households in Madera County by the num-
                    ber of persons in the household. It also shows maximum affordable monthly
                    rents and maximum affordable purchase prices for homes. For example, a
                    four-person household is classified as lower income (80 percent of median)
                    with an annual income of up to $43,050. A household with this income could
                    afford to pay a monthly gross rent (including utilities) of up to $1,076 or to
                    purchase a house priced at $134,370 or less.

                                 Table I-25 below shows HUD-defined fair market rent levels (FMR) for Made-
                                 ra for 2009. In general, the FMR for an area is the amount that would be
                                 needed to pay the gross rent (shelter rent plus utilities) of privately owned,
                                 decent, safe, and sanitary rental housing of a modest (non-luxury) nature with
                                 suitable amenities. FMRs are estimates of rent plus the cost of utilities, ex-
                                 cept telephone. FMRs are housing market-wide estimates of rents that pro-
                                 vide opportunities to rent standard quality housing throughout the geographic
                                 area in which rental housing units are in competition. The rents are drawn
                                 from the distribution of rents of all units that are occupied by recent movers.
                                 Adjustments are made to exclude public housing units, newly built units, and
                                 substandard units.
                                 As noted above, a four-person household classified as low-income (80 per-
                                 cent of median) with an annual income of up to $43,050 could afford to pay
                                 $1,076 monthly gross rent (including utilities). The FMR for a 3-bedroom unit
                                 is $1,213, which is not quite affordable to this household and they would likely
                                 have to live in a 2-bedroom unit, which would be considered overcrowded.
                                 The gap between affordability and rental prices widens drastically for very
                                 low-income families. A four-person household classified as very low-income
                                 (50 percent of median) with an annual income of up to $26,900 could afford
                                 to pay only $673 monthly gross rent and thus could not afford the FMR rent of
                                 $1,213 for a 3-bedroom unit. The same would hold true for households with
                                 incomes below 50 percent of median, who could only afford to spend less.

                               Home Sales Prices
                               Home sale prices for the City of Madera were compiled using data provided
                               by Data Quick, an agency that monitors real estate activity nationwide and
                               provides information to consumers, educational institutions, public agencies,
                               lending institutions, title companies, and industry analysts. According to Da-
                               taQuick, the median sale price for a home in Madera in December of 2007
                               was $240,500. One year later in December 2008, the median sale price had
                               declined by 61.90 percent to $151,750. The median home sale price in-
                               cludes resale single-family homes, new single-family homes, and condomini-
                               ums.

                             According to DataQuick, a significant factor that has lowered the median sale
                             price of homes is the large increase in resale homes that are in foreclosed
                             and pre-foreclosure (defaulted mortgages) status. In the second quarter of
                             2007, there were 215 home mortgages in the County of Madera that were in
                             default. In the second quarter of 2008, the number of mortgages in default
                             was 158 percent higher, with 555 mortgages in default. DataQuick estimates
                             that the median home sale price in Madera will continue to decline as more
                             foreclosed homes are sold below the median price.
                             Comparing the income data and maximum home purchase price based on
                             the income limits established for lower-income households in Table I-27 with
                             the median home sale prices reported by DataQuick (December 2008), it is
                             estimated that only those earning slightly more than the median income can
                             afford to purchase a home. Households earning roughly $48,400 (98 percent
                             AMI) per year earn the minimum amount of monthly income needed to pur-
                             chase a home at the median price of approximately $150,000, without being
                             severely cost burdened by a monthly mortgage payment.

                               Assisted Housing
                               Assisted housing is defined as units in which all or part of the costs are sub-
                               sidized by the public sector so that housing is available to lower-income
                               households at more affordable costs. By Housing and Urban Development
                               (HUD) standards, an affordable unit’s monthly cost does not exceed 30 per-
                               cent of the household’s income. Historically, this figure was 25 percent, but it

                    was raised to 30 percent to more accurately reflect current housing costs.
                    However, financial institutions are using a figure of 30-35 percent of house-
                    hold income for housing costs (principal, interest, taxes, and insurance) as a
                    maximum loan threshold.
                    REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY
                    The City of Madera Redevelopment Agency continually prioritizes increasing
                    and improving the supply of affordable housing in the City. The agency has
                    created affordable housing opportunities for owners and renters by funding
                    projects with public funding and entering into public/private partnerships. Ac-
                    cording to the 2008-2013 Implementation Plan, the Madera RDA has been
                    responsible for the production of 1,436 units through June 2007. The esti-
                    mated number of housing units to be developed in the Redevelopment Pro-
                    ject Area over the five year planning period (2008-2013) is 751 units. The
                    Agency expects approximately 453 of these units will be for very low- income
                    households. This expectation is based on continuation of the Agency’s vari-
                    ous housing programs. Based on the growth in assessment values between
                    2002/2003 and 2007/2008, the authority was able to issue tax allocation
                    bonds in the amount of $37.5 million, $7.4 of which was for housing activities.
                    This bond issue will provide most of the Agency’s funding for project activities
                    during the Implementation Plan cycle. The projected housing set aside fund

                           that the supply of affordable rental units is adequate to meet the demands of
                           low-income households in the City. Table I-30 provides a summary of the
                           assisted housing projects in the City. The Agency utilizes tax exempt bonds
                           and set-aside funds to subsidize affordable rent levels that are below market
                           rate. A portion of the assisted units is also restricted to lower-income house-
                           holds through the HUD Section 8 program. The Agency intends to continue
                           funding these of programs with focus on providing funding for the property
                           acquisition and subdivision program, acquisition infill, new multi-family con-
                           struction and rehabilitation and single-family rehabilitation.

                               Units at Risk of Conversion
                               The Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) defines as-
                               sisted housing developments as multi-family rental housing projects that re-
                               ceive financial assistance through state and federal funding sources including
                               HUD programs, state and local bond programs, redevelopment programs and
                               those restricted as part of inclusionary or density bonus programs. At-risk
                               projects are considered to be those projects that are subject to governmental
                               regulatory agreements and where the project owners can cancel the regula-
                               tory agreement and convert the affordable rents to market-rate rents within
                               the current or subsequent 5-year planning period.
                               According to the California Housing Partnership Cooperation, the Madera
                               Apartments and Madera Garden Apartments are considered to be at risk.
                               The Madera Apartments contain 68 units, of which 65 units are subsidized.
                               The restrictive clause expiration date of the 65 units is April 18, 2011. The
                               Madera Garden Apartments contain a total of 65 units, 58 of which are subsi-
                               dized. The restrictive clause expiration of the 58 units expired on August 31,
                               2001; however the principal loan amount is $878,424.30 outstanding. At the
                               time the principal is paid in full, the restricted units face the possibility of con-
                               version.

CHAPTER 7     HOUSING ELEMENT
                    Cost of Replacing At-Risk Units
                    Generally, the cost of preserving assisted housing units is estimated to be
                    significantly less than replacing units through new construction. Preserving
                    units entails covering the difference between market rate and assisted rental
                    rates. New construction tends to be less cost efficient because of the cost of
                    land, which is often a limiting factor in the development of affordable housing.
                    Preservation
                    An analysis of the cost to preserve at-risk units includes determining the cost
                    to acquire and rehabilitate the at-risk project as well as determining the
                    monthly subsidy necessary to preserve affordability. In the event that the af-
                    fordability terms expire on the two at-risk units and the property owners of the
                    projects decide to convert the rental rates of the units to be equal to or more
                    than the fair market rental rates, interested parties (nonprofit, for profit, the
                    RDA) may purchase and rehabilitate the property in order to maintain the af-
                    fordability of the units. Purchasing the at-risk units depends on the owners’
                    willingness to sell, interested parties to purchase the project, and available
                    funding assistance. Currently, loopnet.com advertises a 10-unit multi-family
                    complex for $650,000, which is $65,000 per unit. The average rehabilitation
                    cost in Madera for each unit is $20,000, which means that the estimated total
                    cost to acquire and rehabilitate each unit is $85,000. Roughly, the total cost
                    to acquire and rehabilitate the at-risk units (123) is $10.5 million.
                    Following the acquisition and rehabilitation of the units, the ongoing cost to
                    preserve affordability is determined by identifying the gap (subsidy) between
                    the assisted rent and the market rent. The exact amount is difficult to esti-
                    mate because the rents are based on a tenant’s income and therefore would
                    depend on the size and income level of the household. Table I-24 summa-
                    rized the affordability situation in the city. Following are some general exam-
                    ples of expected subsidies:
                    An extremely low-income person can only afford up to $283 per month and
                    the fair-market rental rate in the City for a 1-bedroom unit is $654 per month.

                     HOUSING ELEMENT                                CHAPTER 7
The subsidy needed would be approximately $371 per month or $4,452 per
year.
A very low-income family of three can afford $605 a month and the fair-
market rent in the City for a 2-bedroom unit is $834. The subsidy would be
approximately $229 per month or $2,784 per year.
A low-income family of four or larger would most likely find it difficult to find
suitable housing. To avoid overcrowding, a large low-income family would
need to find a single-family unit, and these rents are generally higher than
those for multi-family units. A family of four could afford up to $1,076 per
month, and the fair market rent for a 3-bedroom unit is $1,213. The subsidy
would be approximately $137 per month or $1,644 per year.
Replacement
The City also has the option of replacing converted units through the con-
struction of a new affordable housing project. The cost of developing a new
affordable housing project is typically much higher than acquiring and reha-
bilitating an existing project, due to development fees and the price of pur-
chasing land. The Pacific Companies, an affordable housing developer, is in
the preliminary stages of developing a 65 unit (including manager’s unit) af-
fordable housing project called Arbor Point. According to the developer’s pro
forma calculations, the anticipated financing that is needed to construct Arbor
point is $18,066,212, not including the cost of land, which is equal to roughly
$277,941 per unit. The total construction cost includes a 2,500 square foot
clubhouse/office, which is approximately 3 percent of the total square feet of
the complex. Subtracting 3 percent from each of the unit cost yields a per-
unit cost of roughly $269,198. The cost to replace the at-risk units (123) is
determined by multiplying the total number of at-risk units by the approximate
cost to build each unit. That cost would be $33,111,354 in Madera.

CHAPTER 7     HOUSING ELEMENT
                    FUTURE HOUSING NEEDS
                    Under the state housing element requirement, housing needs are defined in
                    three categories: existing needs, needs of special groups within the commu-
                    nity, and projected needs over the next five-year period. Previous sections of
                    this chapter have identified existing needs and needs of special groups. This
                    section focuses on projected housing needs through 2014.
                    Projected housing needs are the total additional housing units required to
                    adequately house a jurisdiction’s projected population through the planning
                    period in units that are affordable, in standard condition, and not over-
                    crowded. These needs include those of the existing population as well as the
                    needs of the additional population expected to reside in the city five years
                    hence.
                    Madera's Share of 2007 to 2014 Housing Needs
                    Government Code Section 65584 assigns responsibility for developing pro-
                    jections of regional housing need and for allocating a share of this need to lo-
                    calities within the region to regional councils of government or the California
                    Department of Housing and Community Development when there is no local
                    council of government. For Madera County and its two incorporated commu-
                    nities (City of Madera and Chowchilla), HCD prepared and finalized these de-
                    terminations. Based on a methodology that weighs a number of factors (e.g.,
                    projected population growth, employment, commute patterns, available sites),
                    HCD determined quantifiable needs for housing units in Madera County ac-
                    cording to various income categories. Table I-31 depicts Madera’s estimated
                    need for the 7½ year period. In its final Regional Housing Needs Allocation
                    (RHNA) figures, HCD allocated 6,299 housing units to the City. This is
                    equivalent to a yearly need of 890 housing units for the 7½ year period. The
                    total allocation is broken down into four income categories. Per AB 2634, the
                    City must estimate the projected number of extremely low-income house-
                    holds and one way to do so is by assuming half of its very low-income RHNA
                    is for extremely low-income. The total assigned very low-income allocation is
                    1,499 or 24 percent of total units, and approximately 749 of that need is at-

                  tributed to extremely low-income households, low- income (996 units or 16
                  percent of total units), moderate-income (1,230 units or 20 percent of total
                  units), and above moderate- income (2,573 units or 41 percent of total units).
                  In other words, of the 6,299 units allocated, 60 percent must be in the afford-
                  able range (extremely low-, very low-, low-, moderate-) and 41 percent in the
                  above moderate range.

                  Residential Development Activity (2005 to 2008)
                  Over the past four years, Madera has issued building permits for 2,234 new
                  units, nearly half of which were built in 2005. The pace of development rap-
                  idly dissipated after that year. Table I-32 summarizes projects approved,
                  building permits issued, and units constructed by year. Between January 1,
                  2007 and December 31, 2008, the City has issued permits for 323 units, none
                  of which were for units restricted to households of low- or moderate-incomes.
                  The years 2005 and 2006 were in the previous planning period and units
                  constructed in these years have not been counted towards meeting the hous-
                  ing need in the current planning period, rather they are shown to highlight the
                  rapid decline in housing development.

                        results of this analysis are shown in Table I-33. After accounting for ap-
                        proved and constructed housing units between January 2007, and December
                        2008, Madera's remaining fair share need is shown in Table I-33. Very little
                        residential construction has occurred in the City in the past few years, which
                        has lead to limited progress toward the City’s RHNA.

                                 HOUSING RESOURCES
                                 This section assesses the availability of land and services to meet the needs
                                 documented in the previous section. This section inventories Madera’s avail-
                                 able residentially designated land, calculates the buildout potential of this
                                 land, and reviews the adequacy of services to support future housing devel-
                                 opment.
                                 Available Land Inventory
                                 Relative to future basic construction needs, it has been indicated that during
                                 the period of 2009 and 2014, which is the time frame of this Housing Ele-
                                 ment, Madera’s balance of existing need is 5,975 new units. With a slower
                                 residential development market in the past few years, very little has been built
                                 in the City during this current RHNA planning period and none of the units
                                 constructed so far are restricted to very low-, low- or moderate-income
                                 households. The City’s major responsibility is to provide adequate sites
                                 zoned to meet future construction needs. This section evaluates the City’s

CHAPTER 7     HOUSING ELEMENT
                    available land supply to demonstrate if there is enough residentially zoned
                    land to meet future housing demands, as determined by HCD’s RHNA.
                    Available Land Currently Planned for Residential Use
                    The land inventory identified almost 398 sites (covering 892.92 gross acres)
                    that are residentially designated or are proposed to be rezoned to residential
                    and considered vacant. The complete list of available sites to meet the City
                    RHNA is included in the Housing Element (HE) Appendix. The table in this
                    appendix provides the Assessor’s Parcel Number (APN), acreage, zoning,
                    General Plan designation, constraints, maximum capacity and realistic capac-
                    ity numbers. A description of how this realistic capacity number was deter-
                    mined is provided in the “Analysis of Development Potential Versus Projected
                    Housing Need” section below.
                    One of the sites included in the inventory in the appendix is the site of the
                    Ventana Specific Plan, adopted in January 2007. The Ventana Specific Plan
                    contains two parcels currently, 047-014-005 and 047-014-007. The plan pro-
                    vides for nine neighborhoods total with two of the neighborhoods zoned ap-
                    propriately for housing affordable to very low and low income households. As
                    shown in the vacant land table these neighborhoods contain a total of 42.7
                    gross acres of land for approximately 433 dwelling units, which would be ap-
                    propriate for very low-income households. Even though the Ventana Specific
                    Plan is a large site, it is still viable for development because it is currently a
                    tentative map that has not yet been subdivided, which means that it is readily
                    available for a developer to subdivide or propose a new project or layout.
                    However, the specific plan calls for this section of the parcels to be built with
                    higher density housing types, which are appropriate densities for lower income
                    households. The remaining land in the Specific Plan is PD (4500), which is
                    appropriate for low- or moderate- income households (in this case we are as-
                    suming moderate-income-affordable homes) and PD (6000), which provides
                    811 potential units for above moderate-income households.

                                Analysis of Development Potential Versus Projected Housing Need
                                As shown in Table I-33 above, Madera has a net RHNA (after subtracting
                                units already built and approved units between January 2007 and December
                                2008) of 5,975 housing units for the 2007-2014 RHNA planning period. Of
                                this total, there is a need of 1,499 units for the very low-income category, 996
                                for low income, 1,230 for moderate income, and 2,250 for above moderate-
                                income households.
                                As shown in Appendix A - Housing Element Appendix, Madera has a total
                                holding capacity of 7,898 (realistic capacity) to 10.251 (maximum capacity)
                                housing units under current zoning, which is more than enough units to sat-
                                isfy the City’s RHNA with either the maximum or realistic capacity numbers.
                                Using the maximum densities for each zoning district, Madera has a total
                                residential holding capacity that is more than the total adjusted RHNA by
                                3,103.1 units. Using the realistic capacity, Madera has a total residential
                                holding capacity that is more than the total adjusted RHNA by 1,621 units.
                                The “realistic” capacities are based on recent development that has occurred
                                in the City over the past few years. These examples are used to determine a
                                realistic capacity for each site because they demonstrate the number of units

                    that are actually built on a site after development standards are taken into ac-
                    count. Many of the sites in the inventory are designated for medium densities.
                    Projects currently in the pipeline include Villa de Roma, which will be 180
                    units on 15 acres with PD (3000) zoning and Medium Density General Plan
                    designation. This equates to 86 percent of the total maximum number of
                    units possible on this site according to its size and zoning. Another project,
                    Foxglove, is also a 180-unit complex on 15 acres in the PD (3000) zone and
                    Medium Density General Plan designation. The development history of multi-
                    family projects built on medium density sites allows the City to conservatively
                    assume a realistic capacity of 80 percent. This is also the case with the site
                    that is in the PD (2000) zone where a recent development, Varbella is build-
                    ing at 87 percent of its maximum density. Additionally the Freedman project
                    planned on a 4.3 acre site in the PD (1500) zone is developing at approxi-
                    mately 58 percent. This was taken into account for the PD (1500) site in the
                    inventory, which was projected to yield 60 percent of the maximum density.
                    Even though this percentage is slightly higher than the development project
                    example, the track record of building more than 80 percent on a consistent
                    basis allows the City to assume that at least 60 percent of this site’s maxi-
                    mum number of units will be developed.
                    The range of zoning of available sites affords the opportunity for a variety of
                    housing types. Present development patterns have single-family detached
                    units in the R-1, PD 6000, and PD 4500 zones; single-family attached units
                    (cluster units, planned developments, and split-lot duplexes) in the PD 6000
                    and PD 4500 zones; multi-family and mobile home parks in PD 3000 and PD
                    2000; and duplexes and apartments in R-2, R-3, and PD 1500 zones. Manu-
                    factured housing on approved foundation systems may be permitted in most
                    residential zones upon approval by the Zoning Administrator.
                    In addition to the basic construction needs, the housing needs of each of the
                    four income groups (very low, low, moderate, and above moderate) must be
                    considered. Because capacity for housing production exceeds Madera's total
                    need for new housing during the Housing Element planning period, a primary
                    objective for the City over the Housing Element planning period will be to pro-
                    vide adequate sites to accommodate the housing needs of very low-, low-,

and moderate-income households. The California Department of Housing
and Community Development assumes, in general, that the higher the den-
sity, the more affordable the housing. It is HCD's position that local jurisdic-
tions can facilitate and encourage affordable housing development by allow-
ing development at higher densities, which helps to reduce per unit land
costs.
In regard to lower-income households, rental units would typically be con-
structed in the R-2, R-3, PD 3000, PD 2000, PD 1500, and Commercial
zones. Among the sites listed in Table I-35 as appropriate to meet the need
for units affordable to very low- and low- income households are R3 sites with
High Density (HD) proposed General Plan designations, PD (1500) with HD
designation and PD (2000) and PD (3000) with Medium Density Residential
(MDR) designations. Most of the sites used to show capacity for very low and
low-income households are PD (3000), which is described as appropriate for
multi-family and mobile home parks. Using the realistic capacity methodol-
ogy described above and typical developed densities, these sites provide for
approximately 1,310 units and another 433 in the Ventana Specific Plan,
which provides for ample sites to satisfy the very low-income allocation and
another 1,044 units are possible on these sites to fulfill the low-income alloca-
tions. In addition, the City will lessen the reliance on the PD (3000) by rezon-
ing 64.4 acres (capacity to hold approximately 1,471 units) of land to PD
(1500) a density that allows up to 29 units per acre, well above the City’s de-
fault density of 20 units an acre (Action Item 1-1-3). Appendix A includes a list
of sites that will be rezoned.
Zoning to Accommodate Housing Affordable to Lower Income Households
As mentioned above, the City has a large supply of vacant sites with PD 3000
designation that are suitable to meet the City’s fair share allocation of very
low- and low-income housing units. The PD 3000 designation allows for an
equivalent of up to 15 dwelling units per acre, which is lower than the City’s
“default” density of 20 dwelling units per acre. The City’s default density is an
assumed density provided by HCD that is sufficient to use for analyzing
available sites to meet the housing needs of lower-income households. Be-

                    cause the City’s allowable density in the PD 3000 zone is lower than their de-
                    fault density, a thorough analysis of market demand/trends, financial feasibil-
                    ity, and recent development experience in the PD 3000 zone must be pro-
                    vided to demonstrate that lower income housing production is feasible ion this
                    zone.
                    Market Demand/Trend
                    Between 2005 and 2008 the City experienced a dramatic
                    slowdown in residential development activity. In 2005 the City issued 133
                    multifamily building permits and by 2008 the number of multifamily permits
                    declined by 92 percent to 11 permits. However, there are 3 larger scale pro-
                    jects in the development pipeline that are located in the PD 3000 zone. Villa
                    de Roma is proposed to develop on approximately 15 acres with 180 single
                    family homes achieving a density of 12 dwelling units per acre. Foxglove
                    Apartments (180 units) are also planned to achieve a density of 12 dwelling
                    units per acre. Additionally, Arbor Point is planned to develop at roughly 13
                    dwelling units per acre and will provide an additional 65 multifamily units (64
                    affordable and 1 manager) to the City’s housing stock. Each of the three de-
                    velopments described will provide a mixture of housing types (single family,
                    market rate multifamily, and affordable multifamily) in the City’s PD 3000
                    zone, which demonstrates that a variety of housing demands are achieved in
                    the PD 3000 zone.
                    Financial Feasibility
                    As previously discussed, the Arbor Point project is proposed to be developed
                    as a 100 percent affordable housing project. Upon completion, Arbor Point
                    will achieve a density of 13 dwelling units per acre. According to the devel-
                    oper, Pacific Companies and the Housing Authority of the City of Madera (co-
                    partner in the project) the maximum dwelling units per acre (15) in the PD
                    3000 zone is the most ideal density in Madera to achieve economies of scale
                    that allow developers to provide affordable housing units. This is largely due
                    to the relatively lower cost of land in the area and the higher construction
                    costs associated with building more than two stories. As a result, the allowed

density in the PD 3000 zone facilitates the development of housing affordable
to lower income households.
According to the City and local developers, the price of raw land in Madera
remains to be less expensive than overall construction costs, which allows
developers to construct multifamily housing with units affordable to lower in-
come households at allowed densities in the PD 3000 zone. Three story de-
velopments are permitted and encouraged by the City but developers typi-
cally only build up to two stories at 80 percent (12 du/ac) of the maximum al-
lowed density (15 du/ac) due to the relatively low cost of land. In addition, a
third story often requires the installment of elevators, which also add to the
overall cost of the development.
Recent Development Experience
As shown in the vacant sites inventory located in Appendix A, the City has a
large supply of vacant PD 3000 sites sufficient to meet the future demand for
housing affordable to lower- income households. The planned Arbor Point
development provides an example of affordable housing development in the
PD 3000 zone. In addition to the allowed density of housing developments in
the PD 3000 zone, flexible regulations of Planned Unit Development’s (PUD)
encourage the development of affordable housing. Single-family attached
and detached units are also expected to be the major housing type for mod-
erate- and above moderate-income groups. As indicated above, the currently
zoned sites including some in the Ventana plan will provide approximately
727 units appropriate for moderate-income households. The remaining 750
units will be provided through a rezoning program (Action Item 1-1-3) that will
rezone 97.03 acres of R1 zoned land to PD (4500) and rezone 64.4 acres of
land to PD (1500). For above moderate- income households, there are sites
for approximately 2,291 units, which would leave a surplus for approximately
41 units. Many of these are on smaller sites that would hold only one or two
units but it is feasible that individual citizens may purchase these lots and

                    Adequacy of Public Facilities and Infrastructure
                    Water
                    The City’s water supply system consists of a network of interconnected sub-
                    systems serving specific areas in accordance with City policy. Water is sup-
                    plied by 18 water wells, all of which are located inside the city limits. The City
                    also has a 1 million gallon elevated water storage tank. According to Al Hol-
                    guin, Water/Sewer Operations Manager, the City has a current (November
                    2008) pumping capacity of 28,416 gallons per minute (gpm) and an average
                    daily usage of 21 million gallons per day (mgd) during the summer and 5 mgd
                    during the winter. With approximately 12,419 water service connections the
                    City is not currently facing any critical water supply issues or problems and
                    does not anticipate there will be any constraints within the Housing Element
                    planning period (2007-2014) to accommodate the City’s current RHNA. The
                    City has recognized the long term constraints to providing adequate infra-
                    structure related to groundwater overdraft issues. The current General Plan
                    update and corresponding EIR will mitigate the groundwater issues associ-
                    ated with housing production beyond the planning period. The City con-
                    structed additional wells in December 2002 and in 2003. Two or three wells
                    are planned over the next two years to increase the City’s supply of water.
                    Sewer
                    The City of Madera’s Wastewater Treatment Plant is located at 13048 Road
                    21½ in Madera and is a secondary treatment facility. Sewer collection pipe-
                    lines in the City range between 8 and 42 inches. According to Dave Under-
                    wood of the City of Madera’s Wastewater Treatment Plant, the Wastewater
                    Treatment Plant has a maximum design capacity of 10.1 million gallons per
                    day (mgd). During wet weather periods where heavy rainfall occurs for an ex-
                    tended amount of time, the flow can increase significantly due to inflow and
                    infiltration. The treatment facility has seen increases in flow of up to 1.0 mil-

lion gallons per day during rainy periods. The City has taken measures to mi-
tigate the inflow and has reduced it significantly. The current average flow the
plant is receiving is 5.8 million gallons per day. Plant expansion was com-
pleted in March 2008. The plant should not exceed its design capacity for
several years to come and is expected to accommodate the City’s current
RHNA.
To comply with Senate Bill (SB) 1087, the City will immediately forward its
adopted Housing Element to its water and wastewater providers so they can
grant priority for service allocations to proposed developments that include
units affordable to lower-income households.
Housing Programs
Community Development Block Grant
The City’s 2006/2007 CDBG entitlement was $986,261. A little more than
$197,000 was allocated for administrative uses to the Fresno/Madera Contin-
uum of Care and the Fair Housing Council of Central California. Almost
$150,000 was granted for public services including the Center for Independ-
ent Living, Madera Coalition for Community Justice Youth Leadership, Ma-
dera Police Crime Supplemental Patrol, and Madera Parks Kids Kamp Pro-
gram. The remaining amount was distributed to the City’s Neighborhood Re-
vitalization Program, various ADA design projects, storm drainage projects,
and a small contingency fund.
First Time Homebuyer (Down Payment Assistance Program)
The City of Madera promotes homeownership among first-time homebuyers
through a down payment assistance program for households making less
than 80 percent of the Madera County area median income. The program is
available to individuals or households that have not owned a home within the
past three years and the requirements include finding a home within the city
limits, contributing at least one month’s worth of income toward the purchase
price, completion of homeownership classes, securing a good faith estimate

                    or pre-approval letter for a loan within 30 days. The home may not exceed
                    the Federal Housing Administration’s mortgage limits (currently $425,000). In
                    2007 and 2008, 21 low-income and 4 very low-income households were as-
                    sisted through this program.
                    Owner-Occupied Rehabilitation Program
                    The City’s Owner-Occupied Rehabilitation Program provides both zero-
                    interest loans and grants to income eligible families whose homes are in need
                    of repairs to ensure the health and safety of occupants. Zero-interest loans
                    are provided to qualified homeowners whose annual gross incomes do not
                    exceed 80 percent of the area median income for Madera. These loans are
                    deferred, payable when there is a change in title to the property. The emer-
                    gency repair grants are available to households earning up to 50 percent of
                    the area median income. To be eligible, an applicant’s property must be own-
                    er-occupied, within the city limits, and need rehabilitation to meet the Uniform
                    Building Code or “safe, decent and sanitary” standards. If within the 100-year
                    floodplain, properties must meet flood insurance requirements. If an over-
                    crowding problem is demonstrated, a room addition may be authorized. The
                    City provides recipients with a Rehabilitation Construction Management Con-
                    tractor to assist them in determining a priority list of rehabilitation needs and a
                    plan to fit those needs within the funding available.

Abandoned Real Property Registration
The City recently adopted an ordinance that established a foreclosure moni-
toring program to prevent potential blight from abandoned properties in the
City. The ordinance requires property owners to register their property if it is
in any stage of the foreclosure process and is abandoned. Once a property
enters into foreclosure, its owner or trustee must inspect it monthly and if it
becomes vacant, they must register the property with the City’s Neighbor-
hood Revitalization Coordinator within ten days. This requirement remains in
effect and an annual registration fee will apply as long as the property is va-
cant. While the property is vacant, the owner or trustee must ensure the
property is maintained and secure and must post a 24-hour contact informa-
tion for people to call to report any problems at the property If maintenance
and security requirements are not met, a fine of $1000 per day will be issued.
The money collected from fine payments will help pay for the administration
of the program. Neighborhood revitalization staff monitor properties in the
City on a proactive basis as part of this program. As of May 2009, 100 prop-
erties were registered and zero fines had been issued. Neighborhood Stabili-
zation Program (NSP)
The City has also submitted an application for NSP funds in cooperation with
the City of Chowchilla. The proposed use of funds is to purchase abandoned
and foreclosed properties and rehabilitate the units and/or to assist the RDA
in acquiring properties and rehabilitate as needed in the Hughes Neighbor-
hood Network (defined by Pine, Olive, Sunset Avenue, and Highway 99).
The proposed program would expand the City’s first time homebuyer program
that is HOME funded with some additional criteria for the NSP-funded loans.
The loans are provided in the form of deferred payment “silent” second prior-
ity loans as “gap” financing toward the purchase price and closing costs of af-
fordable housing units. While the HOME funded loans are available to
households with low incomes (up to 80 percent of AMI), the NSP-funded
loans may be awarded to moderate-income households earning up to 120
percent of AMI. NSP-funded loans may not be granted for homes built prior to
1978. If repairs to meet health and safety standards or code violations are

                    trast to only $10,000 if HOME-funded)to make the necessary repairs. These
                    repairs must be made no later than 6 months after the close of escrow.

Owner Participation Agreements
The Redevelopment Agency participates with developers in the construction
of public improvements. Affordability covenants restrict the sales of the
homes to persons and families within the targeted income group. Projects
developed using this form of agreement include:
    •    Elm Estates I (6 lots)
    •    Mill Site (20 lots)
    •    Sierra Vista (8 lots)
    •    Elm Estates II (9 lots)
Subdivision Purchases
The Redevelopment Agency has developed a number of residential subdivi-
sions in southeast Madera. Land is acquired, public improvements are con-
structed, and the fully developed lots are sold to participating build-
ers. Affordability covenants restrict the sales of the homes to persons and
families within the targeted income group.
Infill Acquisition
A key component of the housing program is the acquisition of substandard
buildings and incompatible land uses. Following demolition, the lots are sold

                    ENERGY CONSERVATION OPPORTUNITIES
                    State Housing Element law requires an analysis of the opportunities for en-
                    ergy conservation in residential development. Energy efficiency has direct
                    application to affordable housing because the more money spent on energy,
                    the less available for rent or mortgage payments. High energy costs have
                    particularly detrimental effects on low-income households that do not have
                    enough income or cash reserves to absorb cost increases and many times
                    must choose between basic needs such as shelter, food, and energy.
                    Volatile energy markets have led to renewed widespread interest in energy
                    conservation approaches. Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) provides gas and
                    electricity services for the City of Madera. PG&E offers incentives to help
                    consumers save energy and money through a variety of rebate programs and
                    by providing energy saving tips and educational materials to its consumers.
                    All new buildings in California must meet the standards contained in Title 24,
                    Part 6 of the California Code of Regulations (Energy Efficiency Standards for
                    Residential and Nonresidential Buildings). These regulations were estab-
                    lished in 1978 and most recently updated in 1998 (effective date of July 1,
                    1999). Energy efficiency requirements are enforced by local governments
                    through the building permit process. All new construction must comply with
                    the standards in effect on the date a building permit application is made.
                    The California Subdivision Map Act (Government Code Sections 66473-
                    66498) allows local governments to provide for solar access as follows:

sought for any solar energy system, provided that such ordinance contains all
of the following:
1) Specifies the standards for determining the exact dimensions and loca-
    tions of such easements.
2) Specifies any restrictions on vegetation, buildings and other objects which
    would obstruct the passage of sunlight through the easement.
3) Specifies the terms or conditions, if any, under which an easement may
    be revised or terminated.
4) Specifies that in establishing such easements consideration shall be giv-

    sities or the percentage of a lot which may be occupied by a building or a
    structure under applicable planning and zoning in force at the time such
    tentative map is filed.
5) Specifies that the ordinance is not applicable to condominium projects
    which consist of the subdivision of airspace in an existing building where
    no new structures are added.
The City has adopted the uniform solar energy codes introduced by the Inter-
national Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials. However, the
number of installations of solar panels within the community has not been as
great as expected. This is due to certain factors. The initial cost of installa-
tion of a solar unit is beyond the limits of many families within the community.
Furthermore, the prevalence of the fog during winter months reduces the ef-
fectiveness of the solar unit.
The City and PG&E play a role in implementation of various other energy
conservation measures. An insulation program promoted by the City has be-
come very popular in the community. Under the program, households below

                    POTENTIAL HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
                    The provision of adequate and affordable housing can be constrained by a
                    number of factors. This section assesses the various governmental and mar-
                    ket factors that may serve as potential constraints to housing development
                    and improvement in Madera.
                    Potential Government Constraints
                    Local governments have little or no influence upon the national economy or
                    the federal monetary policies which influence it. Yet these two factors most
                    significantly impact the overall cost of housing. The local housing market,
                    however, can be encouraged and assisted locally. Part of the Housing Ele-
                    ment’s purpose is to evaluate the City’s past performance in this regard. By
                    reviewing local conditions and regulations that may impact the housing mar-
                    ket, the local government can prepare for future growth through actions that
                    protect the public’s health and safety without unduly adding to the cost of
                    housing production.
                    The facilitation of affordable housing can be constrained by a number of fac-
                    tors inherent in the municipal structure. Some governmental regulations can
                    increase the cost of development, thus constraining the availability of afford-
                    able housing.
                    Although there are several components of housing production which are be-
                    yond the control of local government, such as the cost and availability of
                    mortgage capital, labor and materials, there are key elements which are di-
                    rectly controlled by local government and are thus legitimate subjects of in-
                    quiry for the Housing Element.
                    Governmental constraints are those imposed by the government which either
                    limit the number of housing units to be built or increase the costs of those

                    HOUSING ELEMENT                                    CHAPTER 7
units which are built. Constraints increase costs by either adding direct spe-
cific expenses, such as street improvements or development fees, to the cost
of a housing unit or by increasing the time necessary to build the unit, thereby
increasing the builder’s incidental costs such as interest payments or labor
costs. All costs are ultimately passed on to the occupant of the housing unit
either in higher mortgage payments or rent.
Governmental constraints can be classified in three basic categories: those
which impose regulation, those which add direct costs, and those which result
in time delays. Regulations and time delays result in increased costs, but
they cannot be calculated as easily as direct costs such as fees. The most

                         The City is tasked with allowing for the development of an array of housing
                         types that are suitable for all economic segments of the community. The
                         Housing Element must describe how the City’s Municipal Code allows for dif-
                         ferent types of housing to meet the needs of its residents. Housing types in-
                         clude single-family dwellings, duplexes, guest dwellings, mobile homes,
                         group residential homes, multiple unit dwellings, convalescent homes, acces-
                         sory structures, supportive housing, and single-room occupancy units. Ta-
                         bles I-36 and I-37 below summarize the housing types permitted by right and
                         those that require a use permit under the City Municipal Code.
                         As shown in Table I-36 below, there are eleven residential zoning districts
                         and four commercial zoning districts which allow residential development in
                         the City of Madera. The table shows the residential uses permitted in each
                         district, as well as the minimum lot sizes for each district. For each of these
                         zoning districts, guest units without kitchen facilities are allowed upon admin-
                         istrative approval. Manufactured housing is also allowed in these zoning dis-
                         tricts with a zoning administrator permit.

                               tions of the use permit are specific to each use. Generally, the conditions are
                               designed to make the housing for the requested use and the surrounding
                               uses compatible. For example, a residential use for the disabled may provide
                               comprehensive supportive services on site and the use permit condition may
                               require additional parking. Another example is a condition that requires the
                               structure used for residential purposes to meet required ADA provisions or
                               reasonable accommodations. The use permit process provides an opportu-
                               nity for the proponents of the use to have a dialogue with the neighbors and
                               meet their reasonable concerns or remove the concerns through information.

     Emergency shelters, transitional and supportive housing types would be considered under the “foster homes, rehabilita-

     gory according to Section 10-3.504 of the City of Madera Municipal Code.
                                   Parking Requirements
                                   The City requires one covered and one uncovered parking space for each
                                   single-family unit and multi-family unit. For multi-family units, the Zoning Or-
                                   dinance requires one guest parking space for every four units. For senior cit-
                                   izen housing projects, one covered parking space for each unit is required. In
                                   addition, one guest parking space is required to be provided at the rate of one
                                   space for every four units.
                                   The City requires 1.5 parking spaces for each 1-bedroom single-family unit
                                   and two spaces for single-family units containing more than 1 bedroom (one
                                   covered and one uncovered). In addition to the parking spaces required for
                                   single-family units, all projects with six or more units are required to provide
                                   off-street parking for visitors. For these units, one space for the first four units
                                   and one space for each four units thereafter is required.
                                   For senior citizen housing projects, one covered parking space for each unit
                                   is required. In addition, one guest parking space is required to be provided at
                                   the rate of one space for every four units. Furthermore, employee parking is
                                   required to be provided at a rate of one space for every two employees, and
                                   parking for a manager’s quarters is required at the standard residential rate.

Density Bonus
According to the Madera Zoning Ordinance, the City will grant a 25 percent
density bonus over the housing unit density allowed by the existing zoning if
the developer agrees to meet one of the following conditions:
     •  10 percent of the units are for very low-income households,
     •  20 percent of the units are for low-income households; or
     •  50 percent of the units are for senior citizens and at least 10 percent
        of the units are for very low-income senior citizens, or at least 20 per-
        cent of its units are for low-income senior citizens.
The City may provide additional incentives for the developer, unless the City
Council finds that additional incentives are not necessary to make the pro-
posed development economically feasible.
As stated in the Zoning Ordinance, additional possible incentives include the
following:
     •  A reduction in site development standards or a modification of zoning
        code requirements or architectural design requirements which exceed
        minimum building standards approved by the State Building Stan-
        dards Commission as provided in the California Health & Safety
        Code.
     •  Approval of mixed use zoning in conjunction with housing develop-
        ment consisting of commercial, office, industrial, or other land uses
        which will reduce the cost of the housing development, if such land
        uses are compatible with the housing development and the existing or
        planned development in the area, and consistent with the General
        Plan.

CHAPTER 7     HOUSING ELEMENT
                    In 2004, Senate Bill (SB) 1818 altered the state density bonus provisions
                    throughout the state. Effective January 1, 2005, SB 1818 increased the max-
                    imum bonus from 25 to 35 percent and changed the eligibility thresholds for
                    projects. It also required localities to grant additional incentives and allowed
                    bonuses for land donation. Under the new density bonus law, there are pro-
                    visions for projects that include affordable housing (to low- and very low-
                    income), senior housing, donations of land, condominium conversions, and
                    child care facilities. The law also allows for concessions and incentives, waiv-
                    ers and reductions or reduced parking requirements. A developer may apply
                    for one to three concessions or incentives on a sliding scale depending on
                    how many affordable units are proposed. The concessions are: reduction in
                    site development standards and modifications of zoning and architectural de-
                    sign requirements, mixed use zoning or other regulatory incentives or con-
                    cessions. In addition, a developer may ask for waivers of any number of de-
                    velopment standards if they can demonstrate the waiver is needed to make
                    the project economically feasible. A reduction in parking requirements is also
                    allowed for senior projects or developments that provide affordable units.
                    Secondary Dwelling Units
                    One type of housing appropriate for lower-income persons is second dwelling
                    units. "Second unit" means an attached or a detached residential dwelling
                    unit which provides complete independent living facilities for one or more per-
                    sons. It includes permanent provisions for living, sleeping, eating, cooking,
                    and sanitation on the same parcel as the single-family dwelling is situated. A
                    second unit also includes attached or detached efficiency units, or manufac-
                    tured homes, as defined in Sections 17958.1 and 18007 of the Health and
                    Safety Code.
                    Assembly Bill (AB) 1866 (Chapter 1062, Statutes of 2002), also known as the
                    “second unit law,” amended the California Government Code to facilitate the
                    development of second units. This amendment now requires localities to al-
                    low second units ministerially without discretionary review or hearings. To be
                    considered a ministerial review, the process used to approve second units
                    must “apply predictable, objective, fixed, quantifiable and clear standards.”

Applications for second units should not be subject to onerous conditions of
approval or public hearing process or public comment.
The second unit law established maximum standards for second units on lots
zoned for residential use that contain existing single-family dwellings. No oth-
er standards can be applied to the approval of second units than those listed
in Section 95852.2(b) of the Government Code, except the City may require
that the primary structure be owner-occupied. The City may apply the follow-
ing standards:
    •   The unit is not intended for sale and may be rented;
    •   The lot is zoned for single-family or multi-family use;
    •   The lot contains an existing single-family dwelling;
    •   The second unit is either attached to the existing dwelling and located
        within the living area of the existing dwelling or detached from the ex-
        isting dwelling and located on the same lot as the existing dwelling;
    •   The increased floor area of an attached second unit shall not exceed
        30 percent of the existing living area;
    •   The total area of floor space for a detached second unit shall not ex-
        ceed 1,200 square feet;
    •   Requirements relating to height, setback, lot coverage, architectural
        review, site plan review, fees, charges, and other zoning requirements
        generally applicable to residential construction in the zone in which
        the property is located;
    •   Local building code requirements which apply to detached dwellings,
        as appropriate; and

                             system is being used, if required.
                    According to the City’s Municipal Code, detached dwellings without kitchen
                    facilities are permitted in all residential zones. Second dwelling units with
                    kitchen facilities on the same lot as primary residence are allowed with a Zon-
                    ing Administrator approval and units on R-1 lots are permitted uses subject to
                    the following standards:
                        A) Secondary units shall conform to the height, open space, lot cover-
                             age, parking, and setback requirements of the R-1 zone along with
                             other requirements of the zoning code and other applicable city
                             codes.
                        B) Either the primary or secondary unit may be for rental purposes and
                             neither unit may be sold separately.
                        C) No application under this [Municipal Code] section shall be considered
                             for any lot less than 6,000 square feet in area.
                        D) The secondary unit shall provide separate, independent living quar-
                             ters for one household and may be detached but shall be similar in
                             architectural style to the existing primary residence.
                        E) The increased floor area of an attached secondary unit shall not ex-
                             ceed 30 percent of the existing living area. The total area of floor
                             space for a detached secondary unit shall not exceed 1,200 square
                             feet.
                        F) An additional 500 square feet of useable open space shall be required
                             for the secondary unit, bringing the total open space requirement for
                             both the primary residence and the secondary unit to 1,500 square
                             feet.

        1) All detached secondary residential units shall have completely
            separate utilities, such as sewer, water, gas, and refuse collection.
        2) All utilities shall be adequate to serve both residential units. This
            shall be based on an evaluation by the Community Development
            Director/City Engineer of the existing level of development in the
            neighborhood, and the potential for increased density related to
            the existing capacity in the utilities serving the neighborhood.
    3) Secondary units shall not be located over underground utilities serving
        the primary unit.
    H) Secondary units shall be provided with at least one covered parking
        space, in addition to parking required for the existing residence.
    I)  Development impact fees to be charged shall be based on the multi-
        family rate.
    J) The application for a permit processed under the provisions of this
        section shall be limited to owner-occupants.
These conditions of approval for secondary dwelling units closely resemble
those listed in the second unit law. However, some changes are required to
ensure full compliance with this legislation. Currently, secondary units with
kitchen facilities are permitted in the R1 zone with a zoning administrator
permit. However, a recent change in state law, Assembly Bill (AB) 1866, re-
quires secondary dwelling units to be allowed ministerially or without any dis-
cretionary review in all residential zones. A zoning administrator permit does
require the Zoning Administrator (Planning Director) to approve each applica-
tion and to hold a public hearing.
As a result, Action Item 4-5-4 requires these units types to be allowed in all
residential zones and provides language to change the regulatory review ne-
cessary to comply with AB 1866. In addition, the City will omit the condition
that precludes second unit development of lots less than 6,000 square feet.

CHAPTER 7     HOUSING ELEMENT
                    This requirement serves as a potential constraint to the development of sec-
                    ondary dwelling units in residential zones outside of the R1 zone, which con-
                    flicts with the second unit law. The City will implement Action Item 4-5-2 to
                    address this compliance issue.
                    Manufactured Housing
                    Manufactured housing can provide quality housing at a reasonable price.
                    The recent trend in state legislation has been to encourage homeowners to
                    place and finance manufactured homes on single-family lots. As a result,
                    mobile homes as well as factory-built housing may now be taxed as real es-
                    tate and may be set on permanent foundations, in common with conventional
                    site-built housing.
                    California SB 1960 (1981) prohibited local jurisdictions from excluding manu-
                    factured homes from all lots zoned for single-family dwellings; in other words,
                    limiting the location of these homes to mobile home parks is forbidden. How-
                    ever, SB 1960 does allow the local jurisdiction to designate certain single-
                    family lots for manufactured homes based on compatibility for this type of
                    use.
                    The City of Madera Zoning Ordinance permits manufactured housing in most
                    residential zones upon approval by the Zoning Administrator. Therefore, the
                    Zoning Ordinance does not act as a constraint to manufactured housing.
                    Emergency Shelters
                    In effect since January 1, 2008, Senate Bill (SB) 2 (Cedillo, 2007) requires
                    the City to allow emergency shelters without any discretionary action in at
                    least one zone that is appropriate for permanent emergency shelters (i.e.,
                    with commercial uses compatible with residential or light industrial zones in
                    transition), regardless of its demonstrated need. The goal of SB 2 was to en-
                    sure that local governments are sharing the responsibility of providing oppor-
                    tunities for the development of emergency shelters. To that end, the legisla-
                    tion also requires that the City demonstrate site capacity in the zone identified

                       HOUSING ELEMENT                                 CHAPTER 7
to be appropriate for the development of emergency shelters. Within the
identified zone, only objective development and management standards may
be applied, given they are designed to encourage and facilitate the develop-
ment of or conversion to an emergency shelter. Those standards may in-
clude:
    1) The maximum number of beds or persons permitted to be served
         nightly by the facility;
    2) Off-street parking based upon demonstrated need, provided that the
         standards do not require more parking for emergency shelters than for
         other residential or commercial uses within the same zone;
    3) The size and location of exterior and interior on-site waiting and client
         intake areas;
    4) The provision of on-site management;
    5) The proximity to other emergency shelters provided that emergency
         shelters are not required to be more than 30 feet apart;
    6) The length of stay;
    7) Lighting; and
    8) Security during hours that the emergency shelter is in operation.
In Madera, emergency shelters are considered under the “foster homes, re-
habilitation facilities, day care centers, and other related facilities which pro-
vide housing for six or fewer unrelated persons” category according to Sec-
tion 10-3.504 of the City of Madera Municipal Code. These housing types are
permitted in the RA, R1, R2 and R3 zones. However, the City must provide
for shelters for more than 6 persons as well. Action Item H-4.4.1 commits the
City to an amendment of its zoning ordinance to ensure compliance with SB 2
             CITY OF MADERA GENERAL PLAN | OCTOBER 2009                      7-99

CHAPTER 7     HOUSING ELEMENT
                    guidelines. As stated in Action Item H-4.4.1, a large amount (approximately
                    212 acres) of Heavy Commercial (C-2) land is vacant and available in the
                    City. The C-2 district is an appropriate zone to permit emergency shelters be-
                    cause it is proximal to transportation corridors and it permits a variety of retail
                    and other services that are permitted in the Light Commercial (C-1) district
                    such as barber services, banks, drug stores, food store, offices, restaurants,
                    laundromats and a variety of others uses. In addition, the development stan-
                    dards for the C-2 district facilitates the development of an emergency shelter
                    as there are no setbacks or yard requirements unless it abuts a residential
                    area, there is a very low minimum lot size requirement (2,000 square feet)
                    and the district allows building heights of up to 65 feet by right.
                    The City has set forth six criteria for the administrative review of emergency
                    shelters. Each provision is set to ensure consistency with local ordinances
                    and state health and safety standards and is compliant with the requirements
                    of SB 2.
                    Transitional and Supportive Housing
                    Transitional housing is defined in Section 50675.2 of the Health and Safety
                    Code as rental housing for stays of at least six months but where the units
                    are recirculated to another program recipient after a set period. It may be
                    designated for a homeless individual or family transitioning to permanent
                    housing. This housing can take many structural forms such as group housing
                    and multi-family units and may include supportive services to allow individu-
                    als to gain necessary life skills in support of independent living.
                    Supportive housing is defined by Section 50675.14 of the Health and Safety
                    Code housing with linked on-site or off-site services with no limit on the length
                    of stay and is occupied by a target population as defined in Health and Safety
                    Code Section 53260 (i.e., low-income person with mental disabilities, AIDS,
                    substance abuse or chronic health conditions, or persons whose disabilities
                    originated before the age of 18). Services linked to supportive housing are
                    usually focused on retaining housing, living and working in the community,
                    and/or health improvement.

                     HOUSING ELEMENT                                   CHAPTER 7
SB 2 requires that transitional and supportive housing types be treated as
residential uses and subject only to those restrictions that apply to other resi-
dential uses of the same type in the same zone. Both transitional and sup-
portive housing types must be explicitly permitted in the municipal code. Cur-
rently, transitional and supportive housing types are considered part of the
“foster homes, day care facilities, rehabilitation center and other related facili-
ties which provide housing for six or fewer unrelated persons category.”
Transitional and supportive housing types for more than six persons require a
conditional use permit. As described in Program H-4.4.4, the City will include
the definitions of transitional and supportive housing in the municipal code
and will ensure they are treated as residential uses.
In compliance with SB 2, these types of facilities for six or fewer persons are
allowed by right in all residential zones. In an effort to clarify the Zoning Or-
dinance and to further comply with SB 2, the City will add definitions of both
transitional and supportive housing as defined in the Health and Safety Code
Sections 50675.2 and 50675.14, respectively. In addition, the Zoning Ordi-
nance will be amended to explicitly allow “emergency shelters” in the code as
defined by California Health and Safety Code Section 5080.1. The state code
defines an emergency shelter as “housing with minimal supportive services
for homeless persons that is limited to occupancy of six months or less by a
homeless person.”
Under the City’s current Zoning Ordinance, emergency shelters, transitional
and supportive housing types are possible in a wide variety of zones, de-
pending on type and size. Smaller emergency and transitional facilities for
fewer than six individuals would be permitted in all residential zones. Emer-
gency shelters and transitional or supportive housing facilities for more than
six individuals are permitted in the R-3, C-1, and C-2 zones with conditional
use permit approval.
Group Homes
The Madera Zoning Ordinance allows group homes and other related facili-
ties (six or fewer persons) in residential zones upon administrative approval.
             CITY OF MADERA GENERAL PLAN | OCTOBER 2009                     7-101

CHAPTER 7     HOUSING ELEMENT
                    Administrative approval does not require any kind of application or staff re-
                    view. Group homes that provide housing for more than six persons are al-
                    lowed in residential zones upon obtaining a conditional use permit from the
                    Planning Commission. These facilities are also allowed with a use permit in
                    the Light Commercial (C-1) and Heavy Commercial (C-2) zones. Group
                    homes are not permitted in any other zones.
                    Persons with Disabilities
                    As part of a governmental constraints analysis, Housing Element law requires
                    each jurisdiction to analyze potential governmental constraints to the devel-
                    opment, improvement, and maintenance of housing for persons with disabili-
                    ties, demonstrate local efforts to remove any such constraints, and provide
                    for reasonable accommodations for persons with disabilities through pro-
                    grams that remove constraints.
                    The City provides for a variety of housing intended to care for the special
                    needs of the disabled. Group home housing types that house six or fewer
                    people are allowed by right in all residential zones and those that house more
                    than seven persons are permitted with a conditional use permit in the R-1, R-
                    2 and R-3 zones. There are no restrictions on the location of any group care
                    homes in the City and there are no special conditions specifically for larger
                    group homes. Even though a conditional use permit is required, the same
                    public notices are posted as other use permits. Additionally, the City has oc-
                    cupancy standards for unrelated persons with a family definition as follows:
                    “one or more persons living as a single housekeeping unit in a dwelling unit,
                    including necessary domestic servants”.
                    Other potential constraints on housing for persons with disabilities are not
                    present in the City including: the City continually monitors its zoning laws, pol-
                    icies and practices for compliance with fair housing law and will continue to
                    maintain compliance through the implementation of the programs under Pol-
                    icy H-4.9. The City allows reductions in parking requirements for develop-
                    ments that contain special needs housing. The City has adopted the
                    2007/2008 Uniform Building Code and has not added any local provisions.

While it has considered universal design elements, the City has not adopted
these into its code. Discussions relative to this type of amendment are in their
infant stages and are ongoing.
If a person with a disability wants to request housing retrofit for accessibility,
they must apply for a building permit. However, the City does not have any
processes for individuals with disabilities to make requests for reasonable ac-
commodations with respect to zoning, permit processing, or building laws,
however there is an active ADA advisory committee created to advise the
City Council on issues related to the needs of individuals with disabilities. Per
Action Item H-4.7.1, the City will develop a formalized reasonable accommo-
dation procedure to remove constraint on housing for persons with disabilities
and will make information available about requesting reasonable accommo-
dation. Although the City does not have any local building requirements for
disabled persons’ accessibility, the City does follow California’s accessibility
laws which require the following for multi-family residential developments:
    •   Multi-family developments containing 4-20 units only require that all of
        their ground floor units are adaptable (interior modifications) and meet
        accessibility requirements.
    •   Multi-family developments containing greater than 20 units require
        that 2 percent of the total units are adaptable and the remainder of the
        units is accessible.
    •   Single-family residential developments are exempt from accessibility
        requirements, but accessibility features for a single-family home may
        be added at the request of a homeowner.
Extremely Low-Income Households
Housing for Extremely Low-Income Households
Assembly Bill 2634 (Lieber, 2006) requires the quantification and analysis of
existing and projected housing needs of extremely low-income households.
             CITY OF MADERA GENERAL PLAN | OCTOBER 2009                    7-103

CHAPTER 7     HOUSING ELEMENT
                    This need is demonstrated in Table I-3 and the accompanying narrative. The
                    number of households estimated to be in the extremely low-income category
                    is 3,002. Additionally, as stated in the Housing Authority section above, the
                    2005-2010 Consolidated Plan stated that 70 percent of the 3,509 (2,456)
                    families on the public housing and voucher waiting lists were extremely low-
                    income. Elements must also identify zoning to encourage and facilitate sup-
                    portive housing and single-room occupancy units (SROs).
                    Extremely low-income households typically comprise persons with special
                    housing needs including, but not limited to, persons experiencing homeless-
                    ness or near-homelessness, persons with substance abuse problems, and
                    persons with mental illness or developmental disabilities. The Institute for
                    Local Government’s (ICG) Housing Resource Center defines an SRO as “a
                    type of residential hotel offering one-room units for long-term occupancy by
                    one or two people...and may have a kitchen or bath facilities (but not both) in
                    the room.” The City does not explicitly define SROs in the Zoning Ordinance,
                    but has defined “boardinghouse” in the Zoning Ordinance (Section 10-3.205)
                    as “a dwelling other than a hotel where lodging and/or meals for three or
                    more persons are provided for compensation.” The City’s Zoning Ordinance
                    currently allows boarding or rooming houses with a conditional use permit
                    (CUP) in the R-3 zone, which is a high density residential zone. Action Item
                    4-5-1 states that the City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to add the defini-
                    tion of a single-room occupancy unit or “SRO” to the current boardinghouse
                    definition. Action Item 4-5-1 requires the City to amend its code to explicitly
                    define SROs as a use in the zoning code.
                    Farmworker Housing
                    In Madera, permanent rental housing affordable to low- and very low-income
                    households is the main type of housing for permanent farmworkers. Loca-
                    tions identified for multi-family residential would provide sites for this group.
                    Most housing specifically for farmworkers exists in the unincorporated county.
                    The only farmworker complex within the city limits is the 40-unit Cottonwood
                    Farm Labor complex operated by Self Help Housing.

                      HOUSING ELEMENT                               CHAPTER 7
Seasonal farmworkers stay primarily in boardinghouses and secondary dwell-
ing units. Boardinghouses are a housing alternative which offers the most
reasonably priced lodging for seasonal farmworkers. The City allows board-
inghouses and bungalow courts in the R-3 zone with a use permit.
Growth Control/Growth Management
The City is in the process of developing Growth Control policies in the Gen-
eral Plan update.
Design Criteria
Other than the standards related to the Planned Development process, the
City does not have a design review process or a set of design criteria for new
residential development. The PD process allows for special design review
criteria to ensure that the maximum utility of a site is realized. The utility of
sites are maximized through the PD process by allowing variations from the
Zoning Ordinance, like clustering and density transfers. The City is also in
the process of developing Design Review policies in the General Plan up-
date.
Open Space Requirements
Land use controls which can impact a city’s ability to provide affordable hous-
ing include open space and off-street parking requirements. Because these
on-site improvements are land-intensive, they increase the cost of land de-
velopment by reducing the unit density while adding landscaping and parking
area development costs. Open space and parking standards are typically de-
termined by surveying similar communities and what the local experience has
indicated is appropriate. The City of Madera off-street parking requirements
for all residential land uses reflect typical standards found elsewhere around
the state, especially among similarly sized communities. The standard park-
ing requirement for apartment development is two spaces for apartments with
two or more bedrooms, with guest parking required at 25 percent of the num-
             CITY OF MADERA GENERAL PLAN | OCTOBER 2009                   7-105

CHAPTER 7       HOUSING ELEMENT
                          ber of units. This standard provides for adequate off-street parking for ten-
                          ants and visitors and permits emergency vehicle access and circulation.
                          Open space standards do not exceed those used in other cities of compara-
                          ble size. In Madera, these standards reflect a strong community value in
                          open space and the role it plays in the overall quality of life of the City’s resi-
                          dents. The standard for conventional single-family residential lot-by-lot de-
                          velopment is 60 percent open space (or 40 percent coverage). This require-
                          ment is inclusive of driveways, uncovered patios and swimming pools, or oth-
                          er hardscape intended for outdoor use. In considering a minimum 4,500
                          square foot lot, the site coverage would need to be in excess of 1,800 square
                          feet to exceed this standard. Planned development procedures provide for
                          the clustering of residential units and the concentration of open space for
                          common use. Indeed, the City has consistently encouraged this type of de-
                          velopment as one method of providing different housing types at more afford-
                          able levels.
                          According to the Madera Zoning Ordinance, the minimum useable open
                          space for each residential unit is shown in Table I-38:

buildings are located.
For apartment projects containing 50 or more units, one or more amenities
are required such as a community room, storage facility, basketball court,
swimming pool, tennis court, putting green, lawn bowling, tot lot, or outdoor
cooking facilities or barbecues.
Building Codes and Enforcement
Building standards are essential to ensure safe housing, although some
codes and standards may constrain the development or preservation of af-
fordable housing. The City of Madera has adopted the California Govern-
ment Code 50022.1 through 50022.6, the texts of those certain publications
of the International Conference of Building Officials, the International Associa-
tion of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials, the Western Fire Chiefs Associa-
tion and the National Fire Protection Association, together with parts of the
appendices thereto, the 2007 California Building Code, based on the 2006
International Building Code, the 2007 California Mechanical Code, based on
the 2006 Uniform Mechanical Code, the 2007 California Fire Code, based on
the 2006 International Fire Code, the 2007 California Plumbing Code, based
on the 2006 Uniform Plumbing Code, the Uniform Swimming Pool, Spa and
Hot Tub Code - 2006 Edition, the 2007 California Electrical Code, based on
the 2005 National Electrical Code, the 2007 Energy Code, and the 2006 In-
ternational Existing Building Code. The CODE was last amended on Octo-
ber 1, 2008.
Building codes and their enforcement can increase the cost of housing and
impact the feasibility of rehabilitating older properties that must be upgraded
to current code standards. In this manner, building codes and their enforce-
ment could potentially act as a constraint on the amount of housing and its af-
fordability. The City operates a code enforcement program employing seven
full-time and three part-time Code Enforcement Officers. Enforcement in-
volves ensuring that development within the City conforms to the standards
contained in the Madera Municipal Code, which includes the above Uniform

                    Codes by reference. However, the codes enforced by Madera are similar to
                    the codes enforced by most other cities in the region and are necessary to
                    promote the minimum standards of safety and accessibility to housing. Thus,
                    the codes are not considered to be an undue constraint on housing invest-
                    ment. The code enforcement process is initiated both by resident complaints
                    and through the observation of code violations by enforcement staff. The City
                    has had a housing rehabilitation program in the past where the efforts of code
                    enforcement officials would be coordinated to target areas where rehabilita-
                    tion needs are most prevalent. However, the program has limited funding and
                    is currently not very active.
                    On-/Off-Site Improvement Requirements
                    The City of Madera requires that developers complete certain site improve-
                    ments in conjunction with new housing development. The following are re-
                    quired improvements for residential subdivisions with five or more parcels ac-
                    cording to City Standard Specifications:
                         •   Storm drainage system;
                         •   Sanitary sewer system and domestic water system including water
                             meters;
                         •   Electric, telephone, and cablevision facilities; and
                         •   Street infrastructure including curb and gutters, sidewalks, streetlights
                             (galvanized steel), and fire hydrants.
                    On-site improvements vary with the type of project proposed. The improve-
                    ments are guided by City Code and Standard Specifications. The right-of-
                    way improvements can be a major cost of development; but they are essen-
                    tial to orderly development, the provision of services, and the health and safe-
                    ty of residents. An action taken by the City to reduce these costs to some ex-
                    tent was the adoption of the 50-foot Residential Access Street Standard.
                    This standard allows for a narrower pavement width and contiguous sidewalk,

                         along with a narrower right-of-way, all of which will lower the cost of residen-
                         tial development.
                         The General Plan also recommends automatic irrigation systems for medium
                         and high density residential projects. This recommendation, along with low
                         maintenance and drought-tolerant plants, should reduce the long-term costs
                         for these types of projects. The state in its mandatory water efficiency regula-
                         tions indicates that the cost of installing and maintaining water-efficient land-
                         scapes should not exceed the costs of other landscaping. Any actual differ-
                         ential should be offset by lower maintenance costs in a very short time.
                         Development Fees and Other Exactions Required of Developers
                         Table I-39a indicates the building and impact fees in 2008 for a typical 1,500
                         square foot 2 bathroom single-family home in the City of Madera. The sewer
                         and water fees vary depending on which one of the four quadrants the a de-
                         velopment will be located. The “typical” example provided in Table I-39a is
                         based on fees for the Southeast quadrant where much of the RDA- assisted
                         housing development has tended to occur in recent years.

                             Processing and Permit Procedures
                             Processing time for projects in the City of Madera is generally minimal. Multi-
                             family projects in residential zones are permitted uses and therefore require
                             only administrative review. A project can be approved and under way for
                             building permit applications in as little as two to four weeks. This procedure,
                             identified as a site plan review application, was established in 1988. It better
                             defines application procedures and project requirements and streamlines the
                             process for many larger developments which might otherwise be subject to
                             use permit approval.
                             In Planned Development zones, a precise plan is required for the project and
                             must be approved by the Planning Commission. The formal review period is
                             four weeks. The time before approval typically ranges from four to six weeks
                             and varies with time between the submittal date and the next regularly sche-
                             duled Planning Commission meeting. Use permits are required for residential
                             uses in commercial zones. The review period is the same as that for precise
                             plans. It cannot be reduced due to the public hearing and environmental re-
                             view notification requirements. Use permits have a 15-day appeal period and
                             are void after one year unless building permits are obtained. Extensions of
                             this time frame may be requested if a project requires a longer period of time
                             in which to obtain financing and prepare building and improvement plans.
                             The formal review period for tentative subdivision maps is four to six weeks.
                             The applicant's preparation time and preliminary staff review may increase
                             the time frames for subdivisions. The time frame often depends on the accu-
                             racy and adequacy of the initial plans. A requirement for an environmental
                             impact report (EIR) will lengthen the process but an EIR can be processed
                             simultaneously with the map. Review and processing times for tentative
                             maps are minimal in the City of Madera since the City Council has delegated

the decision-making process to the Planning Commission. Parcel maps for
less than five parcels are approved by the City's Development Review Com-
mittee so processing time is only limited to the public hearing notification time
frame.
The processing time for projects has been kept to a minimum. Staffing levels
in the various departments responsible for development review are also kept
to a minimum and may result in a slight increase in the time for processing of
projects when the workload is heavy. The adequacy and accuracy of plans
varies significantly among the various developers. Procedural guidelines
have been developed and checklists have been made available for applicants
to reduce time in the preliminary plan preparation phases. Revised applica-
tion forms have also been created which contain an outline of procedures and
application submittal requirements.
Multi-Family Residential Permit Processing and Procedures
Multi-family residential development (3 or more units) proposed for the R-1,
R-2, and R-3 zoning districts require a site plan review application that re-
quires administrative approval, which typically takes approximately two
weeks. Multi-family development proposed in the Commercial and Planned
Development zones requires Planning Commission approval, which can take
approximately one to two months. Conditional use permits are also required
for residential development in Planned Development zones and all Commer-
cial zones with the exception of the Neighborhood Commercial (C-N) zone.
PUD Zone Districts
The review of a precise plan for a PUD zone district is essentially the same
review as in a standard site plan review for other zone districts; both look at
the same issues of design, neighborhood compatibility, and functionality.
However, rather than having to hold to the standard development criteria of a
given zone, Planned Unit Developments "PUD" zone districts allows projects
to be developed in consideration of the context of the specific site and the
project's design features. The City's standards are allowed to be replaced

                    with provisions that allow for more creative and efficient use of space and re-
                    sources such as clustering, density transfers, reduced setbacks, shared facili-
                    ties, etc. The City also has provisions that allow special needs housing to in-
                    crease densities and decrease requirements such as parking and open
                    space.
                    In an effort to streamline the processing of developments in the PUD zone,
                    the City has development design guidelines in place and developers are en-
                    couraged to utilize previously set standards. These tools allow developers to
                    utilize new innovations in designs and technologies to create quality housing
                    without being solely limited to status-quo development regulations, while at
                    the same time providing them with quick ready-made options and guidance
                    for standards that are acceptable for development in the City.
                    Homes in the PUD zone districts typically are developed as one or two story
                    units, but there are no height restrictions. The PUD zones require open space
                    equal to the R-3 zone district (750 sq.ft./unit). However, PUD zones do not
                    have the minimum dimension requirements as in all other residential zone
                    districts. Parking requirements are the same for all residential zones, but
                    may be reduced in a precise plan if the type and design of the project warrant
                    it.
                    Processing of precise plans generally take 4-6 weeks from submission to
                    Planning Commission Decision. This is slightly longer than processing a by-
                    right application in a non PUD zone district (3-4 weeks). Projects that are
                    concerned with expediting the required approvals necessary to begin con-
                    struction are allowed to process the checking of improvement plans simulta-
                    neously, which takes the same amount of time or longer than the approval of
                    a precise plan. Hence, a precise plan does not delay development. The cost
                    to process a precise plan is actually slightly less ($100) than processing a site
                    plan in a non PUD zone district.
                    Overall a PUD zone district allows development more flexibility and can re-
                    duce unneeded development requirements. The processing does not cost

any more than the standard development process or delay final construction
approval.
Following initial plan approval from either administrative staff or the Planning
Commission, application for required building permits may commence. A site
utility and grading permit and electrical, mechanical, and plumbing permit are
the permits required for multi-family residential developments.
Potential Non-Governmental/Market Constraints
All resources needed to develop housing in Madera are subject to the laws of
supply and demand, meaning that these resources may not always be avail-
able at prices which make housing development attractive. Thus, cost factors
are the primary non-governmental constraints upon development of housing
in Madera. This is particularly true in the case of housing for low- and moder-
ate-income households, where basic development cost factors such as the
cost of land, required site improvements, and basic construction are critical in
determining the income a household must have in order to afford housing.
Availability of Financing
The ability for individual persons or households to obtain financing for home-
ownership is also a potential constraint to lower-income household obtaining
affordable housing. The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) is a federal
law enacted in 1975 that requires mortgage lenders to collect, report, and
disclose information about their mortgage applications, originations, and pur-
chases. HMDA was designed to provide the public with loan data that can be
used to assess how financial institutions are serving the housing needs of
their communities. HMDA record provides some measure of the availability of
financing for homes in Madera.
Table I-41 displays the aggregate loan applications processed in the Madera
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) as reported by individual lending institu-
tions within the MSA for the years 2005, 2006, and 2007. In 2005, 6,534 loan
applications were processed and 67 percent of those were approved (4,408).
             CITY OF MADERA GENERAL PLAN | OCTOBER 2009                    7-115
CHAPTER 7     HOUSING ELEMENT
                    In 2006, there were 175 less applications (6,359) completed and 287 less
                    applications approved (4,121). During 2007, there was a significant decline
                    in the total applications completed from the prior two years. In 2007, there
                    were 2,937 applications completed, a decline of 54 percent from the previous
                    year. Of the total applications completed in 2007, 59 percent were approved,
                    which was a decline in the percentage of approved loans from 2005 and
                    2006.
                    The decline in total applications processed between 2005 and 2007 is not
                    unique to the City of Madera. Fresno, a neighboring city, had a decline of 41
                    percent in total applications received between 2006 and 2007. The 6 percent
                    decline in the percentage of approved loans between 2006 (65 percent) and
                    2007 (59 percent) in Madera was twice as high as the percentage decline in
                    Fresno, which experienced a 3 percent decline from 2006 (67 percent) to
                    2007 (64 percent).
                    As seen in Table I-41, the percentage of approved loans has declined over
                    the reported years, while the percentage of denied loans has increased. In
                    2007, the majority of Census tracts within Madera reported a similar trend in
                    the rising percentage of denied applications and decreasing percentage of
                    approved applications. Census tract 0006.01 is the only Census tract in 2007
                    in Madera in which the total number of denied applications exceeded the total
                    number of approved applications. According to the 2000 Census, this tract
                    had the 83rd highest rate of unemployment amongst California Census tracts
                    and a poverty rate of 41 percent.
                    The overall availability of financing in the City of Madera as compared to
                    Fresno is not a constraint for residents to become homeowners.

                                Federal and State Actions
                                While financing availability is a non-governmental constraint, various state
                                and federal government policies can have significant impacts on the afforda-
                                bility of housing. Most important of these policies are those federal monetary
                                policies that influence interest rates. Interest rates affect both construction
                                costs (construction loans) and long-term mortgage costs, thereby having a
                                significant direct impact on the affordability of housing (California Statewide
                                Plan Update, 1990). The volatility of interest rates is demonstrated by the
                                fact that within the last 20 years, mortgage rates have been as high as 13
                                percent and as low as 5 percent. Construction financing has been even more
                                volatile. The federal government has increased the per-capita limits on tax-
                                exempt bonds and the Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program. That
                                change provides more allocation authority for states, which simply means
                                more supply of funds. The federal government has significantly reduced its
                                involvement in direct construction programs to meet the housing needs of
                                low- and very low-income households. However, it has worked with local
                                housing authorities to make the Section 8 program more efficient and effec-
                                tive. Additionally, HUD has worked aggressively with private sector owners

                    of older assisted housing projects in an effort to keep them affordable. It is
                    now much easier for owners to sell to nonprofits and for-profits who are will-
                    ing to enter into new regulatory agreements.
                    Land Costs
                    Costs associated with the acquisition of land include the market price of raw
                    land and the cost of holding land throughout the development process.
                    Among the variables affecting the cost of land are its location, its amenities,
                    the availability of public services, and the financing arrangements made be-
                    tween the buyer and seller.
                    According to a local developer, a finished lot of 6,000 square feet in size (60
                    ft. by 100 ft.) containing water, sewer, electric, gas and cable connections
                    costs approximately $35,000 to $50,000. In addition to the cost of the raw
                    land, new housing prices are influenced by the cost of holding land while de-
                    velopment permits are processed. The shorter the period of time that it takes
                    a local government to process applications for building, the lesser the effect
                    inflation will have on the cost of construction and labor. Permit processing
                    times are discussed earlier in this chapter in the context of governmental
                    constraints on the development of affordable housing.
                    Development Costs
                    Construction Costs
                    According to a local developer, construction cost which includes labor and
                    material is approximately $80.69 per square foot. Therefore, a 4 bedroom, 2
                    bathroom, 2 car garage, 1,330 square foot house built on a concrete slab
                    would cost an estimated $107,317 to construct.

                               Total Housing Development Costs
                               As shown in Table I-42, the total of all housing development costs discussed
                               above for a typical entry-level single-family home (1,500 square feet) is
                               $172,784, including land, site improvements, construction costs, fees and
                               permits (as shown in Table I-39a). Permit and plan check fees are based on
                               a 1,330 square foot house with two baths and an attached garage built on a
                               concrete slab. This figure does not include developer profit, school district
                               fees, marketing, or financing costs. This is a great increase from the original
                               figures quoted by the same developer in 2002, an almost $31,000 increase in
                               development costs. The original house quoted in 2002 was an estimate for a
                               6,500 square foot lot, with a 1,500 square foot house used as an example.

                               An additional element to note is that other factors are expected to drastically
                               affect the pricing of local homes in the short term. Increased oil prices have
                               caused the cost of materials to skyrocket. While area contractors have been
                               able to absorb the increase for the past year, they will no longer be able to do

                    so. It has become difficult to have prices fixed on any commodity for a period
                    longer than 30 days. For copper wire and piping, a price guarantee can only
                    be made for 24 hours. Another issue that has also come into play is the fact
                    that there is now a surplus of subcontractors for the small amount of work
                    available. The initial result is that developers can garner very competitive
                    pricing for their work. However, this surplus will soon be gone as many of the
                    subcontractors can no longer afford to be in business with the severe decline
                    in work. Therefore eventually it is anticipated that local developers will be
                    faced with less contractors available and hence higher prices

GOALS, POLICIES AND ACTION ITEMS
Under California law, the housing element must include the community’s
goals, policies, quantified objectives, and housing programs for the mainte-
nance, improvement, and development of housing.
This Housing Element includes eight goal statements. Under each goal
statement, the element sets out policies that amplify the goal statement. Im-
plementation programs are listed at the end of the corresponding policy or
group of policies and describe briefly the proposed action, the City agencies
or departments with primary responsibility for carrying out the program, and
the time frame for accomplishing the program. Several of the implementation
programs also have quantified objectives listed.
Definitions of goals, policies and implementation action items are given in the
introduction section of the General Plan. The Housing Element also has in-
cludes quantified objectives for the action items, which is defined below.
Quantified Objective: The number of housing units that the City expects to be
constructed, conserved, or rehabilitated, and the number of households the
City expects will be assisted through Housing Element programs based on
general market conditions during the time frame of the Housing Element.
Housing element law recognizes that in developing housing policy and pro-
grams, identified housing needs may exceed available resources and the
community’s ability to satisfy these needs. The quantified objectives of the
housing element therefore need not be identical to the identified housing
need but should establish the maximum number of housing units that can be
constructed, rehabilitated, and conserved over a five-year time frame.

                      include the following criteria:
                      •    The request for reasonable accommodation will be used by an indi-
                           vidual with a disability protected under fair housing laws.
                      •    The requested accommodation is necessary to make housing avail-
                           able to an individual with a disability protected under fair housing
                           laws.

                           cial or administrative burden on the City.
                      •    The requested accommodation would not require a fundamental al-
                           teration in the nature of the City’s land use and zoning program.
                      Additionally, the City will ensure information is available on how to re-

                     Use Element of the General Plan. Vertical mixed use means that commer-
                     cial and residential uses are developed on different stories of a single build-
                     ing, while horizontal mixed use developments integrate use types in a "flat"
                     arrangement, like a residential complex situated behind a retail/commercial
                     space. Within each mixed use type the goal is to provide multiple use
                     types on a single lot. Horizontal mixed-uses may contain a single or multi-
                     ple structures on one site.

CHAPTER 7           HOUSING ELEMENT
                           QUANTIFIED OBJECTIVES
                           One of the requirements of state law (California Government Code, Section
                           65583[b]) is that the Housing Element contain quantified objectives for the
                           maintenance, preservation, improvement, and development of housing.
                           State law recognizes that the total housing needs identified by a community
                           may exceed available resources and the community’s ability to satisfy this
                           need. Under these circumstances, the quantified objectives need not be
                           identical to the total housing needs. The quantified objectives shall, however,
                           establish the maximum number of housing units by income category that can
                           be constructed, rehabilitated, and conserved over a five-year time period.
                           Table II-1 summarizes the quantified objectives for the construction, rehabili-
                           tation, or conservation of units during the time frame of the Housing Element
                           (2009–2014). Residential building has slowed in general as of December
                           2008 and it is unclear when the industry will regain its momentum to the level
                           of development experienced in the last Housing Element cycle. As a result of
                           the downward trend in building, the City’s 2009–2014 quantified objectives
                           are significantly lower than its regional need allocations and even less than
                           the last planning period’s objectives.

* Projection based on development since the beginning of the City’s RHNA period (January 1, 2007), on a pipeline affordable
project, Arbor Point, which is planned to provide 49 very low-income units and 15 low-income units and on the current devel-
opment activity (or lack of) in the City. These numbers were used as a basis to project over the remaining five-year period tak-
ing the current development climate into account.
** Based on the preservation of the Madera Apartments and the Madera Garden Apartments, which have a total of 123 subsi-
dized units.
                                  GENERAL PLAN CONSISTENCY
                                  State law requires that the Housing Element contain a statement of “the
                                  means by which consistency will be achieved with other general plan ele-
                                  ments and community goals” (California Government Code, Section 65583[c]
                                  [6] [B]. This requires an evaluation of two primary characteristics: (1) an iden-
                                  tification of other General Plan goals, policies, and programs that could affect
                                  implementation of the Housing Element or that could be affected by the im-
                                  plementation of the Housing Element; and (2) an identification of actions to
                                  ensure consistency between the Housing Element and affected parts of other
                                  General Plan elements.
                                  The Housing Element policies and programs were developed subject to the
                                  constraints of the policies and programs constrained in the other General
                                  Plan elements. Of all the other General Plan elements, the Housing Element
                                  is most closely related to the Land Use Element in the General Plan because
                                  the Land Use Element specifies the lands within the city that may be utilized
                                  for housing development. The Housing Element update effort coincides with
                                  the City’s General Plan update. Careful attention has been paid to ensuring
                                  that there is consistency between the policies of the updated elements, par-
                                  ticularly the Land Use Element. Additionally, the proposed General Plan des-
                                  ignations were used in the housing site inventory to determine each site’s ap-
                                  propriateness for residential development.
                                  The Housing Element goals, policies, and program have been cross-
                                  referenced with other existing elements and, as the General Plan update pro-

                   gresses; the City is committed to maintaining consistency with the Housing
                   Element goals, policies, and programs.
                   PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
                   Housing Element law requires the City to make a diligent effort to facilitate the
                   participation of all segments of the community during the preparation of its
                   Housing Element update. The City of Madera has attempted to engage a va-
                   riety of citizens and housing stakeholders by engaging an Advisory Commit-
                   tee made up of seven members of the community. The public is also noticed
                   of these meetings via Planning Department press releases that are posted on
                   the City’s General Plan website. All press releases, PowerPoint presentations
                   and drafts are all posted on the General Plan website
                   (www.maderageneralplan.com). Anyone can also sign up for e-newsletters
                   through the website or send comments on any part of the General Plan at
                   any time.
                   Advisory Committee meetings occur once a month during the General Plan
                   Update and each meeting features two elements. Public are invited to each
                   meeting and the press releases provide notice of which elements will be dis-
                   cussed at each session. Members of the public are encouraged to sign in and
                   submit written comments at each meeting even if the topic of their comments
                   is not specific to the elements on the agenda for that meeting. For examples,
                   the December meeting featured presentations on the noise history/cultural
                   resources and sustainability but a written comment was received about hous-
                   ing needs in the City. The comments stated that Madera needs more “public
                   housing” for seniors, disabled and low income persons in safe neighborhoods
                   and close to bus routes, shopping centers and medical facilities.
                   The Housing Element was a featured topic at two Advisory Committee meet-
                   ings. The first meeting took place on May 28, 2008 when the City was just
                   beginning the update process for the Housing Element. For many in atten-
                   dance at the meeting, this was the first introduction to Housing Element. The
                   presentation focused on what the purpose, content and requirements of a
                   Housing Element are as well as exploring examples of real life household in-
                   come and housing affordability examples to demonstrate who needs housing
                   in Madera. This purpose of this portion of the presentation was to “drive
                   home” who lower- and moderate- income households in Madera really are

and to discourage negative stereotypes of who may be in need of affordable
housing in the community. This was done by providing examples of hypo-
thetical “families” and their incomes (derived from actual wage data for
Madera County) and then based on their income and family size, what was
affordable for them to spend on housing. The remainder of the presentation
presented the results of the “review and revise” portion of the Housing Ele-
ment update whereby the Advisory Committee and/or public could weigh in
on the decisions to “continue”, “modify” or “delete” existing Housing Element
programs based on how well they were implemented.
The second Advisory Committee Meeting that the Housing Element was pre-
sented took place in January 26, 2009. At this point, much of the document
had been updated but the City was still developing policies. Because a great
deal of time had passed since the last Housing Element Advisory Committee
session, the real life examples of household incomes and housing afforda-
bility were presented again with some updated data including discussion of
the effects of the dramatic changes in the housing market on housing oppor-
tunities for lower- and moderate-income households. The City also presented
key policy issues that it expected to be in the public review draft. Many peo-
ple in attendance had questions about the Housing Element content and the
data presented. A representative from the Housing Partnership for the Dis-
abled attended and presented a request for the City to consider the inclusion
of a Universal Design ordinance similar to that of the City of Fresno where
housing projects built with state or federal grant money are required to use
Universal Design techniques. The City has added a program to encourage
and support voluntary inclusion of Universal Design measures in new devel-
opment.
When the public review draft of the Housing Element was ready for viewing,
the City posted the draft on its General Plan website and sent letters directly
to area stakeholders inviting them to view the draft and to attend a feedback
session with the City’s Planning Director. Invitations were sent to 60 stake-
holders for one of eight discussion sessions with the Planning Director. Six-
teen stakeholders attended the sessions. Most of the attendees discussed
the purpose and progress of the Housing Element but few had specific com-
ments or requested changes to the document. The following is a summary of
the comments and topics of discussion:

CHAPTER 7     HOUSING ELEMENT
                   •  President Madera Ministerial Association - Reviewed the features and
                      various policies within the element and discussed the location of new mul-
                      tifamily low income development.
                   •  Public Health Education Coordinator – AIDS - Reviewed the features and
                      various policies within the element, discussed the difficulty of finding ap-
                      propriate housing for their clientele due to a combination of issues but
                      had no specific comments or requests for changes.
                   •  Behavioral Health Program Coordinator, Madera County Health Depart-
                      ment – Also reviewed the features and various policies within the ele-
                      ment, discussed the difficulty of finding appropriate housing for their clien-
                      tele due to a combination of issues, discussed coordinating efforts to
                      partner with other multifamily development projects to utilize one time
                      funds (1.2 Mil) for new housing for mentally disabled.
                   •  Executive Director, Fair Housing Counsel of Central California - Dis-
                      cussed the status and process of adopting the element, and the various
                      issues and programs in Madera relative to fair housing practices. They
                      feel that the element does not have legally adequate provisions for a fair
                      housing program and discussed some suggested actions/policies. The
                      City is still awaiting written comments from the Counsel but is confident
                      that its existing fair housing programs are adequate.
                   •  ADA Council Members - Discussed the purpose and progress of the
                      Housing Element. Discussed the accommodation policy and the possibil-
                      ity of considering means of implementing universal design.
                   •  Planning Director, Madera County - Reviewed the progress of the ele-
                      ment. Discussed the implications of the element relative to the existing
                      agreement for RHNA transfers precipitated by annexations. Agreed that
                      the element does not conflict with or change the existing agreement on
                      the subject which is contained in a tax sharing MOU with the County. No
                      requests for changes.
                   •  Madera County Planning - Reviewed the progress of the element and
                      briefly discussed the policy of limiting County development projects in
                      close proximity to the City. No specific comments or suggestions.

•    Realtors - Reviewed the features and various policies within the element,
     discussed the state of sales with the housing market. No specific recom-
     mendations for amendments.
•    County Superintendent of Schools - Reviewed the features and various
     policies within the element and discussed the state of sales with the hous-
     ing market and impact fee issues that affect housing including school

An announcement was also made at the January Advisory Committee meet-
ing that the City was intending to have a public review draft ready to view on-
line or at the City offices by February 13, 2009.
The public review draft was available for nearly seven weeks before submittal
to the State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) for
its initial 60-day review. The draft will continue to be available for public re-
view throughout this 60 day period. All comments will be seriously consid-
ered and incorporated as appropriate into the final draft of the City’s 2009
Housing Element before it is adopted as part of the updated General Plan.
REVIEW AND EVALUATION OF PREVIOUS HOUSING ELEMENT
Government Code, Section 65588(a)(2) “Review and Revision” requires that
each local government review its Housing Element as frequently as appropri-
ate to evaluate the effectiveness of the Housing Element in attainment of the
community’s housing goals and objectives. This section reflects the actual
housing activities that were accomplished since the last Housing Element.

                Table HE-1 summarizes the location, size, and the estimated number of potential housing units which could be
                accommodated on each site. The table also makes a distinction between the development potential developed at
                a typical density (i.e., the density that has actually been built over the last several years) or realistic unit capacity
                versus the maximum allowed density under a particular zoning district. Figure HE-1 (map) shows the location and
                boundaries of the areas referred to in Table HE-1. The table provides a list of sites by zoning and General Plan
                designation to illustrate each site’s appropriateness for the “appropriate income category” indicated in the far-right
                column. These “appropriate income category” assignments are approximations and some sites will designated as
                appropriate for very low are also inherently appropriate for low income units and vice versa so there is flexibility
                within these sites that enables the City to satisfy its very low- and low-income allocations.

                   CHAPTER 8: LAND USE
                   ELEMENT
                   The Land Use Element is what people typ-
                   ically think of when they think of the “Plan”
                   for the City. It establishes the pattern of
                   activity the community would like to see
                   develop in the years to come, and defines
                   areas of the city for housing, business, in-
                   dustry, open space, recreation, education
                   and other public services.
                   THE PLANNING AREA
                   The Planning Area covers roughly 67,414
                   acres of land (about 105 square miles) in
                   southern Madera County. As of 2008, the
                   City of Madera occupied 9,512 acres of the
                   Planning Area (about one-seventh of the
                   total area).
                   Madera was established at the endpoint of
                   a lumber flume on the Fresno River that
                   ran more than 60 miles from the Sierra
                   Nevada mountains into the valley. As the
                   endpoint, a city formed named Madera,
                   Spanish for “wood” or “timber.” Timber re-
                   mained the most significant sector in Ma-
                   dera’s economy until the Great Depres-
                   sion.

   CHAPTER 8                 LAND USE ELEMENT
                                     The California Lumber Company officially laid out the town in 1876, and in
                                     1893 Madera became the county seat when Madera County was established.
                                     Madera incorporated as a City on March 27, 1907.
                                                   Residential land use makes up the majority of urban develop-
                                                   ment, concentrated mainly in the City of Madera and the adjacent
                                                   unincorporated areas. Agricultural uses make up the majority of
                                                   the remaining Planning Area’s land use activity. (A summary of
                                                   existing land uses is provided on page 8-4.)
                                                   The land in Madera is relatively flat, with no major hills. The
                                                   Fresno River, Cottonwood Creek, Schmidt Creek, and other mi-
                                                   nor watercourses wind through the city. The historical threat of
                                                   flooding posed by these waterways was largely reduced by the
                                                   construction of the Hidden Lake Dam in 1976. However, portions
                                                   of the Planning Area continue to be affected by the presence of
                                                   remaining floodplains along some sections of these waterways.
                                                   Note: Please see the Health and Safety Element for additional
                                                   information on flood hazards in the Planning Area.

Fresno River near Yosemite.
                                                   World War II surround the commercial and industrial heart of
                                                   downtown, with looser suburban style residential neighborhoods
                                                   growing towards the edge of town and to the south.
                                     Industrial uses have been established in several areas, with a large area of
                                     “heavy” industry located in the southwestern portion of Madera. In recent
                                     years, industrial uses have also been built near the Madera Municipal Airport
                                     and at the Airport Industrial Park to the east. Some industrial uses also re-
                                     main in the downtown area, continuing a land use pattern that dates to the
                                     city’s early lumber milling days.

                                   ten members of the Madera Vintners Association, which promotes the “Made-

                                   Like many areas in California agricultural land is being converted to other
                                   uses in the Madera area. Between 1984 and 2006 Madera County lost an
                                   average of 1,315 acres of agricultural and grazing land per year, mostly due
                                   to conversion to rural residential and commercial uses.

                                   Existing (2008) land uses in the Planning Area, the Growth Boundary, and

LAND USE CORE PRINCIPLES
The Land Use Goals and Policies included in this Element, together with the
goals and policies in other Elements of this General Plan, reflect a commit-
ment by the City of Madera to pursue several core principles:
   •   Compact and efficient land use patterns should be established
       which provide opportunities to accommodate growth at densities
       which are generally greater than experienced by the City in recent his-
       tory.
   •   Comprehensive planning of new urban areas should be underta-
       ken at the initial stages of development to ensure individual projects
       are integrated with existing and future projects and that they consider
       the form and function of the surrounding area.
   •   Residential neighborhoods should be developed as more than a
       collection of lots; they should incorporate design features and ameni-
       ties that create a desirable living environment.
   •   Walkability should be promoted by establishing land use and circula-
       tion patterns that provide connectivity between neighborhoods, com-
       mercial services, and other public gathering places.
   •   The Fresno River should be utilized as an amenity by incorporating it
       as a major feature in the development and redevelopment of proper-
       ties along the river.
   •   The mix of land uses should be balanced to provide appropriate ra-
       tios of commercial and industrial opportunities to housing.
   •   Agricultural Land outside the area planned for urban development
       should be protected.

CHAPTER 8     LAND USE ELEMENT
                   The Building Blocks concepts described later in this Element are a prime
                   example of how the City’s commitment to planning will be implemented. The
                   Building Blocks concept is based on simple ideas: that walking or bicycling
                   should be viable alternatives to the family car, that neighborhoods work better
                   when they have a central place that all residents can enjoy, and that every-
                   one’s quality of life is improved when they live in an area where they have an
                   opportunity to get to know one another.
                   The Building Blocks concept, which is envisioned to be applied both to new
                   development and in existing areas, is also part of the City’s efforts to build a
                   more compact and sustainable community in which it is easier to travel with-
                   out a car. Building a more compact city will also reduce the need to use the
                   area’s farmland for development—the Land Use Map in this Element shows
                   how these lands are proposed to be used to create a buffer of permanent
                   agricultural lands around the urbanized area of Madera.
                   This Element also recognizes the importance of Madera’s Downtown. The
                   historic heart of the city is envisioned to be improved through detailed plan-
                   ning (the creation of a Downtown Plan) and increased economic vitality.

          LAND USE GOALS
GOAL LU-1 Madera is a well-planned city prepared for growth through comprehen-
          sive planning which balances growth demands with resources and in-
          frastructure, to facilitate high quality development.
GOAL LU-2 In a change from the city’s previous practice of rapid outward expan-
          sion, Madera is a more sustainable, compact city that uses more com-
          pact land use patterns to encourage walking, bicycling, and transit use;
          preserve agricultural and other open space uses; and reduce infrastruc-
          ture costs.
GOAL LU-3 Madera is a vibrant city that provides its residents with a high quality
          of life and attracts visitors with quality buildings, attractive streetscapes
          and public spaces, a wide variety of restaurants, entertainment, cultural
          venues and shops. Downtown Madera supports diverse commercial and
          business opportunities, and viable commercial spaces are available
          throughout the community.

CHAPTER 8      LAND USE ELEMENT
                    LAND USE POLICIES
                     GENERAL LAND USE POLICIES
 Policy LU-1►        Figure LU-2, “Land Use Map,” depicts the land use policy of the City of
                     Madera. The Land Use Map is an illustration of the City’s land use policy
                     for all of the lands in the Planning Area.
 Policy LU-2►        The Land Use Map’s designations are intended to generally follow parcel
                     lines. Interpretation may be needed to determine the exact boundaries of a
                     land use classification where parcel lines are unclear, have been moved, or
                     have been deleted. The exact boundaries of a land use designation may
                     be adjusted at the City’s discretion to reflect conditions on the ground, own-
                     ership boundaries, or other conditions. Minor changes of this type shall not
                     be considered an amendment to this General Plan. Some parcels may be
                     covered by more than one land use designation.
 Policy LU-3►        Zoning in the City limits shall be consistent with the General Plan Land Use
                     Map. Where multiple zoning districts may be compatible, the City shall ap-
                     ply the most-compatible district which best achieves the goals and policies
                     of all elements of this General Plan.
                         Action Item LU-3.1
                         Initiate an amendment to the Zoning Map to rezone all lands within the
                         City to conform with the Land Use Map. Properties outside the city lim-
                         its will be prezoned to conform with the Land Use Map when deemed
                         necessary and appropriate by the City to facilitate annexation and/or the
                         consideration of development projects by the City.
                     Note to the Reader: Descriptions of land use categories are provided on the
                     pages following the Land Use Map.

Policy LU-4► The following shall apply to the use and interpretation of the Land Use Map:
                  •   The official Land Use Map shall be the printed, signed copy on file in
                      the office of the City Clerk, including any adopted amendments.
                  •   Electronic files used to create the map are not the official map.
                  •   The official Land Use Map shall be printed for viewing and interpre-
                      tation at a scale of one inch = 2,500 feet.
                  •   Questions regarding the location of land use designations shall be
                      resolved by the City using the official Land Use Map or a printed
                      copy at the scale specified above.
Policy LU-5► The Land Use Map does not constitute a guarantee that any particular
             property can be developed as shown on the map. A variety of constraints,
             including regulatory requirements, General Plan policies and other factors
             will affect a site’s development potential.
                  •   Calculations of the maximum permitted intensity of development
                      shall be based on the gross acreage as specified by the Madera
                      County Assessor’s records, less any acreage required for the follow-
                      ing: collector and arterial street right of way; public parks as defined
                      in the Parks Element, public facilities such as schools, fire stations,
                      and police facilities; floodways or flood plains; protected biological
                      habitats, and other unique constraints applicable to the property as
                      determined by the City. In the event gross acreage is not included
                      in the Assessor’s data, it shall be calculated by City staff using the
                      dimensions of the property as shown on Madera County Assessor’s
                      Maps.
                  •   The actual intensity of development allowed for any specific project
                      number of units which can be built may be less than the potential
                      maximum due to physical constraints and other requirements, and
                      will be determined through the project approval process.

CHAPTER 8           LAND USE ELEMENT
  Policy LU-6►            Where a density range is specified for residential development, develop-
                          ments shall provide at least the minimum density and shall not exceed the
                          maximum density except as provided for in any applicable density bonus
                          provision.
  Policy LU-7►            Residential development shall conform to the “Target Density” requirement
                          for each land use category. Development density (dwelling units per acre,
                          as calculated using the same methodology as described in Policy LU-5),
                          shall be at or above the Target Density unless one or more of the following
                          findings can be made:
                              •   Specific characteristics of the site (flooding, topography, protected
                                  habitat areas, airport proximity, etc.) cannot be built on and reduce
                                  the development potential below the Target Density.
                              •   Development at the Target Density would result in unacceptable im-
                                  pacts to roadways or other infrastructure or the exceedence of any
                                  City-adopted Threshold Standards.1
                              •   Development was limited by a Development Agreement, Vesting
                                  Tentative Tract Map, or other City-approved plan or agreement exist-
                                  ing before October 1, 2009.
                          Target Density requirements shall apply to all land which was part of a parcel
                          of at least ten (10) acres in size on or after October 1, 2009.

Policy LU-8► Density averaging may be permitted as part of a comprehensively planned
             development or Village Plan (as defined in this Land Use Element) in order
             to enhance a project’s ability to provide a variety of housing types or to in-
             corporate additional public amenities. The total number of dwelling units ap-
             proved as part of the density averaging program must meet the target densi-
             ty, and must not exceed the maximum density requirements for the applica-
             ble land use designations.
                 Action Item LU-8.1
                 In accordance with Policy LU-8, amend the Zoning Code to include
                 guidelines for “density averaging.” Potential strategies include:
                 •   Transfer of Development Rights within a Village area;
                 •   Placing limitations on the amount or percent of land area that can be
                     developed at a single density before requiring a variety of lot and unit
                     sizes; and
                 •   Establishing additional amenity requirements (bus turn-outs, neigh-
                     borhood parks, bicycle lane and parking, park n-ride lots, etc...), for
                     projects seeking density averaging.
Policy LU-9► Public facilities, such as fire stations, wells for public water supplies, parks,
             and other governmental facilities, are permitted in and are considered to be
             consistent with any land use designation.

CHAPTER 8      LAND USE ELEMENT
                     GROWTH BOUNDARY
 Policy LU-10►       The Growth Boundary is considered by the City to define the physical limits
                     of development in Madera. The City shall direct all future growth in Madera
                     and in the unincorporated area outside the city limits to occur inside the
                     Growth Boundary shown on the Land Use Map in this General Plan. Within
                     the City’s Planning Area, the City encourages the County to assist the City in
                     maintaining an agricultural greenbelt around the Growth Boundary by limiting
                     the use of land designated for Agriculture on the City’s General Plan Land
                     Use map to agriculture.
                     The following apply to the Growth Boundary:
                         •   The Growth Boundary may only be revised as part of a comprehen-
                             sive update of the General Plan involving, at a minimum, the Land
                             Use and Circulation elements.
                         •   Any revision to the Growth Boundary shall be accompanied by a
                             statement of findings which demonstrate the following:
                             1) That the revision is consistent with the intent of the Growth Boun-
                                 dary and all other applicable policies in this General Plan;
                             2) That the revision is necessary to accommodate planned growth in
                                 Madera.

                                  LAND USE ELEMENT                                CHAPTER 8
Policy LU-11► The City specifically envisions the establishment and maintenance of a
              greenbelt of agricultural and other open space lands around the urbanized
              portion of the Planning Area, outside the Growth Boundary, as shown on the
              Land Use Map. In addition to the maintenance of appropriate agricultural
              land use designations, the City encourages the use of Williamson Act con-
              tracts and similar mechanisms to ensure the maintenance of the greenbelt.
              Along the west edge of the Planning Area, the greenbelt is intended to be
              permanent, and the implementing mechanisms on the west edge should re-
              flect that intent, including transfer of development rights, permanent conser-
              vation easements, etc. (See specific policies for Villages D & E for require-
              ments to establish a permanent edge/buffer on the western boundary of
              these Villages).
Policy LU-12► The City shall plan and install infrastructure to serve only the area inside the
              Growth Boundary. The expansion of urban services (specifically including
              residential sewer service) outside this boundary shall not be permitted unless
              the City Council finds that:
                  1) The extension is needed to address a clear public health or safety
                      need; and
                  2) The infrastructure provided is sized to the minimum level necessary
                      in order to reduce any excess capacity that could be used to support
                      additional growth outside the boundary.
                  Action Item LU-12.1
                  Develop and implement programs and strategies that support the Growth
                  Boundary and keep urban growth inside the Growth Boundary.

CHAPTER 8      LAND USE ELEMENT
                     GROWTH MANAGEMENT POLICIES
 Policy LU-13►       The City shall support the annexation of property to its boundaries for the
                     purpose of new development only when it determines that the following con-
                     ditions exist:
                     1) Sufficient public infrastructure, facilities, and services are available or will
                          be provided in conjunction with new development; and
                     2) Demands on public infrastructure, facilities and services created by the
                          new development will not result in reductions in capacity that is neces-
                          sary to serve the existing city limits (including demand created by poten-
                          tial infill development), reductions in existing service levels within the city
                          limits, or the creation of detrimental fiscal impacts on the City.
                          Action Item LU-13.1
                          Maintain and periodically update a set of Facility Master Plans for major
                          municipal infrastructure and public facilities, including, at a minimum,
                          wastewater, water, storm drainage, and parks and recreation facilities.
                          Action Item LU-13.2
                          Establish, maintain and monitor a set of level-of-service criteria for police
                          and fire protection services as a tool to assess the ability of the City to
                          service growth.
                          Action Item LU-13.3
                          Monitor levels-of-service for streets, roads, and other features of the cir-
                          culation system based on the level of criteria included in this general plan
                          as a tool to assess the ability of the City to service growth.

                   Action Item LU-13.4
                   Conduct an ongoing Development Monitoring Program focused on new
                   development activity and related infrastructure and public facility con-
                   struction to determine adherence to adopted level of service standards
                   and criteria and compliance with and other City policies and programs.
Policy LU-14► All proposals to annex property into the City limits for the purpose of new de-
              velopment shall prepare a Public Facilities Financing Plan (PFFP) that articu-
              lates infrastructure and public facilities requirements, their costs, financing
              mechanisms, and the feasibility of the financial burden. The PFFP shall ana-
              lyze backbone infrastructure and public service needs and funding capacity
              at the Village level, as defined in Figure LU-3 of the Land Use Element of
              this General Plan. (The Planning Process required for Village Reserve
              Areas in Policy LU-34 shall be sufficient to meet this requirement.) The cost
              of preparing the PFFP shall be shared proportionately among property own-
              ers in each Village, with the shares of any non-participating owner collected
              at the time of development and reimbursed to owner(s) who prepared the
              PFFP through a reimbursement agreement.
Policy LU-15► The City shall deny projects and oppose the annexation of properties which
              are demonstrated to be out of compliance with Policies LU-13 and LU-14
              above.
Policy LU-16► Funding mechanisms for major capital facilities which must be “oversized” to
              support future development shall be established to account for the full cost of
              the facility(ies) and provide for ultimate financing by the future development
              that will share in the benefit. A typical way of accomplishing this is for the ini-
              tial project proponent to complete the required improvements and enter into
              a reimbursement agreement to be reimbursed for that portion beyond his fair
              share. Alternatively, a phased Community Facility District (CFD) or similar
              mechanism which can include all oversized facilities required for the Village
              can be established to finance these facilities over time.

CHAPTER 8      LAND USE ELEMENT
 Policy LU-17►       It is the policy of the City of Madera that any lands in the Planning Area out-
                     side of the City which are proposed to be converted from agricultural use
                     should be annexed to the City before development. The City encourages the
                     County to assist in the implementation of this policy by taking the following
                     actions:
                          •   Discouraging the subdivision of unincorporated land within the Plan-
                              ning Area to parcel sizes less than twenty acres.
                          •   Directing all new urban development within the Growth Boundary
                              (development that would typically be expected to connect to commu-
                              nity sewer and water systems) to annex into the City and by support-
                              ing annexation applications at the Local Agency Formation Commis-
                              sion.
 Policy LU-18►       The City may, as it deems necessary, annex rural or agricultural areas into
                     the City to facilitate the development of the City and/or protect agricultural
                     and open spaces and allow for their operation at different service standards
                     than urbanized areas.
                    LAND USE CATEGORIES
                     RESIDENTIAL LAND USE CATEGORIES
 Policy LU-19►       The following are the City’s residential land use categories:
                     Village Land Use Categories
                     Village Reserve: This category applies to lands in Villages which require
                     additional comprehensive planning as defined in this Land Use Element.
                     Specific land use designations called out in this Land Use Element will be
                     applied in conjunction with the village level planning processes.

                                                     LAND USE ELEMENT                                       CHAPTER 8
                                 Village Mixed Use: This category provides for a mix of uses generally cor-
                                 responding to the Medium Density Residential, High Density Residential,
                                 and Commercial land use categories. This designation is to be applied in
                                 the Village Centers and implemented through standard zoning districts,
                                 specific plans, planned development, or other methods.
                                 Note to the Reader: Please see the “Building Blocks” section of this Land
                                 Use Element for additional information and policies related to Villages and
                                 Village Centers. Target densities/intensities of use in the Village Centers
                                 are shown below for the various residential and commercial uses which will
                                 take place in the Centers.
                                 Residential Land Use Categories
                                 Very Low Density Residential (VLD): Residential development at a density
                                 of 0 to 2 units per acre, with a Target Density of 1.5 units per acre.2 The
                                 Very Low Density category is intended to be limited in its application to
                                 areas which have an established pattern of rural residential development,
                                 generally located along the edge of the urbanized area. The application of
                                 this designation in other areas will be by exception only. Ranchette-style
                                 homes on large lots are the predominant use. Farming activities may be
                                 occur on larger lots, but commercially viable farming is not expected to be
                                 widespread and should not interfere with the residential nature of the cate-
                                 gory.
                                 Low Density Residential (LD): Residential development at a density of 2.1
                                 to 7 units per acre, with a Target Density of 5.25 units per acre. The Low
                                 Density Residential category represents the traditional single-family neigh-
                                 borhood with a majority of single-family detached homes. This is the pre-
                                 dominant land use category of the City’s residential areas.

  “Target Density” is defined in Policy LU-7. Calculation method to determine estimated development potential is defined in
Policy LU-5.

CHAPTER 8      LAND USE ELEMENT
                     Medium Density Residential (MDR): Residential development at a range of
                     7.1 to 15 units per acre, with a Target Density of 11.25 units per acre. The
                     Medium Density Residential category is generally characterized by small lot
                     single-family detached, single-family attached (e.g., town homes, condomi-
                     niums, brownstones), and small apartment complexes. Medium Density
                     development is an important part of a Village Center.
                     High Density Residential (HD): Residential development at a range of 15.1
                     to 50 units per acre, with a Target Density of 22.5 units per acre. High den-
                     sity residential is the most urban residential category available. The predo-
                     minant style of development is larger apartment and condominium com-
                     plexes. Vertical mixed-use projects with residential use are typically devel-
                     oped in the high-density category. Parking for these facilities is often pro-
                     vided in traditional surface lots located around the complex, although at
                     higher densities parking may be in a parking structure or underground. This
                     designation is intended to be applied to lands within walking distance of ex-
                     isting or planned shopping districts, and in Village Centers.
                          Action Item LU-19.1
                          Amend the Zoning Code to implement the density ranges shown above.
 Policy LU-20►       New residential development should be designed to avoid continuous
                     blocks or clusters of dwellings that are connected only by streets, side-
                     walks, and hardscape. New development shall incorporate amenities which
                     establish a sense of identity at the project or neighborhood level, create op-
                     portunities for community interaction, and enhance the visual appeal of the
                     area. Features which accomplish these goals may include pathways, pa-
                     seos, parks, community gardens, and other semi-public gathering places.

Policy LU-21► Multi-family projects shall include functional, accessible outdoor areas and
              improvements which provide space for both private and public gatherings.
              These may include tot lots for pre-school children; passive recreation areas
              for lounging, sun bathing, barbecuing, quiet conversation and reading; and
              private patios or balconies. To the extent possible, these areas shall be
              shaded by trees and/or shade structures.
Policy LU-22► Single family developments need to provide functional outdoor recreational
              space. The space can be provided either on individual lots or more effi-
              ciently as aggregated local public spaces, creating features such as those
              described in Policy LU-20.
                   Action Item LU-22.1
                   Amend the Zoning Code to implement policy LU-22.
              Note to the Reader: Please see the Housing Element for additional policies
              and programs related to residential development in Madera.
              COMMERCIAL LAND USE CATEGORIES AND POLICIES
Policy LU-23► The following are the City’s commercial land use categories:
              Commercial: This is the City’s retail commercial land use category. A
              broad range of commercial uses is allowed, including professional offices.
              Various zoning designations shall be used to determine the specific charac-
              ter of commercial development, from regional shopping centers to neigh-
              borhood stores. The maximum floor area ratio (FAR) for the Commercial
              designation is 0.30.
              Office: This category provides for the development of office centers near
              residential areas and is designed to buffer between residential areas and
              more intense uses or arterial streets. The areas are differentiated from of-

CHAPTER 8      LAND USE ELEMENT
                     fice uses in commercial designations by reduced quantities of signage and
                     architecture that is more consistent with any adjoining residential areas.
                     Architecture and other features should be sympathetic with adjacent resi-
                     dential values. The maximum floor area ratio (FAR) for the Office designa-
                     tion is 1.0 except in the Downtown District where this FAR may be ex-
                     ceeded if determined appropriate by the City.
                     Note to the Reader: Please see Action Item LU-3.1, which provides for the
                     rezoning of lands in the city limits and Planning Area to conform with the
                     designations shown on the Land Use Map.
                     Note to the Reader: Please see also the “Village Mixed Use” land use de-
                     signation, which allows a mix of commercial and residential uses in Village
                     Centers.
 Policy LU-24►       Mixed Use projects, in which residential and commercial uses are combined
                     within one building or site, are permitted in commercially designated proper-
                     ties, provided that the uses are complementary to each other and integrated
                     in a unified design (architecture, landscape and circulation).
                         Action Item LU-24.1
                         Incorporate provisions for mixed use projects into the zoning ordinance,
                         providing for flexibility in applying development standards (such as floor
                         area), where appropriate, based on the location, type, and size of the
                         units and the design of the development.
                         Action Item LU-24.2
                         Seek funding to prepare master plans and/or specific plans and related
                         environmental documents to facilitate mixed use development at se-
                         lected sites.

Policy LU-25► All proposed development in the Redevelopment Project area shall be
              routed to the Redevelopment Agency (RDA) for review. The recommenda-
              tion of the RDA shall be considered by the City as part of the review and
              approval process.

              ditional policies related to the design of commercial developments.
              DOWNTOWN DISTRICT POLICIES
Policy LU-26► The Downtown District is envisioned as the heart of Madera, where all resi-
              dents can go to shop, eat, find entertainment, and interact. To help achieve
              the City’s vision for the Downtown, further planning will be undertaken to
              provide focused, detailed guidelines, standards, and policies for this area.
                   Action Item LU-26.1
                   Prepare and implement a Downtown Plan.
              INDUSTRIAL LAND USE CATEGORIES AND POLICIES
Policy LU-27► The following is the City’s industrial land use category:
              Industrial: This category provides for both light and heavy industrial devel-
              opment. The maximum floor area ratio (FAR) for the Industrial designation
              is 0.80.

CHAPTER 8      LAND USE ELEMENT
 Policy LU-28►       To maintain the quality of life and aesthetic value of the major circulation
                     routes used by both industrial and non-industrial traffic; the portions of in-
                     dustrial sites in public view along arterials and collectors shall be subject to
                     the same standards for architectural review as commercial buildings, includ-
                     ing architecture, street trees, frontage and parking lot landscaping, and
                     screening of outdoor storage visible from public right-of-ways.
                     Please see the Community Design Element for additional policies related to
                     the design of industrial developments.
 Policy LU-29►       The inventory of industrially designated properties created by the Land Use
                     Map is intended to support the long term fiscal viability of the City and to
                     ensure that there are sufficient opportunities for employment generating
                     uses to develop over time. The City recognizes that some industrially des-
                     ignated sites may take longer to develop than others based on market con-
                     ditions and the characteristics of a given site. It is the City’s policy to main-
                     tain its inventory of industrially designated sites. Industrially designated
                     properties shall not be re-designated to an alternative land use except in
                     such limited instances where the City finds that the property is no longer
                     suitable for industrial development and that is in the public’s interest to re-
                     designate the property.
                     OPEN SPACE CATEGORIES AND POLICIES
 Policy LU-30►       The following are the City’s open space land use categories:
                     Resource Conservation/Agriculture:          This category designates lands
                     planned to remain in use as agricultural lands (such as the growing of
                     crops) or for conservation purposes (such as habitat lands).
                     Open Space: This category designates lands planned or in use as publicly
                     owned open space, public parks, and similar uses.

              PUBLIC AND SEMI-PUBLIC LAND USE CATEGORIES AND POLICIES
Policy LU-31► The following is the City’s public and semi-public land use category:
              Other Public and Semi-Public Uses: This category provides for public facili-
              ties owned and/or operated by the City, Madera County, or other public
              agencies. Examples include City hall, Civic Center, School facilities, Coun-
              ty offices, and corporation yards. This designation is commonly used where
              facilities exist or are identified in long term plans. This designation does not
              preclude public facilities, such as fire stations, wells for public water sup-
              plies, parks, and other governmental facilities, in other land use designa-
              tions and their development is considered to be consistent with all land use
              designation.

                                “BUILDING BLOCKS” POLICIES
                                The Building Blocks concept is key to the City’s goal of improving the quality
                                of life in Madera. Building Blocks are based on a simple idea: Residents
                                should live in human-scaled areas that encourage walking and bicycling, that
                                encourage them to interact with their neighbors, and that require less energy
                                (mostly in the form of gasoline) for daily living. Areas built using the Building
                                Blocks concepts will be more livable, will encourage a greater sense of com-
                                munity, and will help Madera to be more sustainable by providing more hous-
                                ing options, more travel choices, and more ways for residents to reduce their
                                use of expensive energy supplies.
                                The Building Blocks concept will be implemented in many ways, including:
                                     •   Land use, which is addressed in this Land Use Element;
                                     •   Circulation, which is addressed in the Circulation and Infrastructure
                                         Element;
                                     •   Design, which is addressed in the Community Design Element.
                                The following concepts, standards, and guidelines shall be used to implement
                                the City’s goal of creating a more compact, livable form of development.

CHAPTER 8               LAND USE ELEMENT
  Policy LU-33►                 Reflecting the community’s desire for a more livable, walkable, and sustain-
                                able community, Madera’s future growth shall be based on the Building
                                Block concept of Neighborhoods, and Villages. In addition, two Districts
                                have been established for specific areas of Madera (the Downtown and the
                                Airport North districts) which don’t conform to typical neighborhood and vil-
                                lage concepts, but do possess unique features that should make them the
                                subject of future, more detailed planning efforts.
                                Each type of Building Block is described below; these discussions are in-
                                tended to be used as guidelines, not as specific requirements or targets.
                                Neighborhoods
                                A Neighborhood is a compact, walkable residential area, generally 1/3 to
                                1/2 mile in radius, as this is the distance an average person would comfort-
                                ably walk or bicycle. In some of the planned Village areas, this overall di-
                                mension will be larger, due to the existing settlement pattern.
                                Neighborhoods will generally be developed at overall densities of 6-8
                                du/ac3, although some will be lower in density due primarily to the existing
                                low-density settlement pattern. In general, the density near the core of a
                                Neighborhood or where the Neighborhood adjoins a Village Center will be
                                higher than at it the edges of the Neighborhood.
                                At the core of each Neighborhood is the Neighborhood Center, a small-
                                scale, neighborhood serving activity center. Neighborhood Centers are ga-
                                thering places where people can congregate and interact. Typical Centers
                                include schools (elementary and middle/junior high schools), libraries,
                                community centers, parks that feature activity elements (i.e. playground and
                                tennis court(s) and basketball court(s)), or neighborhood-serving commer-
                                cial uses (small market, coffee shop, small restaurant, etc.; total square foo-
                                tage is less than 10,000 sq ft).

                    LAND USE ELEMENT                                CHAPTER 8
The following general criteria describe Neighborhoods and Neighborhood
Centers. As noted above, these are intended to be used as guidelines, not
as specific requirements or targets.
Neighborhoods:
Size: 1/3 to 1/2 mile in radius (about 200 to 500 acres)
Population: About 4,000 persons
Residential Density: 6-8 du/ac overall
Notes:
    •   A variety of densities will occur in each Neighborhood; overall densi-
        ty will be lower in areas where existing settlement patterns preclude
        achieving this density.
    •   Overall density includes housing built in the Neighborhood Center.
Neighborhood Centers
Size: About 1-5 acres
Area Served: Neighborhood (about 200 acres)
Population Range Served: About 4,000 people
Typical Range of Building Height: 1-2 stories
Villages
A Village is collection of three to four Neighborhoods. Villages should fea-
ture a mix of residential dwelling types, including the single-family areas
found in the Neighborhoods and multifamily development near the center
and strategically dispersed in single-family areas.
At the center of each Village is the Village Center. Village Centers serve
the daily needs of their service areas and are spaced 1 ½ to 2 miles apart
for adequate distribution around the City. They are primarily commercial
places, featuring stores, offices, restaurants, and services. Multiple tenants
in a pedestrian-friendly commercial development make up the character of
the Center, featuring small to medium size grocery stores, drug stores, and

                    restaurants. Single tenant retail size is developed at a maximum of approx-
                    imately 50,000 square feet so that retail concentrates its services on it own
                    Village and is not aimed at a regional market.
                    Residential uses may be developed in conjunction with the retail and/or of-
                    fice tenants/spaces, typically at a density of 6 to 12 du/ac. Village Centers
                    are often developed with higher density residential sites immediately adja-
                    cent.
                    The following criteria apply to Villages and Village Centers. As noted
                    above, these are intended to be used as guidelines, not as specific re-
                    quirements or targets.
                    Village:
                    Size: About 800 – 1,200 acres
                    Population: About 15,000 persons
                    Residential Density: 6-8 du/ac overall
                    Village Center:
                    Size: About 5 to 10 acres
                    Area Served: About 800 acres
                    Population Range Served: About 15,000 people
                    Typical Range of Building Height, on-site: 1-3 stories
                    Residential Density in or near the Village Center: 8-18 du/ac
                    Districts
                    Districts have been established for the Downtown and the area near the
                    Madera Airport. Districts are not intended to be based on the Neighbor-
                    hood and Village concepts, but require special policies to ensure that they
                    are properly planned and developed.

              VILLAGE AND DISTRICT POLICIES
              The following policies address the Village and District areas designated by
              the City, and are to be applied in combination with other policies in this Land
              Use Element and other elements of the General Plan.
Policy LU-34►  All planning for areas designated on the Land Use Map as “Village Re-
               serve” shall implement the 3-step planning process described below:
               Step 1: Comprehensive Land Use and Implementation Planning
               Step 2: Detailed Neighborhood Plans
               Step 3: Development Proposals
               This planning process is intended to provide progressively more detailed
               plans for Village Reserve areas, Neighborhoods, and individual develop-
               ment projects.
               The following general rules apply to this planning process:
                   •   Each step in the planning process may be initiated by the City of
                       Madera or by another private or public sector applicant(s).
                   •   Each step in the planning process must be completed as a prere-
                       quisite for the next step. However, multiple steps (1+2 or 1+2+3 or
                       2+3) may be undertaken simultaneously. As a general rule, the City
                       would expect that a private applicant would submit a Comprehen-
                       sive Land Use and Implementation Plan and its components (Step
                       1), together with a Neighborhood Plan (Step 2) for at least one
                       neighborhood, as the initial submittal.
                   •   At the Comprehensive Land Use and Implementation Plan and
                       Neighborhood Plan level, the participation of all affected property
                       owners is encouraged, but not required. A private sector applicant

CHAPTER 8      LAND USE ELEMENT
                              submitting either type of plan must include a list of all affected own-
                              ers and their property(ies) and must show how their participation
                              was sought.
                          •   In some Village areas (as mapped and defined in this Land Use
                              Element), the Village Reserve designation applies only to a portion
                              of the Village. In this case, the process outlined below is required
                              only for the Village Reserve areas, not to the entire Village. How-
                              ever, submitting plans that cover the entire Village is permitted.
                     In some Village Reserve areas, a Village Center is not required. See the
                     detailed policies for the affected Village area (later in this Land Use Ele-
                     ment) for further information.
                     In addition to the required plans, maps, reports, etc., the City may at its dis-
                     cretion require other items as needed to address issues in any particular
                     Village. These may include additional environmental analysis, traffic stu-
                     dies, biological studies, noise studies, etc.
                          Action Item LU-34.1
                          Establish and make available procedural guidelines detailing the three
                          step village reserve planning process.
 Policy LU-35►       Figure LU-3 depicts the Village and District areas as defined by the City of
                     Madera. This map shall be used to implement other policies in this General
                     Plan which refer to villages and village centers. Although shown as defined
                     lines, the exact boundaries of a village may be adjusted at the City’s discre-
                     tion to reflect conditions on the ground, ownership boundaries, or other
                     conditions. Such a change shall not be considered an amendment to this
                     General Plan.

                   This illustration of planned land uses in Village A is provided for illustrative
                   purposes only. Land Use Policy is established by the Land Use Map, not by
                   this illustration, and the reader is directed to Figure LU-2 in this Element for
                   detailed information on planned land uses. Neighborhood boundaries are
                   approximate and subject to refinement by the City as part of the Neighbor-
                   hood and Village planning processes.
                   VILLAGE A: GENERAL DESCRIPTION
                   Village A is located in the north-central portion of the Planning Area. The Vil-
                   lage is located entirely outside of the current (2008) city limits, but is inside
                   the current Sphere of Influence. Madera County currently has land use au-
                   thority in this Village, although it is likely that properties in this area will be
                   annexed into the City as urban development is proposed. More than half of

the Village is developed as large lot single family dwelling subdivisions with
average sizes of .5 to one acre.
Area of this Village in the City Limits:              0 acres
Area of this Village in the Sphere of Influence:      3,209 acres
Area of this Village in the Planning Area only:       1,134 acres
Total Area                                            4,343 acres
The area within Village A is developed to what are typically viewed as rural
standards, with most areas lacking curb, gutter, sidewalk, and drainage facili-
ties. All developed properties are accommodated by individual septic sys-
tems. Two-thirds of the developed area is served by a mutual water compa-
ny, with the remainder on individual, private wells. The area is generally un-
derserved by parks and other public amenities. There are no public park fa-
cilities in Village A. A private golf course (Madera Country Club) is located in
the northern portion of the Village near the intersection of Country Club Drive
and Avenue 18½. A single elementary school (Berenda) is located in the
area at the intersection of Club Drive and Lake Street (Road 27).
Village A lacks a defined village center. However, the Madera Town Center,
a major shopping center at the intersection of Avenue 17 and Freeway 99 ad-
jacent to the Village, has been approved for development. While there are no
neighborhood centers functioning in the existing developed areas, three
neighborhood centers have been designated in the undeveloped area along
Lake Street (Road 27).
VILLAGE A: SPECIFIC POLICIES
The following policies are intended to identify some of the unique issues for
this area which will need to be addressed, and to guide development, as the
area transitions to urban use.
      •   The City acknowledges the presence of unique circumstances which
          exist in the northern-most neighborhood of Village A, surrounding the
          Madera Country Club Golf Course. While the City believes that prop-

                        erties proposed for urban development should be annexed into the
                        city, the City will not oppose a proposal to develop this neighborhood
                        prior to annexation, when such proposal is compatible with the City’s
                        development standards. The neighborhood should be planned com-
                        prehensively prior to the development of any single project.
                      • To the extent desired by the property owners in the existing rural sub-
                        divisions, the City will support the maintenance of the large lot - rural
                        character of these subdivisions, even as these subdivisions may be
                        annexed into the City. Existing development standards (local roads
                        and roadway infrastructure, sewer, water) may remain in place until
                        health or safety conditions dictate that modifications be made.
                      • Infrastructure master planning at the city-wide and/or village levels
                        shall identify and consider alternatives for providing services to the ex-
                        isting rural subdivisions in the event urban services are desired by its
                        residents and/or required to address health and safety conditions.
                      • The passenger train rail platform for Madera is being relocated to
                        north side of the railroad tracks just west of County Club Drive, on ex-
                        isting grazing lands. It is important that this facility be incorporated in-
                        to the village and neighborhood layouts as a public amenity and not
                        be isolated. The City will encourage the development of the area sur-
                        rounding the passenger rail platform to be integrated with other public
                        services, features and complementary uses.

VILLAGE B: GENERAL DESCRIPTION
This Village is located in the northeast portion of the Planning Area. About
one-third of the land in this Village has been developed, mostly with low den-
sity residential uses.

                   The Fresno River runs along the southern boundary and should be consi-
                   dered a potential amenity for future development. The BNSF railway runs
                   along the western boundary, raising potential noise, circulation, and safety
                   concerns. There are only two existing at-grade railway crossings, Raymond
                   Road and Lake Street (Road 27). The Circulation Element calls for a future
                   crossing of the rail line at Avenue 17.
                   This Village lacks an existing village center and neighborhood centers. Be-
                   cause of its relatively small size, it is expected that this Village will support
                   one or more neighborhood centers, but that it may share a village center with
                   another village.
                   The area within Village B, particularly south of the Avenue 17 alignment, is
                   developed to what are typically viewed as rural standards, with most areas
                   lacking curb, gutter, sidewalk, and drainage facilities. All developed proper-
                   ties are accommodated by individual septic system and individual, private
                   wells. The area is generally underserved by parks and other public ameni-
                   ties, with no public park facilities or school sites within the village boundaries.
                   Substandard housing conditions and non-conforming property standards are
                   prevalent within the existing neighborhoods, highlighting the need for City and
                   County code enforcement and neighborhood revitalization efforts to eliminate
                   blight.
                   VILLAGE B: SPECIFIC POLICIES
                   The following policies are intended to identify some of the unique issues for
                   this area which will need to be addressed, and to guide development, as the
                   area transitions to urban use.

• Neighborhood dimensions in this Village will be slightly larger than the
  general standard provided in this Land Use Element, and may be 1½ -
  mile or larger.
• This Village may not be large enough for a separate village center in-
  tended to serve its distinct boundaries. Residents in this Village will
  likely share a village center with residents in Villages A or C, and may
  also utilize the Downtown District for their grocery and similar shop-
  ping needs. In conjunction with village level planning, a demand
  evaluation will need to be completed to determine whether it is appro-
  priate to establish land uses in Village B in support of the commercial
  components of a village center.
• Code enforcement and other neighborhood revitalization and im-
  provement techniques should be targeted to this Village to address
  existing blighted conditions. The feasibility and impact of incorporat-
  ing the neighborhoods of this Village into the Redevelopment Agency
  Project Area should be evaluated in conjunction with village level
  planning and annexation proposals.
• Future development along the Fresno River should be designed to
  take advantage of the river frontage, including orienting development
  to front the river where not otherwise prohibited by site conditions.
• The development of Village B is affected by limited access conditions
  created by the lack of an existing rail line crossing at Avenue 17. To
  the extent that a design and funding plan to extend Avenue 17 across
  the rail line has not already been created, such a design and fair-
  share funding program must be established in conjunction with village
  level planning and annexation proposals. An analysis of traffic condi-
  tions completed at that time will determine what actual improvements
  are required to accommodate proposed development, and alterna-
  tives to the construction of the ultimate rail crossing may be consi-
  dered.

VILLAGE C: GENERAL DESCRIPTION
This Village is located in the central part of the Planning Area. About half of
this Village has been developed with residential and several small retail de-
velopments. About one-third of this Village is in the current (2008) city limits;
the balance is in the City’s Sphere of Influence.

                   The Fresno River runs along the southern boundary of this Village and should
                   be considered a potential amenity for future development. The BNSF railway
                   runs along the eastern boundary of this Village, raising potential noise and
                   safety concerns. There currently is only one at-grade crossing of the railway
                   at Raymond Road. The Circulation Element calls for a future crossing of the
                   railway at Avenue 17.
                   Some of the neighborhoods in this Village include existing uses that function
                   as neighborhoods centers. Where such uses do not exist, appropriate land
                   uses designations are established by this general plan to facilitate the devel-
                   opment of new neighborhood centers. While this area lacks a village center,
                   there are two existing commercial centers with grocery and drug-store anc-
                   hors, one on Country Club Drive and the second at Yosemite Avenue and
                   Tozer Road. Together, these centers meet the majority of the commercial
                   needs of this area.
                   While there is a substantial amount of vacant and underutilized land in the
                   area, the parcel sizes are frequently too small to facilitate traditional subdivi-
                   sion development patterns. Assembling smaller parcels into more efficient
                   development blocks is likely to be difficult, increasing the need to focus on is-
                   sues of connectivity and access as infill development occurs.
                   The Madera Unified School District has initiated the process to consolidate
                   school facilities in an expanded campus in the northerly portion of Village C
                   near Country Club Drive and Martin Street. This campus would house a new
                   high school, along with existing elementary and middle school facilities lo-
                   cated on “D” Street. The planning and development of this consolidated
                   campus is likely to serve as a catalyst for new residential development in the
                   surrounding neighborhoods.

                     LAND USE ELEMENT                                 CHAPTER 8
The residential area located west of Country Club Drive and south of Avenue
17 is developed to what are typically viewed as rural standards, with most
areas lacking curb, gutter, sidewalk, and drainage facilities. All developed
properties are accommodated by individual septic systems and individual,
private wells. Substandard housing conditions and non-conforming property
standards appear to be prevalent within the existing neighborhoods, highlight-
ing the need for City and County code enforcement and neighborhood revita-
lization efforts to eliminate blight.
VILLAGE C: SPECIFIC POLICIES
The following policies are intended to identify some of the unique issues for
this area which will need to be addressed, and to guide development, as the
area transitions to urban use.
    •    Properties designated as neighborhood commercial-mixed use should
         be developed with uses that are consistent with the intent of neigh-
         borhood centers as described in the building blocks principles of this
         General Plan. Proposals to develop such properties with alternative
         uses should not be approved unless it is demonstrated that another
         compatible parcel(s) has been designated to achieve this purpose.
    •    Future development along the Fresno River should be designed to
         take advantage of the river frontage, including orienting development
         to front the river where not otherwise prohibited by site conditions.
    •    The City should seek grants or other funding to provide focused
         neighborhood planning to facilitate cohesive development in the areas
         which are characterized by relatively small parcels with numerous
         owners.
    •    Multi-parcel development planning is encouraged. Where individual
         parcels smaller than five acres are proposed for development, the de-
         velopment configuration shall make reasonable accommodation for
         future vehicle access and pedestrian connectivity to adjacent parcels.

CHAPTER 8     LAND USE ELEMENT
                      • Prior to the annexation of any property in the neighborhood surround-
                        ing the consolidated school campus, the project developer shall work
                        with the City and the Madera Unified School District to establish the
                        configuration of local streets to facilitate vehicular and pedestrian
                        connections and to minimize conflict with points of access to the
                        school campus.
                      • Code enforcement and other neighborhood revitalization and im-
                        provement techniques should be implemented in this Village to ad-
                        dress existing blighted conditions. The feasibility and impact of incor-
                        porating the neighborhoods of this Village into the Redevelopment
                        Agency Project Area should be evaluated in conjunction with village
                        level planning and annexation proposals.

VILLAGE D: GENERAL DESCRIPTION
This Village is located in the western portion of the Planning Area, generally
west and south of Madera Airport. Most of this Village is undeveloped, and it
represents an opportunity to implement the City’s “Building Blocks” policies
by master-planning the area. About one-third of this Village is in the current
(2008) city limits; the balance is just outside the City’s Sphere of Influence.

                   A village core is planned along the Fresno River, which forms the Village’s
                   southern boundary. This village layout is intended create opportunities for
                   commercial development integrated with park and open space amenities
                   fronting along the river. There are three existing bridge crossings on the river
                   at Schnoor Avenue, Granada Avenue, and Road 23, with a future bridge
                   crossing identified at Westberry Boulevard.
                   The Madera Airport is located to the northeast of this Village and represents a
                   significant factor in the determining the feasibility of various land uses
                   throughout the village. The entire village lies within the planning area for the
                   airport as defined in the Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan (ALUCP). Por-
                   tions of the village are subject to significant restrictions relative to allowable
                   uses, densities, and development standards.

• In conjunction with village and neighborhood planning, a mechanism
  shall be established which creates a permanent agricultural buffer
  where the westerly edge of the Village abuts the Growth Boundary.
  This buffer shall average at least 400’ in depth, with a minimum depth
  of 250’, and must run continuously along westerly edge of the Village.
  No habitable structures are to be located within this buffer, although
  passive recreational opportunities (such as trails and community gar-
  dens) may be allowed. Alternative methods and designs to establish
  the buffer may be proposed, and including placing the buffer on either
  side of the Growth Boundary. Physical maintenance of the buffer
  shall be provided consistent with the design and function of the space.
• The Village core area shall provide for an integrated mix of uses, in-
  cluding park and open space uses, along the river.
• Future development along the Fresno River should be designed to
  take advantage of the river frontage, including orienting development
  to front the river where not otherwise prohibited by site conditions.
• Village and neighborhood planning shall provide for the alignment of
  the designated arterial which runs through the Village east and west
  (Cleveland Avenue), to bend to the south to provide circulation to the
  proposed village core located along the Fresno River.
• All development proposals within Village D shall comply with the pro-
  visions of the Airport Land Use Master Plan. The establishment of
  land use designations at the village and neighborhood levels, as well
  as the layouts of individual projects, shall reflect the allowable uses
  and densities in the Airport Land Use Master Plan.

                   This Village is located in the west-central portion of the Planning Area, and
                   contains many of the city’s newer residential neighborhoods and retail dis-
                   tricts (including Howard Road). Almost all of the land in this Village which is
                   in the current (2008) city limits has been developed; the portion which is out-

side the city limits is less developed and retains some agricultural uses and
conservation easements.
Area of this Village in the City Limits:               1,839 acres
Area of this Village in the Sphere of Influence:       1,105 acres
Area of this Village in the Planning Area only:        97 acres
Total Area                                             3,041 Acres
The Fresno River runs along the northern boundary of this Village and should
continue to be viewed as an amenity in conjunction with the development and
redevelopment of property along its frontage.
Lions Town and Country Park constitutes a significant public amenity within
Village E, located at the intersection of Howard Road and Granada Drive.
This park facility functions as a gathering place for surrounding neighbor-
hoods; an undeveloped commercially designated parcel at the same intersec-
tion creates the opportunity to add a commercial venue at this central loca-
tion. Aside from these features, there are few opportunities to establish new
neighborhood centers due to the relatively built-up condition of the residential
areas within the Village. Existing retail development along Howard Road
functions as the commercial core for this Village and presents shopping op-
portunities within walking and biking distance to a large area, although it may
not conform to the typical characteristics of a Village Center.
The railroad spur line that serves Madera’s southeastern industrial area
passes through this Village. Although not as busy as the main line parallel to
Hwy 99, this rail line creates some potential noise and safety impacts.

                        habitable structures are to be located within this buffer, although pas-
                        sive recreational opportunities (such as trails), and community gar-
                        dens may be allowed. Alternative methods and designs to establish
                        the buffer may be proposed, and including placing the buffer on either
                        side of the Growth Boundary.        Physical maintenance of the buffer
                        shall be provided consistent with the design and function of the space.
                      • The westerly neighborhood of Village E generally lies west of existing
                        conservation easements which are intended to represent the westerly
                        limit of urban growth in this area. The City does not intend to intensify
                        the existing pattern of rural residential lots in this area, and the exten-
                        sion of infrastructure to serve new development in this area is not
                        permitted. While larger “farmable” parcel sizes outside the urban area
                        are preferable, the existing land use pattern significantly limits com-
                        mercial farming opportunities. Do to the unique conditions in this
                        neighborhood, the City will encourage the County to limit parcel sizes
                        to five acres or larger. In the event this area is annexed into the City,
                        the minimum parcel size permitted by the City in this neighborhood
                        will be five acres.
                      • Individual uses proposed in proximity of the rail spur which passes
                        through Village E shall take into consideration the circulation and
                        noise impacts created by the rail line. The policies of the noise ordin-
                        ance addressing transportation-related noise and mitigation prefe-
                        rences will be applied to projects in the vicinity of the spur.

CHAPTER 8     LAND USE ELEMENT
                   DOWNTOWN DISTRICT: GENERAL DESCRIPTION
                   Almost all of this District is located in the current (2008) city limits. A small
                   area in the northeast corner of this district which fronts along Hwy 145 at the
                   edge of the City is still undeveloped and unincorporated rural land.
                   Area of this District in the City Limits:              1,019 acres
                   Area of this District in the Sphere of Influence:      141 acres
                   Total Area                                             1,160 Acres
                   The Downtown District is the historic center of Madera. The Downtown and
                   the Central Business District and surrounding older residential neighborhoods
                   reflect Madera’s historic roots formed along the axis of the railway and high-
                   way. The Downtown District has undergone significant economic change
                   over the years. The growth of large commercial centers closer to Hwy 99
                   (and a general shift in retail stores toward larger stores in unified centers) has
                   prompted the downtown to seek out new markets; the area now includes a
                   significant number of shops targeted to Madera’s low income Hispanic popu-
                   lation that are prevalent in the residential areas adjacent to the district.
                   In addition to the mix of residential and light-commercial uses in this area, the
                   Downtown District retains some industrial uses along the rail corridor. The
                   mix of residential neighborhoods next to industrial uses raises noise and
                   safety concerns. The Downtown District is also impacted by traffic conges-
                   tion caused from traffic passing through the district on Hwy 145 (Yosemite
                   Avenue).
                   The Fresno River runs along the northwesterly boundary of the Downtown
                   and should be considered a potential amenity for future development, as well
                   as a focal point in redevelopment and revitalization efforts in areas which
                   have already developed. Several parks and other public facilities (including
                   the County Courthouse Park & Museum) are located in the Downtown Dis-
                   trict, as are the offices of the City of Madera, County of Madera, State Supe-
                   rior Court, and numerous other governmental agencies.
                   The Downtown District contains a number of buildings which may be historic.
                   There are several remaining examples of Madera’s early architecture, with at
                   least one dating back to 1900. However, many structures have degraded

over time to the degree that their value and ability to positively reflect historic
character is no longer present.
DOWNTOWN DISTRICT: SPECIFIC POLICIES
The following policies are intended to identify some of the unique issues for
this area which will need to be addressed, and to guide redevelopment and
transition of rural areas to urban uses.
    •    The City is currently (2008) pursuing the creation of a Downtown Plan
         for this area. The preparation of the Downtown Plan is important to
         guide future design and development in the Downtown at a more de-
         tailed level than this General Plan.
    •    Development in the Downtown District should recognize the area’s
         historic features and consider measures to preserve notable historic
         features. Policies and programs in the Historic and Cultural Re-
         sources Element related to historic structures are particularly impor-
         tant in this area.
    •    The City will work with the railroads to continue to improve safety at
         the at-grade crossings of the BNSF railway.
    •    Future development along the Fresno River should be designed to
         take advantage of the river frontage, including orienting development
         to front the river where not otherwise prohibited by site conditions.
    •    The City will investigate the feasibility of establishing Highway 145
         (Yosemite Avenue) in Madera as a component of the traditional City
         street system, providing an opportunity to enhance the streetscape
         and create flexibility in lane configurations and parking arrangements.
    •    Mixed use projects where a combination of commercial and residen-
         tial uses are integrated in the same building or parcel is encouraged in
         the downtown. The clearest example is where housing opportunities

VILLAGE G: GENERAL DESCRIPTION
This Village is located in the eastern central portion of the Planning Area.
Most of this Village (about three-fourths) is located outside the current (2008)
city limits.
           CITY OF MADERA GENERAL PLAN | OCTOBER 7, 2009                    8-57
CHAPTER 8               LAND USE ELEMENT
                                Area of this Village in the City Limits:               390 acres
                                Area of this Village in the Sphere of Influence:       1,862 acres
                                Area of this Village in the Planning Area only:        162 acres
                                Total Area                                             2,414 Acres
                                The eastern border of Village G is formed by an irrigation canal; to the east of
                                the canal is an area of planned industrial development. The irrigation canal
                                provides an opportunity for the creation of a trail or similar feature in conjunc-
                                tion with new development. A potential new alignment for Hwy 145 to bypass
                                Madera’s downtown may pass through a portion of this Village and should be
                                evaluated when development proposals are considered so that noise and
                                traffic issues are addressed.
                                Although much of this Village is undeveloped, new housing and retail devel-
                                opment has taken place in recent years along the western edge of the Vil-
                                lage,4 and new residents are moving in. Several County government facilities
                                are located in this Village north of Olive Avenue (Avenue 14). At the time this
                                General Plan was being written, the California Department of Corrections and
                                Rehabilitation and the County of Madera were evaluating the potential to de-
                                velop a Secure Community Reentry Facility on vacant property adjacent to
                                the existing County complex at Tozer and Olive. While no final decision on
                                the project had been made at the time of this writing, and the City had not
                                taken a formal position on project, the potential development of the facility
                                may affect land uses in the area.
                                This Village lacks existing neighborhood centers and a village center, and is
                                generally underserved by parks and other public facilities. Because of its rel-
                                atively large size, it is expected that this Village will support one or more
                                neighborhood centers. The Village should also be of sufficient size to ac-
                                commodate a new village center, and a land use designation facilitating the
                                development of a village center has been included in this General Plan.
                                The area within Village G, particularly south of Avenue 14 and west of Road
                                28, is developed to what are typically viewed as rural standards, with most

areas lacking curb, gutter, sidewalk, and drainage facilities. County Service
Area 3 serves the semi rural developed area in the southern portion of the
Village, providing the area with community water and sewage service. Subs-
tandard housing conditions and non-conforming property standards appear to
be prevalent within the existing neighborhoods, highlighting the need for City
and County code enforcement and neighborhood revitalization efforts to elim-
inate blight.
VILLAGE G: SPECIFIC POLICIES
The following policies are intended to identify some of the unique issues for
this area which will need to be addressed, and to guide redevelopment and
transition of rural areas to urban uses.
     •   The City supports the creation of neighborhood centers and a village
         center in this area, and encourages the County to consider these facil-
         ities when planning development. Private applicants are encouraged
         to submit applications for projects that would serve as commercial
         neighborhood or village centers.
     •   Future development in the eastern portion of this Village should con-
         sider the potential for future industrial uses east of the irrigation canal.
         Issues such as future traffic, safety, noise, and odors should be con-
         sidered in the design and construction of projects in this area.
     •   Code enforcement and other neighborhood revitalization and im-
         provement techniques should be targeted to this Village to address
         existing blighted conditions. The feasibility and impact of incorporat-
         ing the neighborhoods of this Village into the Redevelopment Agency
         Project Area should be evaluated in conjunction with village level
         planning and annexation proposals.
     •   The property within Village G designated for Village-Mixed Use shall
         be developed in accordance with the Village Center principles de-
         scribed in this General Plan.

CHAPTER 8     LAND USE ELEMENT
                      •   In the event that the development of a Secure Community Reentry
                          Facility proceeds, the following policies and actions will be applied:
                          –   The City will work with the California Department of Corrections
                              and Rehabilitation and the County of Madera to ensure that the
                              design and layout of the facility are established in a manner that
                              maximize compatibility, and minimize conflicts, with existing and
                              planned uses. The area in the vicinity of the potential site is
                              planned substantially for residential use.
                          –   The layout of the facility on the property should maximize the set-
                              backs to adjacent properties, particularly to properties which are
                              privately owned.
                          –   The City encourages the California Department of Corrections and
                              Rehabilitation and the County of Madera to ensure that adequate
                              property is included within the project boundary as necessary to
                              create an “on-site buffer” between the facility and adjacent uses,
                              rather than requiring such a buffer to be provided by non-
                              participating properties.
                          –   The installation of public infrastructure for the facility, including
                              streets, sewer, water, and storm drain improvements, should oc-
                              cur consistent with City standards at the time of project develop-
                              ment, including installing such facilities along all project frontages.
                          –   The property included in the project should be annexed into the
                              City limits to facilitate the logical, orderly development of the area
                              around the facility and prevent the formation of unincorporated isl-
                              ands.

CHAPTER 8     LAND USE ELEMENT
                   VILLAGE H: GENERAL DESCRIPTION
                   This Village is located in the southern portion of the Planning Area west of
                   Highway 99, and includes a number of existing neighborhoods and retail
                   areas. Slightly more than half of this Village is in the current (2008) city limits.
                   The western boundary of this Village is adjacent to the large industrial area in
                   southern Madera; the southern boundary marks the edge of the Growth
                   Boundary. This area includes a high school, Madera Hospital, and a com-
                   mercial district on Madera Avenue.
                   Area of this Village in the City Limits:                1,533 acres
                   Area of this Village in the Sphere of Influence:       1,041 acres
                   Area of this Village in the Planning Area only:         574 acres
                   Total Area                                              3,148 Acres
                   The southern third of the Village along Avenue 12 is designated as Village
                   Reserve and will provide future commercial, industrial and transportation fea-
                   tures, and will require special planning along the urban/agriculture interface.
                   The eastern boundary of this Village is adjacent to Hwy 99 and the parallel
                   railroad line, both of which create potential noise and safety impacts. Hwy
                   145 (Madera Avenue) currently passes through this area, although policies in
                   this General Plan provide for the potential relocation of this highway onto
                   another route that would bypass downtown Madera and a portion of the Vil-
                   lage.
                   Although the retail area on Madera Avenue fulfills the need for a village cen-
                   ter, commercial development is also expected to occur at Highway 99 and
                   Avenue 12. The existing residential areas are generally under supplied with
                   neighborhood centers. A large portion of the area designated Village Re-
                   serve is affected by a 100 Year Flood Plain, which will need to be addressed
                   in conjunction the initial village planning efforts.

        should be carefully planned to ensure compatibility with nearby resi-
        dential areas and interface with agriculture. Residential development
        should generally not occur along Avenue 12 except in limited, mixed
        use settings.
    •   In accordance with the policies defined in the Noise Element of this
        General Plan, the establishment of land use patterns at the village
        level shall reflect sensitivity to noise impacts created by proximity to
        Highway 99.
    •   A portion of the area designated Village Reserve is located within the
        100 Year flood plain. A comprehensive strategy to address the flood
        plain issues for the Village shall be prepared as part of the initial vil-
        lage level planning process.
    •   Land uses planned adjacent to existing industrially designated area
        southwest of the Village shall implement buffering techniques to mi-
        nimize potential conflicts which may otherwise occur.

                   This illustration of planned land uses in Village I is provided for illustrative
                   purposes only. Land Use Policy is established by the Land Use Map, not by
                   this illustration, and the reader is directed to Figure LU-2 in this Element for
                   detailed information on planned land uses. Neighborhood boundaries are
                   approximate and subject to refinement by the City as part of the Neighbor-

                   VILLAGE I: GENERAL DESCRIPTION
                   This area is located in the southeastern portion of the Planning Area, and is
                   almost entirely covered by the Specific Plan for the Community College area.
                   This Village is located entirely outside of the current (2008) city limits.

Area of this Village in the Sphere of Influence:        1,948 acres
Area of this Village in the Planning Area only:         213 acres
Total Area                                              2,161 Acres
As of 2008, the first phase of the college campus and an elementary school
site has been constructed, but no new subdivisions have been developed.
Currently (2008) entitlements for a 250 acre residential project are being
processed.
Hwy 99 forms the western boundary of this area; the BNSF rail line forms the
eastern boundary. Both create noise and potential safety concerns.
The Specific Plan for this area (reflected on the Land Use Policy Map in this
General Plan) generally implements the Building Blocks concepts of this
General Plan, and provides for a number of parks, pathways, neighborhood
centers, and other community amenities.
VILLAGE I: SPECIFIC POLICIES
The following policies are intended to identify some of the unique issues for
this area which will need to be addressed, and to guide redevelopment and
transition of rural areas to urban uses.
    •    Consistent with overall City land use policy, development of uses in
         the Specific Plan should take place in the city and be preceded by an-
         nexation to the City of Madera. Attention must be given to hydrology
         and drainage facilities, development of the trails system per the Spe-
         cific Plan, and financing of infrastructure improvements.

This District is in the northern portion of the Planning Area and includes the
proposed location of a future (as of 2009) casino. This District is north of the
Madera Airport and adjacent to Hwy 99 and the parallel railway. This area is
subject to land use limitations by the Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan.

Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan for additional information.
AIRPORT NORTH DISTRICT: SPECIFIC POLICIES
The following policies are intended to identify some of the unique issues for
this area which will need to be addressed, and to guide redevelopment and
transition of rural areas to urban uses.
    •    The City encourages the annexation of this village into the city limits in
         order to allow the City to maintain a continuous jurisdictional boun-
         dary, even while the City acknowledges that the proposal to have the
         site taken into Federal trust would mean the City’s jurisdiction would
         not apply to the site.
    •    Development of this Village will require careful consideration of how
         infrastructure will be connected to and through the village. The City
         encourages the property owner to coordinate with the City on project-
         level infrastructure planning to ensure that both on and off-site needs
         are addressed.
    •    If the Airport North District is ultimately not taken into Federal trust
         and developed as Native American Casino, the City anticipates the
         eventual development of the property with urban uses. The prepara-
         tion of a specific plan or comparable document will be required to

                        ture needs for this area.
                      • All development proposals within Village J which are subject to the
                        City’s land use authority shall comply with the provisions of the Airport
                        Land Use Master Plan. The establishment of land use designations at
                        the village and neighborhood levels, as well as the layouts of
                        individual projects, shall reflect the allowable uses and densities in the
                        Airport Land Use Master Plan.

              WALKABILITY POLICIES
              The following policies support the City’s goal of creating a more walkable,
              pedestrian-friendly Madera.
              Note to the Reader: Please see also the Community Design Element for ad-
              ditional guidance on creating pedestrian-friendly environments.
Policy LU-36►  The City supports walkability as a guiding concept for the design of new
               residential and commercial projects. Both private sector development
               projects and City public works projects shall be designed to be pedestrian-
               friendly to help reduce vehicular travel, improve the quality life in Madera,
               and support the City’s efforts to reduce pollution and the generation of
               greenhouse gases.
Policy LU-37►  “Walkability” shall include:
                   •   A safe walking environment that includes safety features, sidewalks,
                       crosswalks, stopping places, shade, grade-separated crossings
                       where necessary, and ample opportunities for pedestrians to see
                       and be seen.
                   •   An overall community design in which the places that provide day-
                       to-day needs (parks, local schools, daily shopping needs) are within
                       a reasonable walking distance—generally one mile—of all homes.
                   •   A citywide system that allows for walking and bicycling throughout
                       the community and that reduces or eliminates conflicts between
                       these users and motor vehicles.
               Please see the Parks and Recreation Element for a discussion of “Paseos,”
               a type of non-park facility that will provide for walking and bicycling.

CHAPTER 8      LAND USE ELEMENT
                         Action Item LU-37.1
                         Regularly review—and update if necessary—the City’s Public Works
                         standards to ensure that pedestrian and bicycle safety is adequately
                         addressed.
                         Action Item LU-37.2
                         Promote pedestrian trips throughout Madera through the addition of pe-
                         destrian amenities and the incorporation of the best available design
                         features.
 Policy LU-38►       The City shall work to create a pedestrian and bicycling system that links
                     residential, retail, commercial and employment centers, schools, open
                     space, and public facilities throughout Madera.
                         Action Item LU-38.1
                         Explore feasible funding options to upgrade and complete the City’s pe-
                         destrian system.
                         Action Item LU-38.2
                         Prepare a Bicycle and Pedestrian Master Plan to provide detailed plans,
                         standards, and implementation measures for these facilities.
 Policy LU-39►       Pedestrian and bicycle facilities should not be developed solely as a utilita-
                     rian conveyance; the aesthetic of the design and adjacent landscaping
                     should provide a positive environment for walking. To the extent possible,
                     pedestrian and bicycle use should occur on facilities separated from auto-
                     mobile traffic access. These may include sidewalks for pedestrians and off-
                     street pathways for pedestrians and bicyclists.
                     Note to the Reader: Please see the Circulation Element for additional poli-
                     cies related to bicycle and pedestrian facilities.

              INFILL DEVELOPMENT POLICIES
              The City of Madera recognizes the potential benefits of infill development, de-
              fined in this General Plan as the development (or redevelopment) of vacant
              and underutilized properties within the City limits as of December 31, 2008.
              The likely benefits of infill development, when considered as alternative to
              growth at the City’s edges, may include:
                   •   Lower service delivery costs for municipal infrastructure and public
                       services;
                   •   Reduced vehicle trip miles resulting in lower emissions of air pollu-
                       tants and green house gasses;
                   •   Reduced rate of agricultural land conversion;
                   •   Avoidance of sensitive biological habitats;
                   •   Reduced long-term maintenance costs for public facilities.
              In light of these benefits, the following policies and action items are included
              to support the City’s desire to maximize the potential of infill development to
              meet the need for future development and to help provide additional vitality in
              existing neighborhoods.
Policy LU-40►  The City will prioritize infill residential development inside the city limits as
               of December 31, 2008, and will seek to encourage the development com-
               munity to build on vacant or under-utilized land within those limits.
                    Action Item LU-40.1
                    The City will develop and implement an infill development program to
                    facilitate infill development. The components of that program will in-
                    clude, but are not limited to:

CHAPTER 8     LAND USE ELEMENT
                      •   Identification of the market forces that attract development to infill
                          areas.
                      •   Identification of pro-active approaches to market infill opportunities
                          and to recruit appropriate infill development projects.
                      •   Preparation of a parcel-specific inventory of vacant and underuti-
                          lized properties suitable for development or redevelopment, includ-
                          ing a summary of development capacity, infrastructure require-
                          ments, and other special attributes for each parcel in the inventory.
                      •   Identification of preferred infill project types for key properties in
                          coordination with key stakeholders.
                      •   Creation of flexible development standards that address the needs
                          of infill development and that will help facilitate development of new
                          uses.
                      •   Identification and/or creation of incentives for infill development.
                      Action Item LU-40.2
                      In conjunction with the program identified in Action Item LU-40.1 above,
                      the City will consider the adoption of a fee requirement applied to new
                      development that recognizes the additional cost necessary to serve
                      non-infill development. Such fee could be used as a source to provide
                      incentives for residential infill projects. This program should consider
                      the potential for fee exemptions or adjustments for projects where ex-
                      traordinary efforts are taken to incorporate “green” or “low impact” de-
                      sign and construction, or for developers that participate directly in the
                      development of infill properties.

Policy LU-41► Parcel(s) which are not developed when adjacent or surrounding lands are
              developed shall be planned for so that infrastructure (roadways, water,
              sewer, parks, etc.) are sized and located so they can be extended or ex-

              JOBS/HOUSING BALANCE
Policy LU-42► The City will seek to ensure that sufficient land in all employment-
              generating categories is available at all times to provide jobs that match the
              needs of workers in Madera.
Policy LU-43► The City supports jobs/housing balance programs at the local and regional
              scale intended to reduce the need for workers to commute outside their
              communities.
Policy LU-44► The City supports the creation and retention of jobs that provide sustainable
              wages and benefits for Madera residents.
                 Action Item LU-44.1
                 Explore the use of financing incentives to encourage employment-
                 generating businesses to locate in Madera.
                 Action Item LU-44.2
                 Assist the private sector in its efforts to attract and retain a broad base
                 of businesses and industries providing well-compensated jobs with ca-
                 reer growth potential.

                  CHAPTER 9: NOISE
                  ELEMENT
                  This Element of the General Plan addresses
                  Noise in its many forms, and provides poli-
                  cies and actions to help ensure that uses
                  sensitive to noise maintain the desired level
                  of “quiet” that is needed for a healthy and
                  desirable community.
                  NOISE
                  “Noise” is sometimes defined as “unwanted
                  sound.” Sound which is desirable in some
                  situations—for instance, a music concert—
                  can become “noise” in other situations.
                  Some types of sound—from trains, vehicle
                  traffic, and mechanical equipment—are
                  generally considered undesirable in residen-
                  tial areas, but are accepted in other areas
                  (such as industrial areas).
                  Noise has been cited as being a health
                  problem, not only in terms of actual physio-
                  logical damages such as hearing impair-
                  ment, but in terms of inhibiting general well-
                  being and contributing to stress and an-
                  noyance.
                  In some cases (including, in some cases,
                  the neighbor whose stereo or party creates
                  a nuisance), noise is an annoyance. This

CHAPTER 9                NOISE ELEMENT
                                 type of noise is generally addressed as a “nuisance” and enforced by law en-
                                 forcement. The policies and standards in this Noise Element address ongo-
                                 ing and significant noise sources (roadways, railroads, mechanical equip-
                                 ment, etc.); issues with “noisy neighbors” are not addressed specifically in
                                 this Element.
                                 Long or repeated exposure to sounds at or above 85 decibels can cause
                                 hearing loss. The louder the sound, the shorter the time period before noise-
                                 induced hearing loss can occur. Sounds of less than 75 decibels, even after
                                 long exposure, are unlikely to cause hearing loss.1
                                 Noise can come from two types of sources: mobile and stationary.
                                     •   Mobile source noises are generally associated with transportation,
                                         such as cars, trains, and aircraft. The most significant mobile sources
                                         of noise in Madera are the Madera Airport (noise created by aircraft
                                         takeoffs and landings), the two railroad lines that pass through the
                                         Planning Area, and Hwy 99 and other major roadways.
                                     •   Stationary sounds can be pin-pointed and do not move. Examples
                                         of stationary sources include outdoor machinery (such as heating/air
                                         conditioning systems, which may be found in both residential and
                                         commercial areas), the Madera Raceway, the high school football
                                         stadium, and the industrial areas near the Madera Airport and in the
                                         southwest portion of the Planning Area. Noise generated at construc-
                                         tion sites also falls within the category of stationary sound.
                                 Noise can be measured in a number of ways, ranging from the momentary
                                 noise caused by a single event (such as a passing train) to a day-long aver-
                                 age. Most of the measures in this Noise Element use the latter measure-
                                 ment, which provides a weighted average of the noise in a given location over
                                 a 24-hour period. Two different 24-hour measures are used: Ldn (Day/Night

increase doubles perceived loudness. Contin-

            NOISE GOALS
            NOISE
GOAL N-1    To protect residents from the harmful effects of exposure to excessive
            noise, and to protect the economic base of the City by preventing the
            encroachment of incompatible land uses near roadways, industries,
            railroads, and other sources of noise.
            NOISE POLICIES
Policy N-1► The City will protect residential areas and other noise-sensitive uses from
            excessive noise by doing the following:
            1) Requiring that land uses, roadways, and other sources do not create in-
                compatible noise levels on adjacent parcels.
            2) Allowing homes or noise-sensitive uses to be developed only in places
                where existing and projected noise levels will meet the exterior noise
                guidelines and standards shown in Policies N-5 and N-6.
            3) Requiring that City decisions which would cause or allow an increase in
                noise created by stationary or mobile sources (such as development of
                noise-generating land uses or the construction of new or wider road-
                ways) be informed by a noise analysis and accompanied by noise re-
                duction measures to keep noise at acceptable levels.
                The analysis may be accomplished by reviewing available noise data,
                by requiring additional information on potential noise that would be
                created, or by a noise analysis prepared as part of the project’s envi-
                ronmental analysis. Roadway projects which are consistent with the
                Circulation Map in this General Plan will generally not require the prepa-
                ration of a noise analysis.

CHAPTER 9             NOISE ELEMENT
  Policy N-2►                   To implement Policy N-1, the following shall apply:
                                1) No use regulated by the City shall be permitted to generate noise that
                                    would cause the ambient noise on any adjacent parcel to exceed the
                                    “completely compatible” 24-hour guidelines shown in Policy N-5 or the
                                    30-minute noise standards in Policy N-6.
                                2) The City shall ensure that noise mitigation to achieve a “completely
                                    compatible” 24-hour exterior noise level and conformance with the 30-
                                    minute exterior noise standard is provided in conjunction with any deci-
                                    sion2 it makes that would cause a violation of item 1) above.
                                3) Developers of new residential or other noise-sensitive uses which are
                                    placed in environments subject to existing or projected noise that ex-
                                    ceeds the “completely compatible” guidelines in Policy N-5 shall be re-
                                    sponsible for ensuring that acceptable exterior and interior noise levels
                                    will be achieved.
                                4) The City shall ensure that transportation projects such as new or wi-
                                    dened roadways include mitigation measures to maintain at least “tenta-
                                    tively compatible” noise levels as shown in Policy N-5. Mitigation for
                                    roadway noise need not be provided where “tentatively compatible”
                                    noise guidelines would be exceeded on vacant lands, but shall be in-
                                    stalled as part of the transportation project where the noise would affect
                                    existing homes. In those instances where noise mitigation is not initially
                                    triggered, it shall be the responsibility of the project which places resi-
                                    dential units on the vacant lands.

  Examples of decisions include: Roadway construction projects, public park construction, General Plan amendments,
changes of zone, conditional use permits, and site plan review approval.

                                           tained in Policy N-5 or Policy N-6.
                                      If information on the noise environment at a project site is not available,
                                      a measurement of the noise environment by a qualified acoustical engi-
                                      neer may be needed to make a determination whether a proposed
                                      project complies with the guidelines and standards in Policy N-5 or N-6.

CHAPTER 9      NOISE ELEMENT
 Policy N-3►         The following definitions shall be used to interpret and implement the poli-
                     cies in this Noise Element.
                         •    “Noise-Sensitive Use” is any use other than residential or commer-
                              cial for which an acceptable interior or exterior noise level is defined
                              in this General Plan or other uses as determined by the City. Gen-
                              erally, noise-sensitive uses will be those which require a reasonable
                              level of quiet as part of their ordinary functioning.
                         •    Noise standards in residential areas shall be applied to outdoor ac-
                              tivity areas. Where the outdoor activity areas are not known, the ex-
                              terior noise standard shall be applied to all areas within 50 feet of
                              the residential dwelling.
                         •    “Outdoor Activity Areas” for residential uses include rear yard areas,
                              including patios located in a rear yard; private ground-floor patios;
                              and community play areas, pools, etc.
                         •    “Projected Noise Levels” shall be those projected to exist at a time
                              20 (twenty) years in the future, based on projected future develop-
                              ment, traffic, and other factors.
                         •    “Residential Area” is any area designated for residential uses on the
                              Land Use Map of this General Plan.
                         •    “Transportation Noise” consists of noise generated by motor ve-
                              hicles, trains, and aircraft takeoffs and landings.

  Policy N-4►                 The following compatibility standards shall be used to determine whether a
                              proposed use is appropriate for its location, given the projected ambient
                              noise level.
                                   •   “Completely Compatible” means that the specified land use is satis-
                                       factory and both the indoor and outdoor environments are pleasant.
                                   •   “Tentatively Compatible” means that noise exposure may be of con-
                                       cern, but common building construction practices will make the in-
                                       door living environment acceptable, even for sleeping quarters, and
                                       outdoor activities will not be unduly disturbed by noise.
                                   •   “Normally Incompatible” means that noise exposure warrants special
                                       attention, and new construction or development should generally be
                                       undertaken only after a detailed analysis of noise reduction require-
                                       ments is made and needed noise insulation features are included in
                                       the design. Careful site planning or exterior barriers may be needed
                                       to make the outdoor environment tolerable.
                                   •   “Completely Incompatible” means that the noise exposure is so se-
                                       vere that new construction or development should generally not be
                                       undertaken.
  Policy N-5►                 The following are the maximum 24-hour exterior noise levels for land
                              designated by this General Plan for residential, commercial/retail, and
                              public parks.5
                                   •   See Policy N-4 for the definitions of these levels of compatibility.
                                   •   These guidelines apply to land designated by this General Plan for
                                       these uses. Residential, retail, or public parks which have been

                                        exterior noise guidelines for the land on which they are located.
                                   •    Non-residential uses located on residentially designated land shall
                                        be subject to the exterior noise guidelines for residential lands.
                                   •    All uses on commercial lands, including non-commercial uses, shall
                                        be subject to the standards for commercial land.
                                   •    Land use designations not listed above do not have exterior noise
                                        compatibility standards. Land use designations with no exterior

                                uses may be exposed for any 30-minute period on any day.6
                                     •    Where existing ambient noise levels exceed these standards, the
                                          ambient noise level shall be highest allowable noise level as meas-
                                          ured in dBA Leq (30 minutes).
                                     •    The noise levels specified above shall be lowered by 5 dB for simple
                                          tonal noises (such as humming sounds), noises consisting primarily
                                          of speech or music, or for recurring impulsive noises (such as pile

                                          tive than those specified above, provided that:
                                           1) The noise impact on the residential or other noise-sensitive use
                                               is addressed in an environmental analysis,
                                           2) A finding is made by the approving body stating the reasons for
                                               accepting a higher exterior noise standard, and
                                           3) Interior noise standards will comply with those identified in

                                 most preferred, #5 the least):
                                 1) Reduce noise at the source.
                                 2) If #1 is not practical, seek to designate land uses which are compatible
                                     with projected noise levels.
                                 3) If #1 or #2 are not practical, use distance from the source to reduce
                                     noise to acceptable levels.
                                 4) If #1, #2, or #3 are not practical, use buildings, berms, or landscaping or
                                     a combination of these to reduce exterior noise to acceptable levels.
                                     Use construction techniques (sound-reducing windows, etc.) to reduce
                                     interior noise to acceptable levels.
                                 5) The last measure which should be considered is the use of a sound wall
                                     to reduce noise to acceptable levels.

CHAPTER 9      NOISE ELEMENT
 Policy N-10►        Where they are constructed, sound walls should be:
                     1) Considered only if proven effective by accompanying noise studies.
                     2) Be visually attractive, complement the surroundings, and require a min-
                         imum of maintenance. (See Community Design Element references to
                         sound wall designs).
                     3) As small/low as possible consistent with the need to reduce noise to ac-
                         ceptable levels.
 Policy N-11►        The City shall generally not require the installation of sound walls in front
                     yard areas to reduce noise to acceptable levels in residential areas which
                     were originally constructed without sound walls. The City shall emphasize
                     other methods to reduce noise levels in these situations, and may accept
                     exterior noise levels higher than those shown in Policy N-5 in order to mi-
                     nimize the construction of sound walls. Examples of “other methods” in-
                     clude:
                         •   Installation of double- or triple-paned windows;
                         •   Installation of weather stripping or seals to keep noise out;
                         •   Replacing wooden fencing with walls or other materials with better
                             sound reducing properties;
                         •   Use of rubberized asphalt to reduce roadway noise.
                     Note to the Reader: Please see also the Community Design Element for

Policy N-12► All acoustical analysis prepared pursuant to this Noise Element shall:
             1) Be the financial responsibility of the applicant.
             2) Be prepared by a qualified person experienced in the fields of environ-
                 mental noise assessment and architectural acoustics.
             3) Include representative noise level measurements with sufficient sam-
                 pling periods and locations to adequately describe local conditions and
                 the predominant noise sources.
             4) Estimate existing and projected cumulative (20 years) noise levels in
                 terms of Ldn or CNEL and/or the standards in this Noise Element, and
                 compare those levels to the policies in this Noise Element.
             5) Recommend appropriate mitigation to achieve compliance with the
                 adopted policies and standards of this Noise Element, giving preference
                 to proper site planning and design over mitigation measures which re-
                 quire the construction of noise barriers or structural modifications to
                 buildings which contain noise-sensitive land uses.
             6) In cases where a sound wall is proposed, the potential impacts asso-
                 ciated with noise reflecting off the wall and toward other properties or
                 sensitive uses shall be evaluated.
             7) Estimate noise exposure after the prescribed mitigation measures have
                 been implemented.
             8) Describe a post-project assessment program which could be used to
                 evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation measures.
Policy N-13► For the purposes of CEQA analysis, a 5 db increase in CNEL or Ldn noise
             levels shall be normally considered to be a significant increase in noise.

                  This Element of the General Plan addresses
                  a broad range of issues which contribute to
                  the character of Madera: the city’s Historic,
                  Cultural, and Fossil Resources. Together,
                  these issues create the community history
                  that is shared by everyone in Madera.
                  HISTORIC, CULTURAL, AND
                  FOSSIL RESOURCES
                  The following summarizes the key points of
                  Madera’s history, starting with prehistory (up
                  to about the 1700s). Madera’s modern histo-
                  ry and fossil record are also discussed.
                  PREHISTORY
                  The prehistory of the San Joaquin Valley is
                  generally divided into three periods:
                      •    The first period is characterized by big
                           game hunting and is dated approx-
                           imately 8,000 years ago.

                                The tribes which inhabited the Madera area generally lived a subsistence life-
                                style that included hunting, fishing, and collection of plant resources, particu-
                                larly acorns. Some of these early inhabitants built a variety of structures in-

                                sweat lodges. A common dwelling was a thatched house covered by brush,
                                grass, or tules.
                                A variety of flaked and ground stone tools (e.g., knives, arrow and spear
                                points, and rough cobble and shaped pestles) were common among Native

Native American population began a history of destructive Euroamerican inte-
ractions with Native Americans that eventually lead to the loss of traditional
Native American culture.
HISTORIC PERIOD
Initial expeditions into the San Joaquin Valley were exploratory in nature, but
were soon followed by campaigns to either convert and/or relocate Native
Americans to missions. Missions dominated the social, political, and eco-
nomic lives of both Spanish and Native Americans across much of California
during the Spanish Period (ca. 1769-1821). Many Native American groups,
however, were reluctant to adapt to the mission “system” and convert to Ca-
tholicism. This factor, in combination with the onset of many European dis-
eases, virtually ended the traditional lifeways of many Native American
groups in California.
The Mexican Period (ca. 1821-1848) in California was an outgrowth of the
Mexican Revolution, and its accompanying social and political views affected
the mission system. In 1833 the missions were secularized and their lands
divided among the Californios as ranchos in the form of land grants. The ran-
chos facilitated the growth of a semi-aristocratic group that controlled large
ranchos or land grants. Local Native American populations, who were essen-
tially used as forced labor, worked on these large tracts of land. This was a
period of growing antagonism of Native Americans toward Euroamericans
and also decline in Native American populations due to both disease and
abuse.
The American Period (ca. 1848-present) in California history began with the
end of the Mexican-American War and the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe
Hidalgo in 1848.
The Gold Rush was the catalyst for major settlement and development of the
region. As miners migrated south from the Columbia-Sonora goldfields,
many settled on the valley floor. Madera County encompasses a fairly large
area from west to east, including the foothill region, the plains, and the high

                                                        and opportunities, the mountains were tapped for their

                                                        steadily as the Central Pacific Railroad established lines
                                                        in the San Joaquin Valley in 1872.
                                                        Rising demand for timber prompted the construction of a
                                                        vast flume that ran 63 miles from the Soquel Basin into
                                                        the valley. Built in 1874, the flume made it possible to
                                                        move millions of feet of lumber annually. The flume was
                                                        originally planned to end at Borden, a community already
                                                        established along the Central Pacific Railroad. However,
                                                        high property prices and land level issues prompted mill
                                                        investors to locate elsewhere. The new end-point for the

                                                        As a result, Madera grew significantly, and in 1876 the

                    fossil site in California if not the West Coast. Since it was discovered in 1993
                    more than 13,000 fossils and 5,000 specimens have been uncovered over 16
                    acres of land. The fossils were buried in earth 15-60 feet below the surface
                    and are up to 780,000 years old. In January 2009 groundbreaking took place
                    on the new Madera County Fossil Discovery Center that will house finds from
                    the site. As they continue to uncover new discoveries every year, Paleontol-

                           nancial incentive programs. This may include:
                           •    Creating a historic preservation page on the City’s website with links
                                to federal and state historic preservation programs and financial in-
                                centive programs.

                     The U.S. Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic
                     Properties is a set of guidelines that outlines four potential approaches for historic
                     structures: Preservation, Rehabilitation, Restoration, and Reconstruction.
                     •    The first treatment, Preservation, places a high premium on the retention of
                          all historic fabric through conservation, maintenance and repair. It reflects a
                          building's continuum over time, through successive occupancies, and the res-
                          pectful changes and alterations that are made.
                     •    Rehabilitation, the second treatment, emphasizes the retention and repair of
                          historic materials, but more latitude is provided for replacement because it is
                          assumed the property is more deteriorated prior to work. (Both Preservation
                          and Rehabilitation standards focus attention on the preservation of those ma-
                          terials, features, finishes, spaces, and spatial relationships that, together, give
                          a property its historic character.)
                     •    Restoration, the third treatment, focuses on the retention of materials from
                          the most significant time in a property's history, while permitting the removal of
                          materials from other periods.
                     •    Reconstruction, the fourth treatment, establishes limited opportunities to re-
                          create a non-surviving site, landscape, building, structure, or object in all new
                          materials.

                 restoration of historic resources located on private property, such as:
                 •   Participating in the Mills Act Tax Abatement Program as an econom-
                     ic incentive for private property owners to actively participate in the
                     restoration of their properties.

                 •   Allowing the use of the Historical Building Code (HBC) for buildings
                     which are officially designated as historic. (The HBC provides more
                     flexibility to persons renovating historic buildings and helps preserve
                     the building’s historic character.)

                 Use grants and funds available to the City for historic preservation, such

             tion of historic structures.

                                  with sports fields and picnic areas often at capacity. While there are more
                                  than 320 acres1 of parks and recreation, there are not currently (2008)
                                  enough fields for popular sports such as soccer and baseball. The City’s
                                  neighborhood parks are predominately located in the eastern half of the city.

            PARKS AND RECREATION GOALS
            The City’s Parks and Recreation Goals, shown below, are based on the out-
            comes of Madera Vision 2025, which set out a number of specific steps that
            would be followed to create an enhanced parks and recreation system.
            These goals (and the policies and actions that follow) define in broad terms
            what the City desires for its parks and recreation system and how it will be
            implemented.
            The goals, policies, and actions in this Element provide guidance to Madera’s
            decision-makers, residents, and staff on how to achieve the City’s future park
            and recreation system.
GOAL PR-1    Park Facility Goal: A system of parks and recreation facilities and pro-
             grams that enhance quality of life; improve public health and safety;
             are distributed throughout the city; and are responsive to the needs and
             interests of the people who live and work in Madera.
GOAL PR-2    Recreation Goal: Recreation programs and community services that
             respond to resident needs, promote community, strengthen neighbor-
             hoods, and encourage healthy lifestyles.
GOAL PR-3    Implementation Goal: Adequate and reliable funding for the acquisi-
             tion, development, rehabilitation, and maintenance of parks, communi-
             ty facilities, recreation facilities, trails, and other park-related facilities.

Policy PR-1►   The City shall endeavor to develop and maintain a complete system of pub-
               lic parks distributed throughout the City that provides opportunities for pas-
               sive and active recreation at a minimum of 3 (three) acres per 1,000 (one
               thousand) residents.
Policy PR-2►   The following are the City’s Park and Landscape Area Classifications.
               These Classifications are described in more detail in the City’s Parks and
               Recreation Master Plan, which should be consulted for in-depth information
               on the features that may be provided in each type of facility.
               The Classifications below cover two general types of facilities:
                    •  Public Parks are those areas which the City considers to be part of
                       the parkland area requirement stated in Policy PR-1. These include
                       Neighborhood, Community, and Regional Parks, together with
                       Sports Complexes and Special Use Facilities.
                    •  Non-Park Public Areas which are not “parks,” but which serve oth-
                       er, parks-related functions. These include Paseo/greenbelt areas
                       and Linear Landscape Areas, Pocket Parks, open space, etc.
               Descriptions of each type of facility are provided below. Expanded descrip-
               tions and requirements are included in the City’s Parks and Recreation
               Master Plan.

                                                Neighborhood Parks are the most important type of park
                                                in Madera. Neighborhood Parks are large enough to in-
                                                clude both passive and active facilities (including sports
                                                fields), but are small enough to be placed in neighbor-
                                                hoods, where they serve the needs of residents in a local
                                                setting.
                                                Neighborhood Parks are typically five (5) to ten (10) acres
                                                size, but must be at least three (3) acres.
                                                Neighborhood Parks serve the recreation needs of their
                                                neighborhood, including limited organized/league use.

                                                Neighborhood Parks are designed and operated to minim-

                                                Locations for Neighborhood Parks will be based on a va-

                                                boundaries. Neighborhood Parks should generally be lo-

                                                “Paseos” or “greenbelts” are linear open space areas
                                                which provide pedestrian connections between neighbor-
                                                hoods and open space, and can be a buffer between dif-

                                                those commonly found in pocket parks.
                                                Paseos/greenbelts differ from Linear Landscape Areas
                                                (described below) in that they generally are located within
                                                a residential or other area and are not adjacent to a road-

                                                Paseos/greenbelets can be designed and built as part of
                                                residential areas, or can make use of strips of public land
                                                next to canals or to creeks. Utility corridors within which

                                                A typical design for paseos/greenbelts is to have these

  CHAPTER 11               PARKS AND RECREATION ELEMENT
                                   Pocket parks will be located primarily based on the availability of land. A
                                   Pocket Park should be located in close proximity to the neighborhood it is in-
                                   tended to serve, so that residents can easily walk to the park.
                                   Pocket parks built after 2009 will be maintained through a private entity such
                                   as a homeowners association or through a landscape, lighting, and

                                   The City no longer accepts Pocket Parks for dedication as public parks.
                                   Pocket Parks which existed prior to April 2009 do count toward the City’s

PARKS AND RECREATION ELEMENT                                             CHAPTER 11
     Open Space will generally be set aside as mitigation for impacts (such as the
     loss of wildlife habitat) or in connection with another facility (such as utility
     corridor). The size of the Open Space area will be based on the land’s prima-
     ry function.
     Open Space set aside for mitigation or other public uses may be owned
     and/or maintained by a public agency (including the City of Madera) or by a
     land conservancy or trust set up for this purpose.
     Open Space does not count toward the City’s parkland standard in Policy
     PR-1.
     The City’s goals and policies for the preservation of open space for a variety
     of uses (protecting natural open areas, watersheds, and environmentally
     sensitive areas such as creeks and riparian areas; preserving farmland; and
     ensuring the safety of persons and property) are addressed in the Conserva-
     tion, Land Use, and Health and Safety Elements of this General Plan. The

                            ities needed to achieve these standards. Some facilities will be provided by
                            other agencies (such as school districts) whose facilities are open to the

                         IMPLEMENTATION POLICIES
                         The following policies define how the City will implement the parks system
                         defined in this Element of the General Plan and in the City’s Park and
                         Recreation Master Plan. These policies are related to the Implementation
                         Goal and, by extension, the Park Facility Goal.
Policy PR-4►              The City shall acquire, develop, and maintain parks and recreation facilities
                          in accordance with the City’s Park and Recreation Master Plan, and with the
                          City’s Park Classifications and the Park and Recreation Facility Service Lev-
                          el Standards. All lands offered for dedication must be of size, orientation, lo-
                          cation, and suitability to provide park and recreation facilities consistent with
                          this General Plan and the Park and Recreation Master Plan.
                          Note: Please see Policy PR-21, which establishes Neighborhood Parks as
                          the City’s first priority in new park development.
                                   CITY OF MADERA GENERAL PLAN | OCTOBER 7, 2009                     11-19

CHAPTER 11      PARKS AND RECREATION ELEMENT
  Policy PR-5►        Parks and other facilities will be accepted into the City’s system at the City’s
                      sole discretion. Land which is proposed to be dedicated to the City will not
                      be accepted if it does not meet the requirements of this Element and/or the
                      Park and Recreation Master Plan.
  Policy PR-6►        The City encourages the integration of parks and other facilities in the mas-
                      ter-planning of development projects. Proposed parks on remnant parcels or
                      otherwise unusable land which do not meet the City’s standards will not be
                      accepted by the City as a park by the City and do not count toward the City’s
                      parkland standard in Policy PR-1. They may become Non-Public Park facili-
                      ties if there is a permanent maintenance mechanism provided, such as a
                      landscape maintenance district.
  Policy PR-7►        The development of parks in new growth areas of the City, where residential
                      projects trigger the need for a new park(s), shall be phased and/or timed with
                      the goal of meeting the standards of this Element and the Parks and
                      Recreation Master Plan at all times. New development should be phased or
                      timed in such a way as to avoid situations where insufficient park or other fa-
                      cilities are provided either permanently or temporarily. The City recognizes
                      that this may require the development of parks or other facilities larger than
                      will be needed at the time in order to ensure that standards will be main-
                      tained as future residential development occurs.
                      Note to the Reader: Please see the “Building Blocks” policies in the Land
                      Use Element of this General Plan for additional information on the master-
                      planning requirements that affect many new development areas in Madera.
  Policy PR-8►        The City shall endeavor to acquire new parklands, expand existing parks, or
                      otherwise make available local parkland and open spaces in sufficient quan-
                      tity to meet community demand for facilities and programs identified in the
                      Park and Recreation Master Plan.

                  Action Item PR-8.1
                  Ensure that a plan is prepared for each new parkland development that
                  includes a site development plan, phasing for development, estimated
                  cost for each phase, long-term operation and maintenance, estimated
                  revenue generation, and funding sources for development.
Policy PR-9►  The City may use a broad range of funding and economic development tools
              to ensure high-quality development, maintenance, and programming of City
              parks and recreation facilities.
Policy PR-10► The City shall require new residential development projects, including mixed-
              use projects with residential components, to dedicate land and/or pay in-lieu
              fees to contribute to the acquisition and development of parks or recreation
              facilities. The determination of which method (land dedication and/or pay-
              ment of in-lieu fees) is appropriate shall be made at the City’s sole discretion.
                  Action Item PR-10.1
                  Evaluate and implement, if adopted, a Park Impact and Parkland Dedica-
                  tion Ordinance consistent with the Quimby Act.
Policy PR-11► The City will seek to provide park facilities in areas of Madera which do not
              meet current standards so that all areas of the city are equitably served. The
              City recognizes that building new or expanded parks in already developed
              areas may not occur at the same pace as the development of parks in newly
              developed areas, and that equity is a long-term goal.
Policy PR-12► The City will seek to provide park and recreation programs in all areas of
              Madera. This may be accomplished in part by the use of public and private
              facilities where City-owned facilities are not available.

CHAPTER 11                PARKS AND RECREATION ELEMENT
   Policy PR-13►                    The City encourages the co-location of new parks, and recreation facilities
                                    with schools, and other public facilities where feasible and consistent with
                                    the Parks and Recreation Master Plan.
                                         Action Item PR-13.1
                                         Work with the Madera Unified School District to establish a joint facility
                                         development agreement that includes opportunities to build new parks
                                         adjacent to or near school sites.
                                    Note to the Reader: Several other important Parks and Recreation issues
                                    are addressed in the Land Use Element of this General Plan. The provision
                                    of open spaces in private development projects is addressed in Policies LU-
                                    16 and LU-17. The provision of parks as one potential “neighborhood cen-
                                    ter” is addressed in the “Building Blocks” policies in the Land Use Element.
   Policy PR-14►                    The City will collaborate with public and private agencies to jointly plan, de-
                                    velop, and manage a regional park in the Planning Area.2
                                    CONNECTIVITY AND ACCESS TO TRAILS AND PARKS
                                    The following policies define how the City will address the idea of “connec-
                                    tivity,” which simply put means that all parks should be connected to their
                                    neighborhoods and to each other via sidewalks, trails, and roadways to
                                    make it easier for Maderans to get to—and use—their parks. These policies
                                    primarily implement the Park Facility Goal.
   Policy PR-15►                    The City shall ensure that the design and location of parks and trails reflect
                                    that active living and walkability are important to Madera’s quality of life.

                      larly review the programs oriented toward groups with focused interests and
                      special needs and revise them as appropriate.
                      Note to the Reader: The design of the City’s parks is also addressed by poli-
                      cies in other Elements of this General Plan:
                           •  Parks will be subject to the requirements of Policy CON-45 in the
                              Conservation Element, which supports “green” building practices at
                              all City facilities.
                           •  The design of parks to reduce crime and anti-social behavior is ad-
                              dressed in Policy HS-38 and Policy HS-39 in the Health and Safety
                              Element, which calls for the use of crime-prevention techniques in all
                              new development.
                           •  The use of design elements reflective of Madera’s unique character is
                              addressed in Policy CD-2 in the Community Design Element, which
                              provides for the creation of comprehensive Design Guidelines for all
                              public and private development projects.
                           •  The City’s “urban forest” and the creation of a Master Tree Plan that
                              would guide the planting of trees in parks and other public areas is
                              addressed in Policy CON-31 in the Conservation Element.

Policy PR-32► The City will provide the resources (personnel and
              funding) necessary for the appropriate level of
              maintenance required for the success of all parks,
              recreational facilities, and natural open space
              areas.
Policy PR-33► The City shall consider operation and maintenance costs in the design of all
              park improvements and recreation facilities. These costs should be consi-
              dered prior to acquisition and acceptance of new facilities.
              NOTE REGARDING “OPEN SPACE”
              The issue of Open Space is closely related to parks and recreation. While
              open spaces are not “parks,” they can provide important benefits for both
              Madera residents and the natural systems that still exist in the Planning
              Area. The City’s goals and policies for the preservation of open space for a
              variety of uses (protecting natural open areas, watersheds, and environmen-
              tally sensitive areas such as creeks and riparian areas; preserving farmland;
              and ensuring the safety of persons and property) are addressed in the Con-
              servation, Land Use, and Health and Safety Elements of this General Plan.
              The reader is invited to consult those Elements for detailed policies and ac-
              tions dealing with open space in all its forms.

                   CHAPTER 12:
                   SUSTAINABILITY
                   ELEMENT
                   “Sustainability” is the term used to show how
                   Madera will balance the various interests and
                   needs of our residents. This encompasses
                   established principles of good planning and
                   advocates a proactive approach to future de-
                   velopment.
                   The concept of sustainability is meeting the
                   needs of current generations without com-
                   promising the ability of future generations to
                   meet their own needs. Sustainable develop-
                   ment considers the impact of decisions on the
                   key aspects of sustainability:
                       •   The Environment;
                       •   The local Economy; and
                       •   The Equity of such decisions on all
                           people.

CHAPTER 12     SUSTAINABILITY ELEMENT
                    Ensuring that a given decision or action promotes all three concepts is the
                    basis for many of the policies and programs in this General Plan. Sustaina-
                    bility is reflected throughout this General Plan as a concept which is applied
                    to all aspects of the City’s operations. Examples of the principles for each of
                    these areas include the following:
                    ENVIRONMENT
                    Sustainability is related to the physical environment in many ways, and ad-
                    dresses both the manmade and natural environments which make up Made-
                    ra’s Planning Area. Examples include:
                                              •   Promote compact, walkable, mixed-use develop-
                                                  ment. (Addressed in the Land Use and Circulation
                                                  elements)
                                              •   Promote infill development.    (Addressed in the
                                                  Land Use Element)
                                              •   Protect open space and agricultural lands. (Ad-

                                              •   Promote the efficient use of energy and resources
                                                  such as water, soil, building materials, etc. (Ad-

                    ECONOMY
                    Maintaining a strong economy whose vitality can be relied on well into the fu-
                    ture is key to Sustainability. Concepts in this General Plan that promote a
                    healthy Madera economy include:

     SUSTAINABILITY ELEMENT                                         CHAPTER 12
     •    Create strong local and regional economies. (Addressed in the Land
          Use and Sustainability elements)
     •    Encourage jobs/housing balance. (Addressed in the Land Use and
          Housing elements)
     •    Support energy and resource efficient industries. (Addressed in the
          Conservation Element)
     •    Promote energy and resource efficient buildings. (Addressed in the
          Conservation Element)
     •    Promote economic opportunity for all segments of the community.
          (Addressed in the Sustainability Element)
     •    Enhance the design character of commercial development. (Ad-
          dressed in the Community Design Element)
EQUITY
“Equity” in terms of Sustainability means ensuring equal access to the bene-
fits of living and working in Madera and equal exposure to potential risks and
hazards—essentially, dealing fairly with all segments of the community.
Ideas in this General Plan that promote equity include:
     •    Provide adequate housing for all income levels. (Addressed in the
          Land Use and Housing elements)
     •    Provide a fair and predictable land use planning process. (Addressed
          in the Land Use and Sustainability elements)
     •    Promote development that is equitable in terms of sharing costs and
          benefits among all Maderans. (Addressed in the Sustainability Ele-
          ment)

CHAPTER 12     SUSTAINABILITY ELEMENT
                        •    Require fair treatment in the development, adoption, and enforcement
                             of regulations and policies. (Addressed in the Sustainability Element)
                        •    Promote alternative transportation options to increase access. (Ad-

                                          SCHOOLS AND EDUCATION
                                          Vision 2025 says of Schools and Education: “Ensure
                                          that the adult and child populations of Madera have
                                          access to high quality educational opportunities. Ensure
                                          safe routes from residential areas to schools, including
                                          access by pedestrians, bicycles, buses, and personal ve-
                                          hicles. Establish and maintain a positive relationship with
                                          education providers in the community.”
                                          The policies in this section support educational facilities
                                          and programs for all residents of Madera, at whatever
                                          stage of life they find themselves. Madera recognizes the
                                          importance of lifelong opportunities for residents to learn
                                          and expand their skills and knowledge. A sustainable
                                          education system will provide residents with access to
                    the facilities and resources they need in order to gain knowledge and skills to
                    pursue satisfying careers. Education plays a key role in promoting a strong
                    economy by providing a skilled workforce. Education is a powerful tool for
                    promoting a greater understanding of sustainability and can demonstrate how
                    everyone has a role to play in the social, economic and environmental health
                    of their community.

                     GOOD GOVERNMENT
                     Vision 2025 says of Good Government: “Madera is a
                     community with an ideal model of an effective local gov-
                     ernment. Services are coordinated, sufficiently funded,
                     and accessible to all residents. Government operations
                     strive for environmental and social equity for all residents,
                     and are responsive to the needs of the community.”
                     While this General Plan seeks to demonstrate the City’s
                     commitment to good government by integrating sustaina-
                     ble principles in all Elements of this plan, this section will
demonstrate Madera’s commitment as a leader in sustainability efforts by
supporting greater public participation, providing access to needed services
to all residents and creating a system of government truly representative of all
its residents. The City of Madera will lead by way of example, by ensuring
that public processes are open and accessible to the full public, and by work-
ing cooperatively with surrounding jurisdictions to solve regional problems.

                     Vision 2025 says of Economic Development: “Madera
                     is a community with a sustainable job market and shop-
                     ping opportunities. Industry and commerce within the
                     community are balanced to provide a range of taxes, lo-

                     designed to promote walking, biking, and other forms of
                     transportation and circulation.”
                     Madera is committed to providing a sustainable economy

                    SOCIAL AND COMMUNITY SYSTEMS
                    Vision 2025 says of Social and Community Systems:                   “Madera is a
                    community of connected, informed, and friendly people. Social systems with-
                    in the City are coordinated to provide a range of services and opportunities
                    for local citizens to engage in fun, creative, and engaging activities. City gov-
                    ernment supports the creation and operation of a wide range of activities and
                    systems.”
                                           These policies address the concept of community sys-
                                           tems, and their importance to a well-functioning commu-

                                           The General Plan considers how these groups and sys-
                                           tems can work cooperatively to enhance broad goals of

  NOTE TO THE READER ABOUT STREAMLINED REVIEW
  To provide a streamlined approach, both in the preparation of the updated
  element as well as in review by the California Department of Housing and
  Community Development (HCD), jurisdictions that adopted a housing
  element in the fourth cycle that HCD found in substantial compliance with
  State law may opt to use the Streamlined Update template (provided by
  HCD) to show where changes were made to the previously adopted housing
  element. The City of Madera has used the Streamlined Update template.
  Use of the Streamlined Update does not relieve the jurisdiction of its
  obligation to address all statutory requirements of State housing element law,
  but rather provides a guide to updating the necessary portions of the housing
  element and facilitates State review of housing element submittals. For
  eligible jurisdictions HCD review will rely upon the element in compliance in
  the prior planning period and will be limited to changes that have occurred
  since the prior planning period.
  The Streamlined Update is not available for the following areas:
         Review and Revise (i.e., evaluation of the 2009 Housing Element
          policies and programs)
         Public Participation
         Policies, Programs, and Quantified Objectives
         Any new statutory requirements since the prior update
  For jurisdictions using the Streamlined Update template, the housing element
  must indicate where changes have been made. The yellow highlighting
  throughout this Housing Element identifies new information and information
  that has been changed from the previous Housing Element. The highlighting
  is only used in sections of the Housing Element that are subject to
  streamlined review.

                           INTRODUCTION
                           The City of Madera last updated its
                           Housing Element in August 2010. The
                           Element was subsequently certified as
                           legally adequate by the California
                           Department of Housing and Community
                           Development (HCD). This Housing
                           Element is a comprehensive update of
                           that 2010 Housing Element and is
                           intended to serve a planning period from
                           2016 to 2024, and accommodated the
                           City’s fair share of the regional housing
                           need for the 2014 to 2023 RHNA
                           projection period. Upon its adoption, this
                           Element will become part of the General
                           Plan, which was updated in 2009.

                           REQUIREMENTS
                           State law recognizes the vital role local

                           affordability of housing. Each local
                           government in California is required to
                           adopt a comprehensive, long-term general
                           plan for the physical development of the
                           city or county. The housing element is one
                           of the seven mandated elements of the
                           local general plan. State law requires the
                           housing element to address the existing
                           and projected housing needs of all
                           economic segments of the community.
                           The law acknowledges that, in order for

CHAPTER 7  HOUSING ELEMENT
                 the private market to adequately address housing needs and demand, local
                 governments must adopt land use plans and regulatory systems that provide
                 opportunities for, and do not unduly constrain, housing development. As a
                 result, housing policy in the state rests largely upon the effective
                 implementation of local general plans and, in particular, local housing
                 elements.
                 The purpose of the housing element is to identify the community's housing
                 needs, to state the community’s goals and objectives with regard to housing
                 production, rehabilitation, and conservation to meet those needs, and to
                 define the policies and programs that the community will implement to
                 achieve the stated goals and objectives.
                 State law requires cities and counties to address the needs of all income
                 groups in their housing elements. The official definition of these needs is
                 provided by HCD for each city and county within its geographic jurisdiction.
                 State housing law (Government Code Section 65580) requires an
                 assessment of housing needs and an inventory of resources and constraints
                 relevant to meeting those needs. The assessment and inventory must include
                 all of the following:
                         Analysis of population and employment trends and documentation of
                          projections and a quantification of the locality's existing and projected
                          housing needs for all income levels.
                         Analysis and documentation of household characteristics, including
                          level of payment compared to ability to pay, and housing
                          characteristics, including the extent of overcrowding and an estimate
                          of housing stock conditions.
                         A site-specific inventory of land suitable for residential development,
                          including vacant and underutilized sites, and an analysis of the
                          relationship of zoning, public facilities, and City services to these sites.
                         Analysis of potential and actual governmental constraints upon the
                          maintenance, improvement, or development of housing for all income
                          levels. These constraints include land use controls, building codes
                          and their enforcement, site improvements, fees and other exactions
                          required of developers, and local processing and permit procedures.

         Analysis of potential and actual non-governmental constraints upon
          the maintenance, improvement, or development of housing for all
          income levels, including the availability of financing, the price of land,
          and the cost of construction.
         Analysis of any special housing needs populations, such as those with
          disabilities, the elderly, large families, farmworkers, the homeless, and
          single-parent households.
         Analysis of opportunities for energy conservation with respect to
          residential development.
  The Housing Needs Assessment of this Housing Element identifies the
  nature and extent of the city’s housing needs that in turn provide the basis for
  the City’s response to those needs in the Policy Document.
  The following sections satisfy State housing law requirements and provide
  the foundation for the goals, policies, implementation programs, and
  quantified objectives. The Housing Element Background Report is organized
  as follows:
         Demographics and Employment Characteristics and Trends
         Housing and Household Characteristics
         Household Income Characteristics
         Assisted Housing and At-Risk Units
         Future Housing Needs
         Housing Resources
         Energy Conservation Opportunities
         Potential Housing Constraints
         Evaluation of Existing Housing Element Accomplishments
  These chapters draw on a broad range of informational sources. Information
  on population, housing stock, and economics comes primarily from the 2010
  U.S. Census, the 2011-2013 American Community Survey (ACS), the

                 records. HCD also provided a pre-approved data package for Madera
                 County, which is noted in the sources for several of the data tables in this
                 section. Much of the data contained in the pre-approved data package is from
                 the 2007-2011 ACS. It is important to note that the ACS data is a multi-year
                 estimate based on sample data and has a large margin of error, especially for
                 smaller cities. Information on available sites and services for housing comes
                 from numerous public agencies. Information on constraints on housing
                 production and past and current housing efforts in Madera comes from City
                 staff, other public agencies, and some private sources.
                 General Plan and Housing Element Differences
                 The housing element is one of seven State-mandated elements that every
                 general plan must contain. Although the housing element must follow all the
                 requirements of the general plan, the housing element has several State-
                 mandated requirements that distinguish it from other general plan elements.
                 Whereas the State allows local government the ability to decide when to
                 update their general plan, State law sets the schedule for periodic updates (8-
                 year time frame) of the housing element. Local governments are also
                 required to submit draft and adopted housing elements to the California
                 Department of Housing and Community Development to review for
                 compliance with State law. Upon satisfaction of these requirements, the State
                 will certify that the City’s housing element is legally adequate. Failure to
                 comply with State law could result in potentially serious consequences (e.g.,
                 reduced access to infrastructure, transportation, and housing funding;
                 vulnerability to lawsuits) that extend beyond the realm of residential land use
                 planning.
                 PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
                 The City is completing the Housing Element Update in conjunction with the
                 HUD Consolidated Plan update. As part of this combined effort, the City
                 consulted with a variety of agencies, including local and regional service
                 providers, the Housing Authority, business groups, and many others. The City
                 held two focus groups meetings as well as a community forum to gather
                 input. The input was used to develop strategies for the Consolidated Plan and
                 refine the policies and programs in the Housing Element.

  Focus Group Meetings
  On December 18, 2014, the City held two Focus Group Meetings, one with
  service providers and the other with real estate development professionals.
  The City geared the discussion with service providers towards organizations
  that provide affordable housing; services to low-income households, including
  homeless services and housing counseling; and organizations that provide
  services to special needs groups, such as farmworkers, seniors, the disabled,
  and youth. The City geared the discussion with real estate development
  professionals towards individuals in the real estate sector, including for profit
  and non-profit developers.
  The City asked the focus group participants about the most significant
  housing, economic, and community needs and issues affecting Madera
  residents and businesses and how these needs changed in the past five
  years. Additionally, the City asked participants about issues of housing
  discrimination in the city and if barriers to fair housing choice exist, as well as
  if any government constraints exist that discourage housing development.
  The City publicized the Focus Group Meetings using email announcements,
  the City’s Facebook page, the Madera Tribune’s Community Calendar, phone
  calls, and flyers (in both English and Spanish) posted throughout the City
  Administration Building. Approximately 20 people attended the focus group
  discussions. See Appendix C for a detailed summary of the input.
  Community Forum
  On January 20, 2015, the City held a Community Forum to solicit input from
  residents and workers in the city on the level of need for various types of
  improvements and the major issues affecting the community. A total of 20
  individuals participated in the Community Forum and provided input on what
  they considered to be the top community issues affecting Madera and
  provided feedback on what they considered to be the housing, economic, and
  community development priorities in the city.
  The City publicized the Community Forum using email announcements, the
  City’s Facebook page, phone calls, and flyers (in both English and Spanish)
  posted throughout City Hall, the Madera County Library and the Housing
  Authority of the City of Madera. In addition the City announced the forum in

                 forum date.
                 The forum engaged the community through an introductory presentation and
                 a series of facilitated breakout groups where participants discussed
                 community issues. Participants communicated in an open-ended dialogue,
                 ranked the issues discussed, and offered suggestions on solutions to the
                 issues they selected. The City did this in an effort to understand the various
                 problems affecting local residents and workers and how the City can
                 potentially address them. The interactive format of the forums solicited strong
                 participation, wherein all attendees were provided the opportunity to
                 participate in the conversation. The City provided Spanish translation
                 services, and one of the breakout group discussions was conducted in
                 Spanish. See Appendix C for a detailed summary of the input.

  GOALS, POLICIES AND ACTION ITEMS
  Under California law, the housing element must include the community’s
  goals, policies, housing programs, and quantified objectives for the
  maintenance, improvement, and development of housing.
  This Housing Element includes eight goal statements. Under each goal
  statement, the element sets out policies that amplify the goal statement.
  Implementation programs (i.e., action items) are listed at the end of the
  corresponding policy or group of policies and describe briefly the proposed
  action, the City agencies or departments with primary responsibility for
  carrying out the program, and the time frame for accomplishing the program.
  Quantified objectives are the number of housing units that the City expects to
  be constructed, conserved, or rehabilitated, and the number of households
  the City expects will be assisted through Housing Element programs based
  on general market conditions during the eight-year time frame of the Housing
  Element.
  Housing element law recognizes that in developing housing policy and
  programs, identified housing needs may exceed available resources and the
  community’s ability to satisfy these needs. The quantified objectives of the
  housing element therefore need not be identical to the identified housing
  need but should establish the maximum number of housing units that can be
  constructed, rehabilitated, and conserved over the eight-year time frame.

               QUANTIFIED OBJECTIVES
               One of the requirements of state law (California Government Code, Section
               65583[b]) is that the Housing Element contain quantified objectives for the
               maintenance, preservation, improvement, and development of housing. State
             CITY OF MADERA GENERAL PLAN | ADOPTED DECEMBER 2, 2015                             7-29

CHAPTER 7       HOUSING ELEMENT
                        law recognizes that the total housing needs identified in the Regional Housing
                        Needs Allocation (RHNA) may exceed available resources and the
                        community’s ability to satisfy this need. Under these circumstances, the
                        quantified objectives need not be identical to the total housing needs.
                        This RHNA is greater than the City has available resources to facilitate. In the
                        past, the City relied heavily on Redevelopment Agency funds to subsidize
                        affordable housing development. When the State of California abolished
                        redevelopment agencies, the primary subsidy for affordable housing
                        throughout California was also eliminated. This action by the State, and the
                        effect of the significant economic downturn on general City revenues, has left
                        the City with limited resources to meet affordable housing needs. Therefore,
                        the City’s quantified objectives for new construction, shown in Table H-I-1,
                        are lower than the RHNA.
                        The quantified objectives shown in Table H-I-1 represent targets. They are
                        estimates based on past experience, anticipated funding levels, and
                        anticipated housing market conditions. The quantified objectives are not
                        designed to be minimum requirements. The quantified objectives are based
                        largely upon implementation programs that have measurable outcomes.
                        However, the Housing Element contains several policies and implementation
                        programs that reduce barriers and create opportunities for affordable
                        housing. These policies and programs are essential to meeting the City’s
                        housing needs, but are more qualitative and difficult to quantify.

                 CHARACTERISTICS AND TRENDS
                 The purpose of this discussion is to establish the baseline population and
                 employment characteristics for the city of Madera. Some data is presented to
                 show a trend over time (2000 to 2014 where possible) and other data is
                 presented alongside comparable data for Madera County and the state of
                 California depending on availability of data. This facilitates an understanding
                 of the city’s characteristics by illustrating how the city is similar to, or differs
                 from, the county and the state in various aspects related to demographic
                 characteristics and needs.

       increased between 2000 and 2012; they represented a smaller share of all
       households. Those households earning less than $15,000 saw the greatest
       reduction in percentage; in 2000 this group represented 22 percent of the
       total population, while in 2012 this group represented 13 percent. Most of
       these households would be considered extremely low-income households.

                  The median household income also increased significantly by 6 percent from
                  $39,330 in 2008 to $41,845 in 2013 but remained significantly lower than the
                  national and statewide median incomes. In 2013 the U.S median household
                  income was $53,046 and in California it was $61,094.
                  The State and Federal government classify household income into several
                  groupings based upon the relationship to the county area median income
                  (AMI) adjusted for household size. These income limits determine
                  household’s eligibility for State and Federally-funded housing assistance
                  programs. These limits are also used to analyze the income and affordability
                  characteristics for the city in the absence of current Census numbers that
                  provide detailed income data. The State of California uses the income groups
                  presented in Table H-8. However, Federal housing programs use slightly
                  different income groupings and definitions, with the highest income category
                  generally defined as 95 percent of AMI or greater. For purposes of the
                  Housing Element, the State income definitions are used throughout, except
                  for the data that have been compiled by the U.S. Department of Housing and
                  Urban Development (HUD) as noted.

  The 2014 Area Median Income (AMI) for a family of four in Madera County,
  which also applies to the city, was $57,900. The State limits are presented by
  income level (extremely low-, very low-, low, moderate-, and above
  moderate-income) and by household size in Table H-36 in the Household
  Income Characteristics section.
  Table H-9 shows the breakdown of households by income categories as a
  percent of median income, according to the 2007-2011 Comprehensive
  Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS). As shown in the table, the majority of
  households in the city are categorized as moderate and above-moderate-
  income (53 percent). However, an estimated 47 percent of households are
  categorized as lower-income, and over 12 percent of households are
  extremely low-income. Based on the 2014 Madera County State Income
  Limits, a family of four considered extremely low-income makes less than
  $17,350.

                    Table H-10 illustrates the labor force data for both the county and city of
                    Madera. The city of Madera represents an estimated 35 percent of the labor
                    force of Madera County and has 50 percent of the total unemployed persons
                    in the county. The 2013 unemployment rate at 16.1 percent for the city of
                    Madera is higher than 11.4 percent countywide and 8.9 percent statewide.
                    In 2013 the county of Madera’s unemployment rate was 10.7 percent, lower
                    than 11.2 percent in California and slightly higher than 9.3 percent for the
                    nation during the same period. Rising unemployment trends are not unique to
                    Madera, as the U.S and California are also experiencing a steady increase in
                    unemployment rates.

  Table H-11 and Figure H-3 show the employment by major sectors for the
  city of Madera in 2012. The agricultural, forestry, fishing and hunting, and
  mining sector was the major employment sector in the city, accounting for
  27.2 percent of the city’s employment. This is likely due to the city’s relatively
  large farmworker population. As shown in the table, educational services, and
  health care and social assistance (17.7 percent) was also a significant
  employment sector in the city.

                 Table H-13 shows the largest employers in Madera County. According to the
                 California Economic Development Department, in 2013 government was the
                 largest industry countywide, accounting for 24 percent of the workforce. This
                 is the result of jobs at two state prisons: Central California Women’s Facility
                 and Valley State Prison located in Chowchilla. Together the prisons employ a
                 total of 2,300 people.
                 The majority of employers employ between 250 and 499 permanent workers,
                 but employers such as Children’s Hospital and the prisons provide more than
                 1,000 jobs.
                 In October 2014 the Chukchansi Gold Resort & Casino in Coarsegold, about
                 30 miles northeast of Madera, closed down. This closure has had serious
                 economic impacts to Madera since the casino was one of the largest
                 employers, with a workforce of about 1,400 people from Madera County. In
                 January 2015 leaders from the Tribe came together and expressed how they
                 will continue their efforts to reopen the casino. In February 2015 the
                 California Employment Development Department awarded the Madera
                 County Workforce Investment Board an emergency grant of $500,000 to
                 assist workers laid-off from the casino closure.

         Table H-14 shows employment projections from 2012 through 2022 for the
         10 fastest growing occupation groups in the Madera Metropolitan Statistical
         Area (MSA). During the 10 years, new employment with the Madera MSA is
         expected to be concentrated in a variety of occupations ranging from
         construction occupations to healthcare professions. According to HCD’s
         annual income limits, the 2014 AMI in Madera for a family of four was
         $57,900. Many of the faster growing occupations pay wages that are lower
         than this median income figure. For a family with only one income, these
         common, lower-paying jobs may cause difficulty to afford housing, but for a
         family with two able workers and two incomes, two of these jobs would likely
         allow that family to afford safe and decent housing. However, it is important to
         note that the occupation with the largest projected growth – farmworkers and
         laborers, crop, nursery, and greenhouse – also pays the least, and two
         workers earning these wages would earn well below median income.

                 Table H-15 shows the Department of Finance-estimated population and
                 housing units for Madera. As indicated in this table, the city experienced a
                 period of growth in both the population and housing units during 2005 to
                 2007, with 2007 showing a very strong growth rate. In 2008 the city
                 experienced a significant decrease in housing production as did the state and
                 the U.S.

  Table H-16 compares the city of Madera with Madera County using the 2000
  and 2010 U.S. Census and 2014 Department of Finance estimates for
  population, household, and housing unit growth. The city of Madera
  experienced a 3.6 percent annual average population growth rate from 2000
  to 2010, which was higher than the population growth countywide (2.1
  percent) during this period. However, between 2010 and 2014, the average
  annual growth rate was more similar, about a half-percent, in both the city
  and countywide.

  Madera, the 2000 average household size was 3.57 persons, significantly
  higher than its 1990 size of 2.97. By 2014 that ratio had increased to 3.87,

                            Table H-17 presents comparative data on the housing stock in the city of
                            Madera, Madera County, and California. The table breaks out the total
                            housing stock in each area according to the type of structures in which units
                            are located, total occupied units, and vacancy rates. As shown in the table,
                            single family detached housing units account for the majority of housing in the
                            city of Madera, Madera County, and the state. However, the city of Madera
                            has a slightly larger proportion of single family detached units than the state,
                            and a smaller proportion than the county. From 2000 to 2014 single family
                            detached units increased from 65 to 72 percent of the total housing stock in
                            Madera.

CHAPTER 7  HOUSING ELEMENT
                 In the absence of a recent housing condition survey, the City must estimate
                 the condition of its housing stock according to age. The U.S. Census provides
                 data on the age of a community’s housing stock. This data is an acceptable
                 indicator of the likely condition of the housing stock. As shown in Table H-18,
                 29 percent of the housing stock was built between 2000 and 2009, which
                 accounts for a strong housing construction cycle the city experienced during
                 this time. An estimated 44 percent of housing units were built before 1979. It
                 is probable that many of these older units require some level of rehabilitation
                 and some would require replacement.

  Housing Tenure
  The number of households in Madera increased by nearly 30 percent
  between 2000 and 2007, establishing a strong growth trend that continued
  until the dramatic market change.. Prior to 2010, the city had a higher
  percentage of owner households. However, in 2013, more households are
  renting, as shown in Table H-19.

  Overcrowding
  Data on housing overcrowding are available from the 2008-2012 ACS in the
  form of the number of persons per room in occupied housing units. Table H-
  20 compares data for Madera with data for the county as a whole. Typically, a
  housing unit is considered to be overcrowded if there are more than 1.0
  persons per room and is considered severely overcrowded if there are more
  than 1.5 persons per room. A “room” in this context includes bedrooms and
  living rooms but not kitchen or bathroom facilities. A family of five living in a
  three bedroom home with one living room would be calculated as 1.25
  persons per room and therefore, would technically be considered
  “overcrowded”.

CHAPTER 7  HOUSING ELEMENT
                 In total, 17 percent of occupied housing units in the city were overcrowded in
                 2012, higher than 11 percent countywide This 17 percent is made up of the
                 following percentage (out of the total housing units):
                         10 percent had between 1.01 and 1.50 persons per room;
                         4 percent had between 1.51 and 2.0 persons per room; and
                         3 percent had more than 2.0 persons per room.
                 Overcrowding is more common in renter-occupied households; 8 percent
                 (675) of the owner-occupied households in the city were overcrowded, while
                 an estimated 21 percent (3,397) of renter-occupied households were
                 overcrowded. Countywide 5 percent of owner-occupied households and 29
                 percent of renter-occupied households were overcrowded. These statistics
                 reveal a higher rate of owner overcrowding in the city of Madera than in the
                 county, which can be expected of the main urban center in a rural county.
                 However, the city of Madera had a lower rate of rental overcrowding.

                 Table H-21 shows the number of bedrooms by housing unit in Madera in
                 2013. In 2000 an estimated 52 percent of homes in the city contained more

                 and in 2013 it was almost 70 percent. Less than 10 percent of the housing
                 units have one bedroom.

                 Housing Vacancy Rates
                 Vacant units are essential to the healthy function of the housing market.
                 Vacancies are necessary to facilitate population mobility. They also have an
                 important role in market pricing mechanisms. Too few vacancies can have an
                 undesirable upward effect on prices. Conversely, excessive vacancy rates
                 can have an inhibiting effect on investment in housing, including maintenance
                 of rental properties. There are several types of vacancy rates. For
                 determining shortages and surpluses in the housing market, the most
                 important of these is the “market vacancy rate.” This term refers to the
                 number of vacant units that are for sale or rent as a percentage of the market
                 (all occupied units and all vacant for sale or rent units).
                 Optimal vacancy rates differ between rental housing and for-sale housing.
                 For rental housing a 5 percent vacancy rate is considered necessary to
                 permit ordinary rental mobility. For for-sale housing a 2 percent vacancy rate
                 is considered the threshold to permit ordinary mobility. If vacancy rates are
                 below these levels, residents will have a difficult time finding appropriate units
                 and competition for units will drive up housing prices. There are vacant units

  that are not for sale or rent, such as second homes, units held off the market,
  seasonal units, and units for migratory workers. Collectively, these types of
  vacant units are often referred to as "other vacant" units. The vacancy rates
  which include these vacant units are called “gross vacancy rates.”
  Vacancy rates in Madera were similar to the desired rate in 2013 for owner-
  occupied units with a 1.6 percent vacancy rate. The owner-occupied vacancy
  rate is lower than the countywide rate but the same as the statewide rate.
  Renter-occupied units had a similar vacancy rate to the desired rate at 5.8
  percent. The renter-occupied vacancy rate is similar to the countywide rate
  but higher than the statewide rate.

  Housing Affordability
  Table H-23 identifies the housing costs reported for the city of Madera in
  2013. It is important to note that the greatest majority of the population,
  almost 30 percent, pays between $1,000 and $1,500 per month for housing
  costs. At $12,000 to $18,000 per year, this cost can equate to a large portion
  of a household’s monthly expenses. Considering that the median household
  income in 2014 was $57,900, these housing costs equate to 21 to 31 percent

                 A household that pays more than 30 percent of gross monthly income for rent
                 or a mortgage payment is considered to be overpaying for housing.
                 Households that pay more than 50 percent on housing costs are considered
                 to be severely overpaying.

  Table H-24 provides a summary of households that overpay for housing as a
  percentage of household income. An estimated 47 percent of households
  currently overpay for housing. An estimated 51 percent of all renter-occupied
  households overpaid for housing in 2011, which was 7 percent higher than
  the percentage of owner-occupied households (44 percent) overpaying for
  housing. An estimated 1,915 of the 7,510 households that overpaid for
  housing were extremely low-income households, which represented 21
  percent of all households overpaying; 83 percent of extremely low-income
  households were overpaying for housing, including 86 percent of extremely
  low-income renters and 76 percent of extremely low-income owners. The
  high percentage of extremely low-income households that were overpaying
  for housing highlights the housing burden experienced by lower wage
  earners.

                 SPECIAL HOUSING NEEDS
                 Within the general population, there are several groups of people who have
                 special housing needs. This section identifies the special needs households
                 in the city of Madera. This review is essential because a major part of the
                 City’s role in providing opportunities for affordable housing is to preclude
                 barriers to residents whose needs are not normally met by the private sector.
                 This segment of the city’s population is constrained by the housing market
                 not only because of lower incomes, but also because of the lack of housing
                 that is suitable to their special needs. When the housing market does not
                 meet their needs, families or individuals must settle for substandard housing
                 or must pay more than they can afford. These needs can make it difficult for
                 members of these groups to locate suitable housing. The following
                 subsections discuss the special housing needs of six groups identified in
                 State housing element law (Government Code, Section 65583(a)(7)).
                 Specifically, special housing needs groups include:
                        senior households;
                        persons with disabilities, including developmental disabilities;

        large households;
        single-headed households;
        homeless persons; and
        farmworkers.
  In addition, this Housing Element discusses the needs of extremely low-
  income households. Where possible, estimates of the population or number
  of households in Madera falling into each group are presented.
  Senior Households
  Senior households are defined as households with one or more persons over
  the age of 65 years. Table H-25 below presents a comparison of the number
  of persons over the age of 65 years in Madera, in 2000 and 2013. While the
  number of seniors increased by 33 percent, the proportion of seniors in the
  city decreased from 9 percent to 8 percent in Madera between 2000 and
  2013. The male senior population increased by 52 percent, while the female
  population increased by 22 percent.
  In 2000, 495 seniors were 85 years and older, which made up 1 percent of
  the Madera population as a whole. In 2013, this number increased to 656
  seniors 85 years and older, still representing 1 percent of the Madera
  population as a whole.
  In 2013 the majority of senior households in Madera were owner-occupied
  (69 percent). Only 31 percent of senior households were renter-occupied. In
  contrast, the households headed by a non-senior person have a higher
  proportion of renters, (58 percent). This indicates many seniors have
  purchased their homes and are less inclined to move than younger
  populations.

                             Although there are many more senior homeowners, it is the renters who often
                             experience the greatest housing needs due to low, fixed incomes and rising
                             rental rates. Senior homeowners, however, face the problem of maintaining
                             their homes, often on fixed incomes.

  According to the 2011-2013 American Community Survey in, 4,347
  households receive Social Security Income (SSI) in the city of Madera. (Note
  that this figure includes seniors who may have qualified for SSI before age 65
  because of a disability.) SSI is a needs-based program that pays monthly
  benefits to persons who are 65 years of age or older, blind, or have a
  disability. Seniors who have never worked or have insufficient work credits to
  qualify for Social Security disability often receive SSI benefits. SSI is often the
  only source of income for a number of low-income seniors. As of January
  2015, the maximum monthly Federal payment is $733 for an eligible
  individual and $1,100 for a couple. SSI is often the only source of income for
  a number of low-income elderly persons and while the benefit amount has
  increased over the years, with these maximum monthly benefit amounts, SSI
  recipients are likely to continue having difficulty finding housing that fits within
  their budgets.
  Information from Service Providers
  The Senior Services Division, which is part of the City’s Parks and
  Community Services Department, provides services countywide for senior
  citizens 55 years and older. Services include recreation, meals, special
  outings, health services, and information and referral. The Senior Nutrition
  Program, funded in part by the Fresno-Madera Area Agency on Aging
  (FMAAA), serves hot meals at two centers in Madera, the Frank Bergon
  Senior Center and the Pan Am Community Center. The FMAAA serves over
  300,000 congregate meals and approximately 600,000 home-delivered meals
  annually throughout the Fresno and Madera area. The senior coordinator and
  staff at the centers made the following observations regarding seniors’
  housing needs:
          There is not enough affordable housing for seniors. The waiting lists
           for the existing senior projects are too long.
          Many seniors have extremely low incomes, such as from SSI, and
           cannot afford to pay much rent.
          Many of the units with rents low enough so that they are affordable to
           seniors with extremely low incomes are substandard.
          Some seniors need more services than are currently provided at the
           existing senior developments. They need assistance with

                         supportive services that could be arranged through a services
                         coordinator, if such services were provided for residents.
                 There are currently (2015) 412 senior housing units in eight developments in
                 Madera; 77 units of senior housing are public housing. The senior housing
                 developments in the city of Madera are as follows:
                        Valle de las Brisas: 80 units (all low income);
                        Yosemite Manor: 76 units (all low income);
                        Madera Gardens: 65 units (63 low income);
                        PH-800 E. Yosemite: 50 units (all available to low-income households,
                         the elderly, and persons with disabilities);
                        PH-131 Mace Street: 20 units (all available to low-income households,
                         the elderly, and persons with disabilities);
                        PH-123 Santa Cruz: 4 units (all available to low-income households,
                         the elderly, and persons with disabilities);
                        PH-1022 Clinton: 3 units (all available to low-income households, the
                         elderly, and persons with disabilities); and
                        Cedar Creek: 114 units (0 low income);
                 There are waiting lists for all of these units.
                 Persons with Disabilities
                 Table H-27 presents information from the 2011-2013 American Community
                 Survey on the disability status of persons 5 years and older. An estimated 4
                 percent of those aged 5 to 17 have a disability. The most common disability is
                 vision. An estimated 10.8 percent of Madera’s population 18 to 64 years of
                 age has a disability. The most common disability is an ambulatory disability.
                 The percentage of seniors (65 years and older) with a disability is much
                 larger at 51.2 percent. The most common disability for seniors is ambulatory
                 followed by a hearing difficulty.

CHAPTER 7  HOUSING ELEMENT
                 SB 812, which took effect January 2011, amended State housing element law
                 to require an evaluation of the special housing needs of persons with
                 developmental disabilities. A "developmental disability" is defined as a
                 disability that originates before an individual becomes 18 years old, continues
                 or can be expected to continue indefinitely, and constitutes a substantial
                 disability for that individual. This includes Mental Retardation, Cerebral Palsy,
                 Epilepsy, and Autism.
                 Many developmentally-disabled persons are able to live and work. However,
                 more severely disabled individuals require a group living environment with
                 supervision, or an institutional environment with medical attention and
                 physical therapy. Because developmental disabilities exist before adulthood,
                 the first housing issue for the developmentally disabled is the transition from
                 living with a parent/guardian as a child to an appropriate level of
                 independence as an adult.
                 According to the Department of Developmental Services, there were 813
                 residents in Madera receiving services in 2014. The majority of these (626 or
                 77 percent) lived in their own home.
                 Although these figures can give a sense of the proportion of the population
                 with different types of disabilities, a much smaller proportion of the population
                 may actually require specially-adapted housing to accommodate disabilities.
                 The Madera County Department of Behavioral Health Service provides and
                 coordinates housing services for people who are mentally ill. The department
                 works closely with facility and service providers in the county, such as the
                 Madera County Community Action Agency and the Rescue Mission, to
                 ensure that clients receive housing services and other supportive services.
                 Housing programs for persons with disabilities are primarily available through
                 the Madera Housing Authority. Many of the units identified for seniors are
                 also available to persons with disabilities.

  Large Households
  The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) defines a
  large household or family as one with five or more members. These
  households usually require housing with four or more bedrooms, which is rare
  especially among apartment units and rentals in general. According to Table
  H-28, there were 3,328 large families (five or more members) living in Madera
  in 2000, or 28 percent of the total number of households in the city. By 2013
  this number had increased to 4,156, 26 percent of all households. An
  estimated 839 households had seven or more members. This is a slight
  decrease from the figures in the 2000 Census, where 10 percent of all
  households (1,151) had seven or more members. Two-person households
  made up the highest percentage of the demographic makeup of the
  community in 2000 although in 2013 four-person households had a higher
  percentage.

  Large households require housing units with more bedrooms than housing
  units needed by smaller households. In general, housing for these
  households should provide safe outdoor play areas for children and should
  be located to provide convenient access to schools and child-care facilities.
  These types of needs can pose problems particularly for large families that

  Single-Headed Households
  According to the U.S. Census Bureau, a single-headed household contains a
  household head and at least one dependent, which could include a child, an
  elderly parent, or non-related child. As shown in Table H-30, the 2013 ACS
  estimate indicated that there were 3,915 households headed by a female,
  representing 24 percent of all Madera households. The majority (70 percent)
  of these female-headed households (2,736) have children living in them who
  are under 18 years of age.
  Due to lower incomes, single-headed households often have more difficulties
  finding adequate, affordable housing than families with two adults. Also,
  single-headed households with small children may need to pay for childcare,
  which further reduces disposable income. This special needs group will
  benefit generally from expanded affordable housing opportunities. More
  specifically, the need for dependent care also makes it important that housing
  for single-headed families be located near childcare facilities, schools, youth
  services, medical facilities, or senior services.

CHAPTER 7  HOUSING ELEMENT
                 Homeless Persons
                 As elsewhere in the nation, homelessness is usually the end result of multiple
                 factors that converge in a person's life. The combination of loss of
                 employment, inability to find a job because of the need for retraining, and
                 high housing costs lead to some individuals and families losing their housing.
                 For others, the loss of housing is due to chronic health problems, physical
                 disabilities, mental health disabilities, or drug and alcohol addictions, along
                 with an inability to access the services and long-term support needed to
                 address these conditions.
                 The cities and counties of Madera and Fresno have joined to form the Fresno
                 Madera Continuum of Care (FMCoC) to work together to prevent, reduce,
                 and end homelessness in the San Joaquin Valley. Among the Continuum of
                 Care’s goals are the following:
                         Enhance and stabilize the homeless service and housing provider
                          organizations within the area.
                         Increase the amount of affordable, long-term housing for families that
                          are completing transitional housing programs.
                         Work with Community Development Corporations in Fresno and
                          Madera to increase the inventory of affordable housing in revitalization
                          areas.
                         Implement a Homeless Management Information System to be used
                          for tracking, reporting and coordinating available resources and need.
                         Develop and conduct a Homeless Survey to collect data required for
                          gaps analysis and to secure funding.
                 The FMCoC completed a Point-In-Time (PIT) Homeless Street Count in the
                 Fresno and Madera region on January 27, 2014. A total of 412 volunteers
                 from the Fresno and Madera area dedicated over 1,500 hours to this effort.
                 The major findings from the PIT count survey were as follows:
                         In the entire Fresno-Madera region, a total of 2,597 homeless
                          individuals were counted. Of those, 714 (27 percent) were sheltered

           and the majority, 1,883 (73 percent) were unsheltered homeless
           individuals.
          In the city of Madera, a total of 270 homeless individuals were
           counted. Of those, 105 (39 percent) were sheltered and 165 (61
           percent) were unsheltered.
          Roughly 14 percent of sheltered and 9 percent of unsheltered
           homeless individuals counted during the PIT count were located in the
           city of Madera.
          Among the unsheltered population in the Fresno-Madera region, 24.3
           percent had been homeless seven or more years, 21 percent four to
           six years, 20.1 percent two to three years, 14.2 percent one to two
           years, and 20.4 percent had been homeless for less than one year.
  A number of private, public, and nonprofit organizations operate housing for
  the homeless and provide services to the homeless, such as job training,
  childcare, and counseling.
  Currently (2015) there are 278 shelter beds operated by several programs,
  including emergency, transitional, and permanent supportive housing
  programs (see Table H-31 below). Specific facilities are available to each of
  these subgroups: chronically homeless, homeless families with children,
  veterans and their families, and unaccompanied youth. The names of these
  facilities and the number of beds are presented below in the following table.
  Table H-31 detailed the breakdown of specific homeless facilities operated by
  various organizations in Madera. As the table shows, there are a total of 278
  beds, of which 86 beds are for households with children, 192 beds are for
  households without children, 20 beds are for children, and 85 beds are for
  Veterans. The beds available for different types of households or individuals
  exceeds the total number of beds because many facilities have beds
  available for multiple purposes rather than beds reserved for one type of
  household or individual.

CHAPTER 7  HOUSING ELEMENT
                 Farmworkers
                 Farmworker households are often comprised of extended family members or
                 single male workers. Many farmworker households tend to have difficulties
                 securing safe, decent, and affordable housing due to low incomes, seasonal
                 incomes, and large family size.
                 A special report prepared for the Madera Housing Authority and the Darin M.
                 Camarena Health Centers Inc. provided information on the needs of
                 farmworkers in Madera County. The study included surveys of agricultural
                 workers to assess the health and housing options for agricultural workers in
                 Madera and to identify some of the problems that they are facing. The special
                 study consisted of surveys of 200 agricultural workers, the Immigrant Voice
                 Survey, and the Agricultural Worker Health and Housing Program (AWHHP)
                 survey, as well as three focus group sessions to discuss current and future
                 health and housing needs of these farmworkers.
                 Findings from this special study include the following:
                       Large and Growing Families. Average family size was 5.8 persons.
                        Most of the households had at least one child under the age of 10.
                       Household Income. A reasonable estimate of the typical hourly pay
                        (or piece work equivalent) for these agricultural workers would be
                        $6.75 to $8 per hour. This, combined with the high level of
                        underemployment, results in very low household incomes. The
                        average household income for AWHHP participants was $12,055.
                       Living Arrangements. The majority of the AWHHP participants were
                        living in houses (67), followed by apartments (24), single rooms (6),
                        and mobile homes (1).
                       Housing Quality. Almost half of the AWHHP respondents reported
                        problems with insects or vermin infestation. Other problems included
                        heating and cooling, plumbing, electrical wiring, and sewer.
                        Approximately 10 percent in both surveys cited poor quality housing
                        as the reason for their last move.

         Lack of Affordable Housing. The need for more affordable housing
          options, as either apartment complexes or homes, was the focus of
          much of the discussion at the three focus group meetings.
         Exploitation by Landlords. With their low incomes and in some cases
          undocumented status, many workers are vulnerable to being exploited
          by landlords. Landlords may fail to make necessary repairs, leaving
          tenants to make repairs on their own. In addition, rental deposits are
          often excessive.
  The study concludes that the very low wages paid to agricultural workers, the
  seasonal nature of farm labor, and the rising housing costs in the Central
  Valley pose serious constraints on the ability of Madera’s agricultural workers
  to secure decent and affordable housing. The ineligibility of undocumented
  workers for government-sponsored housing programs is a serious problem as
  well.
  As shown earlier in Table H-11, the estimated number of Madera residents
  employed in agriculture, farming, fishing, and forestry jobs in 2012 was 5,992,
  which was about 27 percent of the workforce (persons aged 16 and older).
  According to the USDA Census of Agriculture, there were over 14,000 hired
  farm laborers in the County of Madera in 2012. More specifically, 7,110 of
  those farmworkers worked 150 days or more, while 6,940 worked fewer than
  150 days. Statistics on farmworkers is often difficult to gather because the
  population moves to other cities following the crops based on the seasons.
  The Housing Authority of the City of Madera is responsible for providing
  assisted rental housing through its public housing farmworker rental units.
  The Housing Authority owns 100 rural development units of farm labor
  housing located in three different sites: the 28 units at 1110 Kennedy Street,
  28 units at 800 Lilly Drive, and 44 units at 337 Knox Drive. Residency is
  restricted to farm labor families that are U.S. citizens or have residency.
  According to the Housing Authority, the public housing farmworker rental
  units have a one percent vacancy rate all year and typically have a waiting list
  over 20 names long. Based on this demand, the City has an unmet need for
  farmworker housing.

CHAPTER 7  HOUSING ELEMENT
                 Extremely Low-Income Households
                 Extremely low-income households are defined as households with incomes
                 under 30 percent of the area median income. Extremely low-income
                 households typically consist of minimum wage workers, seniors on fixed
                 incomes, the disabled, and farmworkers. This income group is likely to live in
                 overcrowded and substandard housing conditions, and have specific housing
                 needs that require greater government subsidies and assistance, housing
                 with supportive services, single room occupancy (SRO) and shared housing,
                 and rental subsidies or vouchers. In recent years rising rents, higher income
                 and credit standards imposed by landlords, and insufficient government
                 assistance has exacerbated the problem. Without adequate assistance this
                 group has a high risk of homelessness.
                 The area median income is $57,900, according to HCD. For extremely low-
                 income households, this results in an income of $17,350 or less for a four-
                 person household or $12,150 or less for a one-person household. Minimum
                 wage in California is $9.00 an hour. A full-time minimum wage worker could
                 be considered an extremely low-income household with an annual income of
                 approximately $18,000 or less. Occupations that make about minimum wage
                 include: education, training and library workers; agricultural graders and
                 sorters; waiters and waitresses; and food preparation and serving related
                 workers. The minimum wage will rise to $10.00 by January 2016 in California,
                 well above the current Federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. With a
                 minimum wage of $10.00, workers will receive an annual salary of $20,000,
                 which by today’s income limits would be very low income.
                 In 2011 there were an estimated 1,915 extremely low-income households in
                 the city (12.1 percent). Most (76 percent) extremely low-income households
                 are renters and also experience a higher incidence of housing problems,
                 defined as: a cost burden greater than 30 percent of income, overcrowding,
                 and/or a home without complete kitchen or plumbing facilities. As shown in
                 Table H-32, 90 percent of extremely low-income renter households
                 experienced housing problems, compared to 76 percent of extremely low-
                 income owners. For both owners and renters, however, the percentage of
                 households with one or more housing problem significantly declines as
                 income increases.

CHAPTER 7  HOUSING ELEMENT
                 HOUSEHOLD INCOME CHARACTERISTICS
                 Housing Costs Compared to Ability to Pay
                 The following section discusses the ability to pay for housing at different
                 income levels compared with housing costs. Housing is classified as
                 “affordable” if households do not pay more than 30 percent of income (35
                 percent for moderate-income households) for payment of rent (including
                 monthly allowance for water, gas, and electricity) or monthly mortgage
                 (including taxes).
                 Table H-33 shows the 2014 State income limits for Madera County by the
                 number of persons in the household. Table H-33 also provides the maximum
                 affordable monthly rents and maximum affordable purchase prices for a
                 home, assuming that the households do not pay more than 30 percent of
                 their income (or 35 percent for moderate-income) for housing expenses. The
                 amounts of the maximum rent were calculated by taking the annual income of
                 each category, dividing that amount by 12, and then multiplying by 30 percent
                 (or 35 percent for moderate-income). For example, a four-person household
                 is classified as very low-income (50 percent of AMI) if the household had an
                 income of $28,950. A household with this income could afford to pay a
                 monthly gross rent (including utilities) of up to $724.
                 The calculation of maximum purchase price assumes a 5 percent down
                 payment, 5 percent annual interest rate, 30-year mortgage, and 21 percent
                 for taxes, mortgage insurance, and homeowners insurance. A very low-
                 income four-person household with an income of $28,950 could afford to
                 purchase a house that was priced at an estimated $116,936 or less.

CHAPTER 7  HOUSING ELEMENT
                   Table H-34 below shows 2015 HUD-defined fair market rent levels (FMR) for
                   Madera County. In general, the FMR for an area is the amount that would be
                   needed to pay the gross rent (shelter rent plus utilities) of privately-owned,
                   decent, safe, and sanitary rental housing of a modest (non-luxury) nature with
                   suitable amenities. The rents are drawn from the distribution of rents of all
                   units that are occupied by recent movers in the area. Adjustments are made
                   to exclude public housing units, newly-built units, and substandard units.
                   As noted above, a four-person low-income household with an annual income
                   of up to $34,750 (60 percent of median) could afford to pay $869 monthly
                   gross rent (including utilities). The FMR for a three-bedroom unit is $1,280,
                   which is not quite affordable to this household. They would likely have to live
                   in a two-bedroom unit, which would be considered overcrowded. The gap
                   between affordability and rental prices widens drastically for very low-income
                   families. A four-person household classified as very low-income (50 percent
                   of median) with an annual income of up to $28,950 could afford to pay only
                   $724 monthly gross rent and could not afford the FMR rent of $1,280 for a
                   three-bedroom unit.

CHAPTER 7  HOUSING ELEMENT
                 Home Sale Prices
                 Home sale prices for the City of Madera were compiled using data provided
                 by DataQuick, an agency that monitors real estate activity nationwide and
                 provides information to consumers, educational institutions, public agencies,
                 lending institutions, title companies, and industry analysts. According to
                 DataQuick, the median sale price for a home in the city of Madera in 2013
                 was $152,000. One year later in 2014, the median sale price had increased
                 by 18 percent to $179,000. This was similar to the 2014 median sale price in
                 Madera County: $185,000. The median home sale price includes resale
                 single family homes, new single family homes, and condominiums.
                 Comparing the income data and maximum home purchase price based on
                 the income limits established for low-income households in Table H-36 with
                 the median home sale prices reported by DataQuick (2014), low-income
                 households would be able to purchase a home at this price.

                 Table H-37 displays the median market rate rental prices by bedroom based
                 on an online rent survey. One-bedroom apartments were renting for an
                 estimated $650-$875 per month, which a single person with an income in the
                 very low-income category would be unable to afford. Rent for a two-bedroom
                 home or apartment was an estimated $537-$1,175. A low-income family of
                 four would likely be able to afford a rent at the low end of this range, but a
                 very low- or low-income household would not. These are indications of the
                 continued need to pursue programmatic solutions to the supply of housing
                 affordable to all income levels.

          ASSISTED HOUSING AND AT-RISK UNITS
          Assisted Housing
          Assisted housing is defined as units in which all or part of the costs are
          subsidized by the public sector so that housing is available to lower-income
          households at more affordable costs. The Department of Housing and
          Community Development (HCD) defines assisted housing developments as
          multifamily rental housing projects that receive financial assistance through
          State and Federal funding sources including HUD programs, State and local
          bond programs, redevelopment programs, and those restricted as part of
          inclusionary or density bonus programs. There are a total of 825 assisted
          units in the city in 14 properties.

  In addition to these assisted multifamily units, there are hundreds of units,
  many of which are single family homes that were assisted with former
  Redevelopment Agency funding. These units have affordability restrictions for
  a variety of lengths from 30 to 55 years. Unfortunately, if a home goes into
  foreclosure, the affordability covenant is broken. According to Jim Taubert,
  Executive Director of the Successor Agency to the Redevelopment Agency,
  there have been close to 35 or 40 foreclosures.
  Units at Risk of Conversion
  At-risk projects are considered to be those projects that are subject to
  governmental regulatory agreements and where the project owners can
  cancel the regulatory agreement and convert the affordable rents to market-
  rate rents within the next 10-year planning period.
  According to the best information available, none of the units are at risk of
  expiring in the 10-year planning period. The expiration dates for two of the
  developments, Lakewood Terrace and Madera Garden Apartments, have
  already passed. It is possible, although highly unlikely based on in-depth
  research from multiple sources, that these developments had additional
  sources of funding that extended the affordability expiration dates. Because
  information on these units is not available, the 134 units are considered at
  risk.
  Options for Preserving or Replacing At-Risk Units
  Generally, the cost of preserving assisted housing units is estimated to be
  significantly less than replacing units through new construction. The following
  analysis compares estimated costs for preserving or replacing the 134 at-risk
  units.
  Acquisition and Rehabilitation
  In the event that the affordability terms expire on an at-risk development and
  the property owners of the projects decide to convert the rental rates of the
  units to market rental rates, interested parties (nonprofit or for profit) may
  purchase and rehabilitate the property in order to maintain the affordability of
  the units. Purchasing the at-risk units depends on the owners’ willingness to
  sell, interested parties to purchase the project, and available funding
  assistance.

CHAPTER 7  HOUSING ELEMENT
                 Currently, loopnet.com advertises two multifamily complexes for sale, both in
                 the city of Madera: a 12-unit complex of two-bedroom apartments for
                 $1,155,000 ($96,250 per unit) and a 16-unit complex of three-bedroom
                 apartments for $1,795,000 ($112,188 per unit). Since the majority of the at-
                 risk units are two bedrooms or fewer, $96,250 per unit is likely a more
                 accurate estimate of the cost of acquiring the units. The average
                 rehabilitation cost for each unit is estimated at $20,000, which means that the
                 estimated total cost to acquire and rehabilitate each unit is $116,250.
                 Roughly, the total cost to acquire and rehabilitate the 134 units is $15.6
                 million. Actual acquisition costs depend on several variables such as
                 condition, size, location and availability of financing (government and market).
                 Preservation
                 The ongoing cost to preserve affordability is determined by identifying the gap
                 (subsidy) between the assisted rent and the market rent. The exact amount is
                 difficult to estimate because the rents are based on a tenant’s income and,
                 therefore, would depend on the size and income level of the household. The
                 following are some general examples of expected subsidies.
                 An extremely low-income person can only afford up to $304 per month and
                 the fair-market rental rate in the city for a one-bedroom unit is $651 per
                 month. The subsidy needed to preserve a unit at an affordable rent for
                 extremely low-income households would be an estimated $347 per month, or
                 $4,164 per year. For 30 years, the subsidy would be about $124,920 for one
                 household. Subsidizing all 134 units at an extremely low-income rent for 30
                 years would cost an estimated $16.7 million.
                 A very low-income family of three can afford $651 a month and the fair-
                 market rent in the city for a two-bedroom unit is $881. The subsidy needed to
                 preserve a unit at an affordable rent for very low-income households would
                 be an estimated $230 per month, or $2,760 per year. For 30 years, the
                 subsidy would be about $82,800 for one household. Subsidizing all 134 units
                 at a very low-income rent for 30 years would cost an estimated $11.1 million.
                 A low-income family of four (at 60 percent AMI) could afford up to $869 per
                 month, and the fair market rent for a three-bedroom unit is $1,280. The
                 subsidy needed to preserve a unit at an affordable rent for lower-income
                 households would be an estimated $411 per month, or $4,932 per year. For

  30 years, the subsidy would be about $147,960 for one household.
  Subsidizing all 134 units at a low-income rent for 30 years would cost an
  estimated $19.8 million.
  Replacement
  The City also has the option of replacing converted units through the
  construction of a new affordable housing project. The cost of developing a
  new affordable housing project is typically much higher than acquiring and
  rehabilitating an existing project, due to development fees and the price of
  purchasing land.
  Arborpoint, one of the newest multifamily development in the city of Madera,
  cost about $17 million to build the 64-unit development, or $265,625 per unit.
  To replace all 134 units at risk, this would total approximately $35.6 million.
  Qualified Entities
  California Government Code Section 65863.10 requires that owners of
  Federally-assisted properties must provide notice of intent to convert their
  properties to market rate 12 months and six months prior to the expiration of
  their contract, opt-outs, or prepayment. The California First Right of Refusal
  Program allows these owners to accept a bona fide offer to purchase the
  property from one who does not intend to maintain required affordability and
  use restrictions (nonqualified entity), subject to the “First Right of Refusal”
  process. This process requires the owner to notify qualified entities (bidders
  who intend to maintain affordability and use restrictions) of the terms and
  conditions on the pending offer, and accept a bid from the qualified entity that
  is the same as that offered by the nonqualified bidder, unless the nonqualified
  entity agrees to maintain affordability and use restrictions. In addition, the
  owner must notify the State one year in advance of intention to remove the
  affordability of the units.

                  FUTURE HOUSING NEEDS
                  Under State housing element requirements, housing needs are defined in
                  three categories: existing needs, needs of special groups within the
                  community, and projected needs. Previous sections of this chapter have
                  identified existing needs and needs of special groups. This section focuses
                  on projected housing needs through 2024.
                  Madera's Share of 2014-2023 Regional Housing Needs
                  State law (Government Code Section 65583(a)) requires each jurisdiction in
                  California to demonstrate the availability of adequate sites with appropriate
                  zoning and development standards and with available public services and
                  facilities. Each jurisdiction must also provide policy and regulatory guidance
                  to accommodate a variety of housing types at a variety of income levels. This
                  section demonstrates that Madera has adequate sites to accommodate the
                  projected housing need for the 2014-2023 Regional Housing Needs
                  Assessment (RHNA), which covers a 10-year period of January 1, 2014, to
                  December 31, 2023.

                                 HOUSING ELEMENT                      CHAPTER 7
  The RHNA promotes the following housing objectives:
        Increase the housing supply and mix of housing types;
        Infill development;
        Housing socioeconomic equity;
        Protect environmental and agriculture resources;
        Efficient development patterns; and
        Improve jobs/housing relationships.
  The California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD)
  apportions statewide housing demand to each of the state’s regional
  governing bodies. This demand represents the number of additional units
  needed to accommodate the anticipated growth in the number of households.
  The allocation of projected housing demand is divided into four income
  categories:
        Very Low-Income – up to 50 percent of the median area income;
        Low-Income – 51 to 80 percent of the median area income;
        Moderate-Income – 81 to 120 percent of the median area income; and
        Above Moderate-Income – more than 120 percent of the median area
         income.
  Adjusting the allocation by income category allows for a balanced distribution
  of lower-income households between jurisdictions. Based on the
  requirements of AB 2634 (Statutes of 2006), each jurisdiction must also
  address the projected need of extremely low-income (ELI) households,
  defined as households earning less than 30 percent of the median income.
  The projected extremely low-income need can be assumed as 50 percent of
  the total need for very low-income households. The City of Madera must
  demonstrate it has or will make available adequate sites with appropriate
  zoning and development standards, as well as services and facilities to
  accommodate the RHNA. The residential sites inventory shows how the City
  will meet this requirement through adopted specific plans and other vacant
  land.

CHAPTER 7  HOUSING ELEMENT
                 For the 2014-2023 RHNA projection period, HCD assigned 12,895 units
                 (2,890 very low-income, 2,230 low-income, 2,310 moderate-income, and
                 5,465 above moderate-income) to all of Madera County. The Madera County

                 Agency for Madera County. However, because MCTC is not a council of
                 governments, the City of Madera’s RHNA is prepared by HCD.
                 Table H-40 shows the RHNA for Madera. The city’s share, as determined by
                 HCD, is 6,099 units, including 1,352 very low-income units, 1,056 low-income
                 units, 1,091 moderate-income units, and 2,600 above moderate-income units.
                 To calculate the projected housing needs for extremely low-income
                 households, the City assumed 50 percent of its very low-income regional
                 housing needs are extremely low-income households. As a result, of the
                 needed 1,352 very low-income units, Madera has a projected need of 676
                 extremely low-income units.

                 This section assesses the availability of land and services to meet the 2014-
                 2023 RHNA. This section includes an inventory of Madera’s available
                 residentially designated land, calculates the buildout potential of this land,
                 and reviews the adequacy of services to support future housing development.

  AVAILABLE LAND INVENTORY
  State law governing the preparation of housing elements emphasizes the
  importance of an adequate land supply by requiring that each housing
  element contain “an inventory of land suitable for residential development,
  including vacant sites and sites having potential for redevelopment, and an
  analysis of the relationship of zoning and public facilities and services to
  these sites” (Government Code Section 65583(a)(3)).
  The residential land inventory is required “to identify sites that can be
  developed for housing within the planning period and that are sufficient to
  provide for the jurisdiction’s share of the regional housing need for all income
  levels” (Government Code Section 65583.2(a)). The phrase “land suitable for
  residential development” includes vacant and underutilized sites zoned for
  residential use as well as vacant and underutilized sites zoned for
  nonresidential use that allow residential development. All parcels (or portions
  of parcels) in the vacant and underutilized sites inventory were reviewed by
  City staff and the Consultants to confirm vacancy status, ownership,
  adequacy of public utilities and services, possible environmental constraints
  (e.g., flood zones and steep slopes), and other possible constraints to
  development feasibility.
  To identify sites that can accommodate a local government’s share of the
  RHNA for lower-income households, housing elements must include an
  analysis that demonstrates the appropriate density to encourage and facilitate
  the development of housing for lower-income households. The statute
  (Government Code Section 65583.2(c)(3)) provides two options for
  demonstrating appropriate densities:
         Provide a detailed market-based analysis demonstrating how the
          adopted densities accommodate this need. The analysis shall include,
          but is not limited to, factors such as market demand, financial
          feasibility, or information based on development project experience
          within a zone or zones that provide housing for lower-income
          households.
         Use the “default density standards” that are “deemed appropriate” in
          State law to accommodate housing for lower-income households
          given the type of the jurisdiction. Madera is considered a “suburban

CHAPTER 7  HOUSING ELEMENT
                         jurisdiction” with a default density standard of 20 units per acre. HCD
                         is required to accept sites that allow for zoning at this density as
                         appropriate for accommodating a jurisdiction’s share of the regional
                         housing need for lower-income households.
                 Sites zoned PD (1500), PD (2000), and R3 have maximum densities of at
                 least 20 units per acre, deeming them appropriate for lower-income
                 households. The City of Madera also has a large number of sites zoned PD
                 (3000), which is described as appropriate for multifamily and mobile home
                 parks. The PD (3000) zone allows for up to 15 dwelling units per acre, which
                 is lower than HCD’s “default” density of 20 dwelling units per acre. However,
                 the City has found that developments in this zone are often affordable to
                 lower-income households. Because the City’s allowable density in the PD
                 (3000) zone is lower than the default density, an analysis of market
                 demand/trends, financial feasibility, and recent development experience in
                 the PD (3000) zone must be provided to demonstrate that lower-income
                 housing production is feasible in this zone.
                 Analysis of Density and Affordability
                 Recent Development Experience and Market Trends
                 The City experienced a dramatic slowdown in residential development activity
                 as a result of the economic recession and housing crisis in 2008. In 2005 the
                 City issued 133 multifamily building permits and by 2008 the number of
                 multifamily permits declined by 92 percent to 11 permits. However, recent
                 projects located in the PD (3000) zone demonstrate that a variety of housing
                 demands can be achieved. Arbor Point, constructed in 2012, is a deed-
                 restricted 65-unit development that is 13 units per acre. Valley Vista,
                 constructed in 1999, is a 60-unit affordable housing project also in the PD
                 3000 zone. At 15.3 units per acre, this development is deed-restricted.
                 Projects like this provide tangible proof that affordable housing projects are
                 appropriate in the PD (3000) zone.
                 According to City staff, there has not been great interest from affordable
                 housing developers to develop the high-density sites. The densities that
                 affordable housing developers seem to prefer is in the 12 to 14 units per acre
                 range. Clay McReynolds, the developer for the Valley Vista Apartments in
                 Madera, stated that when land costs are reasonably low (as is the case in
7-94 CITY OF MADERA GENERAL PLAN | ADOPTED DECEMBER 2, 2015

                                  HOUSING ELEMENT                         CHAPTER 7
  Madera), medium-density development (12 to 14 units per acre) is far more
  financially feasible to construct because higher-density housing costs more to
  build overall. He stated that higher densities are only feasible when high land
  costs force an increase in densities. Mr. McReynolds used an example
  project in Flagstaff, Arizona, where a project has received funding, but the
  City is demanding higher densities that would increase project costs. The
  project is currently in jeopardy of not being developed because of the
  insistence on higher densities. In this case, the requirement of higher-density
  housing can serve as a constraint on the development of affordable housing.
  Financial Feasibility
  In an effort to measure affordability at varying densities, the City compared
  the La Jolla Estates (7 units per acre), Valley Vista (15 units per acre), and
  Sherwood Family (20 units per acre). For these three developments,
  increasing density by 25 percent has an insignificant impact on the
  affordability of the housing units. With a 25 percent density increase, the
  average monthly mortgage drops from $650 to $636 for La Jolla Estates, and
  the required average monthly rent per units drops from $915 to $909 for
  Valley Vista and from $1,055 to $1,044 for Sherwood Family. This assumes
  that everything else remains equal. The minimal cost savings may not be
  recouped by the developer as the smaller units may be less marketable. They
  may also have less open space/community living space and/or parking.
  The Valley Vista development ended up costing over 13 percent less per unit
  than the Sherwood Family development even through Valley Vista was
  developed at a lower density. In addition, the monthly mortgage of $0.38 per
  square foot is much lower than the required average monthly rent per square
  foot of $0.91 for La Jolla and $0.99 for Sherwood Family. On a square foot
  basis, the construction and soft costs per square foot increase as the density
  increases.
  The Arbor Point project is the most recent example of a 100 percent
  affordable housing project in the PD 3000 zone. According to the developer
  of this project (Pacific Companies) and the City of Madera Housing Authority
  (co-partner in the project), 15 units per acre is the most ideal density in
  Madera to achieve economies of scale that allow developers to provide
  affordable housing units. This is largely due to the relatively lower cost of land
  in the area and the higher construction costs associated with building more
CITY OF MADERA GENERAL PLAN | ADOPTED DECEMBER 2, 2015                         7-95
CHAPTER 7  HOUSING ELEMENT
                 than two stories. The land costs are very low, often representing an estimated
                 5 percent of the total development cost. This means that development costs
                 are the primary factor for determining housing affordability, not land costs.
                 The allowed density in the PD (3000) zone best facilitates the development of
                 housing affordable to lower-income households.
                 According to the City and local developers, the price of raw land in Madera is
                 less expensive than overall construction costs, allowing developers to
                 construct multifamily housing with units affordable to lower-income
                 households. Three-story developments are permitted and encouraged by the
                 City but developers typically only build up to two stories at 80 percent (12
                 dwelling units per acre) of the maximum allowed density (15 dwelling units
                 per acre) due to the relatively low cost of land. In addition, a third story often
                 requires the installment of elevators, which add to the overall cost of the
                 development. In addition to the allowed density of housing developments in
                 the PD (3000) zone, flexible regulations of Planned Unit Developments (PUD)
                 encourage the development of affordable housing.
                 Another important consideration is the ability of the project to incorporate
                 amenities. As a smaller, more rural jurisdiction, Madera does not have the
                 available amenities that larger urban areas have. In order to offset this
                 deficiency, larger projects often incorporate amenities such as pools, open
                 space, outdoor play areas, barbeque pits, and tot lots into multifamily
                 developments. This is very difficult to do at densities higher than 15 units per
                 acre. A recent example of this is the Madera Family Apartments. The project,
                 built in PD 2000 at 22.5 units per acre, failed on two additional TCAC
                 applications and is struggling to get a second phase funded. At these high
                 residential densities, it is difficult to include open space and other amenities
                 that enhance livability. The PD 3000 zone better allows for enhancements
                 that make improve the quality of the project.
                 Summary of Market Analysis
                 The following bullets summarize the reasons why density is not a critical
                 factor in providing affordable housing in Madera and why the PD 3000 zone
                 is, at least in part, able to accommodate housing:
                         Land costs as a percentage of total development cost are very low for
                          medium- and high-density projects in Madera.
7-96 CITY OF MADERA GENERAL PLAN | ADOPTED DECEMBER 2, 2015

                                  HOUSING ELEMENT                         CHAPTER 7
         Increasing density by 25 percent has an insignificant impact on the
          cost of housing units in Madera.
         As density increases in Madera, the construction and soft costs per
          square foot increase.
         There have been very few requests for density bonuses from
          developers in the last decade.
         Affordable housing developers have expressed that they prefer
          projects in the 12 to 14 units per acre range. Medium-density
          multifamily development in districts like the PD 3000 zone is far more
          feasible to construct because higher-density construction costs more
          to build overall.
         Higher-density developments in Madera require a greater subsidy per
          unit than lower-density units. In the examples above, the single family
          home project, La Jolla Estates, was affordable to low-income
          households, while the multifamily development needed a considerable
          amount of subsidy to be affordable. Madera is providing
          homeownership opportunities for lower-income households with a
          lower per-unit subsidy than higher-density affordable housing projects.
         In some cases, the insistence of higher-density housing can serve as
          a constraint on the development of affordable housing.
         Multifamily projects in Madera typically include open space and other
          amenities that are difficult to incorporate into the project at densities
          higher than 15 units per ace.
  Inventory Assumptions
  Table H-41 provides a breakdown of the relationship between Madera’s
  zoning districts, appropriate income categories, and inventoried density. Sites
  that were larger than a half-acre and zoned PD (1500), PD (2000), and R3
  were inventoried as lower-income. Based on the analysis above, the PD
  (3000) zone is, at least in part, appropriate for accommodating lower-income
  housing. Sites zoned PD (3000) were conservatively inventoried as 50
  percent lower-income and 50 percent moderate-income. Sites zoned R2 and
  PD (4500) were inventoried as moderate-income. Regardless of zone, small
  sites (less than 0.5 acres) were conservatively inventoried as above-
CITY OF MADERA GENERAL PLAN | ADOPTED DECEMBER 2, 2015                       7-97

CHAPTER 7  HOUSING ELEMENT
                 moderate-income. All other sites were inventoried as above-moderate-
                 income. All sites were inventoried at 85 percent of the maximum density
                 based on recent development that has occurred in the city over the past
                 decade.
                 Flood concerns are the largest environmental constraint to housing in
                 Madera. The sites inventory documents whether or not each parcel lies
                 within, or partially, within the FEMA 100-year flood zone. If the site lies
                 entirely within the flood zone, no units were counted. If the site lies partially
                 within the flood zone, the inventory only counts the number of units that could
                 be accommodated outside the flood zone. The exception to this assumption
                 is the Ventura Specific Plan, which includes 1,444 units and lies almost
                 entirely within the 100-year flood zone. Since the Specific Plan addresses
                 flooding and other environmental constraints in the Specific Plan EIR, The
                 inventory includes all 1,444 units anticipated in the Specific Plan area.

  Rezone Program from 2007-2014 Housing Element
  While the City of Madera adopted a State-certified Housing Element for the
  2007-2014 cycle, it included a rezone program in order to meet the 2007-
  2014 RHNA. The rezone included sites that were identified in Action Item H-
  1.1.3 of the 2009 Housing Element as well as some additional sites that were
  designated for high density residential development in the 2009 General Plan
  Land Use Diagram. The City rezoned 34 sites, 20 of which were identified in
  Action Item H-1.1.3 and 13 that were rezoned independent of Action Item H-
  1.1.3. In total, the City rezoned 76 new acres to PD (1500) and 44 acres to
  PD (4500). This resulted in a net gain of 1,663 lower-income units and
  allowed the City to accommodate the 2007-2014 RHNA.
  Units Built
  Since the RHNA projection period runs from January 1, 2014, to December
  31, 2023, Madera’s RHNA can be reduced by the number of units built since
  January 1, 2014. Table H-42 shows units built since January 1, 2014 in
  Madera. There were 15 single family units built, all of which were inventoried
  as above-moderate income.

  Available Land Currently Planned for Residential Use
  Table H-43 summarizes the City of Madera’s ability to meet its RHNA for the
  2014-2023 projection period. Figure H-4 shows the locations of the sites
  summarized in Table H-43. The vacant land inventory identifies over 370
  sites (covering 872.6 acres) that are zoned for residential and considered
  vacant. The complete list of available sites to meet the City RHNA is included
  in Appendix H-A. The table in this appendix provides the Assessor’s Parcel
  Number (APN), acreage, zoning, General Plan designation, constraints,
  maximum capacity, and realistic capacity numbers. The Ventana Specific
  Plan, adopted in January 2007, is the largest site in the inventory. The Plan
  contains two parcels (047-014-005 and 047-014-007) and provides for nine
  neighborhoods. As shown in Table H-B-1, these neighborhoods include 42.7
  acres of PD (3000), 29.6 acres of PD (4500), and 149.7 acres of PD (6000)
  for a total of 1,444 units. After accounting for all vacant sites, the City of
  Madera has a RHNA surplus of 1,548 units.

  Adequacy of Public Facilities and Infrastructure
  Water
  The City’s water supply system consists of a network of interconnected sub-
  systems serving specific areas in accordance with City policy. Water is
  supplied by 18 water wells, all of which are located inside the city limits. Two
  or three wells are planned over the next two years to increase the city’s
  supply of water. The City also has a 1 million gallon elevated water storage
  tank. According to Danny Martin, Water/Sewer Operations Manager, the City
  has a current (June 2014) pumping capacity of 24,089 gallons per minute
  (gpm) and an average daily usage of 13 million gallons per day (mgd) during
  the summer and 5 mgd during the winter. With 13,407 water service
  connections the City is currently following Stage 3 water use regulations due
  to severe drought conditions in California. At this time the City does not
  foresee any critical water supply issues or problems and does not anticipate
  there will be any constraints within the Housing Element planning period
  (2016-2024) to accommodate the City’s current RHNA. The City has
  recognized the long term constraints to providing adequate infrastructure
  related to groundwater overdraft issues. The General Plan and corresponding
  EIR mitigate the groundwater issues associated with housing production
  beyond the planning period.
  Sewer
  The City of Madera’s Wastewater Treatment Plant is located at 13048 Road
  21½ in Madera and is a secondary treatment facility. Sewer collection
  pipelines in the City range between 8 and 42 inches. According to Dave
  Underwood of the City of Madera’s Wastewater Treatment Plant, the
  Wastewater Treatment Plant has a maximum design capacity of 10.1 million
  gallons per day (mgd). During wet weather periods where heavy rainfall
  occurs for an extended amount of time, the flow can increase significantly
  due to inflow and infiltration. The treatment facility has seen increases in flow
  of up to 1.0 million gallons per day during rainy periods. The City has taken
  measures to mitigate the inflow and has reduced it significantly. The current
  average flow the plant is receiving is 5.8 million gallons per day. Plant
  expansion was completed in March 2008. The plant should not exceed its
  design capacity for several years to come and is expected to accommodate
  the City’s current RHNA.

 CHAPTER 7  HOUSING ELEMENT
                  To comply with Senate Bill (SB) 1087, the City will immediately forward its
                  adopted Housing Element to its water and wastewater providers so they can
                  grant priority for service allocations to proposed developments that include
                  units affordable to lower-income households.
                  HOUSING PROGRAMS
                  Housing Authority
                  The Housing Authority is the primary provider of affordable housing in
                  Madera. The Housing Authority’s two main programs, Public Housing and
                  Housing Choice Vouchers (HCV), provide some housing opportunities for
                  extremely low-, very low-, low-, and moderate-income families and individuals
                  as well as housing for people with other special needs (e.g., senior citizens).
                  The demand for the Housing Authority’s programs and services is evidenced
                  by the program waiting lists.
                  As of December 2014 the Housing Authority of the City of Madera (HACM)
                  operates 244 Public Housing units. In addition HACM administers a total of
                  791 Housing Choice Vouchers (Section 8). There are currently (December
                  2014) 1,287 households on the waiting list for public housing and 1,106
                  households on the waiting list for the HCV program.
                  First Time Homebuyer (Down Payment Assistance Program)
                  The City of Madera promotes homeownership among first-time homebuyers
                  through a down payment assistance program for households making less
                  than 80 percent of the Madera County area median income. The program,
                  which is funded using HOME funds, is available to individuals or households
                  that have not owned a home within the past three years and the requirements
                  include finding a home within the city limits, contributing at least one month’s
                  worth of income toward the purchase price, completion of homeownership
                  classes, securing a good faith estimate or pre-approval letter for a loan within
                  30 days. The home may not exceed the Federal Housing Administration’s
                  mortgage limits (currently $271,050). Since 2010 a total of 20 households
                  have been helped through the City’s Downpayment Assistance Program
                  (excluding NSP3), of which two households were extremely low-income, nine
                  households were very low-income and eight were low-income. Only one
                  moderate-income household received assistance through the program.

  Owner-Occupied Rehabilitation Program
  The City’s Owner-Occupied Rehabilitation Program, funded by HOME funds,
  provides both zero-interest loans and grants to income eligible families whose
  homes are in need of repairs to ensure the health and safety of occupants.
  Zero-interest loans are provided to qualified homeowners whose annual
  gross incomes do not exceed 80 percent of the area median income for
  Madera. These loans are deferred, payable when there is a change in title to
  the property.
  Emergency repair grants are available to households earning up to 50
  percent of the area median income. To be eligible, an applicant’s property
  must be owner-occupied, within the city limits, and need rehabilitation to meet
  the Uniform Building Code or “safe, decent, and sanitary” standards. If within
  the 100-year floodplain, properties must meet flood insurance requirements.
  If an overcrowding problem is demonstrated, a room addition may be
  authorized. The City provides recipients with a Rehabilitation Construction
  Management Contractor to assist them in determining a priority list of
  rehabilitation needs and a plan to fit those needs within the funding available.
  Abandoned Real Property Registration
  The City recently (2008) adopted an ordinance that established a foreclosure
  monitoring program to prevent potential blight from abandoned properties in
  the city. The ordinance requires property owners to register their property if it
  is in any stage of the foreclosure process and is abandoned. Once a property
  enters into foreclosure, its owner or trustee must inspect it monthly and if it
  becomes vacant, they must register the property with the City’s
  Neighborhood Revitalization Coordinator within 10 days. This requirement
  remains in effect and an annual registration fee applies as long as the
  property is vacant. While the property is vacant, the owner or trustee must
  ensure the property is maintained and secure and must post a 24-hour
  contact information for people to call to report any problems at the property. If
  maintenance and security requirements are not met, a fine of $1,000 per day
  will be issued. The money collected from fine payments helps pay for the
  administration of the program. Neighborhood revitalization staff monitor
  properties in the city on a proactive basis as part of this program.
CITY OF MADERA GENERAL PLAN | ADOPTED DECEMBER 2, 2015                       7-107

 CHAPTER 7  HOUSING ELEMENT
                  As of December 31, 2014, there were 41 abandoned vacant units and a
                  combined 244 REO/Abandoned REO properties in the city of Madera based
                  on City records.
                  Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP)
                  The City, in collaboration with the County of Madera, administers the
                  Neighborhood Stabilization Program 3 (NSP3). NSP3 is limited to the HUD
                  target area, which is the Parkwood subdivision area in southern Madera. The
                  loans are provided in the form of deferred payment “silent” second priority
                  loans as “gap” financing toward the purchase price and closing costs of
                  affordable housing units. While the HOME funded loans are available to
                  households with low incomes (up to 80 percent of AMI), the NSP-funded
                  loans may be awarded to moderate-income households earning up to 120
                  percent of AMI. NSP-funded loans may not be granted for homes built prior to
                  1978.
                  ENERGY CONSERVATION OPPORTUNITIES
                  State Housing Element law requires an analysis of the opportunities for
                  energy conservation in residential development. Energy efficiency has direct
                  application to affordable housing because the more money spent on energy,
                  the less available for rent or mortgage payments. High energy costs have
                  particularly detrimental effects on low-income households that do not have
                  enough income or cash reserves to absorb cost increases and many times
                  must choose between basic needs such as shelter, food, and energy.
                  Volatile energy markets have led to renewed widespread interest in energy
                  conservation approaches. Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) provides gas and
                  electricity services in the city of Madera. PG&E offers incentives to help
                  consumers save energy and money through a variety of rebate programs and
                  by providing energy-saving tips and educational materials to its consumers.
                  All new buildings in California must meet the standards contained in Title 24,
                  Part 6 of the California Code of Regulations (Energy Efficiency Standards for
                  Residential and Nonresidential Buildings). Energy-efficiency requirements are
                  enforced by local governments through the building permit process. All new
                  construction must comply with the standards in effect on the date a building
                  permit application is made.

                                   HOUSING ELEMENT                          CHAPTER 7
  In 2010 the State of California Building Standards Commission published and
  mandated CALGreen. The 2013 California Green Building Standards Code
  (“CALGreen”) became effective throughout the state on January 1, 2014.
  CALGreen creates uniform regulations for new residential and non-residential
  California buildings that are intended to reduce construction waste, make
  buildings more efficient in the use of materials and energy, and reduce
  environmental impacts during and after construction.
  Residential buildings subject to CALGreen include multifamily residences and
  one-and two-family dwellings that have three or fewer stories.
  The California Subdivision Map Act (Government Code Sections 66473-
  66498) allows local governments to provide for solar access as follows:
  Section 66475.3: For divisions of land for which a tentative map is required
  pursuant to Section 66426, the legislative body of a city or county may by
  ordinance require, as a condition of the approval of a tentative map, the
  dedication of easements for the purpose of assuring that each parcel or unit
  in the subdivision for which approval is sought shall have the right to receive
  sunlight across adjacent parcels or units in the subdivision for which approval
  is sought for any solar energy system, provided that such ordinance contains
  all of the following:
  1) Specifies the standards for determining the exact dimensions and
       locations of such easements.
  2) Specifies any restrictions on vegetation, buildings, and other objects
       which would obstruct the passage of sunlight through the easement.
  3) Specifies the terms or conditions, if any, under which an easement may
       be revised or terminated.
  4) Specifies that in establishing such easements consideration shall be
       given to feasibility, contour, configuration of the parcel to be divided, and
       cost, and that such easements shall not result in reducing allowable
       densities or the percentage of a lot which may be occupied by a building
       or a structure under applicable planning and zoning in force at the time
       such tentative map is filed.

                  5) Specifies that the ordinance is not applicable to condominium projects
                      which consist of the subdivision of airspace in an existing building where
                      no new structures are added.
                  The City has adopted the uniform solar energy codes introduced by the
                  International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials. However, the
                  number of installations of solar panels within the community has not been as
                  great as expected. This is due to certain factors. The initial cost of installation
                  of a solar unit is beyond the limits of many families within the community.
                  Furthermore, the prevalence of the fog during winter months reduces the
                  effectiveness of the solar unit. The City and PG&E play a role in
                  implementation of various other energy conservation measures.
                  The City is currently (2015) in the process of creating a Climate Action Plan
                  to identify the sources and amounts of greenhouse gas emissions in the
                  community and develop strategies to reduce them in the future.

  POTENTIAL HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
  The provision of adequate and affordable housing can be constrained by a
  number of factors. This section assesses the various governmental and
  market factors that may serve as potential constraints to housing
  development and improvement in Madera.
  POTENTIAL GOVERNMENT CONSTRAINTS
  Local governments have little or no influence upon the national economy or
  the Federal monetary policies which influence it. Yet these two factors most
  significantly impact the overall cost of housing. The local housing market,
  however, can be encouraged and assisted locally. One purpose of the
  Housing Element is to review and evaluate local conditions and regulations
  that may impact the housing market, and identify actions the City can take to
  that protect the public’s health and safety without unduly adding to the cost of
  housing production.
  Governmental constraints are those imposed by the government which either
  limit the number of housing units to be built or increase the costs of those
  units which are built. Constraints increase costs by either adding direct
  specific expenses, such as street improvements or development fees, to the
  cost of a housing unit or by increasing the time necessary to build the unit,
  thereby increasing the builder’s incidental costs such as interest payments or
  labor costs. All costs are ultimately passed on to the occupant of the housing
  unit either in higher mortgage payments or rent.
  General Plan Designations and Zoning
  As shown in Table H-44 below, the General Plan land use designations that
  allow residential development include four residential designations that permit
  a range of residential development types. The City of Madera General Plan
  allows a range of single family and multifamily residential uses up to 50 units
  per acre. The residential densities allowed by the City of Madera General
  Plan are not an impediment to affordable housing.

                            The City is tasked with allowing for the development of an array of housing
                            types that are suitable for all economic segments of the community. The
                            Housing Element must describe how the City’s Municipal Code allows for
                            different types of housing to meet the needs of its residents. Housing types
                            include single family dwellings, duplexes, guest dwellings, mobile homes,
                            group residential homes, multifamily dwellings, convalescent homes,
                            accessory structures, supportive housing, and single-room occupancy units.
                            Tables H-45 and H-46 below summarize the housing types permitted by right
                            and those that require a use permit under the City Municipal Code.

 CHAPTER 7      HOUSING ELEMENT
                          As shown in Table H-45 below, there are 11 residential zoning districts and
                          four commercial zoning districts that allow residential development in the city
                          of Madera. The table shows the residential uses permitted in each district, as
                          well as the minimum lot sizes for each district. Secondary dwelling units are
                          permitted on any lot over 6,000 square feet where one single family detached
                          dwelling is permitted and exists. Manufactured housing is also allowed in
                          these zoning districts with a zoning administrator permit.
                          The Planned Development Zones are intended to provide maximum design
                          flexibility (within the density restrictions) for residential subdivisions. In the P-
                          D zone, special residential developments such as clustering and density
                          transfers are encouraged and unique zoning standards may be considered,
                          such as zero side yard and common-wall developments. All developments in
                          the P-D zone require the approval of a precise plan by the Planning
                          Commission.

1Special  residential developments such as clustering and density transfers are encouraged, and variations from normal
zoning standards may be considered, such as zero side yard and common wall developments. Through the Planned
Development process, special residential design standards may be established which regulate the subdivision rather than
the typical residential standards of the Municipal Code.

                              the residential uses that are permitted by administrative approval (P)
                              (requiring no application), permitted through Zoning Administrator approval
                              (ZA), or permitted via conditional use permit (CUP) approved by the City of
                              Madera Planning Commission. In all cases, the residential district for which a
                              use is requested must provide the minimum required square footage for the
                              use to be considered. The conditions of the use permit are specific to each
                              use. Generally, the conditions are designed to make the housing for the
                              requested use and the surrounding uses compatible. The use permit process
                              provides an opportunity for the proponents of the use to have a dialogue with
                              the neighbors and meet their reasonable concerns or remove the concerns

                                          Provision for a Variety of Housing Types
                                          State Law (Government Code Section 65583(c)(a)) requires that local land
                                          use regulations accommodate a range of housing types, as well as facilities
                                          for people in need of emergency shelter and transitional housing. The
                                          following is a brief analysis of the availability of land for other types of
                                          housing.
                                          Multifamily Housing
                                          Multifamily housing includes duplexes, apartments, condominiums, or
                                          townhomes, and can be an important source of affordable housing.
                                          Multifamily housing is permitted by right in the R2 and R3 zones, with Zoning
                                          Administrator Approval in C-1 and C-2, and with a CUP in the I zone.
                                       CITY OF MADERA GENERAL PLAN | ADOPTED DECEMBER 2, 2015                                    7-117
 CHAPTER 7  HOUSING ELEMENT
                  Multifamily housing is also permitted with a site plan review in PD 1500, PD
                  2000, and PD 3000.
                  Secondary Dwelling Units
                  One type of housing appropriate for lower-income persons is second dwelling
                  units. "Second unit" means an attached or a detached residential dwelling
                  unit that provides complete independent living facilities for one or more
                  persons. It includes permanent provisions for living, sleeping, eating, cooking,
                  and sanitation on the same parcel as the primary single family dwelling. A
                  second unit also includes attached or detached efficiency units, or
                  manufactured homes, as defined in Sections 17958.1 and 18007 of the
                  Health and Safety Code.
                  State law requires localities to permit second units ministerially without
                  discretionary review or hearings in zones allowing single family units. To be
                  considered a ministerial review, the process used to approve second units
                  must “apply predictable, objective, fixed, quantifiable, and clear standards.”
                  Applications for second units should not be subject to onerous conditions of
                  approval or public hearing process or public comment.
                  The second unit law established maximum standards for second units on lots
                  zoned for residential use that contain existing single family dwellings. No
                  other standards can be applied to the approval of second units than those
                  listed in Section 95852.2(b) of the Government Code, except the City may
                  require that the primary structure be owner-occupied. The City may apply the
                  following standards:
                          The unit is not intended for sale and may be rented;
                          The lot is zoned for single family or multifamily use;
                          The lot contains an existing single family dwelling;
                          The second unit is either attached to the existing dwelling and located
                           within the living area of the existing dwelling or detached from the
                           existing dwelling and located on the same lot as the existing dwelling;
                          The increased floor area of an attached second unit shall not exceed
                           30 percent of the existing living area;

           system is being used, if required.
  According to the City’s Municipal Code, detached dwellings without kitchen
  facilities are permitted in all residential zones. Second dwelling units with
  kitchen facilities are permitted on any lot over 6,000 square feet where one
  single family detached dwelling is permitted and exists with a minor site plan
  review subject to the following standards:
          One secondary dwelling unit is allowed on a parcel 6,000 square feet
           or greater containing a single-family dwelling.
          Secondary dwelling units are not allowed on lots with two or more
           dwellings.
          Any applicant seeking approval for a secondary dwelling unit shall be
           both the owner and current resident of the property for which a
           secondary dwelling unit is proposed. An exception to the occupancy
           requirement is allowed where a secondary dwelling unit is to be
           constructed concurrent with the principal dwelling, and the owner will
           reside on the property upon completion of construction.
          Secondary dwelling units may be contained as an addition to the
           principal dwelling or as a detached building.
          Any illegal building additions or accessory structures on the parcel
           shall be brought into compliance with the City Code prior to approval
           of the secondary dwelling unit.

 CHAPTER 7  HOUSING ELEMENT
                      Either the primary or secondary unit may be for rental purposes and
                       neither unit may be sold separately. At no time shall both units be
                       rented.
                      The design shall be architecturally consistent with the principal
                       dwelling including form, exterior siding, trim and color, roof materials,
                       and window placement and type. It shall also be compatible with the
                       height, mass, and general design of buildings in the immediate vicinity
                       of the site;
                      The entrance to the secondary dwelling unit shall not be located on
                       the same building elevation as the entrance to the principal dwelling.
                       The secondary dwelling unit entry shall be clearly subordinate to that
                       of the principal dwelling. The appearance of a duplex shall be
                       avoided;
                      Exterior stairways, secondary dwelling floor entries, or balconies for
                       secondary dwelling units shall only be allowed where privacy impacts
                       on adjacent lots are insignificant, as determined by the Planning
                       Director;
                      The minimum landscaped open space requirements for the applicable
                       zone shall not be reduced as a result of any secondary dwelling unit.
                      The increased floor area of an attached secondary unit shall not
                       exceed 30 percent of the existing living area. The total area of floor
                       space for a detached secondary unit shall not exceed 1,200 square
                       feet.
                      An additional 500 square feet of useable open space shall be required
                       for the secondary unit, bringing the total open space requirement for
                       both the primary residence and the secondary unit to 1,500 square
                       feet.
                      Utilities:
                               1) All detached secondary residential units shall have
                                completely separate utilities, such as sewer, water, gas, and
                                refuse collection.

                 2) All utilities shall be adequate to serve both residential
                  units. This shall be based on an evaluation by the Community
                  Development Director/City Engineer of the existing level of
                  development in the neighborhood, and the potential for
                  increased density related to the existing capacity in the utilities
                  serving the neighborhood.
                 3) Secondary units shall not be located over underground
                  utilities serving the primary unit.
         Secondary units shall be provided with at least one covered parking
          space, in addition to parking required for the existing residence.
         Development impact fees to be charged shall be based on the
          multifamily rate.
         The application for a permit processed under the provisions of this
          section shall be limited to owner-occupants.
         In addition to the on-site parking required for the primary dwelling unit,
          one additional covered parking space shall be provided as an integral
          element of the secondary dwelling unit.
  The secondary unit ordinance was passed in 2003. The City will update the
  Zoning Ordinance to allow second units in all residential zones to comply with
  AB 1866. In addition, the City will omit the condition that precludes second
  unit development of lots less than 6,000 square feet. This requirement serves
  as a potential constraint to the development of secondary dwelling units in
  residential zones outside of the R-1 zone, which conflicts with the second unit
  law.
  Manufactured Housing
  Manufactured housing can provide quality housing at a reasonable price. The
  recent trend in State legislation has been to encourage homeowners to place
  and finance manufactured homes on single family lots. As a result, mobile
  homes as well as factory-built housing may now be taxed as real estate and
  may be set on permanent foundations, in common with conventional site-built
  housing.
CITY OF MADERA GENERAL PLAN | ADOPTED DECEMBER 2, 2015                        7-121

 CHAPTER 7  HOUSING ELEMENT
                  California SB 1960 (1981) prohibited local jurisdictions from excluding
                  manufactured homes from all lots zoned for single family dwellings; in other
                  words, limiting the location of these homes to mobile home parks is
                  forbidden. However, SB 1960 does allow the local jurisdiction to designate
                  certain single family lots for manufactured homes based on compatibility for
                  this type of use.
                  The City of Madera Zoning Ordinance permits manufactured housing in most
                  residential zones upon approval by the Zoning Administrator. Whle the
                  Zoning Ordinance treats manufactured housing no differently than single
                  family dwelling in other zones when it comes to locational requirements, it
                  does require a Zoning Administrator approval, which is not a requirement for
                  stick-built single family dwellings. This is inconsistent with State law and
                  could be a constraint to manufactured housing. As part of the Housing
                  Element, the City has included a program to remove the Zoning Administrator
                  approval requirement for manufactured housing and to treat manufactured
                  housing no differently from other single family dwellings.
                  Emergency Shelters
                  In effect since January 1, 2008, Senate Bill (SB) 2 (Cedillo, 2007) requires
                  the City to allow emergency shelters without any discretionary action in at
                  least one zone that is appropriate for permanent emergency shelters (i.e.,
                  with commercial uses compatible with residential or light industrial zones in
                  transition), regardless of its demonstrated need. The goal of SB 2 was to
                  ensure that local governments are sharing the responsibility of providing
                  opportunities for the development of emergency shelters. To that end, the
                  legislation also requires that the City demonstrate site capacity in the zone
                  identified to be appropriate for the development of emergency shelters.
                  Within the identified zone, only objective development and management
                  standards may be applied, given they are designed to encourage and
                  facilitate the development of or conversion to an emergency shelter. Those
                  standards may include:
                      1) The maximum number of beds or persons permitted to be served
                           nightly by the facility;
7-122 CITY OF MADERA GENERAL PLAN | ADOPTED DECEMBER 2, 2015
                                  HOUSING ELEMENT                        CHAPTER 7
      2) Off-street parking based upon demonstrated need, provided that the
          standards do not require more parking for emergency shelters than for
          other residential or commercial uses within the same zone;
      3) The size and location of exterior and interior on-site waiting and client
          intake areas;
      4) The provision of on-site management;
      5) The proximity to other emergency shelters provided that emergency
          shelters are not required to be more than 300 feet apart;
      6) The length of stay;
      7) Lighting; and
      8) Security during hours that the emergency shelter is in operation.
  The City is currently (2015) updating its Zoning Ordinance to comply with
  State law. The City Council is scheduled to adopt the revised Zoning
  Ordinance at their regularly scheduled May 20, 2015 meeting.
  The City has identified the C-2 (Heavy Commercial) zone as an appropriate
  zone for emergency shelters because it is close to transportation corridors
  and it permits a variety of retail and other services that are permitted in the
  Light Commercial (C-1) district, such as barber services, banks, drug stores,
  food store, offices, restaurants, laundromats, and a variety of others uses. In
  addition, the development standards for the C-2 district facilitates the
  development of an emergency shelter as there are no setbacks or yard
  requirements unless it abuts a residential area; there is a very low minimum
  lot size requirement (2,000 square feet); and the district allows building
  heights of up to 65 feet by right.
  The City analyzed vacant land zoned C-2 in the city and found the following
  potential sites for emergency shelters. There is a total of 212.7 vacant acres
  of C-2 land in the city.

                                   HOUSING ELEMENT                       CHAPTER 7
  The City has set forth six criteria for the administrative review of emergency
  shelters. Each provision is set to ensure consistency with local ordinances
  and State health and safety standards and is compliant with the requirements
  of SB 2.
  A) Facility compliance with applicable state and local standards and
  requirements.
      (1) Federal, State, and local licensing as required for any program
      incidental to the emergency shelter.
  (B) Physical Characteristics.
      (1) Compliance with applicable State and local uniform housing and
      building code requirements.
      (2) The facility shall have on-site security during all hours when the
      shelter is open.
      (3)Facilities shall provide exterior lighting on pedestrian pathways and
      parking lot areas on the property. Lighting shall reflect away from
      residential areas and public streets.
      (4)Facilities shall provide secure areas for personal property.
  (C) Limited Number of Beds per Facility. Emergency shelters shall not
  exceed 50 beds.
  (D) Limited Terms of Stay. The maximum term of staying at an emergency
  shelter is 6 months in a consecutive 12-month period.
  (E) Parking. The emergency shelter shall provide on-site parking at a rate of
  2 spaces per facility for staff plus 1 space per 6 occupants allowed at the
  maximum capacity.
  (F) Emergency Shelter Management. A management plan is required for all
  emergency shelters to address management experience, good neighbor
  issues, transportation, client supervision, client services, and food services.
  Such plan shall be submitted to and approved by the planning, inspections,
  and permitting department prior to operation of the emergency shelter. The
  plan shall include a floor plan that demonstrates compliance with the physical

 CHAPTER 7  HOUSING ELEMENT
                  standards of this chapter. The operator of each emergency shelter shall
                  annually submit the management plan to the planning, inspections and
                  permitting department with updated information for review and approval. The
                  city council may establish a fee by resolution, to cover the administrative cost
                  of review of the required management plan.
                  Transitional and Supportive Housing
                  “Transitional housing” is defined as buildings configured as rental housing
                  developments, but operated under program requirements that require the
                  termination of assistance and recirculating of the assisted unit to another
                  eligible program recipient at a predetermined future point in time that shall be
                  no less than six months from the beginning of the assistance. They may be
                  designated for a homeless individual or family transitioning to permanent
                  housing. This housing can take many structural forms such as group housing
                  and multifamily units and may include supportive services to allow individuals
                  to gain necessary life skills in support of independent living.
                  “Supportive housing” is defined as housing with no limit on length of stay, that
                  is occupied by the target population and that is linked to onsite or offsite
                  services that assist the supportive housing resident in retaining the housing,
                  improving his or her health status, and maximizing his or her ability to live
                  and, when possible, work in the community. SB 2 requires that transitional
                  and supportive housing types be treated as residential uses and subject only
                  to those restrictions that apply to other residential uses of the same type in
                  the same zone. Both transitional and supportive housing types must be
                  explicitly permitted in the municipal code.
                  The City is currently (2015) in the process of updating the Zoning Ordinance
                  to include definitions of both transitional and supportive housing to comply
                  with State law. The definitions emphasize that transitional and supportive
                  housing are allowed in all zones allowing residential uses (including non-
                  residential zones allowing residential uses) subject to the same restrictions
                  and requirements that apply to other residential uses of the same type in the
                  same zone. The Madera City Council is expected to adopt the revised Zoning
                  Ordinance at their regularly scheduled May 20, 2015 meeting.

  Group Homes
  Currently (2014), the Madera Zoning Ordinance allows group homes and
  other related facilities (six or fewer persons) in residential zones upon
  administrative approval. Administrative approval does not require any kind of
  application or staff review. Group homes that provide housing for more than
  six persons are allowed in residential zones upon obtaining a conditional use
  permit from the Planning Commission. These facilities are also allowed with a
  use permit in the Light Commercial (C-1) and Heavy Commercial (C-2)
  zones. Group homes are not permitted in any other zones.
  Farmworker Housing
  In Madera, permanent rental housing affordable to low- and very low-income
  households is the main type of housing for permanent farmworkers.
  Locations identified for multifamily residential would provide sites for this
  group. Most housing specifically for farmworkers exists in the unincorporated
  county.
  The Housing Authority of the City of Madera is responsible for providing
  assisted rental housing through its public housing farmworker rental units.
  The Housing Authority owns 100 rural development units of farm labor
  housing located in three different sites. Residency is restricted to farm labor
  families that are U.S. citizens or have residency. The farmworker sites
  operated by HACM are: the 28 units at 1110 Kennedy Street, 28 units at 800
  Lilly Drive, and 44 units at 337 Knox Drive.
  The provisions of Section 17020 (et seq.) of the California Health and Safety
  Code (Employee Housing Act) relating to employee housing and labor camps
  supersede any ordinance or regulations enacted by local governments. Such
  housing is allowed in all jurisdictions in California pursuant to the regulations
  set forth in Section 17020.
  The Employee Housing Act requires jurisdictions to permit employee housing
  for six or fewer employees as a single family use. Employee housing shall not
  be included within the zoning definition of a boarding house, rooming house,
  hotel, dormitory, or other similar term that implies that the employee housing
  is a business run for profit or differs in any other way from a family dwelling.
  Jurisdictions cannot impose a conditional use permit, zoning variance, or
CITY OF MADERA GENERAL PLAN | ADOPTED DECEMBER 2, 2015                       7-127
 CHAPTER 7  HOUSING ELEMENT
                  other zoning clearance of employee housing that serves six or fewer
                  employees that are not required of a family dwelling of the same type in the
                  same zone. In addition, in any zone where agriculture is a permitted or
                  conditional use, employee housing containing up to 36 beds and 12 units
                  must be a permitted or conditional use, as applicable.
                  The Madera Zoning Ordinance does not differentiate farm employee housing
                  and single family homes, and therefore is not in conflict with the Employee
                  Housing Act. However, the City’s Zoning Ordinance does not permit
                  employee housing in zones where agriculture is a permitted or conditional
                  use.
                  Single Room Occupancy
                  Single Room Occupancy (SRO) residences are small, one-room units
                  occupied by a single individual, and may either have a shared or private
                  kitchen and bathroom facilities. SROs are rented on a monthly basis typically
                  without a rental deposit, and can provide an entry point into the housing
                  market for extremely low-income individuals, formerly homeless, and disabled
                  persons.
                  The City is currently (2015) in the process of updating its Zoning Ordinance to
                  add a definition of SROs:
                        A structure that provides living units that have separate sleeping areas
                        and some combination of shared bath or toilet facilities. The structure
                        may or may not have separate or shared cooking facilities for the
                        residents. SRO includes structures commonly called residential hotels
                        and rooming houses.
                  Housing for Persons with Disabilities
                  As part of a governmental constraints analysis, Housing Element law requires
                  each jurisdiction to analyze potential governmental constraints to the
                  development, improvement, and maintenance of housing for persons with
                  disabilities, demonstrate local efforts to remove any such constraints, and
                  provide for reasonable accommodations for persons with disabilities through
                  programs that remove constraints.

                                   HOUSING ELEMENT                        CHAPTER 7
  The City provides for a variety of housing intended to care for the special
  needs of the disabled. Group home housing types that house six or fewer
  people are allowed by right in all residential zones and those that house more
  than seven persons are permitted with a conditional use permit in the R-1, R-
  2 and R-3 zones. There are no restrictions on the location of any group care
  homes in the city and there are no special conditions specifically for larger
  group homes. Even though a conditional use permit is required, the same
  public notices are posted as other use permits. Additionally, the City has
  occupancy standards for unrelated persons with a family definition as follows:
  “one or more persons living as a single housekeeping unit in a dwelling unit,
  including necessary domestic servants”. (Note: the City is in the process of
  preparing a comprehensive Zoning Code update that would amend this
  definition of “family” to remove reference to domestic servants. )
  Both the current (2015) and proposed draft definition of family are vague and
  do not prevent unrelated individuals from sharing the same home. It does not
  reference any requirement for a type of relationship or limit the occupancy to
  a certain number of persons.
  Other potential constraints on housing for persons with disabilities are not
  present in the city including: the City continually monitors its zoning laws,
  policies and practices for compliance with fair housing law and will continue
  to maintain compliance. The City allows reductions in parking requirements
  for developments that contain special needs housing. The City has adopted
  the 2007/2008 Uniform Building Code and has not added any local
  provisions. While it has considered universal design elements, the City has
  not adopted these into its code.
  If a person with a disability wants to request housing retrofit for accessibility,
  they must apply for a building permit. There is an active ADA advisory
  committee created to advise the City Council on issues related to the needs
  of individuals with disabilities. The City is currently (2015) in the process of
  revising the Zoning Ordinance to adopt a formal reasonable accommodation
  procedure. The Madera City Council is expected to adopt the revised Zoning
  Ordinance at their regularly schedule May 20, 2015 meeting.
  A request for reasonable accommodation must be submitted to the Director
  of the Community Development Department. The Director or his/her designee
  must make a determination within 45 days.

 CHAPTER 7  HOUSING ELEMENT
                  Although the City does not have any local building requirements for disabled
                  persons’ accessibility, the City does follow California’s accessibility laws,
                  which require the following for multifamily residential developments:
                         Multifamily developments containing 4-20 units only require that all of
                          their ground floor units are adaptable (interior modifications) and meet
                          accessibility requirements.
                         Multifamily developments containing greater than 20 units require that
                          2 percent of the total units are adaptable and the remainder of the
                          units is accessible.
                         Single family residential developments are exempt from accessibility
                          requirements, but accessibility features for a single family home may
                          be added at the request of a homeowner.
                  Parking Requirements
                  The City requires 1.5 parking spaces for each one-bedroom single family unit
                  and two spaces for single family units containing more than one bedroom. In
                  each instance, one space per unit must be covered. In addition to the parking
                  spaces required for single family units, all projects with six or more units are
                  required to provide off-street parking for visitors. For these units, one space
                  for the first four units and one space for each four units thereafter is required.
                  For secondary dwelling units, each unit shall be provided with at least one
                  covered parking space, in addition to the parking required for the main
                  residence.
                  For senior citizen housing projects, one covered parking space for each unit
                  is required. In addition, one guest parking space is required to be provided at
                  the rate of one space for every four units. Furthermore, employee parking is
                  required to be provided at a rate of one space for every two employees, and
                  parking for a manager’s quarters is required at the standard residential rate.
                  Density Bonus
                  State law (California Government Code Section 65915) requires local
                  governments to grant a density bonus and/or financially equivalent incentives
                  to developers who agree to provide a specified percentage of affordable
                  housing, senior citizen housing, or child care facilities for lower-income

                                  HOUSING ELEMENT                            CHAPTER 7
  families as part of a residential development. The amount of bonus units or
  incentives depends on the percentage of affordable housing units provided.
  In 2004 Senate Bill (SB) 1818 altered density bonus provisions throughout
  the state. Effective January 1, 2005, SB 1818 increased the maximum bonus
  from 25 to 35 percent and changed the eligibility thresholds for projects. It
  also required localities to grant additional incentives and allowed bonuses for
  land donation. Under the new density bonus law, there are provisions for
  projects that include affordable housing (to low- and very low-income), senior
  housing, donations of land, condominium conversions, and child care
  facilities. The law also allows for concessions and incentives, waivers and
  reductions, or reduced parking requirements. A developer may apply for one
  to three concessions or incentives on a sliding scale depending on how many
  affordable units are proposed. Concessions include reduction in site
  development standards and modifications of zoning and architectural design
  requirements, mixed-use zoning, or other regulatory incentives or
  concessions. In addition, a developer may ask for waivers of any number of
  development standards if they can demonstrate the waiver is needed to make
  the project economically feasible. A reduction in parking requirements is also
  allowed for senior projects or developments that provide affordable units.
  The City is currently (2015) in the process of updating its Zoning Ordinance to
  comply with State law. The Madera City Council is expected to adopt the
  revised Zoning Ordinance at their regularly schedule May 20, 2015 meeting.
  Growth Control/Growth Management
  The 2009 General Plan Land Use element includes growth management
  policies. Specifically, the City will support new annexation only when it
  determines that there is sufficient public infrastructure, facilities, and services.
CITY OF MADERA GENERAL PLAN | ADOPTED DECEMBER 2, 2015                           7-131
 CHAPTER 7  HOUSING ELEMENT
                  Open Space Requirements
                  Land use controls that can impact the ability to provide affordable housing
                  include open space and off-street parking requirements. Because these on-
                  site improvements are land-intensive, they increase the cost of land
                  development by reducing the unit density while adding landscaping and
                  parking area development costs. Open space standards are typically
                  determined by surveying similar communities and what the local experience
                  has indicated is appropriate.
                  Open space standards do not exceed those used in other cities of
                  comparable size. In Madera, these standards reflect a strong community
                  value in open space and the role it plays in the overall quality of life of the
                  city’s residents. The standard for conventional single family residential lot-by-
                  lot development is 60 percent open space (or 40 percent coverage). This
                  requirement is inclusive of driveways, uncovered patios and swimming pools,
                  or other hardscape intended for outdoor use. In considering a minimum 4,500
                  square foot lot, the site coverage would need to be in excess of 1,800 square
                  feet to exceed this standard. Planned development procedures provide for
                  the clustering of residential units and the concentration of open space for
                  common use. For each residential unit in a planned residential development
                  there must be a minimum 750 square feet of open space exclusive of
                  driveways and off-street parking areas. Indeed, the City has consistently
                  encouraged this type of development as one method of providing different
                  housing types at more affordable levels.
                  The minimum useable open space for each residential zone is shown in
                  Table H-48.

    Note: an additional 500 square feet of useable open space is required for a secondary unit
    bringing the total open space requirement for both the primary residence and the secondary
    unit to 1,500 square feet..
    Source: City of Madera Zoning Ordinance, 2014.
  In addition to the minimum open space requirements above, the City requires
  that buildings located on a lot in an R-1 zone shall not exceed a cumulative
  floor area of 1,400 square feet plus 20 percent of the site area on which those
  buildings are located.
  For apartment projects containing 50 or more units, one or more amenities
  are required such as a community room, storage facility, basketball court,
  swimming pool, tennis court, putting green, lawn bowling, tot lot, or outdoor
  cooking facilities or barbecues.
  Building Codes and Enforcement
  Building standards are essential to ensure safe housing, although some
  codes and standards may constrain the development or preservation of
  affordable housing. The City of Madera has adopted the 2007 California
  Building Code.
  Building codes and their enforcement can increase the cost of housing and
  impact the feasibility of rehabilitating older properties that must be upgraded
  to current code standards. In this manner, building codes and their
  enforcement could potentially act as a constraint on the amount of housing
  and its affordability. The City operates a code enforcement program
  employing seven full-time and three part-time Code Enforcement Officers.
CITY OF MADERA GENERAL PLAN | ADOPTED DECEMBER 2, 2015                                  7-133
 CHAPTER 7  HOUSING ELEMENT
                  Enforcement involves ensuring that development within the city conforms to
                  the standards contained in the Madera Municipal Code.
                  However, the codes enforced by Madera are similar to the codes enforced by
                  most other cities in the region and are necessary to promote the minimum
                  standards of safety and accessibility to housing. The codes are not
                  considered to be an undue constraint on housing investment. The code
                  enforcement process is initiated both by resident complaints and through the
                  observation of code violations by enforcement staff.
                  On-/Off-Site Improvement Requirements
                  The City requires that developers complete certain site improvements in
                  conjunction with new housing development. The following are required
                  improvements for residential subdivisions with five or more parcels according
                  to City Standard Specifications:
                         Storm drainage system;
                         Sanitary sewer system and domestic water system including water
                          meters;
                         Electric, telephone, and cable facilities; and
                         Street infrastructure including curb and gutters, sidewalks, streetlights,
                          and fire hydrants.
                  On-site improvements vary with the type of project proposed. The
                  improvements are guided by City Code and Standard Specifications. The
                  right-of-way improvements can be a major cost of development; but they are
                  essential to orderly development, the provision of services, and the health
                  and safety of residents. An action taken by the City to reduce these costs to
                  some extent was the adoption of the 50-foot Residential Access Street
                  Standard. This standard allows for a narrower pavement width and
                  contiguous sidewalk, along with a narrower right-of-way, all of which will
                  lower the cost of residential development.
                  The General Plan also recommends automatic irrigation systems for medium-
                  and high-density residential projects. This recommendation, along with low-
                  maintenance and drought-tolerant plants, should reduce the long-term costs

  for these types of projects. The State, in its mandatory water efficiency
  regulations, indicates that the cost of installing and maintaining water-efficient
  landscapes should not exceed the costs of other landscaping. Any actual
  differential should be offset by lower maintenance costs in a very short time.

                   Processing and Permit Procedures
                   Processing time for projects in the City of Madera is generally minimal.
                   Multifamily projects in residential zones are permitted uses and, therefore,
                   require only administrative review. A project can be approved and under way
                   for building permit applications in as little as two to four weeks. This
                   procedure, identified as a site plan review application, was established in
                   1988. It better defines application procedures and project requirements and
                   streamlines the process for many larger developments that might otherwise
                   be subject to use permit approval.
                   In Planned Development zones, a precise plan is required for the project and
                   must be approved by the Planning Commission. The formal review period is
                   four weeks. The time before approval typically ranges from four to six weeks
                   and varies with time between the submittal date and the next regularly

  scheduled Planning Commission meeting. Use permits are required for
  residential uses in commercial zones. The review period is the same as that
  for precise plans. It cannot be reduced due to the public hearing and
  environmental review notification requirements. Use permits have a 15-day
  appeal period and are void after one year unless building permits are
  obtained. Extensions of this time frame may be requested if a project requires
  a longer period of time in which to obtain financing and prepare building and
  improvement plans.
  The formal review period for tentative subdivision maps is four to six weeks.
  The applicant's preparation time and preliminary staff review may increase
  the time frames for subdivisions. The time frame often depends on the
  accuracy and adequacy of the initial plans. A requirement for an
  environmental impact report (EIR) will lengthen the process but an EIR can
  be processed simultaneously with the map. Review and processing times for
  tentative maps are minimal in the city of Madera since the City Council has
  delegated the decision-making process to the Planning Commission. Parcel
  maps for less than five parcels are approved by the City's Development
  Review Committee so processing time is only limited to the public hearing
  notification time frame.
  The processing time for projects has been kept to a minimum. Staffing levels
  in the various departments responsible for development review are also kept
  to a minimum and may result in a slight increase in the time for processing of
  projects when the workload is heavy. The adequacy and accuracy of plans
  varies significantly among the various developers. Procedural guidelines
  have been developed and checklists have been made available for applicants
  to reduce time in the preliminary plan preparation phases. Revised
  application forms have also been created which contain an outline of
  procedures and application submittal requirements.
  Multifamily Residential Permit Processing and Procedures
  Multifamily residential development (3 or more units) proposed for the R-1, R-
  2, and R-3 zoning districts require a site plan review application that requires
  administrative approval, which typically takes an estimated two to four weeks.
  Multifamily development proposed in the Commercial and Planned
  Development zones requires Planning Commission approval, which can take
  an estimated one to two months. Conditional use permits are also required
CITY OF MADERA GENERAL PLAN | ADOPTED DECEMBER 2, 2015                       7-139
 CHAPTER 7  HOUSING ELEMENT
                  for residential development in Planned Development zones and all
                  Commercial zones with the exception of the Neighborhood Commercial (C-N)
                  zone.
                  Planned Unit Developments (PUD Zone) Districts
                  The review of a precise plan for a PUD zone district is essentially the same
                  review as in a standard site plan review for other zone districts; both look at
                  the same issues of design, neighborhood compatibility, and functionality.
                  However, rather than having to hold to the standard development criteria of a
                  given zone, Planned Unit Developments "PUD" zone districts allows projects
                  to be developed in consideration of the context of the specific site and the
                  project's design features. The City's standards are allowed to be replaced
                  with provisions that allow for more creative and efficient use of space and
                  resources such as clustering, density transfers, reduced setbacks, shared
                  facilities, etc. The City also has provisions that allow special needs housing to
                  increase densities and decrease requirements such as parking and open
                  space.
                  In an effort to streamline the processing of developments in the PUD zone,
                  the City has development design guidelines in place and developers are
                  encouraged to utilize previously set standards. These tools allow developers
                  to utilize new innovations in designs and technologies to create quality
                  housing without being solely limited to status-quo development regulations,
                  while at the same time providing them with quick ready-made options and
                  guidance for standards that are acceptable for development in the city.
                  Homes in the PUD zone districts typically are developed as one- or two-story
                  units, but there are no height restrictions. The PUD zones require open space
                  equal to the R-3 zone district (750 square feet per unit). However, PUD zones
                  do not have the minimum dimension requirements as in all other residential
                  zone districts. Parking requirements are the same for all residential zones,
                  but may be reduced in a precise plan if the type and design of the project
                  warrant it.
                  Processing of precise plans generally take 4 to 6 weeks from submission to
                  Planning Commission Decision. This is slightly longer than processing a by-
                  right application in a non-PUD zone district (3 to 4 weeks). Projects that are
                  concerned with expediting the required approvals necessary to begin

  construction are allowed to process the checking of improvement plans
  simultaneously, which takes the same amount of time or longer than the
  approval of a precise plan. Hence, a precise plan does not delay
  development. The cost to process a precise plan is actually slightly less than
  processing a site plan in a non-PUD zone district.
  Overall a PUD zone district allows development more flexibility and can
  reduce unneeded development requirements. The processing does not cost
  any more than the standard development process or delay final construction
  approval.
  Following initial plan approval from either administrative staff or the Planning
  Commission, application for required building permits may commence. A site
  utility and grading permit and electrical, mechanical, and plumbing permit are
  the permits required for multifamily residential developments.
  POTENTIAL NON-GOVERNMENTAL/MARKET CONSTRAINTS
  All resources needed to develop housing in Madera are subject to the laws of
  supply and demand, meaning that these resources may not always be
  available at prices that make housing development attractive. Cost factors
  are the primary non-governmental constraints upon development of housing
  in Madera. This is particularly true in the case of housing for low- and
  moderate-income households, where basic development cost factors such as
  the cost of land, required site improvements, and basic construction are
  critical in determining the income a household must have in order to afford
  housing.
  Availability of Financing
  The ability for individual persons or households to obtain financing for
  homeownership is also a potential constraint to lower-income households
  obtaining affordable housing. The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) is
  a Federal law enacted in 1975 that requires mortgage lenders to collect,
  report, and disclose information about their mortgage applications,
  originations, and purchases. HMDA was designed to provide the public with
  loan data that can be used to assess how financial institutions are serving the
  housing needs of their communities. HMDA record provides some measure
  of the availability of financing for homes in Madera.

                              Table H-52 displays the aggregate loan applications processed in the
                              Madera Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) as reported by individual lending
                              institutions within the MSA for the years 2007 and 2013. In 2007 there were
                              2,937 applications completed, a decline of 54 percent from the previous year.
                              Of the total applications completed in 2007, 59 percent were approved. In
                              2013 there were fewer applications submitted but a higher percentage were
                              approved (almost 69 percent).

                              As shown in Table H-53, 700 households applied for conventional home
                              loans in the Madera-Chowchilla MSA in 2013. The majority of loan applicants
                              (51.3 percent) were upper-income households earning 120 percent or more
                              of the area median income (AMI). Moderate-income households (80 to 119
                              percent of AMI) and lower-income households (less than 80 percent of AMI)
                              accounted for 11.4 percent and 12.6 percent of loan applicants, respectively.
                              Analysis of loan application disposition considers both approval and denial
                              rates, primarily because withdrawal of applications can significantly affect
                              these rates. Analyzing both approval and denial rates provides a clearer view
                              of loan activity and trends by allowing multiple points of comparison. The
                              approval rate of conventional loans increased with income, as expected.
                              For nearly every income category applying for conventional loans, White
                              applicants had higher approval rates and lower denial rates than non-White
                              applicants (except for 100-119 percent median income, where non-Whites

  had a higher approval rating). The nine percent difference in approval rates
  between White applicants and non-White applicants is similar to the
  difference in approval rates based on income. This indicates that race and
  ethnicity may be a similar factor of loan approval rates than income in the
  Madera-Chowchilla MSA.
  Federally-backed loans are those guaranteed or insured by a Federal
  government agency, such as FHA or VA home loans. Because these loans
  are Federally-guaranteed, they offer additional means of acquiring financing
  for home purchases for those unable to qualify for conventional home loans.
  As shown in Table H-53, 792 applications were made for government-backed
  loans to purchase homes within the Madera-Chowchilla MSA in 2013. Upper-
  income applicants represented 30.4 percent of these loan applications, while
  moderate-income households represented 13.3 percent of applicants, and
  lower-income households comprised 45.6 percent of applicants. Overall,
  denial rates are slightly higher for government-backed loans than
  conventional loans. The approval rates varied by income and by race. White
  applicants had higher approval rates than non-White applicants. The overall
  availability of financing in Madera is not a constraint for residents to become
  homeowners.

 CHAPTER 7  HOUSING ELEMENT
                      Federal and State Actions
                      While financing availability is a non-governmental constraint, various State
                      and Federal government policies can have significant impacts on the
                      affordability of housing. Most important of these policies are those Federal
                      monetary policies that influence interest rates. Interest rates affect both
                      construction costs (construction loans) and long-term mortgage costs,
                      thereby having a significant direct impact on the affordability of housing.
                      Higher interest rates increase a homebuyer’s monthly payment and decrease
                      the range of housing that a household can afford. Lower interest rates result
                      in a lower cost and lower monthly payments for the homebuyer.
                      As shown in Figure H-5, mortgage rates have continued to decrease
                      nationwide since 2007, hitting a historic low in 2013. When interest rates rise,
                      the market typically compensates by decreasing housing prices. Similarly,
                      when interest rates decrease, housing prices begin to rise. There is often a
                      lag in the market, causing housing prices to remain high when interest rates
                      rise until the market catches up. Lower-income households often find it most
                      difficult to purchase a home during this time period.

  The volatility of interest rates is demonstrated by the fact that within the last
  20 years, mortgage rates have been as high as 9 percent and as low as 3
  percent. Construction financing has been even more volatile. The Federal
  government has increased the per-capita limits on tax-exempt bonds and the
  Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program. That change provides more
  allocation authority for states, which simply means more supply of funds. The
  Federal government has significantly reduced its involvement in direct
  construction programs to meet the housing needs of low- and very low-
  income households. However, it has worked with local housing authorities to
  make the Section 8 program more efficient and effective. Additionally, HUD
  has worked aggressively with private sector owners of older assisted housing
  projects in an effort to keep them affordable. It is now much easier for owners
  to sell to nonprofits and for-profits who are willing to enter into new regulatory
  agreements.
  Land Costs
  Costs associated with the acquisition of land include the market price of raw
  land and the cost of holding land throughout the development process.
  Among the variables affecting the cost of land are its location, its amenities,
  the availability of public services, and the financing arrangements made
  between the buyer and seller.
  According to realtor.com, lot prices in Madera on February 23, 2015 for the 9
  residential lots available within the city limits ranged from $75,000 for a 0.17
  acre lot to $225,000 for an 11.3 acre lot. The median price was $177,450.
  Prices per acre ranged from $19,947 to $441,176. The median price per acre
  was $124,500. The land cost per developed unit can be lowered by choosing
  high-density projects.
  In addition to the cost of the raw land, new housing prices are influenced by
  the cost of holding land while development permits are processed. The
  shorter the period of time that it takes a local government to process
  applications for building, the smaller the effect inflation will have on the cost
  of construction and labor. Permit processing times are discussed earlier in
  this chapter in the context of governmental constraints on the development of
  affordable housing.

                  Development Costs
                  Construction Costs
                  Based on nationwide building valuation data compiled by the International
                  Code Council (ICC), a one- and two-family residential building would cost an
                  estimated $118 per square foot. This equals a rough estimate of $236,000 for
                  a 2,000 square foot single family home. In 2014 RS Means (a reliable
                  published source for construction industry costs) estimated that the hard
                  construction costs in the Fresno area were $148 per square foot for a typical
                  one- to three-story multifamily residential construction with wood siding and
                  frames. For a building with a floor area of 33,750 square feet, this totals
                  $4,995,000. Assuming there are 30 units in the building, this would equal
                  roughly $166,500 per unit in construction costs.
                  Total Housing Development Costs
                  Table H-54 shows a rough estimate of the total development cost for a 2,000
                  square foot single family home on a 5,000 square foot lot in Madera. Based
                  on the assumptions below, a typical home would cost an estimated $288,759
                  to build, including land costs, construction costs, site improvements, and
                  impact fees.

To ensure compliance with Chapter 633, Statutes of                     (2015) in the process of
2007 (SB 2), the City will amend its zoning ordinance                  updating its Zoning

The City shall also amend its zoning ordinance to
administratively allow emergency homeless shelters
in the C-2 (Heavy Commercial) zone district in
accordance with Government Code Section 65582
subject to the following criteria:
        Shelters shall not be located within 300 feet
         of another Shelter.
        Shelters shall limit the duration of individual’s
         stays to preclude long term housing.
        Shelters shall be limited to a maximum
         occupancy of 30 beds or less.
        Shelter shall have qualified supervision on
         site during all hours of operation.
        Shelter facilities shall have adequate lighting
         and security features to deter criminal activity
         at its facilities.
        Shelters shall not be located within 2,000 feet
         of any public or private school or park, or any
         designated facility where children gather.
The C-2 (Heavy Commercial) zone is appropriate for
this use as it allows for a variety of retail and other
service uses that accommodate the needs of
residents of emergency shelters. Emergency shelters
in the C-2 shall only be subject to the same
development and management standards that apply
to other allowed uses in the zone. There are
approximately 212 acres of vacant C-2 land, much of
which is located along major transportation corridors.

APPENDIX C: CITIZEN PARTICIPATION
The City is completing the Housing Element in conjunction with the HUD
Consolidated Plan update. The City made a diligent effort to include public
participation throughout this process, with focus groups and community
forums.
Focus Group Meetings
On December 18, 2014, the City held two Focus Group Meetings, one with
service providers and the other with real estate development professionals.
The City held the Focus Group Meetings at City Hall located at 205 West 4th
Street, Madera, California from 10 a.m. to noon and the other from 2 p.m. to 4
p.m. The City geared the discussion with service providers towards
organizations that provide affordable housing; services to low-income
households, including homeless services and housing counseling; and
organizations that provide services to special needs groups, such as
farmworkers, seniors, the disabled, and youth. The City geared the
discussion with real estate development professionals towards individuals in
the real estate sector, including for profit and non-profit developers. These
discussions solicited input from the two groups on the level of need for
various types of housing, community, and economic development
improvements.
The Focus Group Meetings began with introductions and a presentation of
the project. The presentation outlined the importance of public participation
during the planning process. The City asked the focus group participants
about the most significant housing, economic, and community needs and
issues affecting Madera residents and businesses and how these needs
changed in the past five years. Additionally, the City asked participants about
issues of housing discrimination in the city and if barriers to fair housing
choice exist, as well as if any government constraints exist that discourage
housing development.
The City publicized the Focus Group Meetings using email announcements,
the City’s Facebook page, the Madera Tribune’s Community Calendar, phone
calls, and flyers (in both English and Spanish) posted throughout the City
Administration Building. Approximately 20 people attended the focus group

                  discussions held at City Hall located at 205 West 4th Street, Madera
                  California from 10 a.m. to noon and the other from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m.
                  Participants identified the following major needs in the community:
                         More extremely low-income and very low-income units;
                         More single room occupancy, studios, and dormitory style units for
                          single adults, specifically for former foster youth, veterans, and
                          disabled individuals who may prefer and may be accustomed to living
                          individually;
                         More transitional housing options for individuals who have left
                          homeless shelters but are on the waitlist for a Housing Choice
                          Voucher;
                         More homeless shelters for men, especially returning veterans;
                         More transitional housing for single men;
                         Social services to be provided on-site at affordable housing facilities;
                          and
                         More Housing Choice Vouchers in an effort to reduce the number of
                          individuals/families on the waitlist.
                         More job specific training programs, specifically machinist, mechanics
                          and welders.
                         The need to educate residents about fair housing
                         The need to better connect social programs and educational services
                          with students and families at the school district
                         The need for more public improvements: sidewalks, roads, public art
                  Community Forum
                  On January 20, 2015, the City held a Community Forum to provide an
                  introduction to the City’s five-year Consolidated Plan and the Federal CDBG
                  program, and to solicit input from residents and workers in the city on the
                  level of need for various types of improvements and the major issues

affecting the community. A total of 20 individuals participated in the
Community Forum and provided input on what they considered to be the top
community issues affecting Madera and provided feedback on what they
considered to be the housing, economic, and community development
priorities in the city.
The City held the Community Forum at the Frank Bergon Senior Center
located at 238 South D Street, Madera California from 5:30 pm to 7:30 pm.
The City publicized the Community Forum using email announcements, the
City’s Facebook page, phone calls, and flyers (in both English and Spanish)
posted throughout City Hall, the Madera County Library and the Housing
Authority of the City of Madera. In addition the City announced the forum in
the Madera Tribune, the local newspaper several weeks leading up to the
forum date.
The forum engaged the community through an introductory presentation and
a series of facilitated breakout groups where participants discussed
community issues. Participants communicated in an open-ended dialogue,
ranked the issues discussed, and offered suggestions on solutions to the
issues they selected. The City did this in an effort to understand the various
problems affecting local residents and workers and how the City can
potentially address them. The interactive format of the forums solicited strong
participation, wherein all attendees were provided the opportunity to
participate in the conversation. The City provided Spanish translation
services, and one of the breakout group discussions was conducted in
Spanish.
The top three issues identified by the first breakout group include:
        Need more advocates to support the development of permanent
         supportive housing for the homeless.
        Need more affordable housing for re-entry populations, including:
         former foster youth leaving foster care, Veterans, Prop 47 released
         individuals, mental health patients.
        Need more housing options for single individuals.
Solutions to the issues above:
