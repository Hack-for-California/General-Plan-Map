MILPITAS GENERAL PLAN
      Purpose
      The text and policies of the Land Use Element, and the General Plan Diagram (color
 foldout Figure 2-1) provide the physical framework for development in the Planning Area.
 The Diagram designates the proposed general location, distribution and extent of land uses.
 Uses on sites less than two acres in size are generally not depicted on the Diagram. As
 required by state law, land use classifications, shown as letter designations, labels or
 graphic patterns on the Diagram, specify a range for population density and building
 intensity for each type of designated land use. These standards of population density and
 building intensity allow circulation and public facility needs to be determined; they also
 reflect the environmental carrying-capacity limitations established by other elements of the
 General Plan.
      Relationship to Other Elements
      The Land Use Element correlates land use policies contained in the other elements.
 Land Use designations on the General Plan Diagram, and building density and intensity
 standards contained in the Land Use Element provide a basis for determining future traffic
 conditions and the need for capital facilities, such as street improvements, parks and
 schools.
                                                                                             2-1

     2.1      Population and Growth
     Population Growth
     The Planning Area's 2010 population is 69,100. Between 2000 and 2010, the Planning Area
population increase by 6,290 people at a rate of 1.00 percent per year. Build-out under the 2010
land use designations of the General Plan would result in an additional population of
approximately 37,000 in the City, or a total population of about 106,100 in the Planning Area.
However, this may be affected as a result of any Plan amendments that may subsequently be
adopted.

     While build-out of the General Plan is expected to occur over a 15- to 25-year period, the
time at which build-out would occur is not specified in or anticipated by the Plan.
     Land Availability
     Table 2-2 summarizes the status, as of May 2010, of developed and vacant land within City
limits under the different General Plan land use classifications. About one-third of the developed
land in the Valley Floor is devoted to Single Family Low-Density Residential use, with all
designated residential areas accounting for about 46 percent of the Valley Floor. About 25
percent of the Valley Floor is designated for industrial (Manufacturing and Industrial Park) uses.
About 15 percent of the total land in the Valley Floor is vacant and available for development.
                                                                                                2-3

MILPITAS GENERAL PLAN
     2.2      Land Use Classifications
     The following descriptions apply to land uses indicated on the General Plan Diagram. The
legend on the General Plan Diagram is an abbreviated version of the descriptions. The
classifications represent adopted City policy and are meant to be clear, but broad enough to give
the City flexibility in implementing the Plan. The City's Zoning Ordinance contains more detailed
use provisions and development standards than are described in the classifications. More than
one zoning district may be consistent with a single General Plan land use classification. Table 2-
3 shows a correspondence between the General Plan and the Zoning Ordinance.
     According to state law, the General Plan must establish standards of population density and
building intensity for each land use classification. The General Plan expresses residential density
as housing units and persons per gross acre, as established in Table 2-4 and the land use
classifications that follow. Density ranges specified for each category are discrete and not
cumulative. However, housing types are cumulative (i.e. single family units are permitted in areas
designated for multifamily use), provided the overall development project falls within the
stipulated density range. If a project’s density falls between the density ranges of separate
designations, its density is to be rounded to the nearest whole number to determine if it conforms
to the indicated General Plan density range. For example, in Multifamily Medium Density (7-11
units per gross acre) areas, a residential project would have to have a gross density of at least
6.5 units per acre and less than 12.5 units per acre in order to be in conformance with that
General Plan designation.
     For nonresidential uses, a maximum permitted ratio of gross floor area to site area (FAR) is
specified. FAR is a broad measure of building bulk that controls both visual prominence and
traffic generated. It can be clearly translated to a limit on building floor area in the Zoning
Ordinance and is independent of the type of use occupying the building. The Zoning Ordinance
will include provisions for reviewing and approving deviations from the FAR limitations for uses
with low employee densities, such as wholesaling and distribution, or low peak-hour traffic
generation, such as a hospital.
     The density/intensity standards do not imply that development projects will be approved at
the maximum density or intensity specified for each use. Zoning regulations consistent with
General Plan policies and/or site conditions may reduce development potential within the ranges
stated in the Plan.
     Valley Floor
     The following use descriptions apply to the Valley Floor portion of the Planning Area.
     RESIDENTIAL
     Residential densities are expressed as a range of housing units per gross acre of
developable land, provided that at least one housing unit may be built on each existing legally-
subdivided parcel designated for residential use. Second units permitted by local regulations (i.e.
“granny flats”, “in-law units”), and state-mandated density bonuses for affordable housing are in
addition to densities otherwise permitted.

       Depends on the density of housing provided.
      Single-family Low Density. (3 to 5 units per gross acre) All housing units are to be
individually owned, either on separate lots or as part of a clustered Planned Unit Development.
Single-unit detached residences will be the typical housing type in this category.
      Single-family Moderate Density. (6 to 15 units per gross acre) All housing units are to be
individually owned, either on separate lots or as part of a clustered Planned Unit Development.
Developments with densities ranging from 7 to 10 units per acre may be approved only if
proposals are found to be consistent with policies and programs of the General Plan and
compatible with the surrounding neighborhood. Single-unit attached residences will typically be
built within this density range. Densities higher than 10 units per acre would be consistent only
for sites of 5 acres or less, accompanied by specific findings relating to:
      •    Appropriate relationship to surrounding land uses.
      • Affordability [for Planned Unit Developments (PUDs) the acceptable floor area range is
600 to 1,100 sq. ft.]
      Multifamily Medium Density. (7 to 11 units per gross acre) This density range would allow
single-family attached and semi-detached houses and duplexes.
      Multifamily High Density. (12 to 20 units per gross acre) This density range would
accommodate a variety of housing types, ranging from row houses to triplexes and four-plexes,
stacked townhouses and walk-up garden apartments. Densities up to 40 units per gross acre
                                                                                             2-11

may be permitted for proposals designed as Planned Unit Developments (PUDs) provided that
the following criteria are met:
    •    Sewer and water service is sufficient to accommodate the proposal as well as other
         developments permitted by the General Plan. Any improvements to the sewer or water
         system that would be required to accommodate any such higher density proposals would
         be made conditions of project approval;
    •    Cumulative traffic, from the increased density and other existing or future projects, must
         not cause any street intersection to operate below Level of Service (LOS) E; and
    •    The design of such higher density projects will not have adverse shadow, view
         obstruction or loss of privacy impacts that are not mitigated to acceptable levels.
    Multifamily Very High Density. (31 to 40 dwelling units per gross acre) This density range
would accommodate a variety of housing types, ranging from row houses and townhouses to lofts
and stacked flats with structured parking. Increased densities are permitted within the Transit
Oriented Development overlay zone (TOD). Refer to page 2-15.

residential neighborhoods further from BART, at the interior of sub-district neighborhoods. A
minimum average gross density of 21 units per acre is required, up to a maximum of 40 units per
acre. Residential and related uses are allowed, but not commercial uses.
    Very High Density Transit-Oriented Residential. Intended to create residential districts
near BART and light rail stations, this designation requires housing to be built at an average
density of at least 41 units per gross acre, up to a maximum of 60 and 90 units per gross acre.
Small local-serving commercial uses are permitted at the ground floor level, including retail,
restaurants, and personal services uses.
    Mobile-home Park. This is an overlay category that may be combined with Single-family
Low Density, Multifamily Medium Density and Multifamily High Density Residential, or Highway
Service classifications. Mobile home Park, along with accessory uses, is the permitted use.
Maximum residential density would range from 6 to 7 units per gross acre when combined with
the use classifications as follows:
    In addition to the above-stipulated densities, one additional housing unit per gross acre may
be permitted upon a finding by the Planning Commission that the proposed project is of a
superior functional and aesthetic design based upon it exceeding adopted mobile home park
development standards.
Mixed Use
    Mixed Use. (Residential component: 21 to 30 units per gross acre; non-residential
component: FAR of 0.75) This designation allows for commercial offices, retail and services, high
density residential and public and quasi-public uses. Mixed-use buildings can contain a
combination of residential and commercial uses. The intensity for the non-residential component
is a maximum floor area ratio (FAR) of 0.75. The residential density is 21 to 30 units per gross
2-12

MILPITAS GENERAL PLAN
acre and is calculated separately from the non-residential component. Increased residential
densities are permitted within the Transit Overlay District (TOD). Refer to page 2-15.
     Residential – Retail High Density Mixed Use. This district is intended to be a true mixed
use area with retail, restaurants, and services on the ground floor, and residential or office uses
on the floors above. The residential density is a minimum average gross density of 31 units per
acre and a maximum of between 40 and 60 units per gross acre. In addition, 200 square feet of
retail or restaurant space is required per unit, using the minimum density (i.e. the requirement is
based on the number of units required to meet the minimum density). Sites may be developed
for office and hotel uses without residential development, although ground floor retail or
restaurant square footage will still be required. For nonresidential projects, the minimum FAR
ranges from 1.5 to 2.25. However there is no FAR limit for hotels. A FAR of 2.5 may be
permitted on individual sites with approval of a conditional use permit by the Planning
Commission.
     Boulevard Very High Density Mixed Use. This classification is intended to provide high-
density housing, retail, and employment along Montague Expressway with a landscaped
boulevard character. Projects may include a wholly residential or non-residential concept or a
project that integrates residential and non-residential uses vertically or horizontally.
     Permitted uses include residential, office, commercial, and medical uses. Sites developed
with a mix of uses, or non-residential uses, must adhere to the FAR maximum which ranges from
1.5 to 2.25. Residential projects shall have a minimum average gross density of 41 units per acre
and can be built up to between 60 to 90 units per acre.
     A FAR of 2.5 may be permitted on individual sites with approval of a conditional use permit by
the Planning Commission. Special criteria would need to be met, including the following: (1) the
proposed uses include a hotel or office uses that create substantial new jobs, and do not include
residential uses; (2) the design of the project is on extremely high quality and is compatible with
the scale of surrounding buildings; (3) there are no adverse traffic impacts beyond those studied
in the Transit Area Plan EIR or the project will be required to mitigate such impacts individually;
and (4) buildings do not shade public parks or plazas more than 30% between 10 AM and 3 PM
as measured on March 15.
     INSTITUTIONAL
     The Institutional classification is for parcels owned by public agencies and intended to be
accessed by the public. There are three institutional classifications:
     1. Schools
     2. Correctional Facility
     3. Public Facilities
     COMMERCIAL
     Town Center. This designation provides for a variety of commercial, civic and residential
uses appropriate to the Center's role as the functional and visual focus of Milpitas. The Town
                                                                                               2-13

MILPITAS GENERAL PLAN
Center is a meeting place and a market place, the home of commercial and professional firms, an
entertainment area and a place for restaurants and hotels. Because of this unique and relatively
intensive mix of activities, very high density residential developments (i.e., up to 40 units per
acres) may be permitted within the Town Center because of the increased economic support the
residents would offer to the commercial uses.
     General Commercial. This classification provides for a wide range of retail sales, and
personal and business services accessed primarily by the automobile. It includes commercial
uses in which shopping may be conducted by people walking to several stores as in a center, and
may include uses customarily of a single-purpose character served from an adjacently parked
automobile.
     Retail Sub-Center. This classification accommodates neighborhood shopping facilities that
provide for convenience needs, such as groceries and minor hardgood purchases. The General
Plan provides for nine sub-centers, between two and 20 acres in size, distributed throughout the
City.
     Professional and Administrative Office. This classification provides advantageous
locations for medical, law, and similar services required to serve residents and businesses.
While office uses can be located in all of the commercial districts, the Professional Administrative
Office areas are solely for these uses.
     Highway Service. This classification provides for motels, mobile home parks, and non-retail
services such as car-rental offices. Eight highway service areas are designated on the General
Plan Diagram, typically at the intersection of major streets and/or freeways.
     INDUSTRIAL
     Manufacturing. This classification encompasses a variety of light and heavy industrial
activities, such as manufacturing, packaging, processing, warehousing and distribution, and
ancillary support uses.
     Industrial Park. This classification accommodates research, professional, packaging and
distribution facilities in a park-like setting, free from noise, odor and other such nuisances.
     HILLSIDE
     The Hillside Area comprises approximately 6,000 acres generally east of Piedmont Road,
Evans Road and the portion of North Park Victoria Drive north of Evans Road. The undeveloped
portion of the Hillside Area is characterized by gentle to steep slopes, grassy terrain with some
chaparral and trees, wildlife, geologically unstable areas, the Ed R. Levin County Regional Park,
and a feeling of remoteness from the more urban portions of the City. These conditions warrant
Plan proposals and use classifications that differ considerably from those for the Valley Floor
Area.
     To ensure safety and to preserve its natural ambiance, all development in the Hillside Area is
to be of low-density rural residential nature. Three categories of residential uses are provided.
2-14
MILPITAS GENERAL PLAN
The Low and the Medium Density categories accommodate existing development; all new
development is to be at a Very Low Density.
     RESIDENTIAL
     Residential densities are per gross acre of developable land provided that at least one
housing unit may be built on each existing parcel designated for residential use. Densities
outlined in the classifications are maximums for the classifications; these decrease with increase
in slope as outlined in the classifications and defined in detail in the City’s Zoning Ordinance.
The City may further reduce the permitted density on a site if such a reduction is necessary or
appropriate for reasons of site conditions, access, views or geologic hazards. Second units
permitted by local regulations and state access-mandated density bonuses for affordable housing
are in addition to densities otherwise permitted.
     Very Low Density. The maximum permitted density for this classification is one dwelling unit
per ten gross acres. The maximum density decreases with increase in slope until 80 acres per
housing unit is required for land with an average slope of 50 percent or greater. This designation
includes most of the Hillside Area.
     Low Density. The maximum density for this classification is 1.0 housing unit per gross acre.
This density decreases with increase in slope until ten acres of land are required per housing unit
for sites with an average slope of 27 percent or more. Three relatively small areas of the Hillside
(representing prior developments) are shown on the General Plan Diagram with this designation.
     Medium Density. The maximum density for this classification is approximately 3.0 units per
gross acre on level land and decreases with increasing slope until ten acres of land are required
per unit for sites with an average slope of approximately 27 percent or more. Areas designated
as Medium Density (all existing) include:
     •   Development along the base of the hillside area;
     •   Summitpointe residential and golf course;
     •   Calaveras Ridge PUD; and
     •   The Country Club Estates.
     OVERLAY ZONES
     Overlay zones are established in areas with distinct characteristics to have special
development standards or guidelines beyond those identified in the underlying land use
designation to carry out a vision or goal.
     Transit Oriented Development (TOD) Overlay Zone
     The Transit Oriented Development (TOD) Overlay Zones are located near transit stations,
and are applicable to land generally located within a 2,000 foot walking distance from a Light Rail
Station or future BART station. Development within the TOD overlay zone is subject to special
requirements regarding development density, parking, mix of uses, and transit supportive design
features.
                                                                                              2-15

MILPITAS GENERAL PLAN
     The south Midtown TOD increases densities in the Multifamily-Very High Density designation
to a range of 41 to 60 dwelling units per gross acre. The north Midtown TOD increases densities
in the Mixed Use designation to a range of 31 to 40 dwelling units per gross acre.
     Gateway Office Overlay Zone
     The Gateway Office Overlay Zone is located in areas that are well-suited for a ‘gateway’
higher intensity office development. This overlay zone allows office developments to be
developed to an intensity of FAR 1.5 for Class A office only; not for retail or other office buildings.
     Recreation and Entertainment Overlay
     The purpose of the Recreation and Entertainment (-RE) Overlay District is to encourage the
interaction between commercial and entertainment uses to create a destination that attracts
visitors to Milpitas, which in turn, enhances retail spending opportunities. The overlay would
expand the type of recreation and entertainment uses that could be allowed with a conditional use
permit in the non-residential (C2, HS, M1, and MP) zoning districts covered by the district. Such
uses include but not limited to conference centers, movie theatres, nightclubs, indoor recreational
facilities, etc.
     High Rise Overlay
          The purpose of the High Rise Overlay is intended to be a special district to allow greater
building height and density at strategic locations to frame major City gateways and provide
unique housing, shopping and employment opportunities. This overlay would allow between 60-
150 dwelling units per gross acre and is intended for areas that are well suited for taller, high
density mixed-use buildings located along freeways or expressways.

         MILPITAS GENERAL PLAN
             2.3        Jobs/Housing Relationship
                   The job/housing balance is the relationship between the number of jobs provided by a
         community and the number of housing units needed to house the workers in those jobs. The
         best measure of job/housing balance is the jobs/employed resident ratio. A ratio of 1.00
         indicates there is a numeric balance between the number of jobs and the number of employed
         residents in a community. A ratio of less than 1.00 indicates that a community is “job poor”
         and that its economic development has not kept pace with its housing growth, which can imply
         that the community’s tax base is weak and maybe unable to support adequate levels of urban
         services. It is also an indicator for other factors such as community’s housing cost in relation
         to worker’s income; travel distances between homes and jobs; and the environment and
         quality of life in that community.
                   ABAG 2009 Projections estimated 1.54 workers per household in Milpitas. There
         were a total of 19,070 households in Milpitas and housed 31,274 workers. The 2035 projected
         growth in jobs and employed residents for Milpitas and Santa Clara County are summarized in
         Table 2-5.

intensities to vacant sites shows that Milpitas would be able to accommodate about 22,000 new
jobs under current General Plan designations (Table 2-7), more than enough to meet projected
needs over the next 20 years.

          Methodology for additional enrollment is based on additional housing units multiplied by
          student generation rates obtained from the Projected Enrollments from 2009-2019 Report,
          Enrollment Projection Consultants, February 2/15/10
    Projections
    Growth from the buildout of the General Plan would result in the addition of 1,428 students.
Table 2-8 lists the additional students that would be generated by grade category using Milpitas
Unified School District (MUSD) student generation rates of 0.031 students for Single Family
Dwelling developments, 0.12 students for Regular Attached developments, and 0.40 for Below
Market-Rate (BMR) developments             ; and broken down by grade in proportion to the current
enrollment. 1
    Milpitas currently levies state-mandated fees for new residential, commercial and industrial
development at the time of building permit issuance in accordance with more recent statutes and
court decisions.

MILPITAS GENERAL PLAN
     Government Facilities
     The Civic Center (consisting of City Hall, Community Center and Senior Center) is adjacent
to the Town Center. The library is located on southwest corner of North Main Street and Weller
Avenue near Calaveras Boulevard overpass. The Police Station and Corporation Yard are
located on the west side of North Milpitas Boulevard. There are four fire stations located
throughout the Valley Floor Area. The locations of these City facilities, as well as the County’s
Elmwood Correctional Facility on Abel Street, are indicated on the General Plan Diagram.
     Water Supply
     The City receives water from the San Francisco Water Department (SFWD) through the
Hetch-Hetchy system by connections on two of the four local aqueducts that transport water from
mountain reservoirs to San Francisco and the Peninsula. While the SFWD aqueduct is able to
meet the City's demand, the City's 1980 Water Master Plan concluded that it would be more cost
effective for the City to obtain some of its water from the Santa Clara Valley Water District
(SCVWD). As a result, industrial areas in the southwestern part of the City have since August
1993 been receiving water from the SCVWD.
     The 2009/2010 average water consumption in the City was approximately 11,500 acre feet
per year. The projected domestic water purchases for 2010/2011 is 10,500 acre feet per year.
The City’s current Water Master Plan was adopted in Spring 2010.
     Wastewater Services
     The San Jose/Santa Clara Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP), the wastewater treatment
facility for the City, is located in San Jose. It is a tertiary regional facility serving San Jose, Santa
Clara, Milpitas, West Valley Sanitation District, Cupertino Sanitary District, County Sanitary
District 2-3, Burbank Sanitary District, and the Sunol Sanitary District. Milpitas wastewater
service area is contiguous with the City boundaries.
     Capacity and Discharge. In 2009/2010, the City discharged 8.4 million gallons per day
(mgd) and is contractually limited to a flow of 14.25 mgd. The dry weather flow rate was 7.2 mgd
in 2010/2011. The WPCP has a dry-weather total capacity of 167 mgd, and a current average
daily flow of approximately 121 mgd. There are no plans to increase the capacity of the WPCP.
To mitigate a discharge-limit cap, conditions to WPCP's National Pollution Discharge Elimination
System discharge permit have been imposed (see Section 4.4). The WPCP staff is preparing a
master plan to establish a 30-year plan for equipment and process upgrades.
     Current Programs. In order to allow the WPCP to meet the more stringent discharge
requirements into the Bay, Milpitas is participating in water conservation programs and plans to
divert flows to reclamation systems. Recycled water to supplement potable irrigation water
became available in 2000. Future recycled water uses include industrial process, cooling towers,
and dual plumbing of non-residential buildings.

MILPITAS GENERAL PLAN
   The City completed an inflow and infiltration sewer remedial program in 1989. The City also
updated its sewer master plan in May 2010.
                                                                                         2-23
MILPITAS GENERAL PLAN
2.6    Land Use Principles and Policies
a.         Land Use
Guiding Principles
 2.a-G-1   Maintain a land use program that balances
           Milpitas' regional and local roles by providing
           for a highly amenable community
           environment and a thriving regional
           industrial center.
 2.a-G-2   Maintain a relatively compact urban form.
           Emphasize mixed-use development to the
           extent feasible, to achieve service
           efficiencies from compact development
           patterns and to maximize job development
           and commercial opportunities near
           residential development.
 2.a-G-3   Provide for a variety of housing types and
           densities that meet the needs of individuals
           and families.
 2.a-G-4   The Town Center will be the “heart” of
           Milpitas’ civic, cultural, business, and
           professional life.
 2.a-G-5   A park-like setting will be created by a series
           of local parks, school sites, trails, and a
           greenway system laced throughout all living
           areas.
 2.a-G-6   Implement the Midtown Specific Plan goals,
           policies and development standards and
           guidelines to create a mixed-use community
           that includes high-density, transit-oriented
           housing and a central community ‘gathering
           place’ while maintaining needed industrial,
           service and commercial uses.
 2.a-G-7   When considering development proposals,
           seek “community benefit”, such as upgrading
           infrastructure facilities, constructing new
           infrastructure facilities, and funding
           contributions to programs.
2-24

MILPITAS GENERAL PLAN
 2.a-G-8   The City should consider a long term
           approach to managing its income/job
           generating lands and the impacts of
           development on public services.
 2.a-G-9   The city should make land use decisions that
           improve the City’s fiscal condition. Manage
           the City’s future growth in an orderly,
           planned manner that is consistent with the
           City’s ability to provide efficient and
           economical public services, to maximize the
           use of existing and proposed public facilities,
           and to achieve equitable sharing of the cost
           of such services and facilities.
 2.a-G-    Consider long-term planning and strong land
 10        use policy in managing the City’s fiscal
           position.
 2.a-G-    Promote land use policy and implementation
 11        actions that improve the City’s fiscal
           sustainability. Maintain and enhance the
           City’s projected total net revenue through
           amendments made to the General Plan.
           Discourage proposed re-zonings or other
           discretionary land use actions that could
           significantly diminish revenue to the City or
           significantly increase the City’s service costs
           to the City without offsetting increases in
           revenue.
Implementing Policies
 Development Intensity
 2.a-I-1   New developments should not exceed the          Housing density standards
           building intensity limits established in the    consistent with the General Plan
           General Plan.                                   are already established in the
                                                           Zoning Ordinance. Limits on
                                                           development intensity are
                                                           required by state law.
 2.a-I-2   Land use conversions from
           employment/sales tax generation properties
           to residential shall only be considered once
           there is 80% buildout in the Midtown and
           Transit Area Specific Plans.
                                                                                          2-25

MILPITAS GENERAL PLAN
 Growth and Expansion
 2.a I-2    Promote development within the incorporated
            limits which acts to fill-in the urban fabric
            rather than providing costly expansion of
            urban services into outlying areas.
 2.a I-2.1  Maintain an Urban Growth Boundary in the
            hillside area, as shown on the General Plan
            Land Use Map, that shall be effective until
            December 31, 2018 and, except as otherwise
            provided below, shall not be moved until that
            time.
         A. City Services Prohibited in Area Outside the Urban Growth Boundary and
            Outside the City Limits: The City shall not process, approve or authorize
            construction or provision of any City service or City service extension to any
            property or people in that area located both outside of the Urban Growth
            Boundary and outside of the city limits of the City of Milpitas, except as
            expressly provided in this Policy 2.a I-2.1A. “City service” means any water,
            sanitary sewer, storm drain, flood control, road maintenance, sidewalk
            maintenance, police, fire or emergency medical service, including construction
            of related infrastructure that the City, its agents, its departments, or its
            contractors, provides to any property or people within the City limits. The City
            may provide a City service or City service extension to property or people
            outside of the Urban Growth Boundary only if:
            1. Declared Public Emergency: The City Council declares a local emergency
                 pursuant to Government Code § 8630 et seq. or Milpitas Municipal Code
                 Title V, Chapter V-1 as they presently exist or may be amended in the future
                 and the City Council finds, based on substantial evidence, that: (1) the
                 extension or provision of service on a temporary basis is necessary to
                 ensure public safety and (2) the extension or provision of service is for a
                 specified limited time period;
2-26

MILPITAS GENERAL PLAN
           2. Urgent Public Health or Safety Concern Affecting Existing Development:
              The City Council finds, based on substantial evidence, that: (1) an urgent
              public health or safety concern exists; (2) an independent, certified
              professional engineer approved by the City has concluded that the only
              economically justifiable solution to that public health or safety concern is to
              provide or extend City service; (3) on or before November 3, 1998, the legal
              parcel affected by that public health or safety concern had either a vested
              right to develop an approved land use or an approved and recorded final
              subdivision map pursuant to which residential units had been constructed
              within said subdivision; and 4) the applicant for the provision or extension of
              such City service has agreed to pay for its proportionate share of the service
              or service extension costs including, but not limited to, any engineering,
              design, inspection, land acquisition or review or other capital or operating
              costs incurred by the City. Any City service extension constructed under
              this Policy 2.a I-2.1A.(ii) shall be constructed in accordance with Section XI-
              1-7 of the Milpitas Municipal Code (regarding developer installation of
              improvements);
           3. Parks and Open Space: The City Council finds, based on substantial
              evidence, that: (1) the property is operated as park or open space for the
              benefit of the general public and owned by either a private open-space trust
              or a government agency, authority, or district; (2) there would be minimal
              alteration (e.g. trails and fire roads) of the natural land forms as a result of
              any land use approval or modification; and (3) the property either will be
              used exclusively for passive recreational uses consistent with the rural
              character and indigenous plant and animal species of the hillsides, or
              contains a designated historic building(s) or setting that will be used for a
              purpose related to the historic significance of the site. Any property that is
              extended or provided City service under this Policy 2.a I-2.1.A.(i) shall not
              be used as golf course, ball field, ball court, amphitheater, amusement park,
              gymnasium or auditorium; or
           4. Mutual Aid Agreements with Other Public Agencies: The City Council finds,
              based on substantial evidence, that: (1) the City services to be provided are
              limited to police, fire or emergency medical services, (2) such services are
              provided pursuant to a written agreement between the City of Milpitas and
              another public agency, (3) the agreement provides mutual benefits to both
              the City of Milpitas and the other agency to the agreement, and (4) the
              agreement benefits all or substantially all of the residents of the City of
              Milpitas.
                                                                                               2-27
MILPITAS GENERAL PLAN
       B. Limited City Services Available in Areas Outside the Urban Growth
          Boundary and Within the City Limits: The City may provide police, fire or
          emergency medical service to any property or people in that area located both
          outside of the Urban Growth Boundary and within the city limits of the City of
          Milpitas. “City police, fire or emergency medical service” means any police, fire
          or emergency medical service, including construction of directly related
          infrastructure [except new stations] that the City, its departments, agents or
          contractors provides to any property or people within the City limits. Other than
          police, fire and emergency medical services specified herein, the City shall not
          process, approve or authorize construction or provision of any City service or
          City service extension to any property or people in that area located both outside
          of the Urban Growth Boundary and within the city limits of the City of Milpitas,
          except as expressly provided in this Policy 2.a I-2.1A. For purposes of this
          section, “City service” means any water, sanitary sewer, storm drain, flood
          control, road maintenance, sidewalk maintenance, including construction of
          related infrastructure that the City, its agents, its departments, or its contractors,
          provides to any property or people within the City limits. Notwithstanding any
          prohibition provided in this paragraph, the City may continue to maintain and/or
          repair that portion of Calaveras Road within the City limits and outside of the
          Urban Growth Boundary.
       C. Amendments to the Urban Growth Boundary: Until December 31, 2018, the
          Urban Growth Boundary may only be amended as follows:
           1. The Urban Growth Boundary may be amended by a vote of the People of
               the City of Milpitas;
           2. To comply with state law regarding the provision of housing for all economic
               segments of the community, the City Council may amend the Urban Growth
               Boundary to accommodate lands designated or to be designated for
               residential uses. No more than 3 acres of land may be brought within the
               Urban Growth Boundary for this purpose in any calendar year. Land added
               to the Urban Growth Boundary pursuant to this section must be contiguous
               to land already within the Urban Growth Boundary. Such amendment may
               be adopted only if the City Council makes all of the following findings, based
               on substantial evidence:
               a    That the land is to be included within the Urban Growth Boundary not
                    designated as existing regional parks in the Santa Clara County General
                    Plan adopted December 20, 1994, as amended through August 3, 1998;
                    and
               b. That the land is immediately adjacent to (i) the existing Urban Growth
                    Boundary, and (ii) existing serviceable water and sewer connections;
               c.   That the proposed development will consist of primarily low and very low
                    income housing pursuant to the Housing Element of this General Plan;
                    and
2-28

MILPITAS GENERAL PLAN
                 d. hat there is no existing residentially designated land within the Urban
                      Growth Boundary to accommodate the proposed development and it is
                      not reasonably feasible to accommodate the proposed development by
                      redesignating lands inside the Urban Growth Boundary for low and very
                      low income housing; and
                 e. That the proposed development is necessary to comply with state law
                      requirements for provision of low and very low income housing and the
                      area of land within the proposed development will not exceed the
                      minimum necessary to comply with state law; or
            3. The City Council may amend the Urban Growth Boundary if it makes both of
                 the following findings:
                 a. The application of any aspect of the Urban Growth Boundary above
                      would constitute an unconstitutional taking of a landowner’s property;
                      and
                 b. That the amendment and associated land use designation under
                      consideration by the City Council will allow additional land uses
                      approved by the City Council only to the minimum extent necessary to
                      avoid said unconstitutional taking of the landowner’s property.
         D. Review of the Urban Growth Boundary: In 2015, prior to its expiration in
            2018, the City shall begin a comprehensive review of the Urban Growth
            Boundary.
 2.a I-2.2  Not later than 45 days after approval of this
            General Plan Amendment, the City shall take
            all necessary actions to apply for and request
            that the Santa Clara County Local Agency
            Formation       Commission     (“SC     LAFCO”)
            relocate the Urban Service Area boundary so
            that it is coterminous with the Urban Growth
            Boundary. The City shall take all actions
            within the scope of its jurisdiction to support
            and facilitate SC LAFCO’s action regarding
            the City’s request to relocate the Urban
            Service Area Boundary.
 Economic Development
 2.a-I-3     Encourage economic pursuits which will
             strengthen and promote development through
             stability and balance.
                                                                                             2-29

MILPITAS GENERAL PLAN
 2.a-I-4   Publicize the position of Milpitas as a place to
           carry on compatible industrial and
           commercial activities with special emphasis
           directed toward the advantages of the City’s
           location to both industrial and commercial
           use.
 2.a-I-5   Maintain policies that promote a strong
           economy which provides economic
           opportunities for all Milpitas residents within
           existing environmental, social fiscal and land
           use constraints.
 2.a-I-6   Endeavor to maintain a balanced economic
           base that can resist downturns in any one
           economic sector.
 2.a-I-7   Provide opportunities to expand employment,
           participate in partnerships with local business
           to facilitate communication, and promote

 2.a-I-8   Establish redevelopment projects to secure
           funds that can be used to attract commercial,
           industrial, and residential development in
           order to eliminate blight and improve an area.
 2.a-I-9   Prohibit encroachment of incompatible uses
           into industrial lands, and prohibit non-
           industrial uses which would result in the
           imposition of additional operational
           restrictions and/or mitigation requirements on
           industrial users due to land use
           incompatibility issues.
 2.a-I-10  Maintain an inventory of industrial lands and
           periodically assess the condition, type, and
           amount of industrial land available to meet
           projected demands.

MILPITAS GENERAL PLAN
 2.a-I-11   Encourage supportive and compatible
            commercial and office uses in industrial areas
            designated for those uses. In areas reserved
            for industrial uses, only limited ancillary and
            incidental commercial uses, such as small
            eating establishments, may be permitted
            when such are of a scale and design
            providing support only to the needs of
            businesses and their employees in the
            immediate industrial area.
 2.a-I-12   Consider conversion from one employment
            land use to another, where the conversion
            would retain or expand employment capacity
            and revenue generation, particular for
            intensification on-site if the proposed
            conversion would result in a net increase in
            revenue generation.
 2.a-I-13   When considering land use conversions from
            commercial or industrial lands to residential,
            the City should contemplate substantial
            economic benefit through negotiable
            development agreements with contributions
            towards the Economic Development
            Corporation to spur economic development.
 Land Use Compatibility
 2.a-I-14   When new uses are proposed in proximity to
            existing industrial uses, incorporate
            conditions upon the new use to minimize its
            negative impacts on existing nearby land
            uses and to promote the health and safety of
            individuals at the new development site.
            Prohibit social organization uses within
            industrial areas. Consider these uses in other
            areas in the City.
 Fiscally Beneficial Land Use
 2.a-I-15   Maintain and expand the total amount of land
            with industrial designations. Do not add
            overlays or other designations that would
            allow non-industrial, employment uses within
            industrially designated areas.
                                                            2-31

   Purpose
    The Circulation Element designates the general location and extent of existing and
proposed major thoroughfares, transportation routes--including those for bicycles and
pedestrians--and other local public facilities.
   Relationship to Other Elements
       The Circulation Element is systematically and reciprocally correlated with the Land Use
Element, which includes policies related to the physical framework for development that the
circulation system is designed to serve. The trails and bikeways identified in this element are
also related to the recreational plans and policies identified in the Open Space and
Environmental Conservation Element. Projected noise conditions in the Noise Element are
also based on the traffic analysis conducted as part of the Circulation Element.

Much of Milpitas' evolution and recent growth can be attributed to its strategic location at the
narrow plain between the Diablo Range and the San Francisco Bay that connects the East Bay
and the South Bay. Several major regional transportation facilities traverse the City including
Interstates 680 and 880, State Route 237-Calaveras Boulevard, Montague Expressway, The
Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) Light Rail line, the Union Pacific Railroad
tracks and the future Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) commuter rail line. These major routes
serve as major regional thoroughfares; however also act as barriers for local access.
    Milpitas accommodates significant regional traffic as commuters from the East Bay and
Central Valley travel to employment centers in Milpitas and Santa Clara County. The
predominant direction of travel is south and west during the morning and east and north during
the evening commute. Mean travel time to work for City residents was 22.7 minutes in 2009,
compared to 23.8 minutes for County residents as a whole.
    The residents' mode of transportation to work was quite similar to that of County residents as
detailed in the 2009 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates, with about 77 percent of the
workers relying on the automobile as the primary mode (Table 3-1). Carpooling is slightly higher
than the County average with 14 percent Milpitas residents sharing a vehicle over the County’s
11 percent. A small amount of Milpitas residents travel by public transportation and about 2
percent of Milpitas residents walk or use another means of transportation which is assumed
bicycling.

MILPITAS GENERAL PLAN
     The Circulation Element provides a framework to guide growth of Milpitas' transportation-
related infrastructure over the next 20 years. The Element is closely integrated with the Land
Use Element to maintain acceptable level of service as the City grows and to plan an adequate
street network to serve future development.
     3.1         Relationship to Regional Programs
     For a discussion of the Bay Area Air Quality Management District's programs, see Section
3.4.
     A recognition of the functional relationships between transportation, land use and air quality,
as well as of the need for jurisdictional cooperation, has led to a long history of legislation. In
accordance with California Statute, Government Code 65088, Santa Clara County established a
Congestion Management Program (CMP) to develop a comprehensive transportation
improvement program among local jurisdictions that will reduce traffic congestion and improve
land use decision-making and air quality. In 1991, Congress enacted the landmark Intermodal
Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) followed by TEA-21 (expired in mid-2003) to
provide a “national intermodal transportation system that is economically efficient and
environmentally sound, and moves people and goods in an energy-efficient manner”. This
allowed state and metropolitan planning organization to take a broader view of the transportation
system and its performance. In 2005, congress approved the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and
Efficient Transportation Equity Act- A Legacy for Users or SAFETEA-LU. Like its predecessors,
SAFETEA-LU provided dollars to fund federal highways public transportation, highway safety and
motor carrier safety program. The program promotes projects of national significance and it gives
state and local transportation decision makers the financial flexibility to solve transportation
problems in their communities.
     The state of California has adopted three legislative mandates to guide the development of
local plans and strategies:
     AB 32 California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006. This bill requires the State board
to adopt regulations to require the reporting and verification of Statewide greenhouse gas
emissions and to monitor and enforce compliance with this program
     SB 97 CEQA Guidelines Amendments of 2009. These amendments provide guidelines for
mitigation of green house gas emissions or the effect of greenhourse gas emissions.
     SB 375 2008 Transportation Planning: Travel Demand Models; Sustainable
Communities Strategy; Environmental Review. This bill requires the California Transportation
Commission (CTC) to maintain guidelines, as specified, for travel demand models used in the
development of the regional transportation plans by metropolitan planning organizations. This bill
would also require the regional transportation plan for regions of the State with a metropolitan
planning organization to adopt a sustainable communities strategy, as part of its regional
transportation, designed to achieve certain goals for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions
from automobiles and light trucks in a region.

     Major street improvements to meet the needs for a long-range planning horizon are identified
in Section 3.3 of this Element. These projects will later be studied in greater detail and funding
and implementation sources would be identified. Many of the projects are part of local and
regional programs, including the City's Capital Improvement Program, the Santa Clara County
Congestion Management Program (CMP), and Regional Transportation Plans as discussed
below.
     AB 1358 California Complete Streets Act of 2008. In order to fulfill the commitment to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions, make the most efficient use of urban land and transportation
infrastructure, and improve public health by encouraging physical activity, transportation planners
must find innovative ways to reduce vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and to shift from short trips in
the automobile to biking, walking and use of public transit. There is no singular design
prescription for Complete Streets; each one is unique and responds to its community context.
     Regional Transportation Plan
     As the designated metropolitan planning organization for the Bay Area, the Metropolitan
Transportation Commission (MTC) is responsible for preparing a long range Regional
Transportation Plan (RTP). With the adoption of the Regional Transportation Plan in 2009, three
principles of sustainability guide the Bay Area: a prosperous and globally competitive economy, a
healthy and safe environment, and equity wherein all Bay Area residents share in the benefits of
a well-maintained, efficient and connected regional transportation system. These principles are
benchmarks to measure the progress of the Bay Area’s transportation system.
      In addition, to remain eligible for federal transportation funds, a region must demonstrate
that the highway and transit projects contained in its RTP will help attain and maintain federal air
quality standards. Once adopted, a RTP serves as a guide for the region's Transportation
Improvement Programs (TIPs) in which projects and their specific funding sources are listed.
     Santa Clara County Congestion Management Program
     The Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA), in its role as the Congestion
Management Agency (CMA) for Santa Clara County, is responsible for preparing and periodically
updating the Valley Transportation Plan (VTP), the long range vision for transportation in the
County. The VTP identifies existing and future transportation related needs, considers all modes
of travel and identifies what can be completed within the anticipated available funding for projects
and programs. It provides a roadmap for the planning, policy development and programming of
transportation funds in Santa Clara County for the next 25 years according to State and Federal
requirements. It considers all travel modes and addresses the links between transportation and
land use planning, air quality, energy use and community livability. The VTP updates every 4-5
years on a cycle coinciding with the Bay Area’s Regional Transportation Plan (RTP)
     The Congestion Management Program (CMP) is administered by the Santa Clara Valley
Transportation Authority, the County's Congestion Management Agency, which is also
responsible for overseeing local agency compliance with state law. The CMP promotes an
integrated approach to transportation planning decision-making and mobility in Santa Clara
                                                                                                 3-5

MILPITAS GENERAL PLAN
County by establishing traffic and transit standards, trip-reduction and travel-demand
requirements, and by incorporating the transportation implications of land-use decisions in
planning efforts.
     Cities within the County are responsible for conformance with the adopted service level
standards on the principal arterial system defined by the CMP, and for transit standards. They
are also responsible for the adoption and implementation of a trip-reduction and travel-demand
ordinance and for developing a program to analyze the impacts of land use decisions. Where
deficiencies in the system exist, deficiency plans must be adopted and methods of correcting the
deficiencies identified. If deficiencies go unmitigated, a city could lose its entitlement to a portion
of its gas tax revenues.
     Capital Improvements Program (CIP). The CMA maintains a CIP which includes a list of
transportation facility improvements that is submitted to the MTC for inclusion in the Valley
Transportation Plan 2040 (VTP 2040), or for funding from the state (Flexible Congestion Relief
Funds) or from the federal Surface Transportation and the Congestion Mitigation/Air Quality
programs.
     Traffic level of service (LOS) standards adopted as part of the CMP is discussed in Section
3.2 and the street network in Section 3.3.
     3.2           Standards for Traffic Service
     Because much of the City is built-out, the primary traffic issues in Milpitas are the feasibility of
improvements and achievement of an acceptable level of service, particularly along two major
commute corridors that bisect the city. Areas along the local street system not constrained by
available rights-of-way are few.
     Level of service (LOS) is a measure of quality of traffic service along a roadway or at an
intersection. As described in Table 3-2, it ranges from A to F, with LOS A being best and LOS F
being worst. LOS A, B and C indicate conditions where traffic can move relatively freely. LOS D
describes conditions where delay is noticeable. LOS E indicates significant delays and traffic
volumes are generally at or close to capacity. Finally, LOS F characterizes traffic flow at very
slow speeds (stop-and-go), and large delays (more than one minute) with queuing at signalized
intersections; in effect, traffic demand on the roadway exceeds the roadway's capacity.
     CMP Level-of-Service Standards
     As required by state law, the Santa Clara County CMP includes level-of-service standards for
the designated CMP Roadway System as follows:
              •    The LOS basic standard is LOS E;
              •    The LOS goal for the CMP system is LOS D, however member agencies
                   (including the City of Milpitas) are not required to conform to the goal.
              •    Intersections that have a baseline (1991) LOS F are grandfathered in as LOS F.

                                                             CIRCULATION ELEMENT
• If the baseline LOS for a CMP System facility was LOS F and the facility is not
  included in an approved deficiency plan, then changes to traffic conditions
  caused by a project shall not be allowed to increase LOS by more than the
  criteria outlined in the CMP Traffic LOS Impact criteria for intersections- four or
  more second increase of average stopped delay for the critical movements and
  increase in critical volume-to-capacity ration (v/c) by 0.01 or more. In the event
  that the project causes CMP System facilities to worsen below baseline
  conditions, either a mitigation proposal to improve traffic LOS shall be provided,
  or an approved deficiency plan must be approved.

               Vehicles are completely unimpeded in their ability to maneuver
               within the traffic stream. Stopped delay at signalized intersections

               arterial class. The ability to maneuver within the traffic stream is
               only slightly restricted and stopped delays are not bothersome.
               Drivers are not generally subjected to appreciable tension.
        C         Represents stable operations. However, ability to maneuver and            0.8
               change lanes in midblock locations may be more restricted than in
               LOS B, and longer queues and/or adverse signal coordination may
               contribute to lower average travel speeds of about 50 percent of the
               average free-flow speed for the arterial class. Motorists will
               experience an appreciable tension while driving.

               substantial increases in approach delay and, hence decreases in

               inappropriate signal timing, high volumes, or some combination of
               these. Average travel speeds are about 40 percent of free-flow

               are caused by some combination or adverse progression, high
               signal density, extensive queuing at critical intersections, and
               inappropriate signal timing.

               condition.

      Traffic Analysis
          The City completed two major planning documents in order to address community needs
as it relates to land use and transportation. The Midtown Specific Plan provides a new vision for
the approximately 589 acre area of land in central Milpitas. This area provides for approximately
1400 units of housing, reinvestment in the Great Mall, the VTA Light Rail and the future Bay Area
Rapid Transit line. Recent additions to Midtown Milpitas include the Milpitas Library and the
County’s multi-regional Medical Facility. The Transit Area Specific Plan is a plan for the
redevelopment of an approximately 437-acre area in the southern portion of the City that currently
includes a number of industrial uses near the Great Mall shopping center. This plan proposes
redevelopment of this area with 7,109 dwelling units, 993,843 square feet of office space, 340
hotel rooms and 287,075 square feet of retail space centered around the proposed Milpitas BART
station and the VTA Light Rail system. Both these plans forecast traffic conditions include 2030
development as well as the VTA estimates of land use in the year 2030 in all parts of the County
outside of the City’s Planning Area.
          In the Planning Area, overall employment projections based on ABAG’s Projections 2009
 were appropriately converted to land uses and distributed based on the Midtown and Transit
 Area Specific Plan designations. The model was used to produce forecasts of peak-hour traffic
 on the freeways, arterials and many of the collector streets in the City. Results of the traffic
 analysis are included in Appendix A. Major improvements needed to accommodate these
 anticipated traffic increases are discussed in Section 3.3.
      3.3          Street Network and Classification
      A hierarchy of streets will be required to provide access to future development and maintain
 acceptable levels of service. The circulation network in the General Plan Diagram (Figure 2-1)
 identifies the functional classifications of key routes. A route's design is determined by the
 projected traffic level on the street. The classifications and their required access standards are
 identified in Table 3-3. Street widths, number of lanes, and the need for on-street parking are to
 be tailored to individual conditions.

     Major Improvements Needed
     Due to regional through-traffic along sub-regional routes, such as State Route 237 and
Montague Expressway, a large increase in traffic by year 2035 is anticipated. In addition, the
completion of the Midtown Specific Plan and Transit Area Specific Plan, along with recent
development activity has forecasted the increase of cumulative traffic. It is anticipated that
segments of the following Milpitas roadways will have higher levels of traffic volume by year
2030:
           •  Abel Street
           •  Dixon Landing Road
           •  Main Street
           •  McCarthy Boulevard
           •  Milpitas Boulevard
           •  Montague Expressway
           •  Tasman Drive/Great Mall Parkway
     Mitigation measures have been identified in order to alleviate the traffic pressure on these
roadways. Major improvement projects are reviewed annually and are included in the VTP/RTP
in order to be eligible for funding. Currently, these projects included are:

              from four to six lanes, including pedestrian and bicycle facilities
         •    Dixon Landing Road/Milpitas Boulevard Intersection and Widening Improvements.
    Consistency with the Capital Improvement Program
    Because of the incremental nature of development, the General Plan does not outline a
schedule for the improvements to the City's street system discussed above. Projects identified in
the Plan will be prioritized and included in the City's ongoing Capital Improvement Program (CIP).
Modifications to the CIP are to be made as a normal part of the City's budgeting and
implementation process and do not require amendment of the General Plan.
    3.4           Transportation Demand Management
    The term "Transportation Demand Management" (TDM) refers to measures designed to
reduce peak-period auto traffic, by making more efficient use of existing transportation resources,
and expanding and emphasizing more sustainable non-auto alternatives. These include public
transit, flexible working hours, telecommuting, carpooling and vanpooling, and incentives to
increase the use of these alternatives. TDM has become increasingly important in the effort to
enhance mobility through efficient use of alternative modes of transportation, and in meeting
federal and state air quality standards.
    A successful TDM program is an essential and important element in the continuing effort to
achieve acceptable levels of traffic service based on the standards in Section 3.2. The specific
objectives of TDM are to:
         •    Reduce peak hour traffic congestion by reducing the number of single-occupant
              vehicle trips associated with commuting by provide travelers with alternate mobility
              choices;
         •    Reduce or delay the need for street improvements by making more efficient use of
              existing facilities;
         •    Reduce future air pollution concentrations and strive towards meeting state and
              federal ambient air pollution standards by reducing the number of single-occupant
              vehicle trips associated with commuting; and
         •    Reduce consumption of energy for transportation uses, thereby contributing to the
              national policy to increase energy self-sufficiency.
    Transportation Control Measures
                                                                                               3-11

MILPITAS GENERAL PLAN
    Under the California Clean Air Act (CCAA) of 1988, the Bay Area Air Quality Management
District (BAAQMD) is required to prepare a Clean Air Plan (CAP) to achieve state standards for
ozone and carbon monoxide. The Bay Area 2010 Clean Air Plan (CAP) provides a
comprehensive plan to improve Bay Area air quality and protect public health. The CAP defines
a control strategy that the Air District and its partners will implement to: (1) reduce emissions and
decrease ambient concentrations of harmful pollutants; (2) safeguard public health by reducing
exposure to air pollutants that pose the greatest health risk, with an emphasis on protecting the
communities most heavily impacted by air pollution; and (3) reduce greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions to protect the climate.
    The CCAA states that attainment plans should emphasize reducing emissions from
transportation and area wide sources. The Act requires air districts to adopt, implement, and
enforce Transportation Control Measures (TCMs). TCMs are defined in state law as “any
strategy to reduce vehicle trips, vehicle use, vehicle miles traveled, vehicle idling, or traffic
congestion for the purpose of reducing motor vehicle emissions.” Although cars are about 90
percent cleaner than they were 20 years ago and fleet turnover will produce the bulk of mobile
source emission reductions in the future, the state plan still requires TCMs as a complementary
strategy. MTC develops and updates a list of TCMs to the BAAQMD.
    Transit
    Only 1.6 percent of Milpitas' workforce uses public transportation to travel to work (see Table
3–1). The primary function of transit in the City is to transport residents from the City to
commercial and employment centers and to other transit stations in surrounding jurisdictions.
The bus transfer station and park-and-ride lot, at the Great Mall transit center acts as a hub for
most of the bus lines that serve Milpitas. Frequent service (less than 30 minute headway) is
offered primarily during peak hours (6 AM to 9 AM and 3 PM to 6 PM on weekdays) while
headway increase to 30 minutes or more during the midday, after 6 PM and on weekends and
holidays.
    Bus. The VTA provides a majority of the bus service for Milpitas. Local bus routes provide
service to Mountain View, Sunnyvale, Great America, southeast and east San Jose, and

     3.5         Pedestrian and Bicycle Circulation
     The relatively flat topography of the Valley Floor and the City's mild Mediterranean climate
are conducive to walking and bicycling. Yet, few residents utilize these means of transportation
for commuting. Walking and bicycling constituted only about 4.7 percent of the total trips made
by City's employed residents in 20091 (see Table 3-1). Measures aggressively promoting and
accommodating alternative mode choice should prove to increase this percentage in the future.
     Many parts of the City also hold good potential for recreational biking and walking, including
along Coyote Creek and within the Hillside Area. There are also additional opportunities along
many of the creek channels and the Hetch-Hetchy rights-of-way.
     Milpitas is crossed by two freeways and two railroad tracks; which fragment the City's
circulation system, including facilities for biking and walking. In addition, many shopping centers
and neighborhoods are accessed through a limited number of entrances, through which
pedestrians and bicyclists must compete with the automobile for safe passage to their
destination. As Milpitas is approaching build out, it is critical that bikeways and trails be
addressed with each planned development and redevelopment program.
    Bicycling and walking are recognized as vital forms of transportation in the Federal legislation,
which calls upon the states to maximize the efficiency of the existing roadway system and to
provide for intermodal transportation. Pedestrians and bicyclists are integral to the success of
the intermodal system.
     Bikeways
     The City’s existing system of bike lanes and routes support this transportation mode. The
City’s Bicycle Pedestrian Advisory Committee (BPAC) serves as an advisory body to the City
Council on matters relating to planning, modifications and expansion of the City’s Bikeway
System. BPAC also promotes safety, education and awareness of bicycling and pedestrian
issues.
     The City has adopted a Bikeways Master Plan which includes:
          •  Goals, objectives, and benchmarks for bicycling
          •  A review of existing bicycling conditions
          •  Descriptions of Relevant Local and Regional Plans and Polices related to Bicycling
          •  An analysis of bicycling needs
          •  Recommended Bicycling Projects, Cost Estimates, and Priorities for implementation
          •  Recommended Bicycling Programs
          •  Funding Sources for Bicycle Projects and Programs
          •  Design Guidelines with best practices for implementing bikeways

                       Lanes or Bike Paths. Bike Routes are shared facilities, either with motor
                       vehicles on the street or with pedestrians on sidewalks.
     The VTA Bicycle Plan identifies regional bicycle routes that provide for inter-city commuting.
Portions of the Milpitas Bikeway System are identified in this regional plan. The VTA Bicycle
Technical Guidelines is a guide for local agencies in Santa Clara County that present standards
for planning, designing, operating retrofitting, and maintaining roadways and bikeways as best
practices.
     Trails
     Milpitas Trails Master Plan. Recognizing that an off-street trail system will enhance the
quality of life within Milpitas by providing an alternative transportation system, expanding
recreational opportunities and improving the environmental conditions of those trail corridors that
parallel creeks, the City Council adopted the Milpitas Trails Master Plan on June 3, 1997.
Several of the trail corridors identified in the Trails Master Plan will provide direct, grade-
separated routes from home to work, school and shopping. The direct access and lack of street
crossings provided by grade separated facilities enhances the convenience of the off-street trail
system. This added convenience encourages more people to bicycle and walk. The trail system
will provide access to the Town Center, the Great Mall, all of the major employment centers,
numerous schools and parks and the Tasman Corridor Light Rail stations.
     Approximately 35 miles of trails are identified in the Master Plan. Of these, 6 miles have
been built and 29 miles are proposed, including about 4 miles of on-street connectors proposed
to link together the off-street system. The majority of trails identified in the plan follow the creeks,
rail corridors and utility right of ways that traverse the City. In addition, the Midtown Specific Plan
promotes the development of these trails. The trails are categorized into the following four
groups:

CIRCULATION ELEMENT
                3-15
MILPITAS GENERAL PLAN
     •     Regional Trails are those routes identified in the Santa Clara County Trails Master Plan
           as having national, state or regional significance. In Milpitas these are the Coyote
           Creek Trail, the San Francisco Bay Trail and the Juan Bautista de Anza National
           Historic Trails (which share the same alignment in Milpitas), and the Bay Area Ridge
           Trail.
     •     City Trails provide north-south and east-west cross-town routes and extend beyond the
           City limits to Fremont and San Jose. These trails provide recreation and transportation
           benefits by linking neighborhoods with employment centers, shopping districts, schools,
           and transit facilities. City Trails include the Berryessa Creek Trail, Calera Creek Trail,
           Hetch-Hetchy Trail, Penitencia Creek Trail, and Wrigley Creek/Union Pacific Railroad
           Trail.
     •     Neighborhood Trails connect homes with schools and parks and provide pedestrian and
           bicycle access to local shops and markets. They include the Hillcrest Park/Ben Rogers
           Park Trail, McCarthy Ranch Jogging Trail and Par Course, Rancho Milpitas Middle
           School/Sinnott School Trail and the Yellowstone Park Trail.
     •     On-Street Connectors consist of on-street bicycle lanes and routes that link segments of
           the off-street trail system where no other route is available. They include Calaveras
           Road, Yosemite Drive and North Park Victoria Drive.
     The Trails Master Plan details trail types and the specific corridors included in the plan, offers
general analysis, prioritizes trail projects and provides preliminary budget estimates. The Master
Plan notes that detailed trail alignment studies for each corridor will be needed as trail projects
move forward towards development.
     Pedestrian Support
     Sidewalks and Streetscapes. In general, pedestrian support has similar infrastructure and
safety needs as bikeways and trails. It should be identified that pedestrian activity (as well as the
enjoyment of walking) is increased when walkway facilities are safe, comfortable and attractive
for all users including children, seniors and persons with disabilities. Some of the best ways to
enhance walkways are through the provision of adequate sidewalk width, lighting, buffers
between the pedestrians, median islands, curb extensions, safe crossing opportunities, and
ample landscaping, particularly street trees. In addition, other enhancements at signalized
crossings such as adequate pedestrian crossing timing and accessible pedestrian signals near
senior complexes and medical facilities further improve access for users with slower walking
pace and sensory loss. Obstructions to movement should be removed to the extent feasible and
planned for accordingly.
     Street Trees. Street trees have soothing visual impact, provide shade and a habit for wildlife
and add to property values. However, City maintenance costs can be expected to increase as
street trees grow taller, requiring additional and more difficult pruning. Sidewalk damage is one
of the difficult problems in street maintenance, and one reason for the increased use of

monolithic sidewalks located next to the curb, which widens the appearance of the street and
reduces pedestrians’ sense of safety by putting them closer to traffic.
     Planning for Children. The Milpitas Suggested Routes to School program encourages
parents and students to walk or bike to school by identifying obstacles, promoting safety, and
suggested improvements. A strong education component is included in the program.
     Planning for Seniors. Adequate pedestrian timing and accessible pedestrian signals for
crossing should be in place at signalized crossings in the vicinity of senior residential complexes,
civic and medical facilities to improve the pedestrian experience for senior citizens.
     Planning for Persons with Disabilities. As with the measures suggested for senior citizens,
adequate pedestrian timing and accessible pedestrian signals for signalized crossings should be
in place where appropriate, such as civic and medical facilities. Obstructions to movement should
also be removed and placed in appropriate locations during the planning stages to maximize
movement for those with disabilities.
                                                                                                3-17

MILPITAS GENERAL PLAN
     3.6      Goods Movement
     Providing adequate circulation for trucks is necessary for economic development of the City
by facilitating transportation of goods and products. In Milpitas, there is a four-ton weight limit
restriction on all streets, except those shown on Figure 3-3. Therefore, by default, through truck
traffic can only utilize the exempted streets, which can be referred to as “truck routes.” The
routes shown in the Figure serve as primary commercial truck movements entering and leaving
the City. Trucks, however, can use any street to get to and from specific delivery locations when
a restricted street is on the direct path to the origin or destination and there is no other permitted
facility.
     Where feasible, efforts should be made to minimize conflicts along streets with heavy
pedestrian activities by implementing parallel corridors for goods movements.

                                      OPEN SPACE & ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION ELEMENT
     Purpose
     According to state law, the purpose of a Conservation Element is to assure the
conservation, development and use of natural resources including water, forests, soils,
rivers, fisheries, wildlife, minerals and other natural resources. Similarly, the purpose of an
Open Space Element is to assure the continued availability of land for the managed
production of resources (such as food and fiber), to protect the enjoyment of scenic beauty
and ensure provision of recreation, to identify and preserve lands whose indiscriminate
development could compromise public health and safety, and to preserve natural resources.
     State law also requires that an Open Space Element contain an action program
consisting of specific programs to implement the open space plan. Milpitas' open space
action plan is the sum total of the open space and conservation policies in this Element of
the General Plan and the open space proposals depicted on the General Plan Land Use
Diagram.
     Relationship to Other Elements
     The Open Space and Environmental Conservation Elements are correlated with the
Land Use Element which designates park and open space areas.
                                                                                               4-1

     4.1          Parks and Recreational Facilities
     Inventory and Classification
     Existing parks and recreation facilities are summarized in Table 4-1. As of October 2010, the
Planning Area included approximately 201 developed city parkland and 1,544 acres of the Ed
Levin Park, part of which is within City limits. Definitions of the General Plan park classifications
follow.
     Community Parks. Community Parks typically contain regulation-size ball fields and courts,
space for informal games and activities, picnic and gathering areas, children play areas and
parking. The only existing community park, the 24.4 acre Sports Center, serves as a special-use
facility because it contains sports fields and facilities.
     Neighborhood Parks. Neighborhood parks in the City fall into two categories: typical walk-
to parks that serve the immediate neighborhood, providing open space for informal play, and
parks containing a community-use facility, such as a regulation size, prepared ball field. In
addition to serving the immediate neighborhood, the latter category also draws people from the
larger community, some of whom may drive to the facility. The City's current inventory includes
43.3 acres of neighborhood parks.
     Special-use Parks. This category includes mini-parks, linear parks, creek trails, flood
retention areas, Community Garden, Senior Center, Rancho Milpitas Middle School Ball field,
and Community /Civic Center. A total of 15 acres of the City's inventory consists of special-use
parks. Additional linear parks through the creek trail system will be developed within the Midtown
and Transit Specific Plan areas with future residential development.
     Urban Parks: Urban parks are small facilities, generally less than one acre in size, which
accommodate the daily recreation or passive needs of nearby residents. They typically can
include children’s play areas, sitting areas, and limited green space, but are not large enough to
contain sports fields.
     Linear Parks: Linear parks are narrow corridors of land that have been developed primarily
as a trail system. Linear parks may also include other small scale facilities such as picnic tables
and benches. Milpitas has taken advantage of the Hetch-Hetchy right-of-ways for the
development of a linear park system.
     Regional Parks. Regional parks are generally larger than 100 acres in size and serve the
entire City or the region. While regional parks can provide for varying degrees of recreation
activity, a portion of the park is generally maintained in a rustic setting for passive recreation use.
While a number of regional parks serve Milpitas residents, the Planning Area includes only one
such facility, the Ed Levin County Park.
     Trails. The trail system within the City consist of several miles of pedestrian and bicycle
trails on flood control levees and on the Hetch Hetchy corridor. The 1997 Trails Master Plan and
2010 Park and Recreation Open Space Plan establish goals for developing and enhancing city
trails and connections to regional trails.
                                                                                                    4-3

MILPITAS GENERAL PLAN
    Other Facilities in the Planning Area include:
    School Sites. The City has a joint-use agreement with the Milpitas Unified School District
(MUSD) that allows mutual use of facilities at a reduced rental rate.
    Private Recreation Facilities. Besides parks and recreation facilities listed above, private
recreation facilities in the Planning Area include: Fitness for 10, 24-Hour Fitness, Fitness 19, USA
Fitness, South Bay Athletic Cub, Golfland, Summitpointe Golf Course, and Spring Valley Golf
Course. Newly developed residential communities contain private recreational facilities and
amenities such as pools, community rooms, and playgrounds.

    Current Plans
    The City of Milpitas is committed to providing an interconnected system of park and
recreational facilities and services for its residents. The Park and Recreation Master Plan was
adopted in February 2010 and outlines the visions, goals, and implementation for the
development and maintenance of Milpitas’ park system. The Park and Recreation Master Plan

MILPITAS GENERAL PLAN
      Standards
      To guide implementation of park and recreation proposals, standards relating to park size,
distribution, and primary service area are established in the General Plan (Table 4-2). Figure 4-1
depicts areas of the City within a 1/4 and 3/8-mile service radius of existing and future parks.
                                                             Table 4-2

      Future Need
      Current General Plan designations at build out would result in a population of approximately
106,100. With redevelopment and infill of the Midtown and Transit Specific Plan area, it is
important to provide appropriately-scaled parks and open spaces to serve new residents and
improve the amenity and livability of the Midtown and Transit Plan areas. Improving the creek
trail system will link the Midtown and Transit Plan areas to the larger park system throughout the
city. The Transit Area Specific Plan plans for 30 acres of new parks and trails to be developed
upon build out. Their locations have been specifically designated to ensure each neighborhood
is serviced by a park within comfortable walking distance (See the Map on page 3.1-7). The
remaining growth projected by ABAG outside of the Transit Area can be adequately serviced with
park and open space by continued adherence to the adopted service areas and acreage goals.

    4.2             Biological Resources
    The Planning Area and the surrounding region offer a variety of wildlife habitats, such as
marshlands, riparian areas, grasslands and woodlands. While much of the City is built-out,
species supported by habitats such as Coyote Creek, salt marsh and mud flats to the west and
the rolling hills of Ed Levin Park and beyond to the east include the California coastal deer,
gophers and water snakes, as well as rattlers, songbirds such as the mocking bird and the red-
winged blackbird, upland game birds, pheasant, quails and doves, squirrels, and bobcats. Fish
species found include bass, catfish, trout and other non-game species which may be found in the
Calaveras Reservoir (east of the Planning Area), Sandy Wool Lake, periodically in Coyote Creek,
and impounded waters within the foothills.
    Special Status Species in the Planning Area
    Certain species are recognized as needing special protection under state and federal law
due to their rare, endangered, or threatened status. These species are afforded varying degrees
of protection through the applicable laws and regulations of the Federal Endangered Species Act
(ESA), the California Native Plant Protection Act (NPPA), the California Endangered Species Act
(CESA), and the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
    The California Natural Diversity Data Base (CNDDB), run by the California Department of
Fish and Game (CDFG), is the most complete single-source inventory of officially (state and
federal) listed rare, endangered, and threatened animals and plants, plus those considered by
the scientific community to be deserving of such listing. An October 2010 search of the CNDDB
for the Milpitas and Calaveras Reservoir Quadrangles identified the following 8 species with
special status. It should be noted the Milpitas and Calaveras Reservoir Quadrangles contain
areas that are outside of the Milpitas Planning area.

     The CNDDB also inventories both terrestrial and aquatic natural communities that are of
extremely high quality and/or very limited distribution; no such communities were found in the
search.
     The California Native Plant Society's (CNPS) Inventory of Rare and Endangered Vascular
Plants of California for the Milpitas and Calaveras Reservoir quads were also consulted. The
inventory contains a list of plants presumed extinct in California, Rare and Endangered plants in
California and elsewhere, Rare and Endangered plants in California but more common
elsewhere, plant species for which more information is needed, and plants of limited distribution.
An October 2010 search of the CNPS inventory for the Milpitas and Calaveras Reservoir
Quadrants identified the following 4 plant species with special status.

     The results of the CNDDB and the CNPS search are summarized in the Appendix C. The
appendix also contains a listing of sensitive species in Santa Clara County – the presence of
most has not been established in the Planning Area.
     A brief discussion of the species potentially known to occur with the Planning Area are as
follows:
     Salt Marsh Harvest Mouse (Reithrodontomys raviventris). Listed as “Endangered” at the
state and federal level, the salt marsh harvest mouse is confined to salt marshes about the Bay.
The salt marsh harvest mouse is commonly associated with dense growth of pickleweed.1 A
non-burrowing mammal, it requires higher areas for flood escape. While the salt marsh harvest

MILPITAS GENERAL PLAN
mouse has been sighted primarily west of the Planning Area in the marshes along Alviso Slough,
Albrae Slough and Coyote Creek, one capture occurred at the San Jose-Santa Clara sewage
disposal site and another two miles south of Fremont between Coyote Creek and the Nimitz
Freeway in 1985.
     Golden Eagle (Aguila chrysaetos). Listed as “Fully Protected” the golden eagle is found in
rolling foothills or coast-range terrain, where wide open grassland turns to scattered oaks,
sycamores or large digger pines. Nesting habitat can be found in cliff-walled canyons or large
trees in open areas. In May 1993, two juvenile Golden eagles were banded at the upper end of
Calera Creek, within the Ed Levin County Park. This is the only known site within the Planning
Area.
     California Tiger Salamander (Ambystoma californiense). Listed as a “Threatened” by
CDFG, the California tiger salamander is most commonly found in annual grassland habitat, but
also occurs in the grassy understory of valley-foothill hardwood habitats, and uncommonly along
stream courses in valley-foothill riparian habitats.
     California Red-legged Frog (Rana draytonii).           Listed as “Threatened” by CFDG, the
California red-legged frog is commonly found near foothills, grassland, and streamside habitats.
These amphibians breed near water sources such as lakes, ponds, reservoirs, and marshes.
     Burrowing Owl (Athene cunicularia). Listed as Species of Special Concern by the CDFG,
the Burrowing Owl routinely lives and nests underground. The burrowing owls may occupy a
range of open habitats that include grasslands, treeless plains, and in urban areas such as golf
courses, and undeveloped vacant lots. In a survey conducted in July 2003, twelve burrowing owls
were observed on and adjacent to northwestern and western portions of the KB Terra Serena
Residential Development.
     Steelhead-Central California Cost DPS (Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus). Listed as
“Threatened” by CDFG, the Steelhead fish spend their adult life in the ocean but spawn and rear
in freshwater streams and rivers. Their habitat consists of shaded pools of small, cool, low-flow
upstream reaches as well as warm water habitats below dams or pipeline outfalls. According to
the CNDDB, Steelhead fish are known to be present in Coyote Creek and are reported to spawn
in gravel substrates in nontidal reaches of Coyote Creek upstream of the confluence with
Penitencia Creek.
     Alkali Milk-Vetch (Astragalus tener vartener). Listed as Rare by CNPS, the alkali milk-
vetch is found in valley and foothill grassland, and vernal pools. The CNPS notes this species as
being endangered in a portion of its range, endemic to California and that its “occurrence [is]
limited to one or a few highly restricted populations or present in such small numbers that it is
seldom reported.” The alkali milk-vetch was recorded in southern Milpitas in the region bounded
by Calaveras Boulevard to the north, Dempsey Road to the east, Capitol Avenue to the South
and the Nimitz Freeway in the west. Although presumed extant according to CNDDB, the last
siting was in 1905.

    4.3           Agricultural Resources
    For background information and policies relating to soils in the Planning Area, see Section
5.1: Geology, Soils and Seismic Hazards.
    Important Farmland
    As part of the Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Plan (FMMP), the State Department of
Conservation employs the Important Farmlands Inventory to classify farmland as prime, of
statewide importance, unique, or of local importance based on data provided by the USDA Natural
Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Classification of land as prime or of statewide
importance is determined by the soil type as well as current land use. The Farmland Mapping
and Monitoring Program does not classify publicly owned land for which there is an adopted
policy preventing agricultural use.
    Categories of farmland employed by the FMMP1 include:
    Prime Farmland: Land which has the best combination of physical and chemical
characteristics for the production of crops.
    Unique Farmland: Land of lesser quality soils used for the production of specific high
economic value crops.
    Farmland of Local Importance: Small orchards, primarily in the foothill area.
    Grazing Land: Land on which the existing vegetation is suited for the grazing of livestock.
    While urbanization has resulted in loss of a considerable amount of farmland in the Planning
Area, the Area does include some farmlands. The Santa Clara County Important Farmland Map
(2008) depicts that there is no farmland of statewide importance in the Planning Area. However,
within the city limits, prime farmland exists between N. McCarthy Boulevard and Coyote Creek,
north of State Route 237.
    Crops in the Planning Area
    A small part of the Planning Area, along the Coyote Creek, is used for growing a variety of
truck and field crops2. These include wheat, walnuts, grapes, and apricots. Figure 4-3 shows
crops in the Planning Area according to type.

Urban Runoff (Stormwater) Pollution Prevention
     The San Francisco Bay Regional Water Control Board (RWQCB) is responsible for
enforcing the state’s Porter-Cologne Water Quality Act and the Federal Clean Water Act. The
Water Board’s Water Quality Control Plan (Basin Plan) identifies beneficial uses of San Francisco
Bay and its tributaries and sets forth criteria and programs for protection of beneficial uses. The
RWQCB has issued National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits to Bay
Area counties, water districts and municipalities. The permits mandate comprehensive programs
to reduce urban runoff pollution by targeting pollutant reduction and surface flow prevention from
urban development activities. Milpitas, along with twelve other cities and towns in northern Santa
Clara County, Santa Clara County, and the Santa Clara Valley Water District are Co-permittees
under a single stormwater NPDES permit. The NPDES permit was issued in 1990 and reissued,
with additional requirements, in 1995, 2001, and 2009.
     Water Conservation
     Prompted by the recent drought and water shortages, the City in 1993 adopted a Water
Efficient Landscapes Ordinance and in 1994 adopted the Water Conservation Ordinance. The
Ordinance seeks to promote conservation and efficient use of water by restricting new and
rehabilitated landscaping for public agency projects, private commercial and industrial projects,
and common-area landscaping in single-family and multifamily subdivisions and planned unit
developments to maximum applied water allowances. It also requires preparation of landscape
documentation packages for new and rehabilitated landscapes.
     Recycled Water
     The City of Milpitas desires to conserve potable water supplies and encourages the use of
recycled water for appropriate uses. Potable water shall not be used for irrigation if recycled
water is available except as specified in the City Municipal Code.
                                                                                                4-13

MILPITAS GENERAL PLAN
     4.5         Mineral Resources
     Urban preemption of prime mineral deposits and conflicts between mining and other uses
throughout California led to passage of the Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975
(SMARA), which establishes policies for conservation and development of mineral lands, and
contains specific provisions for the classification of mineral lands by the State Geologist.
         SMARA requires all cities and counties to incorporate in their general plans mapped
designations approved by the State Mining and Geology Board. These designations are to
include lands categorized as Mineral Resource Zones, the most significant of which is a
designation of mineral resources that are of regional or statewide significance.
         When considering mineral extraction, three critical factors must be weighed: impact
upon the natural environment, regional need for the minerals extracted, and impacts upon the
community.
     Existing Mineral Resources
     The Planning Area contains four areas identified by the State Geologist as containing
Regionally Significant Construction Aggregate Resources. These areas, located in the foothills
outside City limits (see Figure 4-5), are part of the South San Francisco Bay Production-
Consumption Region and contain sandstone deposits. Three of the sites are located west of the
Ed Levin Park along Tularcitos and Loa Caches creeks, and the fourth is along Scott Creek at the
County line. All of the areas are being currently quarried.
     The scenic damage that has already occurred from these quarry operations is readily
apparent; it is also possible for such activities to adversely affect water resources. In addition,
these quarries must haul many tons of product off-site. When the only means of transportation
for the product is by trucks passing through urbanized areas and transversing narrow hillside
roads, there are a great many impacts upon the community.
     Santa Clara County Policies
         Santa Clara County's Mineral Resources Element was adopted in 1994. Policies
included in the Element call for new quarry operations within a city's Sphere of Influence to be
consistent with that City's General Plan. Approval of new or significant expansion of existing
operations would require environmental assessment and new operations that are visible from the
Valley Floor are discouraged.

MILPITAS GENERAL PLAN
         4.6      Historical and Cultural Resources
         Background information that follows is summarized from the Historic Sites Inventory
(1990) and the Historic Resources Master Plan (1993).
    Prehistoric Period
    The lands now occupied by the City of Milpitas were once a part of the home territory of the
Tamyen tribelet of Costanoan (Ohlone) Indians. Like other Costanoan groups, the Tamyen
maintained a few year-round village sites but also visited various temporary camps at different
seasons of the year to hunt and gather food as it became available.
    The presence of a deposit of cinnabar (later famous as the mines of New Almaden) within
Tamyen territory increased traffic through the early Milpitas area. The cinnabar (used as a body
paint) stimulated considerable trade. The deposits were known over much of northern California,
and parties from as far away as the Columbia River journeyed to Costanoan territory to obtain it.
Trade for other items such as wooden bows, salt, and pine nuts, also brought many visitor to the
Tamyen territories.
    Remnants of Lifestyle. Two notable Costanoan village sites lie within the city limits of
Milpitas. One, a huge shellmound near the present-day Elmwood Rehabilitation Center, was
discovered in 1949 and dates back to the eighteenth century. The other, on the site of the Alviso
Adobe near the corner of Calaveras and Piedmont, is at least 3,000 years old and is one of only
a handful of archaeological sites in California with such a long history of continuous occupation.
    Historic Period
    Aboriginal Milpitas must have been cris-crossed with a network of paths from village to village
and from village to camp. For centuries, these aboriginal footpaths and deer trails were the only
roadways of Milpitas. The year 1769 marked the most dramatic event since human beings first
migrated into the Bay Area; in that year, the expedition of Gaspar de Portola inaugurated the
historic era, bringing in its wake a host of changes. The expedition passed through Milpitas.
    The Spanish presence in the South Bay region was rapidly modified over the next few
decades. Over the following half-century, the mission holdings were broken up by secularization,
supplanted by private land grants such as the Rancho de Milpitas.
    The area that was to become Milpitas was already achieving distinction as a stopover point
by the late 1840s when the Higuera Adobe welcomed travelers on the immigrant trail

between Sutter's Fort and San Jose, via Livermore Pass. In 1855, settlers in the Calaveras
Valley petitioned for a county road across the flats to Alviso. The resulting intersection — where
the Alviso Road crossed the Mission Road — encouraged the development of Milpitas. By the
late 1850s, a stage line was operating between San Jose and Oakland, with stops at Milpitas,
including one at the Higuera Adobe, operating as a hotel and stage depot. Soon businesses
such as general stores, stables, saloons, hotels, blacksmiths, carriage shops, and the all-
important post office catered to the needs of farming families.
     Historic Sites. The historically and architecturally significant buildings in Milpitas are
extremely diverse in style, as well as in method and period of construction.
     The first structures to be built in Milpitas were adobe houses located along the foothills east
of town (now east of Piedmont and Evans Road) and along both sides of Calaveras Road
between Main Street and the foothills. During the 1850s to 1870s, many frame farmhouses were
constructed.
     Businesses that catered to travelers (saloons, restaurants, blacksmiths, service stations, and
hotels) and those that supplied the local population (general stores, meat markets, lumber yards)
developed near the intersection of the Alviso-Milpitas Road and the San Jose-Oakland Road.
Clustered around this nucleus of commercial and service buildings were the homes of the
merchants, railway employees, and working men of the community.
     Milpitas changed little until 1953, when the Ford Motor Plant was built at the south end of
town. Within the next two decades virtually all of the older buildings in the center of town were
demolished; leaving two corridors along the eastern foothills and the western highway fairly
intact.
     Historical and Cultural Resources Preservation Programs
     Cultural Resources Preservation Program. Procedures to identify and designate historical
and cultural resources, and to guide their preservation are outlined in the City's Zoning, Planning
and Annexation Code. Cultural resources and historic districts are designated by the City
Council on the advice of the Parks, Recreation and Cultural Resources Commission. Currently,
there are fifteen sites officially designated and locally registered as a Milpitas Cultural Resources.
Of the fourteen sites, the Alviso Adobe and Milpitas Grammar School are included in the National
Register of Historic Places.

     4.7          Scenic Resources and Routes
     Milpitas’ image is of an urban community located at the foot of a significant section of the
Mount Diablo Range. The foothills, sparsely settled, represent a semi-wilderness of rugged
terrain, remote plateaus and distant views.
     Scenic Resources
          The foothills and the tree-lined Coyote Creek corridor provide Milpitas with a scenic
backdrop and visual reference points. Also important to Milpitas' identity are the major entryways
of the City. Scenic Resources could be both natural and man-made. Figure 4-6 identifies
hillsides, ridges, visually significant vegetation and other elements that are critical in shaping the
City's scenic identity.
     Scenic Routes
     In order to maintain and improve the character of and views of scenic resources from streets,
maximize access to parks, open space and other resources, the General Plan establishes a
well-integrated network of Scenic Routes. These are streets or corridors which pass through an
area of scenic value, provide efficient connections between such areas, or provide distant views
of Scenic Resources. Two types of Scenic Routes are established (see Figure 4-6):
     Scenic Corridor. Scenic Corridors are located along designated streets that pass through
an area of scenic value. Scenic Corridors include the street rights-of-way and extend 200 feet
from the center line of the streets along which they are located. Areas within the corridors are
subject to special development controls for the purpose of retaining and enhancing nearby views
or maintaining unobstructed distant views. Public projects will also be reviewed for compliance
with this plan.
     Scenic Connector. A designated street connecting or providing access to Scenic Corridors
or distant views. A Scenic Connector may not necessarily traverse an area of scenic value, and
the abutting land is not subject to the Scenic Corridor land use controls. However, special design
treatment — which may include roadside landscaping, undergrounding of utility lines, and street
furnishings — will be carried out to provide a visual continuity with the Scenic Corridors.

    4.8      Waste Management and Recycling
    The City of Milpitas and Santa Clara County Integrated Waste Management Plans (IWMP)
comply with state-mandated waste reduction goals specified in Public Resources Code 40500
(Assembly Bill 939). PRC 40500 requires local agencies to implement source reduction,
recycling, and composting activities to reduce solid waste generation by 25 percent by the year
1995, and by 50 percent by the year 2000.
    As a part of PRC 40500, each city and county is required to prepare a Source Reduction and
Recycling Element (SRRE) and a Household Hazardous Waste Element (HHWE). Together, the
SRRE and HHWE comprise the City's IWMP.
    Solid Waste Disposal Facilities
    Newby Island landfill, located on Dixon Landing Road in San Jose serves the City. It is a
Class III landfill, with an estimated lifespan of an additional 11 years (to 2021).
    Source Reduction and Recycling
    The City's Source Reduction and Recycling Element provides a summary and analysis of
existing and needed source reduction, recycling, and composting programs and facilities,
strategies for handling special wastes, and for funding. Implementation measures for both short
(next 5 years) and medium term (next 10 years) are specified and include multifamily residential
and non-residential recycling, public awareness, and regulatory programs. Implementation
measures outlined in the Element are expected to lead to diversion of an estimated 13.6 to 19.5
percent of the waste stream by 2000.
    Goals adopted as part of the City's Source Reduction and Recycling Element include:
    •    Meet or exceed state-mandated solid waste disposition rates by maximizing source
         reduction, recycling and composting opportunities for Milpitas residents and businesses;
    •    Motivate the residential and business sectors to reduce and recycle solid waste;
    •    Ensure that all land development projects provide adequate space and design for waste
         reduction and management activities and equipment;
    •    Encourage the development and expansion of local and regional markets for diverted
         materials;
    •    Provide solid waste management services that minimize environmental impacts, ensure
         public health and safety and facilitate waste reduction efforts; and
    •    Increase residents' awareness of proper disposal and reduction methods for wastes.
                                                                                              4-21

MILPITAS GENERAL PLAN
     Hazardous Waste
     Hazardous materials management includes the identification, proper transport, and disposal
of hazardous materials. Hazardous materials include liquids, solids, and gases which by
themselves, or when placed in contact with other materials, can result in contamination of soil or
water, poisonous vapors, fires, or explosions. Hazardous materials can enter the environment
via air, soil transport, or surface runoff. Improper storage or disposal can contaminate soil and
groundwater and pose a general health hazard to the population. Hazardous materials are used
and created everyday by some industries, and include common household items such as
insecticides, waste motor oil, and cleaning fluids.
     Nearly all of the hazardous materials transported through Santa Clara County, and the
Planning Area, are carried by truck on the freeways and state highways. Little or none of the
hazardous materials is transported through via rail. County roads and city streets are used to
transport locally generated wastes from the source to the regional highway system.
     Household Hazardous Waste (HHW)
     Hazardous materials, used in many household products (e.g., drain cleaners, waste oil,
cleaning fluids, insecticides, and car batteries), are often improperly disposed of as part of normal
household trash. These materials can interact with other chemicals to create a risk to the general
population and can also result in soil and groundwater contamination.
     Since 1985, Milpitas residents have had access to disposal of their HHW. Funded by the
City from the General Fund, the current program is conducted by the Santa Clara County
Household Hazardous Waste Collection Program. The County hosts mobile pickup at different
sites throughout the County, twice yearly in Milpitas. Residents call the County HHW program
hotline to make appointments to drop off their hazardous wastes, and the City pays a per-vehicle
fee for the service.
     The City has since October 1993 been participating in a countywide effort to site and develop
permanent recycling and disposable facilities for HHW. These facilities, currently in the planning
stages, will also serve small commercial generators of hazardous waste.
     In 1986, AB 2984 (Tanner Bill) was passed, establishing a process for the development of
hazardous waste management plans for all California counties, regional councils of government
and the state. In 1989 Milpitas participated with other Santa Clara County cities in developing the
Hazardous Waste Management Plan (CHWMP). This plan was subsequently approved by the
County Board of Supervisors and the City Councils of every participating city, including Milpitas.
In 1991 the CHWMP was amended by the County and cities. The State’s review and approval of
the CHWMP was obtained on January 6, 1995.
     In addition to becoming the County Plan, the CHWMP was designed as a plan which could
be adopted by participating cities for their own use. The City of Milpitas has adopted the CHWMP
as the policy document and planning guide for all decisions regarding the development of off-site
hazardous waste management facilities and programs related to the management of hazardous
waste within the City.
     The objectives of the City's Household Hazardous Waste Element are:
4-22

                               OPEN SPACE & ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION ELEMENT
• Provide disposal alternatives for HHW generated in the city, including participation in the

• Undertake educational programs to reduce the volume and hazards of HHW entering the
  waste stream by encouraging proper use and disposal of hazardous products, and waste
  reduction, including the use of safer alternatives;
• Promote proper storage and handling methods to protect the public’s health and safety;
• Recycle HHW to the extent possible; and
• Participate in the load inspection program at the Newby Island landfill.

4.g-G-2  Establish a network of continuous and varied
         Scenic Routes that provide views of Scenic
         Resources and access from urban areas and
         the regular transportation network to parks,
         open spaces and cultural attractions.
4.g-G-3  Enhance the visual impact of the gateways to
         Milpitas.
4.g-G-4  Encourage a variety of recreational uses along
         Scenic Routes consistent with the concept of
         protecting visual resources.
4.g-G-5  Provide for the inclusion of facilities and
         improvements (vista points, picnic areas, etc.)
         along Scenic Routes where appropriate.
4.g-G-6  Design and site Scenic Routes to have a
         minimal adverse impact on the environment.
4.g-G-7  Exempt all lands within the Valley Floor
         Planning Area from Scenic Corridor

Implementing Policies
Land Use and Development
4.g-I-1 Limit uses in Scenic Corridors to those uses
        allowed by right and conditionally in the R-1
        Single Family Residence and Park and Open
        Space Zoning Districts. Commercial
        development can only be allowed when its
        design will not result in a loss of any scenic
        potential.
4.g-I-2 Permit clustering of structures, in order to
        preserve open space while providing for
        desired development.
                                                                                 4-33
MILPITAS GENERAL PLAN
4.g-I-3  Development in the Scenic Corridor shall not
         exceed 17 feet in height. The 17 foot height
         limit may be waived by the City Council when
         the following two criteria are met: (1) taller
         building are allowed through the underlying
         zoning district or a PUD process; and (2)
         development that exceeds the 17 foot height
         limit does not significantly obstruct views of
         the Hillside based on the following guidelines:
         •    The development will not significantly
              obstruct scenic features including but not
              limited to ridgelines, stands of trees or
              other vegetation, geologic formations,
              historic or scenic structures.
         •    The development is sited to avoid
              destruction of any distinctive physical
              characteristics with significant scenic
              value.
         •    The development will avoid architectural
              features such as unusually long blank
              walls, unbroken roof lines, and
              excessively steep roof pitches which
              would detract from the scenic
              characteristics of the site.
         •    The scale of the project is consistent with
              the scale of existing development in the
              immediate vicinity and within the Scenic
              Corridor.
         •    The bulk of the building(s) will not
              dominate views of the corridor.
         •    Building materials and colors will blend in
              and complement the rural "natural"
              hillside setting (i.e., earth tones, stucco,
              clay, stone, wood, etc.).
Design
4.g-I-4  Require all development within or abutting
         Scenic Corridors to be oriented away from the
         Corridors, with limited driveway access.

 4.g-I-5 New development within the Scenic Corridor
         will be subject to site and architectural review
         ("S" zone Approval) by the Planning
         Commission. The review will include:
         •     reviewing architectural design and site
               planning of all development;
         •     requiring development that adjoins
               natural environments to use materials
               that help to blend buildings into the
               surroundings; and
         •     requiring parking, storage and other such
               areas to be screened-off from view by
               using trees and shrubs.
 4.g-I-6 Provide view turnouts, rest areas and picnic
         facilities at appropriate locations along Scenic
         Corridors.
 Landscaping and Utilities

         •     Enhances the City's scenic resources by
               utilizing an appropriate scale of planting, Median landscaping, lighting fixtures,
               framing views where appropriate, and not    street signals, and other street
               forming a visual barrier to views;          furnishing along Scenic Routes
                                                           should follow a consistent design

          necessary for identification purposes.
4.g-I-11  Undertake an evaluation of and implement
          any necessary steps to ensure that the
          design and location of signs within and
          adjoining Scenic Routes does not lead to
          unsightly and obtrusive conglomerations of
          advertising.
4.g-I-12  Undertake a program to place appropriate
          and consistent Scenic Route identification
          signs periodically along all Scenic Routes.

     5.1       Seismic and Geologic Hazards
     The Hillside Area is located in the foothills of the Diablo Range and consists of a series of
parallel hills and valleys oriented generally northwest/southeast. The rounded hills in the western
portion of the Hillside Area form a band about one mile wide with a maximum elevation of about
1,270 feet. Spring Valley, in the central portion of the Area, is roughly one-quarter mile wide and
two and a half miles long. The central portion of the valley is relatively flat and has an elevation
of about 600 feet. Along the eastern boundary of the Hillside Area rise the steep western slopes
of Los Buellis Hills, where the elevation ranges from roughly 800 feet to 2,337 feet at Monument
Peak in the north.
     Background information in this section is extracted from Geotechnical Hazards Evaluation,
City of Milpitas (1987). The report is based on compilation of published geologic and soils maps,
data from unpublished geotechnical reports, and interpretation of stereoscopic aerial
photographs. No new field mapping was performed for the study. Figure 5-1 summarizes
geotechnical hazards in the Planning Area.
     Hillside Area
     Most of the Hillside Area is underlain by relatively hard, shallow, fractured bedrock. Softer
bedrock underlies the western margin of the Hillside Area. Most of the ridges are mantled by thin
residual soil which forms in-place as the bedrock weathers. The slopes and small valleys are
blanketed by organic-material rich colluvial soil, which has moved downslope and accumulated
on lower slopes and in canyon bottoms.
     LANDSLIDES
     Many large landslide deposits are present in the foothills. Although the largest landslides are
tens of thousands of years old, portions of many of the landslides have reactivated. Large, deep
landslides generally involve unstable bedrock as well as soil. These slides can be deeper than
100 feet. Small, shallow landslides generally involve only soil and weathered bedrock. Some of
the steep slopes in the hills are susceptible to recurring debris flows, which are shallow, rapid
landslides that often travel many hundreds of feet and impact areas well below the unstable
hillsides on which they originate.
     Unstable soils on slopes are mapped in Figure 5-1.
     GEOLOGY AND SOILS
     All of the bedrock formations produce colluvial soil, which may be as thick as 15 feet in valley
bottoms. Sandstone and shale of Cretaceous age underlies the west-central portion of the
Hillside Area west of Spring Valley. Much of the shale is highly susceptible to landsliding.
Residual soils are generally silty and sandy clay, less than 2 feet thick, and highly expansive.
                                                                                                 5-3

     The Monterey Shale of Miocene age underlies the central portion of the foothills west of
Spring Valley. Unweathered bedrock may be difficult to excavate. Residual soils are generally
clayey, less than two feet thick, and highly expansive.
     The Briones Sandstone of upper Miocene age underlies the eastern portion of the foothills
west of Spring Valley. The formation includes siltstone as well as sandstone and is locally
fossiliferous. Fossiliferous beds may also be difficult to excavate. Residual soils are generally
clayey, less than two feet thick, and expansive.
          The Orinda Formation of Pliocene age underlies the foothills around Spring Valley and
includes conglomerate, sandstone, siltstone, and claystone. The Orinda Formation, especially the
claystone, is highly susceptible to landsliding. The conglomerates may be difficult to excavate.
The residual soils are generally silty clay, four to six feet thick, and highly expansive.
     The Santa Clara Formation of Plio-Pleistocene age underlies the western margin of the
foothills. It consists of soft conglomerate sandstone, siltstone, and claystone that weather rapidly
and are highly erodible and highly susceptible to landsliding. Residual soils are generally clayey,
five to six feet thick, and highly expansive.
     Valley Floor
     The relatively flat, urbanized Valley Floor is underlain by alluvial soil of Quaternary age. This
soil consists of interlayered, poorly sorted gravel, sand, silt, and clay deposited by water. The
thickness of the alluvial soil increases westward from zero at the base of the hills to 1,000 feet or
more at the western edge of the City.
     The alluvial soil in Milpitas was deposited in and adjacent to stream channels, in low-lying
basins between streams, and on the floor of the Bay when the shoreline was east of its present
position. The composition and consistency of alluvial soils varies laterally and vertically over
small distances and depths.
     Most of the alluvial soil in Milpitas is expansive and susceptible to liquefaction, and alluvial
areas along creeks may be susceptible to lateral spreading. Local areas have compressible
soils, poorly drained soils, shallow ground water, or are susceptible to lateral spreading. Because
soil composition varies vertically as well as laterally, several soil types may underlie a particular
site.
     Faulting and Seismicity
     The Hayward fault trends northwestward through the western portion of the Milpitas foothills
(see Figure 5-2). The Calaveras fault trends northwestward through Calaveras Reservoir,
approximately 1-1/2 miles northeast of the eastern edge of the City. The San Andreas fault
trends northwestward through the Santa Cruz Mountains approximately 13 miles southwest of
Milpitas. All of these faults are active and have produced damaging earthquakes in the historic
past. Other active and potentially active faults are present in the Bay Area and may produce
earthquakes of significance to Milpitas.
                                                                                                   5-5
MILPITAS GENERAL PLAN
     Earthquake hazards consist of hazards produced by surface fault rupture, and hazards
produced by ground shaking. Only the Hayward fault zone is located within Milpitas and capable
of producing surface fault rupture in the City. Large earthquakes on the Hayward, Calaveras,
and San Andreas faults could produce ground shaking sufficient to cause extensive damage in
Milpitas. Large earthquakes on other faults may also produce significant ground shaking in the
City. Table 5-1 lists each of the three major active faults, its closest approach to the City of
Milpitas, and the Richter magnitude of the maximum credible earthquake it might generate.

     Surface Fault Rupture. As previously stated, the Hayward fault zone passes through the
western part of the Milpitas Hillside Area. The fault zone extends from San Pablo Bay to San
Jose. In 1836 and 1868 the Hayward fault produced earthquakes with estimated Richter
magnitudes of 7.0 and 6.9. The surface rupture of the 1868 earthquake extended from San
Leandro to the Warm Springs district of Fremont, a distance of about 29 miles. Portions of the
Hayward fault exhibit slow, relatively continuous surface fault creep not associated with
earthquakes. The Hayward fault is not known to be creeping in Milpitas.
     Ground Shaking. The intensely of ground shaking depends on factors such as earthquake
magnitude, distance to the causative fault, depth to bedrock, physical characteristics of
underlying soil and bedrock, and local topography. Maximum bedrock accelerations for the
Milpitas area are expected to exceed 0.5g, half the acceleration of gravity. Maximum earthquake
intensities expected in the City for large earthquakes on the Hayward fault range from "very
violent" to "very strong". Earthquake hazards produced by ground shaking include damage to
structures, and secondary ground failures.
     Ground shaking that accompanied the 1868 earthquake on the Hayward fault and the 1906
earthquake on the San Andreas fault caused ground failures along Coyote Creek in Milpitas.
Modes of ground failure included ground settlement, lateral spreading, and failures of stream
banks. Large historic earthquakes have also produced landslides on hillsides in the region.

MILPITAS GENERAL PLAN
     Alquist-Priolo Special Studies Zone. The Alquist-Priolo Special Studies Zone Act went into
effect in 1973 and has been amended several times since. The purpose of the Act is to prohibit
the location of most structures for human occupancy across the traces of active faults and to
thereby mitigate the hazard of fault rupture. Under the Act, the state Division of Mines and
Geology is required to delineate Special Studies Zones along active faults in California, and
jurisdictions containing these zones must then regulate certain types of development within the
zones.
     Figure 5-2 shows the state-defined Special Studies Zone for Milpitas and requirements for
undertaking studies prior to development.

      5.2         Drainage, Flooding and Dam Inundation
    Drainage
    The Planning Area extends northeastward from Coyote Creek near the Bay into the Diablo
Range. The base of the foothills of the Range trends northwestward and marks the northeastern
edge of the urbanized part of the Planning Area. Near the eastern City limit, the rolling foothills
are interrupted by a broad, northwest tending intermontane valley known as Spring Valley.
Elevations in the Planning Area range from sea level near Coyote Creek to approximately 2,400
feet in the northeastern corner, near Monument Peak. Natural slope gradients range from nearly
level near the Bay to approximately 1.5:1 (horizontal to vertical) on the steeper hillsides.
    Drainage in Milpitas is generally westward. Six intermittent streams (Scott, Calera, Tularcitos,
Piedmont, and Berryessa creeks, and Arroyo de los Coches) flow out of the foothills and across
the flatlands. In the western part of the City, Lower Penetencia and Coyote creeks carry water
from these streams northward into the Bay.              The perennial Coyote Creek originates
approximately 30 miles southeast of Milpitas. Most of the intermittent streams have been
channelized through the Valley Floor.
    In the Valley Floor, water seeps into unlined streambeds and recharges the ground water
supply. In some parts of the flatlands, the ground water table is near the ground surface during
the rainy season.
    Storm Water Collection and Disposal. The City collects and disposes its storm water via a
storm drainage network consisting of catch basins, conveyance piping, pump stations, and
outfalls to creeks. The City has 123 miles of storm pipe, 3,000 catch basins, approximately 4
miles of drainage ditches and creeks, and storm water pump stations. Storm water collection
efforts are guided by the Floodplain Management Plan, which is a compilation of different
management sources, and is designed to be a flexible and growing instrument.
    Flooding
    Milpitas is located within the East Zone of the Flood Control benefit Assessment District, the
proceeds of which go to the Santa Clara Valley Water District to provide maintenance and an
increased level of flood protection by accelerating construction projects throughout the County,
some of which are in Milpitas.
    About half of the Planning Area Valley Floor lies within one of the Special Flood Hazard
Areas (see Figure 5-3). Almost all land west of the Southern Pacific Railroad lies within the 100-
year Flood Zone and all land west of Highway 680 is part of the 500-year Flood Zone.
    Flood control in the Planning Area is provided by a variety of federal, state, and local
agencies. The general purposes of these agencies are to identify potential flood issues and
                                                                                                 5-9

hazard areas, and devise preventative programs, policies, or structures to avoid or minimize flood
destruction. Agencies besides the City that are responsible for flood control include:
     U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE). The ACOE identifies the need for, and constructs
major flood control facilities. The ACOE also develops flood and dam inundation maps and
reports.
     Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). FEMA manages the National Flood
Insurance Program, providing insurance to the public in communities which participate in the
program. FEMA is the main federal government agency contact during natural disasters and is a
regulating agency for water quality control. FEMA publishes the Federal Insurance Rating Maps
(FIRM), which identifies the extent of flood potential in flood prone communities. FIRMs are
based on a 100-year flood (or base flood) event.
     Federal Insurance Administration. The Federal Insurance Administration is the primary
agency which delineates potential flood hazard areas and floodways through the FIRMs and the
Flood Boundary and Floodway Map.
     Dam Inundation
     State law requires local governments to assess the potential impacts that dam failures may
have on their jurisdiction. According to the state Office of Emergency Services for Santa Clara
County, parts of the City along the Calaveras Road area east of I-680 could be inundated by
failure of the 38-foot high Sandy Wool Lake Dam, located in Ed Levine Park (see Figure 5-3).
The area could be inundated in as soon as 15 minutes from the time of dam failure, affecting a
population of about 4,900. The Office of Emergency Services maintains an evacuation plan in
the unlikely event that a failure of the dam were to occur.
                                                                                              5-11
MILPITAS GENERAL PLAN
     5.3           Fire Safety
     Milpitas Fire Department
     The Milpitas Fire Department (MFD) provides fire protection services for the 13.2 square-mile
incorporated portion of the Planning Area. The City maintains mutual aid agreements with the
area municipal and County fire departments through the Santa Clara County Local Mutual Aid
Plan, and also with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. The City is also
party to the statewide mutual aid agreement.
     The average response time to code 3 emergencies in the City was about 4.2 minutes during
2010/2011. The City's Insurance Services Office (ISO) rating is 3 on a scale of 1 to 10 (with 1
being the best).
     Stations. The City staffs and operates four stations: on Curtis Avenue, Yosemite Drive,
Midwick Drive, and Barber Lane. While expansion of facilities and seismic upgrading at some
stations is being planned, there are no plans to add new stations1.
     Wildland Fires
     During summer, and in prolonged periods without rainfall, grasses, trees and other vegetation
in the Planning Area become extremely dry and act as potential fuel for fires. The grasses on the
hillsides are light fuel vegetation, which in the event of a fire burn quickly. Fire protection for the
hillsides is primarily provided by the California Department of Forestry and the Spring Valley
voluntary Fire Department. The City provides assistance for the hillside as needed on the basis
of a mutual agreement.
     Weed Abatement Program. The MFD maintains a weed abatement program. Each year,
between May and August, department personnel survey non-developed properties in the City and
notify owners of the need to remove vegetation and trash.
     5.4           Emergency Management
     See also section 5.2 for emergencies related to dam inundation.
     The City maintains an emergency plan to deal with natural or man-made disasters. The
objectives of the Plan are to prepare for and facilitate coordinated and effective responses to
emergencies within the City and to provide assistance to other jurisdictions as needed. The Plan
specifies actions for the coordination of operations, management and resources, and
responsibilities of the different departments and governmental agencies during emergency
events. Evacuation routes are to be determined as appropriate depending on the nature of the

     The City Manger serves as the Director of Emergency Services; a state of emergency can be
declared by the Director or the City Council. The City Emergency Operating Center is located in
the City Police Station, 1275 North Milpitas Boulevard.
     The California Mutual Aid Agreement calls for a shared response to an emergency from
adjacent or area jurisdictions when an affected jurisdiction cannot provide service by itself.
Disaster assistance from federal agencies is also available when needed to supplement, but not
substitute, local civil operations.
     Hazardous Materials Spill. In the event of a hazardous materials emergency several
agencies are responsible for timely response, depending on the extent, and type of the incident.
The Santa Clara County Hazardous Materials Response Team composed of representatives of
the Santa Clara County Fire Department, California Department of Forestry, and member cities
responds to large scale, emergency hazardous material incidents within the Planning Area. The
Milpitas Fire Department is responsible for non-emergency hazardous materials reports within
the City. If and when these non-emergency incidents become a threat to groundwater supplies,
the Regional Water Quality Control Board takes control of the case. The Fire Department also
monitors above ground and underground storage tanks and combustible and flammable liquids
for leaks and spills.
                                                                                           5-13

                                                                             NOISE ELEMENT
    Purpose
    Noise is “unwanted sound” and is known to have several adverse effects on people. The
known effects include hearing loss (not generally a factor with community noise),
communication interference, sleep interference, physiological responses and annoyance.
The Noise Element provides an understanding of existing and future noise conditions in the
Planning Area, establishes a basis for evaluating potential noise level impacts on future
development, and includes policy statements to guide public and private planning to attain
and maintain acceptable noise levels. Implementation of the Noise Element will promote a
comprehensive and long range program of achieving acceptable noise levels throughout the
Planning Area. Quantitative information in the Element includes maps showing present and
future noise levels.
    Relationship to Other Elements
    Traffic is one of the major Planning Area noise sources, and noise contours are based on
existing and projected traffic volumes on the planned street system. As projected traffic
volumes are directly related to planned land uses, the Noise Element is also closely related to
the Land Use Element.
                                                                                              6-1

     6.1          Noise Measurement and Compatibility
                  Standards
     Noise Measurement
     For planning purposes, a weighted scale is used to describe environmental noise at any
one particular time; however, community noise levels vary continuously. In order to account for
the time-varying characteristics of noise, all of the individual noise readings must be averaged
over a 24-hour period to give an equivalent level. This equivalent noise level, expressed as
Day-Night Noise Level (DNL or Ldn) or Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL, normally
within 0.5 dB of the DNL value) can then be plotted on a map to illustrate average noise levels
throughout the community. The DNL used in this Element represents a sound level that is
equivalent to the total varying sound levels that occur over a 24 -hour period plus a 10 decibel
(dB) penalty for nighttime noise (i.e. between 10 PM and 7 AM).
     In establishing noise contours for land use planning, it is customary to ignore the noise
attenuation afforded by man-made structures, roadway elevations, and depressions, and to
minimize the barrier effects of natural terrain features. Thus, noise contours provide a
conservative estimate of the future noise environment. The purpose of the contours is to
identify the potential need for more detailed acoustical analyses, not to precisely predict noise
levels. It is preferable to overestimate the potential noise at a future sensitive development
site, rather than underestimate the noise environment and allow for potentially incompatible
land use development. Man-made barriers, such as buildings, may be removed as a part of
development, thereby providing no future noise attenuation.
     Noise Compatibility Standards
     Based on the known effects of noise, criteria have been established to help protect public
health and safety and prevent disruption of certain human activities. The City’s noise
compatibility standards are derived from guidelines published by the California Office of
Planning and Research, and are shown in Table 6-1. They match different land uses with an
appropriate range of noise levels. These standards should be used in conjunction with noise
exposure contours shown on the noise map (Figures 6-1 Existing Noise, and 6-2, Future Noise)
to determine where noise levels exceed the "normally acceptable" range and an acoustic report
and noise mitigation is required for development projects.
                                                                                                6-3


                                                                                 NOISE ELEMENT
     6.2          Existing and Projected Noise
     A community noise survey was conducted for the General Plan to document noise
exposure in areas containing noise sensitive land uses, such as residential areas, parks and
schools. Noise monitoring sites were selected to be representative of typical conditions in the
Planning Area. Details of survey are in Appendix C of the Plan.
     Noise Contours
     In addition to the noise survey, noise contour maps were produced for the Planning Area.
A "noise contour map" shows as closed lines those linear bands subject to similar average
noise levels. Figure 6-1 shows existing noise levels in the Planning Area, based on noise
studies conducted in 1988. The noise survey conducted for the General Plan in November and
December 1993 confirms that current (1993-94) noise levels have not changed substantially
since 1988. Figure 6-2 depicts projected 2010 noise levels (based on projected traffic
volumes). The noise levels in these maps are expressed in DNL.
      Contours along roadways represent the predicted noise level and do not reflect the
mitigating effects of noise barriers, structures, topography, or vegetation. Because intervening
structures, topography, and vegetation may significantly affect noise exposure at a particular
location, the noise contours should not be considered site-specific, but rather are guides to
determine when detailed acoustic analysis should be undertaken.
     Principal Noise Sources in the Planning Area
     Traffic and the railroads are the principal noise sources in the Planning Area. Sporadic
noise from aircraft and construction-related activities also contributes to the noise environment
in the Planning Area. Further detail on the existing noise environment in the Planning Area is
included in Appendix C.
                                                                                               6-5

    6.3         Noise Mitigation
    The preferred method of mitigating noise is controlling it at source and separating sensitive
receptors and noise sources. Mitigation measures generally fall into two general categories:
physical and regulatory. Physical measures include enclosing the noise source, substitution of
a quieter noise source, or use of a noise barrier. Regulatory measures, on the other hand,
reduce noise exposure by limiting operation of the noise source or by regulating locations
where it may be used. Generally, physical measures reduce the level of noise produced,
whereas regulatory measures limit the duration of the noise, thereby reducing noise exposure.
    Physical mitigation measures for traffic noise are construction of sound walls along noise-
sensitive areas, use of earth berms and revetments, and routing of new roads to circumvent
noise-sensitive areas. Administrative regulation of traffic noise includes restricting truck access
routes, enforcement of speed limits, and enforcement of state vehicle noise emission
standards.
    For new construction, noise control should be incorporated into the design of projects.
Specific recommendations depend upon the type of construction, character of the noise
exposure, and degree of noise reduction required for interior and outdoor areas.
                                                                                                  6-9

6.4       Noise Principles and Policies
Guiding Principles
6-G-1      Maintain land use compatibility with noise
           levels similar to those set by State
           guidelines.
6-G-2      Minimize unnecessary, annoying, or
           injurious noise.
Implementing Policies
Uses and Standards
6-I-1      Use the guidelines in Table 6-1 (Noise and
           Land Use Compatibility) as review criteria
           for development projects.
6-I-2      Require an acoustical analysis for projects
           located within a "conditionally acceptable"
           or "normally unacceptable" exterior noise
           exposure area. Require mitigation
           measures to reduce noise to acceptable
           levels.
6-I-3      Prohibit new construction where the exterior
           noise exposure is considered "clearly
           unacceptable" for the use proposed.
6-I-4      Where actual or projected rear yard and
           exterior common open space noise
           exposure exceeds the “normally
           acceptable” levels for new single-family and
           multifamily residential projects, use
           mitigation measures to reduce sound levels
           in those areas to acceptable levels.
6-I-5      All new residential development (single
           family and multifamily) and lodging facilities
           must have interior noise levels of 45 dB
           DNL or less. Mechanical ventilation will be
           required where use of windows for
           ventilation will result in higher than 45 dB
           DNL interior noise levels.
                                                                     6-11

MILPITAS GENERAL PLAN
6-I-6      Assist in enforcing compliance with noise      The most efficient and effective
           emissions standards for all types of           means of controlling noise from
           vehicles, established by the California        transportation systems is reducing
           Vehicle Code and by federal regulations,       noise at the source. However, the
           through coordination with the Milpitas         City has little direct control over
           Police Department, Santa Clara County          transportation source noise levels
           Sheriff's Department, and the California       because of sate and federal
           Highway Patrol.                                preemption (e.g. State Motor
                                                          Vehicle Noise Standards).
                                                          Therefore, requiring compliance
                                                          with State and federal agency
                                                          standards is the best approach.
6-I-7      Avoid residential DNL exposure increases
           of more than 3 dB or more than 65 dB at
           the property line, whichever is more
           restrictive.
Noise Monitoring and Updating
6-I-8      Biennially monitor 24-hour noise exposure
           at two locations, and shorter-duration
           exposure at six additional locations in the
           Planning Area.
6-I-9      Enforce the provisions of the City of Milpitas
           Noise Ordinance and the use of established
           truck routes.
Methods of Attenuation
6-I-10     Reduce the noise impact in existing
           residential areas where feasible. Noise
           mitigation measures should be
           implemented with the cost shared by public
           and private agencies and individuals.
6-I-11     Minimize noise impacts on neighbors
           caused by commercial and industrial
           projects.
6-12
                                                        NOISE ELEMENT
6-I-12    New noise-producing facilities introduced
          near sensitive land uses which may
          increase noise levels in excess of
          “acceptable” levels will be evaluated for
          impact prior to approval; adequate
          mitigation at the noise source will be
          required to protect noise-sensitive land
          uses.
6-I-13    Restrict the hours of operation, technique,
          and equipment used in all public and
          private construction activities to minimize
          noise impact. Include noise specifications
          in requests for bids and equipment
          information.
6-I-14    City streets will be designed to reduce
          noise levels to adjacent areas. This is most
          effectively implemented through traffic
          engineering to prevent residential streets
          from becoming rush-hour thoroughfares,
          and through enforcement of speed limits.
          Physical mitigation measures, such as
          sound walls, will also be considered, where
          appropriate.
6-I-15    Promote installation of noise barriers along
          highways and the railroad corridor where
          substantial land uses of high sensitivity are
          impacted by unacceptable noise levels.
Coordination with Other Agencies
6-I-16    Work with Caltrans and other agencies on
          traffic and railroad noise issues and
          participate in appropriate noise mitigation
          programs.
                                                                   6-13

7.1 HOUSING ELEMENT EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
A. Introduction
The 2002 Milpitas Housing Element is the basis for the current Housing Element update. All sections in
the 2002 Housing Element have been reviewed and updated. Since the last Housing Element, there
have been changes in State law. These changes affect a number of sections in the Housing element.
Secondly, the City of Milpitas has adopted two specific plans (Midtown and Transit Areas) that include
increased densities, promotion of in-fill development, and transit use, a goal promoted by the State
Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD).
An important section of the Housing Element is an inventory of sites for future housing development. This
inventory must demonstrate that the city has identified a sufficient number of development sites to
accommodate the City’s share of the regional housing need, as determined by the Association of Bay
Area Governments (ABAG). Out of a total of 2,487 units assigned to Milpitas by ABAG, 6,274 units had
already been constructed, were under construction, were approved, or were planned as of 2009. While
the total number of these units exceeds the number assigned to Milpitas by ABAG, the number of
affordable units is less than half of the total assigned. Thus, the City is still required to identify additional
sites to meet these affordable housing needs. Table ES-1 presents information on the regional housing
needs allocated to Milpitas.

B. Update Process
Research to update the revised housing element commenced in 2008. At that time, the housing market
already showed signs of the national economic downturn that intensified in 2009. Although the Housing
Element period is officially 2009-2014, housing units that were constructed since January 2007 can be
counted towards meeting the City’s share of regional housing need.
Community meetings and public hearings were conducted in Fall 2008. Information on the Housing
Element Update process was provided on the City’s website. The Planning Commission and City Council
held public hearings in May and June 2009. The City submitted the approved draft Housing Element to
HCD in December 2009. The Final Housing Element to be adopted by Milpitas incorporates the review
comments provided by HCD to Milpitas in fall 2009 and winter 2010.
A Negative Declaration was prepared and circulated to the appropriate state and local agencies in May
2009. The City did not receive any comments and has concluded that no additional environmental
assessment is required.
                                                                                                                7-1

                                                                                       HOUSING ELEMENT
C. Needs Assessment
The housing needs assessment is a description of demographic, economic, and housing conditions in
Milpitas. Its purpose is to document the demand for housing that is needed to serve all segments of the
community. This assessment is intended to assist Milpitas in formulating policies and programs to
address local housing needs. Key findings from this assessment are presented below.
Population, Employment and Income
         Since 2000, the population of Milpitas has increased by about 13 percent and is estimated at
         70,817 residents in 2009. The number of households has also increased by a similar percentage.
         The average household size in Milpitas is estimated at 3.5 persons, which is higher than Santa
         Clara County’s average of 2.9 persons per household. It should be noted that average household
         size in Milpitas is trending down with the increase in new multifamily units.
         Employment has also increased and is projected by ABAG to continue to increase. Between
         2005 and 2015, ABAG projected that the number of jobs would grow by over 10 percent. Finally,
         while incomes have risen since 2000, incomes adjusted for inflation have dropped between 2000
         and the present.
Housing Costs
         Housing Prices and rents have increased since the last Housing Element.
         Single-family home prices rose 60 percent between 2001 and 2006, reaching a peak average
         price of $768,912, but then fell with the onset of the housing downturn. Average prices in 2008
         were 25 percent below their peak in 2006, with a, 21-percent drop in home prices recorded
         between May 2007 and May 2008.
         The City’s condominium market has been less volatile during the recent housing market
         downturn. Since peaking in 2005 at approximately $536,000, average prices for condominiums
         sold in the month of May 2008 dropped six percent, falling to $504,000 in 2008.
         Rentals - Average rents in Milpitas have been steadily increasing between 2006 and 2008. After
         falling on an annual basis between 2001 and 2005, rents began to increase again in 2006 as the
         homeownership market started to suffer and rental options became more appealing. While rents
         have not yet reached 2001 levels, rents appear to be steadily increasing.
Housing Needs
         The Housing Element identifies two types of housing needs. These include needs based on low
         incomes and special housing needs that are not addressed by market activity, for example,
         building more units designed for persons with disabilities.
         The greatest housing need in Milpitas stems from low incomes.
                                                                                                        7-2

                                                                                         HOUSING ELEMENT
          A blight survey in targeted neighborhoods was conducted as part of the Housing Element update
          process. This survey indicated that, with some exceptions, the housing stock in Milpitas is sound.
D. Site Inventory
While the number of market rate housing units that are newly constructed, under construction, approved,
and planned in Milpitas exceeds the number of units required by ABAG, the City is still required to identify
additional housing sites that have sufficient density to be financially feasible as affordable or mixed-
income housing development sites. The remaining goal for the site inventory is to demonstrate there are
adequate sites on which to develop approximately 900 additional affordable units. Of the fourteen sites
listed in the Housing Element, thirteen sites are zoned for multifamily housing and have the capacity to
provide an additional 2,352 housing units. (See Table ES-2.) These sites are located in either the
Midtown or the Transit Plan areas. Since new residential development is occurring near these sites, the
City has concluded that these are viable sites for additional housing development.

E. Housing Constraints and Resources
A key component of the Housing Element is a description and analysis of government and non-
government constraints to the preservation and provision of housing. In addition, the Housing Element
provides a description of housing resources that can assist in the construction of affordable and special
needs housing.
Government Constraints
                                                                                                         7-3
                                                                                          HOUSING ELEMENT
Milpitas has worked systematically to address potential government constraints to housing production.
The results of this work are reflected in the City’s land use and development policies, infrastructure
planning, and funding of affordable housing projects. Both the Midtown and Transit Area Plans have
removed all government constraints that could affect density and development standards. The only
potential remaining constraints are those that affect development of special needs housing, including
homeless shelters, transitional and supportive housing, farmworker housing, and development of single
room occupancy units (SRO’s). Furthermore, while development fees have increased since the last
Housing Element, this trend has not constrained development.
Non-Government Constraints
High development costs constitute the primary non-government constraint to the production of housing in
Milpitas. In particular, land and construction costs increased the most since the last Housing Element.
Financing costs are more reasonable than in prior periods. However, it is more difficult to obtain
financing, as lenders have become increasingly concerned over mortgage defaults.
Housing Resources
The City is committed to supporting high quality residential development for all income groups. Milpitas
has demonstrated this commitment through its land use policies, affordable housing requirement on new
market rate housing, and the provision of loans and grants to subsidize affordable housing. The primary
source of funds is the City’s redevelopment housing set-aside fund. At present, housing set-aside funds
are programmed to create an additional 265 units, of which over 60 percent will be affordable to low- and
very low-income households. This is in addition to the 717 affordable units that received City assistance
during the last Housing Element period.
F. Housing Plan
Based on the needs, resources, and constraints identified above, Milpitas has defined a Housing Plan for
the 2009-2014 planning period. The City has established this Plan in consideration of its own local needs
and priorities, as well as its obligations under State Housing Element Law. The Housing Plan includes
major goals, related policies, programs, implementing agencies, funding sources, and time-frames for
implementation. In some cases, programs are designed to accomplish specific goals, such as zoning
ordinance changes. In other cases, programs provide ongoing services, such as the provision of fair
housing services.
         Provide Adequate Sites for Housing Development in the City of Milpitas. The City of Milpitas will
         maintain adequate sites to accommodate its share of the regional housing need, including sites
         that would be appropriate for the development of housing affordable to very low-, low-, moderate-
         and above moderate-income households.
         Conserve Housing and Neighborhoods. The maintenance and improvement of the quality of life
         of existing neighborhoods is a high priority for the City of Milpitas. In addition, the City of Milpitas
         will strive to maintain and preserve existing housing resources, including both affordable and
         market rate units.
                                                                                                               7-4

                                                                                          HOUSING ELEMENT
         Promote New Housing Production. The City of Milpitas will take necessary steps to promote new
         housing development and remove public infrastructure constraints to new housing development.
         Encourage Housing Diversity and Affordability. The City of Milpitas will use available resources
         to expand the number of new housing units affordable to extremely low-, very low-, low- and
         moderate-income households. In addition, the City of Milpitas strives to increase the range of
         housing opportunities for all residents, including those with special needs. Finally, in recognition
         of the diverse needs of Milpitas households, the City supports creativity in the design and
         development of housing projects.
         Eliminate Housing Discrimination. Milpitas values diversity of its population and protection of
         housing rights for its citizens. The City will work to eliminate all unlawful discrimination in housing
         with respect to age, race, gender, sexual orientation, marital or familial status, ethnic background,
         medical condition, or other arbitrary factors, so that all residents can obtain decent housing
         throughout the City.
         Promote Energy Conservation in Residential Development. The City of Milpitas will promote
         energy efficiency in residential development within the City, including reduction of energy use
         through better design and construction in individual homes, and also through energy efficient
         urban design.
         Remove Government Constraints. Milpitas will continue to promote land use policies and
         development standards to facilitate housing production. During the last Housing Element Period,
         Milpitas made extensive changes to its Zoning Ordinance in order to provide high density, transit
         oriented development in its specific plan areas. Housing developed in these areas will continue
         to provide opportunities for affordable and workforce housing, will reduce the jobs housing
         imbalance in Milpitas, and promote the use of alternative means of transportation, such as transit.
         Milpitas also supports the development of housing for the homeless and other special needs
         groups. The City will take necessary steps to remove government constraints to the development
         of affordable housing serving special needs populations.
G. Quantified Housing Objectives
Finally, consistent with the Housing Plan summarized above and the number of housing units assigned to
Milpitas by ABAG (as part of its regional housing needs determination), Milpitas has established
objectives for new construction, rehabilitation, and preservation of housing units for the period 2007-2014.
(See Table ES.3.)

7.2 INTRODUCTION
A. Preparation of the Housing Element Update
In accordance with California State Law, California cities must have an adopted General Plan and the
General Plan must contain a Housing Element. While all elements of a General Plan are reviewed and
revised regularly to ensure that the plan remains current, state law requires that the Housing Element be
updated every five years. State law also dictates the issues that the Housing Element must address and
furthermore requires the element to be reviewed by the California Department of Housing and Community
Development (HCD) to assure that it meets the minimum requirements established by Government Code
§65580-65589.8. This process is commonly referred to as “certifying” the Housing Element.
The major requirement for the Housing Element is that it requires cities to plan to meet their existing and
projected housing needs including their share of the regional housing need. The Association of Bay Area
Governments (ABAG) recently completed the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA). As part of this
process, ABAG worked with regional and local governments to develop a methodology for distributing the
nine-county Bay Area's housing need (as determined by HCD) to all local governments in the region.
Each city and county has received an allocation of housing units, broken down by income categories.
Cities and counties must identify adequate sites zoned at adequate densities to meet this housing
allocation, also referred to as the RHNA numbers. The planning period for this version of the Housing
Element is 2009-2014. In response to the allocations, each city and county in the Bay Area will have to
review, update and adopt its Housing Element by June 30, 2009.
The prior Milpitas Housing Element, certified by HCD in 2003, is the basis for the current Housing
Element update. However, all sections in the 2003 Housing Element have been reviewed and updated
for several reasons. First, since the last housing element, there have been changes in State law. These
changes affect a number of sections in the housing element. For example, State law now requires much
more detailed information about available housing sites, including identification of sites that can be used
for special housing needs, for example, units targeted to extremely low-income households, the
disabled, and the homeless. Also, there is more of an emphasis on energy conservation for new
construction and rehabilitation.
Secondly, the City of Milpitas has undergone changes since the 2002 Housing Element. For example, a
Transit Specific Plan has been adopted, and the Zoning Ordinance has been updated to reflect
requirements of both the Midtown and the Transit Area Specific Plans. These changes include increased
densities and reduced parking requirements. New policies adopted by the City represent the
development approach encouraged by HCD, since they are helpful in promoting in-fill development and
transit use. Thus, Milpitas is in a good position to comply with the latest Housing Element requirements.
                                                                                                          7-7

                                                                                       HOUSING ELEMENT
B. Public Participation in the Housing Element Update
The City held two public meetings in November 2008. The first, held on November 6, 2008 was with
housing professionals. The second meeting open to the general public was held on November 13, 2008.
Both meetings were noticed on the City’s website and in the local newspaper. In addition, the City created
a lengthy list of housing professionals who were sent invitations to the November 6th meeting via email.
A small group showed up at the housing professionals meeting, and a slightly larger group attended the
public meeting. The purpose of these public meetings was to provide comments on housing policy to the
Planning Department staff and consultant for consideration in the preparation of the preliminary draft
Housing Element. Summary comments from these meetings are presented in Appendix A to the Housing
Element.
At the public meeting, questionnaires were distributed to participants to learn more about housing needs,
problems and possible strategies to address problems. Subsequently, this questionnaire was distributed
electronically to the list of housing professionals.
In addition to these public meetings, information on the Housing Element Update was posted on the City’s
website. Residents were encouraged to contact the Planning & Neighborhood Services Department with
comments and questions.
Background research was also conducted as part of the Housing Element preparation process. This
background work included interviews with numerous staff from the City of Milpitas, the County of Santa
Clara, and as well as staff at a variety of social service agencies and other interested organizations that
serve the Milpitas community. The names of these organizations are presented in the Bibliography
attached to the Housing Element.
The Planning Commission conducted a public hearing on May 27, 2009, and the City Council conducted
a public hearing on June 16, 2009. These hearings were noticed, and the draft Housing element was
made available for public comments 30 days prior to the first public hearing. Additional public hearings
on the Final Draft Housing Element are scheduled in April 2010 with the Planning Commission and in
May 2010 with the City Council.
Following this introduction, the Housing Element includes the following major components:
     •   A review of the prior (2002) housing element, including an analysis of housing production in
         comparison to mandated housing goals.
     •   An analysis of the City’s current and future housing needs.
     •   An inventory and analysis of housing resources.
     •   An analysis of governmental and non-governmental constraints to housing production.
     •   A housing plan setting forth goals, policies, programs and quantified objectives to address the
         City’s housing needs.
                                                                                                          7-8

                                                                                          HOUSING ELEMENT
7.3 ASSESSMENT OF PRIOR HOUSING ELEMENT
This chapter reviews and evaluates the City’s progress in implementing the 2002 Housing Element’s
programs. In addition, it analyzes the difference between projected housing need (as defined by the
RHNA numbers) and actual housing production between 1999 and 2006.
The City of Milpitas supports affordable housing and is strongly committed to facilitating a diversity of
housing types. These commitments are observed in a number of ways. For example, during the last
housing element period, the City provided support to three subsidized housing developments (DeVries
Place Senior Housing, Aspen Family Apartments, and Senior Solutions’ group homes). In addition, as
part of the affordable housing agreement between a new market rate project at Town Center and the City
of Milpitas, the City required that the developer pay for the rehabilitation of four units. These units are
now rent restricted for 55 years and are part of the City’s affordable housing supply for very low-income
households. Finally, the City’s Zoning Code encourages that twenty percent of all market rate housing be
affordable and allows densities of up to 75 units per acre in the Transit Oriented Development Overlay
District (TOD) areas.
The following sections present information on the progress made by Milpitas in its implementation of the
housing programs set forth in the 2002 Housing Element, as well as its progress in achieving its 1999-
2006 RHNA goals.
A. Progress in Implementation of 2002 Housing Element Programs
Table II.1 provides a summary of the 2002 Housing Element’s accomplishments. A detailed list and
assessment of the housing programs included in the last Housing Element is provided in Appendix B.
The City of Milpitas has established a strong housing program. At the center of its strategy is the creation
of the Midtown and Transit Specific Plan Areas. These Specific Plan areas provide the following benefits
for new market rate and affordable housing production:
     •    The City changed its Zoning Ordinance to accommodate high density residential and mixed use
          zones. These zoning designations establish a minimum density (ranging from 21 to 41 units per
          acre) and maximum densities, ranting from 20 to 60 units per acre. Builders have been active in
          these residential zones, attracted to the high density zoning that is not provided by other Silicon
          Valley Cities.
     •    The City adopted a Transit-Oriented Overlay Zone that increases the maximum densities in the
          high density residential zones to 75 units per acre (R5 and MXD3) and decreases parking
          requirements.
     •    The Transit Area Specific Plan EIR was completed during this time period and can be used as a
          programmatic environmental document for future residential development in the Transit Area
          Specific Plan Area.
     •    The City helps pay for needed infrastructure in these two specific plan areas to facilitate
          residential development.
                                                                                                            7-9

                                                                                       HOUSING ELEMENT
Other achievements include successful implementation of the condominium and mobile home conversion
ordinances to protect renters, operation of programs that rehabilitate and retrofit housing units, and the
provision of financial assistance for facilities and services that help the homeless.
Finally, the City has adopted policies to encourage that twenty percent of all new housing units are
affordable in new developments. To help developers comply with this requirement, the City provides
funds for mortgage financing, impact fees, and loans to help projects located in the redevelopment area
comply with the affordable housing requirement.
There are many policies and programs from the 2002 Housing Element Update that will be carried
forward to the 2009-2014 Housing Element Update. These are presented in Chapter VI of the updated
Housing Element.
                                                                                                         7-10

Table II.1: Summary of 2002 Housing Element Accomplishments
 Goal                   Accomplishments
 Housing and            The City adopted the Neighborhood Beautification Ordinance (NBO) in
 Neighborhood           September 1999 and amended it in 2000 to establish fines for violation of non-
 Conservation           compliance.
                        The City uses CDBG loan funds to rehabilitate owner occupied housing units
                        and provides assistance to six to eight homeowners annually.
                        The City operates a Capital Improvement Program to rehabilitate and replace
                        obsolete infrastructure. During the last Housing Element period, the City spent
                        over $6 million on projects that include street resurfacing, sidewalk repair, and
                        repair of public facilities, such as the large gym at the City’s Sport Center.
                        The City continues to work with the Santa Clara County Housing Authority to
                        maintain affordability of expired units at Sunnyhills Apartments.
                        The City administered its Mobile Home Conversion Ordinance, when the
                        owners of the South Main Street Mobile Home Park converted the Park to
                        other uses.
 New Housing            The City created a Transit-Oriented Overlay Zone that increases densities and
 Production             land utilization.
                        The City has maintained a minimum housing density of 20 dwelling units/acre
                        in the Midtown and Transit Specific Plan Areas. Most new developments
                        exceed this minimum density.
                        The City established a Mixed-Use Zoning District in its Zoning Ordinance.
                        The City modified zoning in the Town Center Zoning District to allow
                        residential development. A 65-unit housing development was completed in
                        2009 in the Town Center.
                        The City changed the Zoning Ordinance to permit mixed use and residential
                        developments “by right” in the Midtown Specific Plan Area.
                        The City purchased additional wastewater capacity to accommodate
                        infrastructure necessary for new housing development.
                        The City is investing its own redevelopment agency funds and applying for
                        additional funds from the State and VTA to provide infrastructure
                        improvements for the Transit and Midtown Specific Plan Areas.
                        The City completed a water system loop connecting Bothello Avenue and East
                        Carlo to benefit development at the Union Pacific Site, located in the Midtown
                        Specific Area.
                        Improvements to the Trade Zone Boulevard Sewer Service are now included
                        in the Transit Area improvements.
                        To avoid potential flooding, the City reduced the allowable density at the
                        Crossings Apartment site development, in order to provide for the open space
                        needed for detention ponds (rather than allowing the maximum density on
                        site).
                        The City included residents (Midtown Task Force) to work with the Planning
                        Commission and City Council in the preparation of the Midtown Specific Plan.
                        The City promoted its Midtown Specific Plan through the preparation of
                        promotional materials and advertisements on the City’s website, on Cable TV,
                        and in the local newspaper.
                        The City expanded its Redevelopment Project Area to include the Midtown
                        Specific Plan Area.
                        The City has provided $5.8 million in Redevelopment funds to provide low- and
                        moderate-income housing. These funds were used to cover impact fees on
                        affordable units, and to support subsidized projects.
                        A master EIR for the Transit Specific Plan Area was completed.
                                                                                                       7-11

                                                                                        HOUSING ELEMENT
 Goal                      Accomplishments
                           The City worked with property owners to assemble small sites for future
                           housing developments.
                           The City provided $23.6 million in financial assistance (primarily loans) to 10
                           residential projects resulting in the creation of 789 affordable units. The City
 Housing Diversity         has also contributed to Santa Clara County’s Housing Trust Fund, since its
 and Affordability         inception. Since 2004, the City has provided $925,000 to this Fund. Two of the
                           city’s affordable developments received funds from this Trust Fund during the
                           last Housing Element period.
                           The City amended its Density Bonus Ordinance so that it is consistent with
                           State Law.
                           The City encourages the use of density bonuses to promote affordable
                           housing. Examples of recent projects benefiting from the density bonus are
                           DeVries Place Senior Housing and Summerfield Homes.
                           The City provided $2.4 million in developer impact fee assistance to three
                           projects during the last update period.
                           The City provides mortgage assistance to first-time homebuyers. This
                           assistance is frequently provided to buyers of affordable units in mixed-income
                           developments.
                           The City provided financial assistance to two low-income senior rental projects
                           (DeVries Place Senior housing, and Senior Solutions group home).
                           The City promotes both large units (four bedrooms) and very small units
                           (studios) when negotiating with market rate developers.
                           The City adopted a policy to encourage live/work lofts in specific residential
                           projects.
                           The City supports homeless services and housing in a number of ways. It
                           provided CDBG funding to construct a center which provides shelter and
                           transitional housing services. On an ongoing basis, Milpitas provides
                           assistance to organizations assisting the homeless, including food pantries
                           and groups providing referrals and counseling.
                           The City provides CDBG housing rehabilitation funds for retrofitting of homes
                           for disabled persons and provides funds to Project Sentinel, an organization
                           that also helps with retrofitting of homes.
                           The City provides public information to developers regarding Title 24 and ADA
                           compliance and to disabled persons about housing opportunities and
                           resources.
                           The City provides information on housing and housing opportunities on the
                           City’s website, Cable TV, and the Milpitas Post.
                           The City provides funding to Project Sentinel, a social services agency that
 Fair Housing
                           monitors housing discrimination and provides information and referrals.
                           The City provides referrals and outreach materials to help low-income seniors
                           reduce energy consumption. This information covers PG&E’s Energy Partners
 Energy Conservation
                           Program that provides free weatherization services and energy-efficient
                           appliances to reduce energy consumption.
                           The City adopted a Green Building Policy Resolution (No. 7735). The City
                           also mandates conformance with the State of California’s Title 24 Energy
                           Efficiency Standards.

B. Progress in Achieving RHNA Goals
The 2002 Housing Element addressed housing needs for the City of Milpitas from 1999 through 2006.
Table II.2 below shows the total number of housing units built (or permitted) in the City of Milpitas from
1999 to 2006. Table II.2 compares these units with the units required to be developed in Milpitas
pursuant to the City’s Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) provided by ABAG.
A total of 2,419 housing units were built or permitted during this period. The total difference between the
RHNA numbers (4,348) and the actual housing units built or permitted is 1,929 units. The income
category that the City came closest to meeting was the above moderate-income group, for which almost
79 percent of RHNA goals were met. In addition, the City met almost 60 percent of the housing need for
very low-income households. Finally of the 405 very low-income units that were built or permitted, 123 or
30 percent are affordable to extremely low-income households.

7.4 HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
The purpose of the Housing Needs Assessment is to describe housing, economic, and demographic
conditions in Milpitas, assess the demand for housing for households at all income levels, and document
the demand for housing to serve various special needs populations. The Housing Needs Assessment
also provides information on opportunities for energy conservation and analysis of any assisted housing
projects that are at risk of converting to market rate projects. The Housing Needs Assessment is
intended to assist Milpitas in developing housing goals and formulating policies and programs that
address local housing needs.
At the present time, there is no single source of information to use to describe existing demographic and
housing conditions, since the 2000 Census information is out-dated, and the next Census will not be
conducted until 2010.
Consequently, several sources of information were used to describe existing conditions in Milpitas.
These include the following:
     •    The 2000 Census, supplemented by 2008 estimates provided by Claritas, Inc. and housing unit
          estimates provided by the State of California, Department of Finance, provides information on
          population, number of households, household size, vacancy rates, and other demographic and
          housing characteristics.
     •    ABAG 2007 Projections provides employment and income projections.
     •    Other sources of economic information such as information from the Employment Development
          Department, website rental listings, multiple listing service, and other published data.
     •    Interviews with key informants provided information on special needs housing.
Finally, to facilitate an understanding of how the characteristics of Milpitas are similar to, or different from,
other nearby communities, this Housing Needs Assessment presents some comparative data for all of
Santa Clara County.
A summary of relevant trends in demographic, economic, and housing conditions based on the detailed
analyses in the Chapter is presented below.
                                                                                                              7-14

                                                                                        HOUSING ELEMENT
Demographic Trends
    •   The City continued to add population between 2000 and 2008, reaching an estimated population
        figure of 65,754 in 2008. The number of households also grew during the same time period.
    •   Almost half the City’s population is below 35 years of age.
    •   Milpitas remains a family oriented city. For example, the average household size of 3.5 persons
        is higher in Milpitas than in Santa Clara Count and over 80 percent of all households are family
        households.
    •   While nominal median income rose between 2000 and 2008 (from $84,429 to $97,870), real
        household incomes (adjusted for inflation) have dropped.
    •   About one-third of all Milpitas households pay more than 30 percent of their income on housing
        costs. This percentage is higher for lower-income and extremely low-income households, as well
        as for renters.
Employment Growth
    •   Employment growth between 2005 and 2015 is expected to reach 11 percent, or an increase of
        over 5,000 jobs.
    •   The growth in employed residents will exceed growth in population or growth in employment, so
        that there should be a better jobs/housing imbalance by 2015.
Housing Trends
    •   While only about 20 percent of Milpitas households live in overcrowded units (as defined by
        standards provided by Department of Housing and Urban Development [HUD] standards), the
        percentage of renters in overcrowded units is more than double the percentage of owners living in
        overcrowded units.1
    •   Almost 60 percent of all housing units are currently single family units. However, this ratio will
        decline, since the majority of new residential development projects are multifamily properties.
    •   The ratio of owners to renters is higher in Milpitas than in the County; 70 percent of Milpitas
        households own their own homes.
    •   Over half of all housing units were constructed since 1970. Aside from isolated pockets, the
        housing stock is in good condition.
    •   Starting in 2006, average rents started to increase. In comparison, sales prices have decreased
        since 2006.
    •   Housing affordability continues to be a problem for lower-income households.
    •   There continues to be more demand than supply for affordable senior housing, larger housing
        units, and housing for other special needs groups, such as the disabled and the homeless.

The total population in Milpitas is estimated at 65,754 in 2008 and grew by about five percent between
2000 and 2008. (See Table III.1.) This growth rate is slightly lower than the County’s growth rate.

It should be noted that the 2008 population estimates presented in Table III.1 are lower than the
estimates provided by the State of California, Department of Finance (DOF), for the same time period.
For example, the DOF estimates that the population in Milpitas as of January 2008 is actually 69,419,
which exceeds the Claritas estimate by 3,665 persons (or about six percent).2
The distribution of Milpitas's population according to the age categories presented in Table III.2 is similar
to Santa Clara County’s. Almost half of the population in Milpitas and Santa Clara County is below the
age of 35, and about one-quarter is below the age of 18. Finally, the proportion of senior persons (65 and
over) in Milpitas in 2008 is slightly lower at nine percent, in comparison to the proportion of senior persons
in Santa Clara County (ten percent).

  The differences between the Claritas estimates and the DOF estimates mentioned in this section are not significant,
since they are within five to six percent of each other. While it is possible that DOF information is more accurate
(since information on building permits is collected directly from cities), it is necessary to utilize Claritas numbers in
the Housing Element. Claritas provides information on additional demographic characteristics not provided by the
DOF, such as age and income.

Milpitas had a total of approximately 47,650 jobs in 2005 and is projected to add an additional 5,240 jobs
by 2015, for a percentage increase of 11 percent. The job sectors projected to have the highest growth
rates are Other (24 percent), Financial & Professional Services (21 percent), and Health, Educational &
Recreational (18 percent). Health, Educational & Recreational also will experience the highest growth in
the absolute number of new jobs (an increase of 1,540 jobs).
Presently, the City of Milpitas’ level of employment exceeds the number of employed residents. ABAG
projects that this trend will decline over time. The ratio of total jobs to employed residents was estimated
to be 1.8 in 2005 and is projected to decline to 1.5 by 2015. In other words, for every employed resident
in Milpitas in 2005, there were 1.8 jobs, and this number is projected to decline to 1.5 jobs per employed
resident by 2015.
3) Projections of Population, Employed Residents and Employment
Table III.4 shows projected population, employed residents and employment for Milpitas and Santa Clara
County for 2005 and 2015. As shown in the table, ABAG projects Milpitas's population to increase from
64,900 in 2005 to 74,400 in 2015, an increase of nearly 15 percent over the 10-year period. In contrast,
Santa Clara County’s population is projected to grow at a slightly slower rate of 12 percent from 2005 to
2015.
The 10-year percentage change in employed residents in Milpitas is projected to be 34 percent, more
than twice the percentage increase in population during the same period. A similar trend is projected for
Santa Clara County. Finally, the number of jobs in Milpitas is projected to increase at a lower rate than
percentage increases in employed residents.

In summary, current and projected conditions indicate that the City’s population is continuing to grow and
that the population is relatively young, reflecting a growing labor force that is attracted to the jobs
provided in Milpitas.
B. Household Characteristics
1) Number and Type of Households
The number of households in Milpitas is estimated at 17,901 in 2008, for a household growth rate of
about five percent between 2000 and 2008. This growth rate is similar to the population growth rate
between 2000 and 2008. In addition, average household size in Milpitas is estimated at 3.50 persons per
household in 2008 and is slightly higher than the average household size in 2000 (3.47 persons per
household). The average household size in Milpitas is higher than the average household size in Santa
Clara County. (See Table III.5.)

The U.S. Census divides households into two different categories, depending on their composition.
Family households are those that consist of two or more related persons living together. Non-family
households include persons who live alone or in groups comprised of unrelated individuals. As shown in
Table III.6, about 82 percent of Milpitas’ households are estimated to be family households in 2008. In
Santa Clara County, this number is lower at about 70 percent. The rate of homeownership in Milpitas (70
percent) is also higher than Santa Clara County’s (59 percent) and could be due to the high proportion of
family households.
                                                                                                        7-18

2) Existing and Projected Incomes
Table III.7 shows the distribution of estimated 2008 household incomes for Milpitas and compares it with
actual (unadjusted) 1999 incomes reported by the 2000 Census. The percentage of households in each
category up to $150,000 does not vary significantly between 2000 and 2008. However, a slightly higher
percentage of households earned above $150,000 in 2008 in comparison to households falling into this
category in 2000 (24 percent versus 17 percent). This reflects an increase in nominal incomes between
these two time periods.

However, once household income is adjusted for inflation a different pattern emerges. Milpitas and Santa
Clara County household incomes have declined in constant dollars since 2000. The Association of Bay
                                                                                                     7-19

Area Governments (ABAG) income estimates documents this trend. A comparison of the average
household income in 2000 with estimated household income in 2005 indicates that Milpitas incomes
dropped by about $20,000 between these time periods. This is very similar to the drop in average income
in Santa Clara County during this same time period. (See Table III.8.) The most likely explanation for this
drop in income is the decline in employment since 2000 in Silicon Valley industries that are located in and
adjacent to the City of Milpitas and in Santa Clara County.

A final way to understand household income in Milpitas is to understand the household income categories
established for state and federal housing programs. These income categories are based on estimated
income in Santa Clara County. In a subsequent section of the housing element, these income definitions
are used to define housing affordability.
Table III.9: Definitions of Income Categories for Milpitas and Santa Clara County, Based on State
Income Limits
  Extremely Low-Income Households have a combined income at or lower than 30 percent of area
  median income (AMI) for Santa Clara County, as established by the state Department of Housing
  and Community Development (HCD). A household of four is considered extremely low-income in
  Santa Clara County if its combined income is less than $31,850 for the year 2008.
  Very Low-Income Households have a combined income between 31 and 50 percent of AMI for
  Santa Clara County, as established by HCD. A household of four is considered very low-income in
  Santa Clara County if its combined income is between $31,851 and $53,050 in 2008.
  Low-Income Households have a combined income between 51 and 80 percent of AMI for Santa
  Clara County, as established by HCD. A household of four is considered to be low-income in Santa
  Clara County if its combined income is between $53,051 and $84,900 in 2008.
  Median-Income Households have a combined income of 100 percent of AMI for Santa Clara
  County, as established by HCD. A household of four is considered to be median-income in Santa
  Clara County if its combined income is $105,500 in 2008.
  Moderate-Income Households have a combined income between 81 and 120 percent of AMI for
  Santa Clara County, as established by HCD. A household of four is considered to be moderate-
  income in Santa Clara County if its combined income is between $84,901 and $126,600 in 2008.
  Above Moderate-Income Households have a combined income greater than 120 percent of AMI
  for Santa Clara County, as established by HCD. A household of four is considered to be above
  moderate-income in Santa Clara County if its combined income is greater than $126,600 in 2008.

2008.
3) Housing Cost Burdens
According to state standards, a household is considered to be overpaying for housing, and therefore
facing a housing cost burden, if gross monthly housing costs require more than 30 percent of gross
monthly income. Households paying more than 50 percent of gross monthly income are considered to
have severe cost burdens or are severely overpaying.
Table III.10 presents information on housing cost burden by tenure and household income levels as of
1999. This table is based on information provided by HUD’s cross-tabulations of 2000 Census data.3 As
shown, approximately 31 percent of all Milpitas households experienced high housing cost burdens in
1999. Housing cost burdens were greatest for renters – more than 40 percent of all Milpitas renters (for a
total of 2,040 households) paid more than 30 percent of their incomes for housing costs in 1999. Renter
households earning less than $50,000 per year were much more likely to have high cost burdens than
households with annual incomes greater than $50,000. For households earning less than $20,000 per
year, the percentage of renters with high cost burdens increased to 87 percent. For households with
annual incomes between $20,000 and $34,999, nearly 83 percent had high cost burdens.
A smaller percentage of Milpitas homeowners (27 percent) had high cost burdens in 1999. A total of
2,845 homeowners had high cost burdens in 1999.4 This included 62 percent of households earning
between $20,000 and $34,999, and 66 percent of households with annual incomes between $35,000 and
$49,999.
A substantial percentage of households earning close to median income also faced high housing cost
burdens in 1999. For households earning between $50,000 and $74,999 per year, which is roughly
comparable to 80 to 100 percent of area median income, a third of renter households and nearly half of
homeowners paid more than 30 percent of their incomes on housing costs.

State Housing Element guidelines call for an analysis of the proportion of “lower-income” households
overpaying for housing (Government Code, Section 65583(a) (2). Lower-income households are defined
as those earning 80 percent AMI or below. According to HUD, the 2000 income limit for lower-income
households for the Milpitas area (Santa Clara County) was $56,950.5
As shown in Table III.11, Milpitas had 2,329 lower-income renter households in 1999. Of those, 1,665
(nearly 72 percent) had high housing cost burdens. It is estimated that 2,147 of Milpitas' owner
households were lower-income in 1999 and that of these, 1,274 (59 percent) had high housing cost
burdens. These data clearly show that substantial portions of Milpitas's lower-income households had a
problem with high housing cost burdens in 1999.

  This figure is based on a household size of four persons. Income limits were higher or lower for larger or smaller
households, respectively.

The incidence of high housing cost burdens in Milpitas exceeded (66 percent) comparable figures for
Santa Clara County for both renters and homeowners (63 percent), as shown in Table III.11. However
the percentage of all households with severe housing cost burdens (35 percent) was similar in Milpitas
and Santa Clara County.
4) Extremely Low-Income Households
Government Code Section 65583(a) (1) requires that housing elements provide documentation of
projections and quantification of a jurisdiction’s existing and projected housing needs for all income levels,
including extremely low-income households. Extremely low-income households are those who earn less
than 30 percent of Area Median Income (AMI). Without adequate affordable housing, these households
are typically the most at risk of becoming homeless.
Eight percent of Milpitas households were extremely low income in 1999, totaling 1,302 households.
About a third of these extremely low-income households are one- and two-person senior households.6
Housing cost burdens for extremely low-income households are the highest of any income group, as
shown in Table III.12.

Assuming extremely low-income households continue to be the same percentage of households as they
are today, Milpitas could add an additional 218 extremely low-income households by 2015.7 An
alternative approach to estimate the growth in extremely low-income households would be to assume that
half the RHNA allocation of units for very low-income households (689 units) could be required by
extremely low-income households. This estimation approach generates a higher number of extremely
low-income households (345) in comparison to the estimation approach based on ABAG and census
data.
At this time, there are 128 existing and planned rent-restricted units for extremely low-income households
in Milpitas; five units for extremely low-income seniors are located at a newly developed group home
(Senior Solutions), 72 units are included at the newly constructed senior development, DeVries Place, 46
family units for extremely low-income households are under construction at Aspen Family Apartments,
and another five extremely low-income seniors will be assisted at another group home to be developed by
Senior Solutions. When these units are built, there will be a total of 128 units for extremely low-income
households in Milpitas. Finally, Sunnyhills Apartments is a mixed-income community. It provides 149
Section 8 units for which extremely low-income households would be eligible.
In addition to these resources in Milpitas, the Santa Clara County Housing Authority provides Section 8
vouchers to Milpitas households, and EHC Lifebuilders provides shelter and support services for the
Milpitas homeless. Finally, the County provides direct services to the homeless. These services are
discussed below in the subsection on homelessness.
5) Affordable Rental Costs and Home Prices
Household income and household size are the bases upon which to define the ability of a household to
pay for housing costs. The following section examines the ability of Milpitas households at various income
levels to pay for housing. This analysis is presented by the household income categories defined in
Table III.9.
Table III.13 shows maximum affordable monthly rents and maximum affordable purchase prices for
extremely low-, very low-, low-, median- and moderate-income households in Santa Clara County
(including Milpitas). Since income categories vary by household size, information is presented for
households ranging in size from one to five persons. For example: a three-person household classified
as low-income (or 80 percent of AMI) with an annual income of up to $76,400 could afford to pay $1,910
monthly gross rent (including utilities) or purchase a $206,006 house, assuming a five percent down
payment. While affordable rents are defined as requiring no more than 30 percent of income, affordable
home prices for owners vary according to income level and range between 30 and 35 percent.8
7
  ABAG, Projections 2007. The City of Milpitas as a whole is projected to add 2,730 households between 2005 and
2015. The estimated number of extremely low-income households is projected by multiplying the percent of
extremely low-income households as of 2000 (eight percent) to the household growth of 2,730 projected by ABAG.
8
  For example, the percentage of income paid for ownership costs for lower-income households is 30% of gross
income, but median- and moderate-income households are assumed to be able to pay 35% of gross income for
ownership costs.
                                                                                                             7-24

Later subsections of this Housing Needs Assessment Chapter show that the current rents and sales
prices for much of the Milpitas housing stock is priced beyond the affordable levels defined in Table III.13.

The Census defines an overcrowded unit as one with more than 1.0 person per room (excluding
bathrooms and kitchens). Units with more than 1.5 persons per room are considered severely
overcrowded.
In total, 19 percent of Milpitas housing units were overcrowded in 2000, as shown in Table III.14. This
represents 3,334 households, 1,632 of whom were renter households and 1,702 were homeowners.
Approximately 9 percent of housing units in Milpitas were severely overcrowded. Proportionally,
overcrowding was a greater problem for the City’s renter households than its homeowners in 2000.
Overcrowding was worse for both homeowners and renters in Milpitas than for Santa Clara County as a
whole.

C. Housing Stock Characteristics
1) Information Sources
There are three sources of information for 2008 housing unit counts. These include the State of California
Department of Finance Population and Housing Estimates (DOF); Claritas, Inc., a private company that
provides housing and population estimates and projections, and the City of Milpitas’ building records.
However, information provided by these sources differs. For example, the lowest count of housing unit
growth between 2000 and 2008 is the DOF estimate of 1,709 housing units. In comparison, Claritas’
estimate for growth in the number of housing units is higher during the same period at 1,917 units (a
difference of 208 units). Finally, according to the City, a total of 3,318 housing permits were issued
between 1999 and 2006. All three sources of information are used in the Housing Element.
     •   DOF is the source of information for 2008 housing unit counts by type of housing (single family,
         multifamily, etc.), and occupancy status.
     •   Claritas estimates are used for 2008 tenure and age of housing information.
     •   City of Milpitas records are used in describing the number and type of units that have been
         permitted since January 1, 2007.
Finally, a targeted housing condition survey was conducted to supplement the information provided by
these other data sources. Results from this survey are presented below.
2) Housing Types and Occupancy Levels
Table III.15 presents information on the housing stock of Milpitas and Santa Clara County in 2000 and
2008. In 2008, single family detached units accounted for the majority of housing in Milpitas, comprising
nearly 58 percent of the total. When detached and attached single family units are considered together,
they make up more than two-thirds of the total existing housing stock. While single family units constitute
a slightly larger proportion of the total housing stock in Milpitas than in Santa Clara County as a whole,
single family units declined as a percentage of total housing units in Milpitas between 2000 and 2008.
In contrast, multifamily properties represent a growing percentage of total housing units in Milpitas. As
shown in Table III.15, multifamily properties with more than five units grew from 12.6 to 18.5 percent of
the total housing stock between 2000 and 2008. With few exceptions, all housing built in Milpitas since
2000 has been multifamily.9
In 2000, a majority of five-plus unit properties had between 5 and 20 units, and just over a third of all five-
plus unit properties had more than 50 units.10 While information provided by the California Department of
Finance (DOF) for 2008 does not provide details about how many units are presently in large multifamily
properties, a recent market study prepared for the City found that of the 3,492 housing units that were
under construction or had been recently approved as of February 2008, the average density was 34 units

to the acre.11 In fact, 98% of new housing in Milpitas is multifamily. This trend reflects the City’s policy to
develop denser housing in the Midtown and Transit Area Specific Plan Areas.
The percentage of mobile home units in Milpitas’s housing stock has remained relatively constant
between 2000 and 2008, at just over three percent of total housing stock. These units have been
governed by rent control since 1992.
Table III.15 also shows the number of occupied units and the percentage of vacant units. It is important
to note that these counts include all vacant units, including those units held vacant for seasonal use; not
all of the vacant units are actually offered for sale or for rent. Milpitas is shown as having a very low
vacancy rate of 1.34 percent in 2008, which is slightly lower than the vacancy rate for Santa Clara
County.

3) Overall Housing Conditions
The U.S. Census provides only limited data that can be used to infer the condition of Milpitas' housing
stock. For example, the Census reports on whether housing units have complete kitchen and plumbing
facilities. With the exception of 46 housing units, all Milpitas housing units had complete plumbing
facilities, and only 38 units had incomplete kitchen facilities as of 2000. These census indicators reveal
little about overall housing conditions.
In most cases, the age of a community's housing stock is a better indicator of the likely condition of the
housing stock, particularly in communities like Milpitas where a large proportion of housing units are
relatively new. As shown in Table III.16, over 98% of the City’s housing stock was built after World War II.
Nearly half (45 percent) of all units have been built since 1980, and a comparable percentage (46
percent) was built in the 1960s and 1970s. However, since approximately 31 percent of the City’s

The Senior Housing Neighborhood Preservation Specialist provided statistics on code enforcement
activity during the past three years. Code enforcement activity relates to both housing and neighborhood
conditions. In the last three fiscal years, starting in 2005/06 and ending in 2007/08, resolved violations
and complaints were primarily connected to enforcement of the Neighborhood Beautification Ordinance.
     •   In 2005/06, there were a total of 1,802 resolved violations and complaints, of which 337 were
         vehicle related.
     •   In 2006/07, the number of violations and complaints was lower at 1,470, of which 208 were
         vehicle related.
     •   Finally, in 2007/08, there were 1,500       violations and complaints, of which 225 were vehicle
         related.
These violations covered a range of violations, including those related to signs, zoning, junk cars, graffiti,
solid waste and animal regulations. Most of these violations are related to the City’s Neighborhood
Beautification Ordinance, which was adopted in December 2000. The Ordinance specifies certain actions
as unlawful, outlines procedures for abating the problem, and establishes a schedule of fines to apply if
necessary. The Ordinance covers the following areas:
     •   Outdoor Storage – The accumulation of junk, discarded objects, furniture, etc. that are a threat to
         health or safety of any person or that are visible from the public right-of-way. Includes vehicles in
         disrepair.
     •   Landscaping/Vegetation – Dead, decayed, diseased or hazardous trees, weeds, shrubs or other
         vegetation. Overgrown vegetation likely to harbor rats, vermin and other similar nuisances.
     •   Buildings and Structures – Includes abandoned and boarded up buildings.
     •   Fences and Gates – Severely sagging, leaning, fallen or decayed fences or other structures.
     •   Parking in Residential Front Yards – Includes vehicle parked on the lawn or
         residential front yard.
                                                                                                          7-30

                                                                                       HOUSING ELEMENT
    •    Residential Vehicle Repair – Prohibits major vehicle repairs, such as pulling an engine block,
         repair and replacement of transmissions and similar work associated with automobiles, boats or
         other motorized vehicles.
    •    Miscellaneous – Any other condition or use of property that represents a threat to the health and
         welfare of the public by virtue of its unsafe, dangerous or hazardous nature.
The City’s Code Enforcement Program responds to complaints from residents through a Service Request
format, which investigates complaints. If the condition is a violation of the Neighborhood Beautification
Ordinance, the property owner is given notice to comply and, if necessary, is cited for the violation.
4) Targeted Housing Condition Survey
A windshield survey of housing conditions was conducted for the 2002 Housing Element. Similarly, a
windshield survey of housing conditions was conducted for the Housing Element update. However, the
2008 windshield survey was more targeted.
The following two neighborhoods were surveyed in 2008:
    •    The Selwyn Park neighborhood, including Selwyn, Shirley, and Edsel Drives as well as Dempsey
         Road. (This area is south of East Calaveras Boulevard.)
    •    The Cardoza Park area, bordered to the north by Kennedy Drive, to the south by Calaveras
         Boulevard, to the east by North Park Victoria and to the west by North Temple Drive.
These neighborhoods were chosen based on staff recommendations of areas that could potentially have
more housing problems than other areas in the City. While these neighborhoods were not intended to
represent the City’s overall housing stock, they were chosen as areas that could have housing
rehabilitation needs.
A total of 128 properties were randomly sampled. Surveyed properties included the following housing
types:
    •    Single family homes (54 percent),
    •    Duplexes (nearly 13 percent),
    •    Tri- and quad-plexes (nearly 20 percent), and
    •    Five-or-more-unit buildings (14 percent).
For more information on the methodology used for the housing condition survey, see Appendix C.
Three quarters of all surveyed properties received a rating of either sound or excellent. Only 23 percent
received a rating that suggested the need for minor rehabilitation, and only two properties appeared to
require moderate rehabilitation. (See Table III.17.) No properties were assessed to be dilapidated or in
need of substantial rehabilitation.
                                                                                                         7-31

Generally, properties needing some form of rehabilitation received this rating due to the need for repairs
in multiple categories, such as foundation, siding, roofing and/or windows and doors.
Multifamily buildings with three or more units were the buildings most likely to need some form of
rehabilitation, while single family structures were the least likely. (See Table III.18.)

With regard to specific housing conditions, the housing survey found the following:
     •   Siding disrepair was the most common housing problem; 62 percent of surveyed properties
         needed some form of siding improvement. Usually a structure’s siding needed repainting, though
         20 percent of the properties had siding that was cracked or broken in spots, and two percent
         needed outright siding replacement.
     •   Windows and doors were generally in the best condition – only 20 percent had some form of
         problem requiring repair.
     •   Twenty-eight percent of properties showed cracks at the foundation, though none of these
         currently require partial or full replacement.
     •   About 27 percent of properties had cracked, broken or curled shingles, but only one property
         needed partial re-roofing or more serious repair.
     •   Few blighting conditions were evident at surveyed properties. However a total of eight surveyed
         properties had trash accumulations in their front yards, one property had fence graffiti, and one

A block assessment was conducted in tandem with the housing condition survey, in part to record issues
missed through random sampling. The block assessment took a broader look at conditions on each
surveyed street. This assessment identified additional code and clean-up issues, but found limited
evidence of major problems. Trash accumulation was observed on eight of the 19 street segments
surveyed. A handful of blocks had properties with cars parked on front lawns. Several multifamily
buildings in the survey area had carports in disrepair. Overall, properties whose conditions might be
characterized as poor were rare. Only four street segments contained a property meeting this description.
The majority of blocks assessed were rated in good condition, and one was rated excellent.
5) Rental Housing Costs, Trends, and Affordability
Thus far, this Housing Needs Assessment has addressed the types of housing and housing conditions in
Milpitas. A final consideration is the cost of both rental and for-sale housing. Table III.19 presents two
indicators of existing rent levels in Milpitas. One indicator relies on HUD-defined, fair market rents
(FMRs) for Santa Clara County (including Milpitas). Fair market rents represent the 40th percentile of
rents in the County.12 In other words, sixty percent of rents in the County are above the figures shown
and forty percent below. In general, the FMR for an area is the amount that would be needed to pay the
gross rent (rent plus utilities) of privately owned, decent, safe, and sanitary rental housing of a modest,
non-luxury nature with suitable amenities. The second indicator shows average advertised rents in
Milpitas as of August 2008. These advertised rents would be expected to be higher than FMRs for two
reasons. First, FMRs are at the 40th percentile, as described above, and the advertised rents reported in
Table III.19 are averages. Secondly, FMRs are based on the countywide rental market, and Milpitas is a
higher priced market than some areas in Santa Clara County, including parts of San Jose.

As shown previously in Table III.9, a low-income, three-person household with an annual income of up to
$76,400 could afford to pay a monthly gross rent (including utilities) of $1,910. Comparing Table III.9 to
Table III.19, such a household could afford the fair market rent of $1,293 for a two-bedroom unit,
assuming such a unit was available in Milpitas. This household would also be able to afford the average
advertised rent of $1,748. However, a very low-income household of the same size, earning $47,750 per
year, could only afford to pay a monthly rent of $1,194, and would therefore be unable to afford the FMR
for a two-bedroom unit or pay the average advertised rent for a two-bedroom unit.
12
   The 40th percentile rent is drawn from the distribution of rents of all units that are occupied by recent movers.
Adjustments are made to exclude public housing units, newly built units and substandard units.
                                                                                                                   7-33

Generally, low-income households (between 51% and 80% AMI) of one to four persons are able to afford
the average priced rental units appropriate to their household sizes in Milpitas. However, affordable
rental options are scarcer for larger, low-income households. For example, neither five-person nor six-
person, low-income households would be able to afford the average rents for four-bedroom units
($2,476). Also, very low-income and extremely low-income households earn just below what would be
necessary to afford the fair market rent for units matched to their household sizes, with the single
exception of studio apartments. Average advertised apartment rents are even less affordable for very
low- and extremely low-income households, at all apartment sizes.
Average rents in Milpitas have been steadily increasing during the second half of this decade. After
falling on an annual basis between 2001 and 2005, rents began to increase again in 2006 as demand for
homeownership started to decline, and rental housing became more appealing. According to rent data
derived from listings posted at apartmentratings.com, the average two-bedroom apartment rent
(unadjusted for inflation) rose from approximately $1,350 in 2005 to $1,550 in 2007. In 2008, two-
bedroom apartment rents averaged approximately $1,750, an increase of 13 percent over 2007 rents.13
While rents have not yet reached 2001 rent levels, when an average two-bedroom rented for
approximately $1,900, rents appear to be steadily increasing. It is likely that recent trends in the housing
market, such as lack of credit and relatively high prices, have encouraged households to continue renting.
6) Homeownership Costs, Trends, and Affordability
Home prices in Milpitas have followed the inverse pattern of apartment rentals over the past decade.
After dipping slightly during the dot-com bust in 2002, home prices in Milpitas rose rapidly to new highs in
the middle part of the decade. Tables III.20 and III.21 show a year-to-year comparison of median and
average sales prices from 2001 through the first part of 2008 for both single family homes and
condominiums in Milpitas. As shown, single family home prices rose 60 percent between 2001 and 2006,
reaching a peak average price of $768,912, but then fell with the onset of the housing downturn. Average
prices in 2008 are now 25 percent below their peak in 2006, with a 21-percent drop in home prices
recorded between May 2008 and May 2007.

The City’s condominium market has been less volatile during the recent housing market crisis. Since
peaking in 2005 at approximately $536,000, average prices for condominiums sold in the month of May
have only dropped six percent, falling to $504,000 in 2008.

The City of Milpitas is not significantly impacted by recent foreclosure activity. For example, in March
2009, 426 homes were listed as being at some point in the foreclosure process (from notice of default
through bank sales) according to RealtyTrac, a private firm that tracks foreclosures. This number
represents about two percent of all housing units in Milpitas.
Despite the overall downturn of the past few years, 2008 median sales prices are still well above 2001
levels. Median single family home prices have increased 21 percent since 2001, and median
condominium prices have increased by more than 40 percent. This has had important impacts on
housing affordability.
Based on the sales price assumptions presented in Table III.9, low- and moderate-income households
would be unable to afford the average priced single family home in Milpitas ($573,002 in May 2008) or
                                                                                                         7-35

                                                                                            HOUSING ELEMENT
even the average priced condominium unit ($504,000). In order to afford to purchase a single family
home, a household would need to be above-moderate-income, with an annual income of approximately
$137,000 (130 percent of area median income).14 Only 30 percent of Milpitas households presently meet
this threshold, based on the 2008 income distribution data presented earlier in Table III.7. To afford the
average priced condominium unit, a household would need to earn $120,000 annually (or 114 percent of
AMI). Presently about 34 percent of Milpitas’ households earn enough to afford the average priced
condominium unit.
D. Special Housing Needs
Within the general population there are several groups of people who have special housing needs. These
needs can make it difficult for members of these groups to locate suitable housing. The following
subsections discuss the special housing needs of the six groups identified in State housing element law
(Government Code, Section 65583(a) (6)). Specifically, these include elderly households, persons with
disabilities, large households, female-headed households, farm workers, and the homeless. Where
possible, estimates of the population or number of households in Milpitas falling into each group are
presented.
1) Elderly Households
The total population of residents over the age of 65 in Milpitas grew by more than 1,500 persons between
2000 and 2008 to reach an estimated total of 5,972 in 2008. This represents an increase of nearly 35
percent since 2000, significantly higher than the growth rate of the City’s non-senior population. As
shown in Table III.22, the much of the absolute growth in the senior population was among adults 65 to
74 years of age, and the fastest growth rate was experienced by seniors 75 years and older. Finally, the
senior population of Milpitas grew at a faster rate than Santa Clara County’s senior population (35 percent
compared with 20 percent).
14
   This assumes that buyers spend 35% of their incomes for housing payments, provide a 20 percent down payment,
and obtain a 6.5%, fixed rate, 30-year mortgage. Insurance and property taxes are included in the computation of
affordable sales prices.

While Claritas provides information on growth in the senior population, it does not provide information on
growth in senior-headed households. Consequently, Table III.23 estimates growth in senior households
by tenure by combining information from the 2000 Census with information from Claritas. Table III.23
provides estimates for the total number of senior households in 2008, as well as estimates for renter-
occupied and owner-occupied units headed by seniors. The majority of senior households (76 percent)
were homeowners.

(1) To estimate the total number of senior households for 2008, the average size of senior-headed
households was assumed to be the same in 2008 as it was in 2000. The 2008 senior population was
then divided by the average senior household size to generate an estimate of the number of households
headed by seniors. Senior household tenure was estimated also using ratios from the 2000 Census. In
this case, the percentage of senior-headed households renting or owning their homes in 2000 was
applied to the total estimated number of senior households in 2008.

Senior Households’ Housing Cost Burdens
Senior households typically live on fixed incomes, thus potentially increasing their needs for affordable
housing. This is supported by information provided in Table III-24. As shown in Table III.24, one-to-two
person senior-headed households were more likely to have high housing cost burdens in 1999 than
                                                                                                        7-37

households in general, since 38 percent paid more than 30 percent of their income for housing, and 18
percent paid more than 50 percent of their income for housing costs. The cost burdens faced by senior
renters were particularly high, with nearly 61 percent of senior renter households experiencing a high
housing cost burden in 1999 compared to 37 percent of all renter households. Senior homeowners were
also more likely than their non-senior counterparts to experience a high housing cost burden; nearly 33
percent were burdened by high housing costs in 1999 compared to 26 percent of homeowners overall.
Although senior homeowners are generally more likely to have owned their homes long enough to pay off
mortgages, their higher rate of housing cost burden may result from having to pay other ownership costs
– such as utilities, maintenance, and insurance – on fixed incomes.

The housing burdens described above partly reflect the large percentage of senior households that are
lower-income in Milpitas. As Table III.25 shows, more than half of all one-to-two- person senior
households were low-, very low- or extremely low-income in 1999. Finally, senior renter households were
much more likely to be lower-income than were senior homeowners.

Finally, Table III.26 shows how the problem of high cost burdens is exacerbated for lower-income senior-
headed households. Over 50 percent of all lower-income senior households had high housing cost
burdens in 1999, and 30 percent had severe housing cost burdens. While a higher percentage of renters
faced high cost burden than homeowners, in absolute numbers, more homeowners have high cost
burdens.

Housing Options for Seniors
There is increasing variety in the types of housing available to the senior population. This section focuses
on three basic types.
     •   Independent living – housing for healthy seniors who are self-sufficient and want the freedom
         and privacy of their own separate, apartment or house. Many seniors remain in their original
         homes, and others move to special residential communities which provide a greater level of
         security and social activities of a senior community.
     •   Group living – shared living arrangements in which seniors live in close proximity to their peers
         and have access to activities and special services.
     •   Assisted living – provides the greatest level of support, including meal preparation and
         assistance with other activities of daily living.
                                                                                                        7-39

                                                                                             HOUSING ELEMENT
Each of these options is discussed below. It is clear that there is a lack of housing resources for low-
income seniors in Milpitas. This situation is not unique to Milpitas and reflects national trends.
Independent Living
The greatest need for some lower-income seniors is to receive support services in order to remain in their
own homes as long as possible.15 Santa Clara County provides some services to help lower-income
seniors live independently, but these services are insufficient to meet all needs. The primary, affordable
in-home service in Santa Clara County is provided by In-Home Health Services (IHHS), and the Multi-
Service Program (MSP). IHHS provides help with cooking, housekeeping, and transportation. MSP
offers teams of professionals who provide services like medication monitoring. The Council on Aging
coordinates both service providers, and operates with limited state funding. These services meet a very
small portion of the need.16 Since the senior population is projected to nearly double by the year 2020,
demand for these in-home services can be expected to increase dramatically as well.17
An alternative to receiving support services in one’s own home is to live in an independent living
development designed for seniors. Presently there are two affordable housing developments for lower-
income seniors in Milpitas. The newer of the two, Devries Place, was completed in February of 2008. It
was fully occupied in a short period of time. All 102 units are priced to be affordable to very low- and
extremely low-income seniors. The development is located in a mixed-use district at the north end of the
Midtown Specific Plan Area. The new Valley Health Center will be built next door to Devries Place in
2009, and a new Milpitas Public Library across the street has been completed and is open. Retail and
transit are also within a short walking distance.
Terrace Gardens, built in 1989, provides 148 units for very low-income seniors. A meal program is
included. The development is located behind a shopping center, providing residents with easy access to
retail goods, groceries and services.
Waiting lists at each of these developments are substantial, providing strong evidence of unmet need.
More than 150 people are on the waiting list for Devries Place, and new applicants are reportedly added
to the list on a daily basis. Terrace Gardens also maintains a waiting list. This list ranges between several
months to two years, depending on the affordability category and unit turnover.
Additionally, in Fall 2008, there were 330 seniors from Milpitas on Santa Clara County’s Housing
Authority’s Section 8 voucher waiting list. This is in addition to 116 Milpitas senior households that
already have vouchers.
Finally, the Barbara Lee Senior Center located in Milpitas reports that it receives between 30 and 40
inquiries from seniors for low-income housing per month. This request level remained steady during
2008. The City is building a new Senior Center and anticipates completion in late 2010.

Affordable Group Living
Senior Housing Solutions is a leading developer in Santa Clara County of shared senior housing, in which
older adults share large, single family homes. Presently this non-profit operates a total of nine houses
countywide, providing rooms for 37 seniors. Another three homes were under construction in the County
in 2008. Four to five extremely low-income residents live in each house. In 2007, Senior Housing
Solutions located its first shared home in Milpitas near Abel Street and Marylinn Drive. As of mid-2008,
130 people were on their waiting list. Ten of these individuals live in Milpitas. Senior Housing Solutions
expects its waiting list to double once it advertises its new homes.18 The City of Milpitas has authorized
another grant of $750,000 to Senior Housing Solutions for the development of another group house that
will serve five extremely low-income seniors. Finally, the City supports a request for funding by Senior
Housing Solutions to the Housing Trust Fund of Santa Clara County. Milpitas has pledged an additional
$100,000 in support for this funding request to the Housing Trust Fund.
Assisted Living
Residential care facilities for the elderly (RCFE’s) offer state-licensed assisted living for people who need
minimal assistance with personal care such as bathing, dressing, and grooming, and who need or want
communal meals and social contact. Presently, there are a total of five licensed residential care homes
for the elderly in Milpitas, with a combined capacity of 30 beds.19 The City provides CDBG funds to
Catholic Charities of Santa Clara County Long Term Care Ombudsman Program to seek resolution to
problems of seniors, to advocate for the rights of residents in long-term care facilities, and to investigate
complaints.
RCFE’s in Santa Clara County cost typically between $1,200 and $10,000 per month, with relatively few
facilities at the low end of the price scale (even assuming shared rooms and minimal personal care), and
more options in the $3000 to $4000 range.20 For those seniors who receive Supplemental Security
Income (SSI), their benefit levels would cover only a small portion of this cost. In addition, neither
Medical nor Medicaid assistance can be used to pay for rooms at RCFE’s. This mismatch between
income and residential costs underscores a need for more affordably priced residential care facilities.

2) Persons with Disabilities
In 2000, 17 percent of Milpitas residents over five years of age had some form of disability. This totaled
9,390 residents. The highest rate of disability was among persons over the age of 65 (44 percent). (See
Table III.27.)

Table III.28 provides more detailed information on the nature of these disabilities. The number of
disabilities in this table (16,296) exceeds the number of individuals with disabilities (9,390), since a
person can have more than one disability. Of the general population over the age of five who reported
disabilities, the most common disabilities were related to employment or difficulty going outside the home.

Not all disabled persons require special housing. Many disabled individuals live independently or with
family members. A small proportion of the City’s disabled population may actually require housing that is
specially adapted to accommodate their disabilities. However, there is unmet need for affordable housing
for disabled adults. For example, the Santa Clara County’s Housing Authority’s waiting list for Section 8
vouchers in 2008 included 191 Milpitas residents with disabilities.
                                                                                                         7-42

                                                                                               HOUSING ELEMENT
To understand the special housing needs of the City’s disabled population, this subsection provides
information on three categories of disabled adults. These include housing for individuals with mental
illness, the developmentally disabled, and the physically disabled.
Housing for Individuals with Mental Illness
The typical housing need for individuals with mental illness includes one-bedroom units, single room
occupancy units (SRO’s), or shared housing. Each type of housing also requires supportive services.
With the passage of the Mental Health Services Act in 2004, Santa Clara County Mental Health received
$19 million to buy and build units for severely mentally ill individuals who are homeless or nearly
homeless. The County’s Housing Plus Fund has also given the Mental Health Department $4 million for
this purpose. County Mental Health expects to build about 150 units of supportive housing with these
combined funds.
Two affordable projects that provide supportive services are in the pipeline. These projects are funded
through Mental Health Services Act and will be located in Santa Clara and San Jose. Other projects are
being considered for Sunnyvale and San Jose. No housing developments for mentally ill homeless
individuals are currently planned for Milpitas.
However, according to the Mental Health Department, these resources are inadequate to meet the total
need for affordable, supportive housing. According to the most recent census of the homeless, it is
estimated that 23% of the 7,202 sheltered and unsheltered homeless individuals in Santa Clara County
are mentally ill.21 Thus, the planned 150 housing units will fall short of the need represented by more
than 1,600 estimated mentally ill homeless in the County.
Private organizations like InnVision operate a continuum of supportive housing options for homeless
mentally ill individuals in Santa Clara County. These services are based in San Jose. For example,
Julian Street Inn provides 70 emergency shelter beds to clients diagnosed with a mental illness. Stevens
House provides transitional housing for eight “graduates” of the Julian Street Inn. A third housing
development operated by InnVision provides permanent supportive housing for mentally ill single women.
Housing for the Developmentally Disabled
Developmentally disabled individuals live with mental retardation, cerebral palsy, autism or other forms of
learning or cognitive disabilities. According to the San Andreas Regional Center in Santa Clara County,
there is a growing need for housing for the developmentally disabled in Milpitas. The Center estimates
that 310 developmentally disabled individuals presently live in Milpitas. The vast majority lives with a
parent, relative or legal guardian.
The Housing Choice Coalition is the affordable housing arm of the San Andreas Regional Center and
works with non-profits throughout Santa Clara County to develop special needs affordable housing
coupled with supportive services that can allow developmentally disabled adults live independently. In
21
   The information on the percent of the homeless population that is mentally ill is from the 2007 Homeless Census
and Survey. Also, the estimate of the number of mentally ill homeless is likely to be conservative, since it is based
on surveyed homeless who identified themselves as mentally ill.
                                                                                                                   7-43

                                                                                          HOUSING ELEMENT
2008, there were a total of 1,400 developmentally disabled individuals on the Housing Choice Coalition’s
waiting list for affordable housing. The Coalition has helped create 200 units in the past 11 years, and
has five more projects in the pipeline. None of these developments is located in Milpitas.
There are presently 10 residential care facilities in Milpitas for developmentally disabled adults, with a
combined capacity to serve 57 individuals. Most operate to serve non-ambulatory disabled adults.
Housing for the Physically Disabled
The Silicon Valley Independent Living Center (SVILC) receives more than 245 requests each year for the
placement of disabled persons in accessible housing. Only a small percentage of these persons can
actually be placed because of the shortage of special housing and its cost. Since most of the individuals
contacting SVILC are extremely low-income, they cannot afford market-rate rents.
According to SVILC, twenty Milpitas residents contacted the Center for services in 2007. Out of the
sixteen individuals who contacted the Center for housing, only four were actually placed. This low
placement rate is due to a lack of accessible, affordable housing.
3) Large Households
Large households, defined as households with five or more members, require housing units with three or
more bedrooms in order not to be overcrowded. Since large households are frequently family
households with children, suitable housing should also provide safe outdoor play areas, and be located
with convenient access to schools and child-care facilities. These types of needs can pose problems
particularly for large families that cannot afford to buy or rent single family houses, since apartment and
condominium units are often designed for smaller households.
It is estimated that in 2008, the City of Milpitas had 4,325 households with five or more members. This
accounted for 24 percent of all households. Most of these larger households were homeowners; only
one-third or 1,309 households were renters. (See Table III.29.)
                                                                                                           7-44

Tenure by household size was estimated based on the ratio of renters to homeowners for each
household size in 2000, using Census data. Total households by household size were derived from 2008
Claritas data.

As of 2000, over half of the housing stock in Milpitas (10,675 units) consisted of larger units, defined as
those with three or more bedrooms. (See Table III.30.) However, when renter household size
information is compared with the availability of units with four or more bedrooms, it appears that there is a
slight shortage of housing units for the 613 very large renter households (those with six or more persons).
As of 2000, there were only 540 rental units with four or more bedrooms.

A final assessment of the situation for large households is to consider household income levels. Table
III.31 provides data on the income levels of the City’s larger households. As shown, 1,042 large
households (26 percent of the total) were lower-income in 1999. The majority of these were renters.

When planning for new multifamily housing developments, therefore, the provision of housing for the
largest households is an important consideration. The new and proposed units in the City of Milpitas are
                                                                                                     7-46

                                                                                          HOUSING ELEMENT
not large, primarily because they are multifamily units. Over half of the new units recently built or under
construction have an average size below 1,050 square feet. In contrast, of the approximately 530 re-
sales of existing single family homes in 2006, the median size was 1,588 square feet, and the average
size was 1,712 square feet, significantly larger than new multifamily housing units.
The number of bedrooms in the new multifamily units also reflects the size difference between existing
single family housing stock and new housing development. In new developments, the median number of
bedrooms is two; in comparison the median number of bedrooms in existing single family units that sold
in 2006 was three. Finally, out of 2,662 new housing units built since 2000, there are only 11 four-
bedroom units, and less than half of all units (1,068 units out of 2,662) consist of three or more bedrooms.
The need for an adequate supply of rental units for very large renter households (mentioned above) is
magnified for lower-income, very large renter households whose limited incomes may preclude them from
renting single family homes with four or more bedrooms.
4) Female-Headed Households
Female-headed households are households of at least two persons (related or unrelated) headed by a
woman. As of 2008, it is estimated that there are 1,940 female-headed households in Milpitas,
representing 11 percent of all households in 2008.22 (See Table III.32.) A very small proportion of
female-headed households in Milpitas (approximately one percent) fall below the poverty level. This is
lower than overall poverty rate among Milpitas’ households in 2008 (estimated at three percent).

Due to lower incomes, female-headed households often have more difficulties finding adequate,
affordable housing than families with two adults. Also, female-headed households with small children
may need to pay for childcare, which further reduces disposable income. As an indication of unmet need
for affordable housing, there are presently 1,120 female-headed households in Milpitas on the Section 8
22
   A female-headed household is defined as a family or non-family household, headed by a female, consisting of at
least two persons.

from expanded affordable housing opportunities.
5) Farmworkers
Farms are present in Santa Clara County, but very few are located in or near Milpitas. For example, a
scan of pesticide permits conducted by the Agricultural Commission in 2008 found only one active permit
within Milpitas for a small rangeland property. The Santa Clara Farm Bureau is not aware of any other
farms other than rangeland in the immediate area. Farmworkers, employed in Santa Clara County, are
more likely to be working on farms located to the south of Milpitas in unincorporated areas of Santa Clara
County, as well as in jurisdictions such as Morgan Hill and Gilroy.
Within the City’s sphere of influence, it is estimated that 180 people are employed in Agriculture and
Natural Resources; however, there is no way to know how many of these jobs actually involve farm
work.23 The 2000 US Census identified 130 local residents employed in farming, fishing or forestry.
However, the location of these jobs is not specified and could be outside the City.
Presently, there is no farmworker housing in Milpitas. However, farmworker housing is a conditional use
in any district where it is deemed essential to public convenience or welfare and is consistent with the
General Plan. There are no special development standards or procedures for farmworker housing in
Milpitas. Due to the high cost of land, absence of seasonal agriculture, and lack of a significant
farmworker population in the City, the need to develop farmworker housing in Milpitas is a low priority.
6) Homeless
According to the 2007 Santa Clara County Homeless Census and Survey, there are at least 5,101
unsheltered homeless people in Santa Clara County and an additional 2,101 sheltered homeless
individuals at any point in time.24 (See Table III.33.) This is a conservative estimate, since it excludes
people staying in rehabilitation facilities, hospitals and jails. The total number of the County’s estimated
homeless population for 2007 (7,202) was slightly lower than the total estimated in 2005 (7,491).
However, a greater number of persons (18,056) were estimated to have been homeless at any point in
time during the course of the previous year.

Of the homeless population surveyed in the Homeless Census and Survey, approximately 29 percent
were chronically homeless, while 57 percent of respondents had been homeless only once within the past
year.25 Within the sheltered homeless population, 73 percent of single individuals (807) were male adults,
22 percent (248) were female adults and four percent (48) were single youth. Among the sheltered family
homeless population, 31 percent (309) were females, 10 percent (95) were males and 59 percent (592)
were youth.
Additional information about specific homeless subpopulations is provided in Table III.34. According to
the information presented in this table, the largest groups are persons with severe mental illness those
with chronic substance abuse, and homeless veterans.

The Homeless Census and Survey counted a total of 142 unsheltered homeless in Milpitas in 2007.
Roughly half of these unsheltered homeless were living in encampments, RV’s or vans. The Santa Clara
County Collaborative on Housing and Homeless Issues reports there were 189 adults and 34 children
from Milpitas who utilized homeless services somewhere in the County between July 1, 2007 and June
25
   Chronically homeless is defined as having a disabling condition and having either been homeless for a year or
more or having four or more episodes of homelessness within the past three years.

30, 2008.26 While Milpitas represents around 3.8 percent of the total Santa Clara County population, only
1.7 percent of the County’s homeless population had a last permanent address in Milpitas.27
The City of Milpitas is home to a relatively small percentage of the County’s homeless population, which
can be explained, in part, by the absence of shelters operating in the City. While EHC Lifebuilders (EHC)
is a primary provider of shelter and support services for the Milpitas homeless population, it operates
these services out of a central location in San Jose. The City of Milpitas provides EHC with CDBG
funding to cover the cost of 4,500 Person Shelter Days (PSD) for 55 unduplicated Milpitas residents at
EHC’s Reception Center on Little Orchard Street in San Jose. This is the closest overnight shelter that
serves Milpitas’ homeless population. The City of Milpitas also operates a “cooling and warming” shelter
for the homeless in the City’s Sports Center, but does not provide overnight housing there. In addition,
during the Winter, the City provides daytime warming centers at the City’s Community and Senior
Centers.
Despite its relatively small homeless population, however, the City of Milpitas has been collaborating with
other jurisdictions in Santa Clara County to address the homeless problem regionally, due to the shifting
nature of homelessness in Santa Clara County and the tendency of people to move between cities to find
work or housing. This collaboration includes supporting regional efforts to build additional transitional and
permanent housing with supportive services.
As of January 2007, Santa Clara County provided the following resources:
     •    744 year-round shelter beds (320 for families, 424 for individuals);
     •    250 seasonal shelter beds;
     •    1,445 transitional housing beds (1,064 for families, 381 for individuals), and
     •    1,170 permanent supportive housing beds (724 for families, 446 for individuals).
An additional 283 beds of permanent supportive housing were under development as of early 2007.28
Unmet need for 121 transitional housing beds and 2,346 permanent supportive housing beds remains,
according to the Santa Clara Collaborative on Housing and Homeless Issues. The need for emergency
shelter beds is harder to gauge. Emergency shelters for individuals in the County tend to be full, and
shelters for families are almost always full, though this does not necessarily suggest a need for more
shelter beds at present time according to the County Collaborative.29
The Santa Clara County Housing Authority sets aside two types of vouchers for chronically homeless
individuals, totaling 200 Section 8 vouchers. The waiting list for these vouchers is lengthy and closed.
26
   The Santa Clara County Homeless Management Information System (2008), operated by the Community
Technology Alliance on behalf of the Santa Clara Collaborative on Homelessness and Housing Issues, provided
these numbers. These figures do not include segments of the chronically homeless population that elect not to
receive assistance as well as short-term homeless families and individuals that were quickly re-housed without
assistance.

E. Opportunities for Energy Conservation
The purpose of assessing opportunities for energy conservation is to document how the City assists
residential development to conserve energy and secondly to understand how energy conservation can
reduce overall housing costs by reducing PG&E bills.
The City of Milpitas primarily facilitates energy conservation through its residential development and
zoning policies. These policies are reflected in the Midtown and Transit Area Specific Plans which
recommend that the City undertake rezoning of many underutilized parcels to higher densities. The
Specific Area Plans also recommended the use of a Transit Oriented Development Overlay District that
provides for higher building heights for the R3, R4, MXD, and MXD3 districts. Through the adoption of
higher densities near transit, the City encourages the use of transit which reduces reliance on private
automobiles and associated carbon emissions.
In addition, the City’s Transit Area Specific Plan (TASP) promotes walking and biking for short internal
trips. For example, the TASP requires new development to install sidewalks, and the City intends to
provide pedestrian bridges over major streets, such as Great Mall Parkway, Capitol Avenue, and
Montague Expressway.
The City continues to enforce California Energy Commission’s Title 24 standards for energy efficiency.
Finally, in 2008, the City adopted Resolution No. 7735 for Green Building Policies. A summary of the key
provisions of this Resolution which covers both residential and non-residential building is as follows:
     •    The U.S. Green Building Council’s LEED rating system for non-residential buildings and Built It
          Green’s GreenPoint Rated system for residential buildings have been adopted as the official
          green building standards for the City of Milpitas.
     •    Planning applications for new buildings submitted after March 1, 2008 must include a completed
          LEED or GreenPoint Rated checklist for informational purposes.
     •    New city buildings and renovation projects over 5,000 square feet initiated after March 1, 2008
          are now required to be evaluated for feasibility to achieve at least a LEED Silver certification.
     •    Finally, the City will be adopting a Green Building Ordinance by the end of 2009.
In addition, the City provides outreach on an ongoing basis to residents about the Pacific Gas and Electric
Energy Partners Program. This program provides low-income customers with free weatherization
services and energy-efficient appliances to reduce gas and electricity uses. This is the principal way in
which the City currently promotes energy conservation opportunities unrelated to new development or
renovations.

The City of Milpitas is home to six affordable housing developments (including an
acquisition/rehabilitation of a four-plex), and ten mixed-income developments, including four that are
under construction. Additional mixed-income developments have been approved. (See Chapter IV.)
Table III.35 presents the inventory of affordable housing units in the City of Milpitas. There are 1,085
affordable housing units in Milpitas. One of these units is a group home serving five extremely low-
income seniors; there are 730 units available to very low-income households, 172 units available to low-
income households, and finally, there are 182 units earmarked for moderate-income households. This
table also indicates the earliest dates of termination of affordability restrictions for each of the listed
projects. Of the 16 affordable and mixed-income projects listed in Table III.35, six have affordability
restrictions which are not subject to expiration, and nine have restrictions which will expire beyond the
planning horizon of this Housing Element. However, affordability restrictions for 149 affordable units at
Sunnyhills Apartments are due to expire in 2011.
                                                                                                            7-53

2) At-Risk Projects
State law requires that housing elements include an inventory of all publicly assisted multifamily rental
housing projects within the local jurisdiction that are at risk of conversion to uses other than low-income
residential during the current planning period and the subsequent five years (2009 through 2019). For
those units found to be at risk of conversion, the Housing Element must estimate the cost to preserve or
replace the at-risk units, to identify the resources available to help in the preservation or replacement of
those units, and to identify those organizations that could assist in these efforts. Since Sunnyhills
Apartments is the only development at risk of market rate conversion, this subsection of the Housing
Element provides information on preservation and replacement costs for the Sunnyhills at-risk units.
Originally financed under the Section 236 and Section 8 programs in 1981, the project owner attempted
to prepay their mortgage in 1990 under Sections 220 and 221 of the Low Income Housing Preservation
and Resident Homeownership Act of 1990 (LIHPRHA). Originally a total of 104 units were supported
through HUD project-based Section 8 vouchers. Through the efforts of the City and HUD, project
sponsors entered into a revised Plan of Action in December 1991 in which project affordability restrictions
were retained in exchange for a modest increase in rental payments, and funding of an additional 45
project-based Section 8 units, for a total of 149 affordable units. Under this revised 20-year agreement
between HUD and the JMK Sunnyhills Investors II, affordability restrictions are in place until October 1,
2011. Currently, the subsidy provided averages $950 per unit monthly. According to the owner, HUD
has not yet discussed the continuation of the project-based Section 8 subsidies.
The total subsidy amount annually is $1,698,600 for the project or $11,400 per unit annually. According
to the current owner, rents for the affordable units are low compared to market rate rents. The owner
anticipates that, if HUD elects to renew the contract, the subsidy per unit will be increased substantially.
One possibility is that the owner could decide to continue receiving Section 8 subsidies on a year-to-year
basis.
Preserve Affordability
While it is difficult to estimate the exact cost to preserve the 149 affordable units, this analysis uses an
annual subsidy amount of $1.7 million (a rounded amount of the current annual subsidy in 2008 dollars)
as the basis for the estimate of preservation costs. This assumes that the property owner is willing to
enter into a rental subsidy agreement with HUD, the Housing Authority of Santa Clara County, the City of
Milpitas, or some other entity. Based, on this assumption, the cost to preserve these units for a 30-year
period (assuming an inflation rate of three percent) would be approximately $80.9 million in 2008 dollars.
(See Table III.36.)

Acquisition/Rehabilitation of Sunnyhills Apartments to Preserve Affordability
An acquisition strategy first requires that the current property owner is interested in selling the property to
another entity, such as a nonprofit housing developer. Secondly, this nonprofit organization would need
to obtain funds to purchase the property. The advantage of an acquisition/rehabilitation strategy is that
the nonprofit developer does not need to go through the entire development process including locating a
suitable site and obtaining necessary entitlements. However, funding requirements are similar and costs
are generally comparable to new construction.30
Replace Affordable Units
As an alternative to providing ongoing monthly rent subsidies or attempting to acquire Sunnyhills
Apartments, the City or another entity could develop replacement housing units that could be rented to
the displaced households at lower-income rent levels. Based on the development costs of an affordable
family project under construction in Milpitas in 2008, per unit construction cost is approximately $388,000
per unit or approximately $58 million for 149 units. Since rents affordable to lower-income households
cannot support this mortgage, it would be necessary for the affordable housing developer to obtain
subsidies for permanent financing. Assuming that all rental income is applied to operating expenses,
then, the entire development costs would need to be financed. A loan in the amount of $126.4 million
would be needed to replace the 149 units, assuming a six percent, 30 year, amortizing loan. (See Table
III.36.)
The City must consider what resources are available to help replace these units so that lower-income
tenants would not be displaced in the event that Sunnyhills Apartments is redeveloped as a market rate
development. The City could provide some financing from the City Redevelopment Agency and its CDBG
Entitlement Funds. In addition, nonprofit developers in Milpitas have access to a range of funding options
that could also be used to pay for the replacement of the Sunnyhills apartments. These sources include
the following:
     •    Mortgage Revenue Bonds
     •    State Grant Programs, such as MHP
     •    HOME Program

   Since costs are comparable to new construction, acquisition/rehabilitation cost estimates are not provided here.

     •    Federal Grant Programs
     •    Low Income Housing Tax Credits
     •    Housing Trust Fund of Santa Clara County
If the owners of Sunnyhills Apartments decide to convert the project to a market rate use in late 2011, the
City will need to develop a strategy to replace the 149 affordable units. In most situations this entails
collaboration with an affordable housing developer. The City is experienced in collaborating with
affordable housing developers. The DeVries Place Senior Housing development and Montevista
Apartments are two examples of the private/public partnership that would be needed to replace the at-risk
units at Sunnyhills Apartments.

7.5 SITES INVENTORY
A. Projected Housing Needs
As shown in Table IV.1, the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG), in its final Regional Housing
Needs Determination figures, allocated Milpitas 2,487 housing units for the period from 2007 to 2014. The
allocation is equivalent to a yearly need of approximately 355 housing units for the seven-year time
period. The principal difference in the regional housing needs allocation (RHNA) numbers between the
last housing element period and the current period is in the reduction of the number of units required for
moderate-income and above-moderate income households.

Milpitas's RHNA allocation represents about four percent of the total Santa Clara County RHNA figure of
60,338 housing units.31
B. Sites Inventory
The State Government Code requires that the Housing Element include an “inventory of land suitable for
residential development, including vacant sites and sites having the potential for redevelopment” (Section
65583(a) (3)).32 The purpose of an inventory of sites is to demonstrate that the City of Milpitas has a
sufficient amount of land to accommodate its fair share of the region’s housing needs during the planning
period (2007-2014). It further requires that the Element analyze zoning and infrastructure on these sites,
to ensure that residential development is feasible during the planning period.
Since the last Housing Element update, additional information is now required to be included in the
inventory. (See Government Code Section 65583.2) This information includes parcel number (or other
unique identifier), parcel size, and current use (if not vacant). Also, the inventory must demonstrate that
there are available sites that can accommodate a variety of housing types, including multifamily rental
housing, manufactured housing, farmworker housing, emergency shelters and transitional housing.
A beginning point in the inventory of available sites is to identify current residential projects that are under
construction, approved, or planned. Since the beginning of the current housing element update period
(January 2007), five projects have been completed or started construction (Town Center Villas, Paragon,

   This share is slightly above Milpitas’s share of total housing units in Santa Clara County estimated by the
Department of Finance for 2008 at three percent. It is likely that this difference reflects the transit advantages and
employment potential of Milpitas.

   Sites refer to locations for potential housing development. In some instances, these sites are comprised of several
parcels (identified by APN’s).

Ranch) for a total of 681 units, including 199 affordable units. Also, the City has now approved 1,923
additional units, including 156 affordable units. An additional 3,670 units are in the planning stages,
including 299 affordable units, primarily for moderate-income households. More information on these
projects is presented below. (See Table IV.5 for a complete list of these new developments.)
Table IV.2 summarizes this development activity and compares it to the RHNA numbers assigned to the
City of Milpitas for the period 2007-2014. Although the City could surpass its housing needs goals by
almost 3,800 units (assuming all approved and planned units are built), the number of affordable units
planned and approved (654) falls short of the RHNA numbers. Furthermore, the majority of these below
market rate units are priced for the moderate-income income group. The number of units to
accommodate very low- and low-income households that remain to be accommodated on other Milpitas
sites is 897 units.

Thus, one of the remaining goals for the City is to identify additional sites that can be used to develop
affordable housing, as well as special needs housing.
Demonstrating an adequate land supply, however, is only part of the task. The City must also show that
this supply is capable of supporting housing demand from all economic segments of the community. High
land costs in the region make it difficult to meet the demand for affordable housing on sites that are
designated for low densities. This is not a problem for the City of Milpitas, however, since it has zoned
substantial areas of the City for high density residential and mixed use land uses.
The majority of the City’s residential development potential is located in the areas covered by the Midtown
and Transit Area Specific Plans. All of the Midtown Specific Plan Area is located in a redevelopment
project area and all but 46 acres of the Transit Area Specific Plan Area is located in a redevelopment
project area.33 Only two sites on the inventory list presented below (Table IV.4) are located outside these
areas. The specific plan areas are in the midst of a transition from older industrial and heavy commercial

   The portion of the Transit Area that is not included in a redevelopment project area is the Piper Drive/Montague
Expressway Area. There are three pending projects located in this area – Piper Towers, Citation, and Milpitas
Station.

uses to a mixed use community developed at urban densities. Over 2,000 units have been built or
permitted in the City since 1999, and the majority of these are located in one of the specific plan areas.
Additional units are now in the pipeline and are included as part of the 2007-2014 site inventory as new
projects.
The inventory of potential sites that are not included on the current projects list was developed from two
sources.
     •   First, the City reviewed the list of available sites that were presented in the 2002 Housing
         Element. This original list presented information on 28 sites, many of which were comprised of
         more than one assessor’s parcel number (APN). From this original list, fewer than half of the
         original 28 sites are still potential development locations. These are included on the 2007-2014
         site inventory.
     •   Second, the Transit Area Specific Plan identified six development opportunity areas that could be
         redeveloped within the five years following plan adoption. This five-year period falls into the
         housing element update period of 2007-2014. Additional sites located in these areas are
         included in the site inventory. 34
When developing the inventory of potential sites, the opportunity sites were presumed to be developed at
the midpoint of the allowable density range. This is a conservative assumption, as many initial
development proposals for sites in the specific plan areas have been closer to the high end of the density
range, or even above the top of the range. In addition, for those sites that are designated as mixed-use
sites (MXD), the acreage on the site has been reduced by nine percent to account for the potential
development of non-residential uses. This adjustment is based on recent mixed-use developments in the
Midtown and Transit Specific Plan Areas that have been redeveloped with residential and commercial
uses. While it is possible for sites zoned as mixed-use to be completely developed for non-residential
uses, the historical trend within the City is for parcels in these areas to be developed primarily for
residential uses.
Table IV.3 summarizes these potential sites, Figure IV-1 shows their locations, and Table IV.4 provides
detailed information. Based on midpoint densities and current zoning, there is a potential for an additional
2,385 housing units that could be built on the 14 housing sites. With the exception of Site #1, all sites are
zoned for multifamily development and are suitable for affordable housing developments.
34
   A market study prepared for the City in 2008 identified additional parcels that could be considered for residential
development. These parcels are not zoned for residential use. These sites are not included on the site inventory list,
since there are already a sufficient number of sites located in Milpitas that are zoned for residential use.

There are three vacant sites included in this inventory. These are Sites 1, 4, and 12, ranging in size from
approximately one-half acre to almost five acres. In addition, some of the parcels that are aggregated to
create a site include vacant parcels. Table IV.4 identifies these as well. The sites vary in size. Those
located in the Transit Area Specific Plan Area are larger than those in the Midtown Specific Plan Area.
With the exception of Site #1 on North Park Victoria, the lowest density of the sites listed is R3, which
allows densities up to 20 units per acre. The highest density (up to 75 units per acre) is allowed in the
TOD overlay portions of the R5 and MXD3 zones. Eight parcels located at five sites are zoned as MXD3.
Minimum density requirements will ensure that the land is efficiently used, while development agreements
and incentive programs will ensure that a significant portion of future housing will be affordable.
At present, there are 6,270 units that are under construction, approved, or under discussion. These units
are located on additional sites, not included on Table IV.4. Table IV.5 provides a list of these current
projects, and Figure IV.2 shows their locations. Eight of these developments will provide affordable units
for a total of 654 units.
The City uses its development approval process to draft an affordable housing agreement for each
residential development. These agreements are designed to meet either the City’s affordable housing
requirements (Section XI-10-6.03 of the City’s Zoning Ordinance) or California Redevelopment Law
affordable housing requirements. Since many of the new residential developments are located in one of
the City’s redevelopment project areas, the affordability requirements of Redevelopment Law are
frequently those that are applied. Under Redevelopment Law, 15 percent of privately developed housing
must be affordable to very low-, low- and moderate-income households. However, this requirement does
not need to be met on a project-by-project basis, but within the redevelopment project area as a whole.
Thus, the City has some leeway in negotiating the affordable housing requirement with housing
developers. To illustrate, a portion of Terra Serena’s affordable housing requirement was fulfilled by the
donation of a site that was used by DeVries Place Senior Housing, a senior affordable development.
When affordable housing is provided on-site, the rents and sales prices are restricted and determined by
the City consistent with California Redevelopment Law. In the case of affordable, for-sale housing, the
City’s website provides income guidelines, sales price information, and applications. Affordable rental
housing is managed by individual property management companies.
The current and proposed projects that will provide affordable units are as follows:
     •   Town Center Villas is a 65-unit, mixed-income single family development and is almost
         completed. Sixteen of these units will be affordable to moderate-income buyers. The City of
         Milpitas has provided funds for down payment assistance to moderate-income, first-time
         homebuyers who will purchase homes in the Town Center project. Sales prices on the moderate-
         income units will be restricted until 2054.
     •   Another ownership project is Paragon, which is a 147-unit, mixed-income development under
         construction. Paragon is a condominium project that will provide 29 units affordable to very low-
         and moderate-income buyers. The City of Milpitas has provided funds for down payment
         assistance to very low- and moderate-income, first-time homebuyers who will purchase at
         Paragon. Sales prices will be restricted until 2044.
                                                                                                         7-69

                                                                                       HOUSING ELEMENT
   •   The final phase of KB Homes Terra Serena development will provide 94 units, of which 63 will be
       affordable to moderate-income buyers. Sales prices will be restricted until 2062. The City has
       provided loans and grants to this project.
   •   The Fairfield Murphy Ranch Project consists of rental and ownership units. Of the 374 rental
       units to be developed at this site, 20 will be affordable to very low-income households, 30 will be
       affordable to low-income households, and 38 will be affordable to moderate-income households.
       The ownership portion of the Fairfield Murphy Ranch development consists of an additional 285
       units. Forty-four units will be affordable (37 will be for moderate-income households, and seven
       for very low-income households). Although this project has not received financial assistance from
       the City, it will restrict sales prices and rents.
   •   The Matteson Condos, a 126-unit project, will provide 19 affordable units, of which four will be for
       low-income households, and the remaining units will be for moderate-income households. No
       funds have been provided to this project, but sales prices will be restricted.
   •   Apton Plaza will be completely affordable. It will provide 37 units for very low-income households
       and 56 units for low-income households to be sold at restricted sales prices. The City has
       committed a loan to this development.
   •   South Main Street Senior Lifestyles will provide 63 affordable assisted living units for seniors, of
       which 36 will be affordable to very low-income households, and 27 will be affordable to low-
       income households.
   •   Finally, there is the mixed-use Integral development that will include 1,573 housing units, of which
       236 will be affordable to moderate-income households. The City will consider financial
       assistance to this development, but the level of this assistance has not yet been determined.
These affordable units are included in Table IV.2.

C. Additional Considerations
1) Site Considerations for Above Moderate-Income Households
A review of the land use database provided by the County of Santa Clara Assessor’s Office and the City
of Milpitas indicates that there are 29 vacant residentially-designated sites where new housing could be
possible. These sites are in scattered locations but are mostly in the northeastern part of the City,
consisting of either empty lots within existing subdivisions (e.g., Calaveras Ridge Estates, Calera Creek
Heights, Vista Ridge), or as larger undeveloped parcels that extend up from the base of the hills along
Piedmont Road and Evans Road, or along the sloped portion of County Club Road. Most sites are
located within the City’s Urban Growth Boundary and would be subject to the restrictions of voter-
approved Hillside Residential Overlay District in the City’s Zoning Ordinance that specifies a density of
one unit per 10 acres. At current General Plan and zoning densities, these sites could yield approximately
119 units. Most of these would be appropriate sites for luxury single family homes.
One of the larger and more interesting sites that emerged from the site inventory discussed above is a
4.85 acre vacant parcel on North Park Victoria Drive. This site is listed on Table IV.4. It is located along
the west side of North Park Victoria Drive and across from the intersection of Country Club Road, inside
the Urban Growth Boundary and is zoned for residential use. It appears to be undeveloped except for a
single family house located at the southeast corner of the property, a house that appears to have suffered
fire damage and is currently unoccupied. The location and size of this parcel suggest that it might make a
good candidate for luxury housing. This site could yield approximately 33 units under current zoning (R1-
6 at seven units to the acre).
2) Adequacy of Infrastructure and Services
Although Milpitas is a built-out city, the conversion of older industrial and commercial sites in the Specific
Plan Areas to residential and mixed land uses requires that additional infrastructure investment be
undertaken. Transportation access to these areas is excellent, since these areas are in close proximity to
two major freeways, two light rail stations and a future BART Station. However, since Milpitas is located
at a crossroads of Silicon Valley, there is a great deal of regional traffic. The City has adopted a
transportation impact fee that will help pay for needed road improvements within the City. Until sufficient
funds are collected from this fee, affected roads will be operating below an acceptable level of service.
Finally, traffic congestion along the major freeways is a regional problem that requires regional solutions.
The Transit Area Specific Plan EIR recommended a Traffic Fee to contribute to address this issue.
Aside from transportation issues, remaining infrastructure, such as water, sewers, and storm drains are
adequate to support the planned growth in Milpitas.
A final consideration is the fire and emergency medical assistance services provided throughout Milpitas by
the Milpitas Fire Department (MFD). The TASP EIR recommended that a “standards-of-coverage” analysis
be conducted “to determine the precise impact on the department’s staffing, equipment and any required
facility enhancements. In addition, the MFD will need to write an addendum to the City’s emergency man-
agement plan to address future development of the project area. Thus, future development of sites in the
TASP area will need to address these issues related to fire and emergency medical assistance services.
                                                                                                          7-74

assistance coverage be extended to all Housing Element sites, including those outside as well as inside
the TASP area, at the time specific projects come up for review.
3) Environmental Constraints
Chapter V addresses more generally the extent to which environmental considerations could be a
constraint on new development in the City of Milpitas. These include potential earthquakes, flooding, and
hillside erosion. In addition, since many of the potential sites are located in a transitional area changing
from older industrial and heavy commercial uses to a mixed use community, it is possible that there are
hazardous materials on some of the potential sites.
     •    Milpitas is subject to the same hazards from seismic activity as are other cities in the San
          Francisco Bay Area. However, since the sites presented above are not located on landfill, new
          development on these sites is not exposed to any greater risk from a potential earthquake.
     •    Some of the housing sites in the Transit Area are located within the 100-year floodplain.
          Although flood depths would be very shallow, a combination of on-site and off-site improvements
          may still be required before building in areas that could experience potential flooding.
     •    Although development on the hillsides is theoretically possible, the area has serious seismic and
          landslide constraints. However since none of the sites included in the site inventory are located
          in the hillside area, this potential hazard is not a problem.
     •    None of the sites listed in the 2002 Housing Element that are still considered potential sites for
          2007-2014 are contaminated. The five sites that are Transit Area Specific Plan Opportunity sites
          and which were not included in the 2002 Housing Element are Sites 10, 11, 12, 15, and 17.
          Given prior land uses, it may be necessary to undertake a Phase I Environmental Site
          Assessment for these sites prior to residential development.
A final environmental issue relates to vibration levels that may affect future development inside and
outside the TASP area related to the UPRR and BART right-of-way. To make sure that vibration levels do
not exceed acceptable levels, the TASP includes mitigation measures to address potential issues related
to vibration. Future development in this area will be subject to potential siting and/or construction features
sufficient to reduce the impacts of ground vibration. This Housing Element provides that Housing
Element sites outside the TASP but within 300 feet of an active UPRR and/or BART alignment be subject
to an analysis of vibration impacts and be required to provide for vibration reduction consistent with the
direction of TASP policies.
D. Zoning for a Variety of Housing Types
In addition to the requirement of identifying potential sites for affordable housing, the City must identify
districts within the City in which special needs housing can be constructed. The purpose of special
housing is two-fold. First, it must be affordable, and second, the type of housing required should not be
                                                                                                           7-75

                                                                                              HOUSING ELEMENT
subject to any special conditions, aside from conforming to site and design standards. Each type of
special needs housing is presented below along with recommendations regarding the appropriate zoning
districts in which the type of housing can be located. In all cases, the City will need to modify its Zoning
Ordinance to allow the special needs use “by right” rather than as a conditional use.
1) Farmworker Housing
Health and Safety Code Sections 17021.5 and 17021.6 specify that the Housing Element must
demonstrate that the local government’s zoning, development standards and processing requirements
encourage and facilitate all types of housing for farmworkers. Appropriate zoning would allow multifamily
units as well as dormitory-style housing. While there are two exclusions to this requirement, the City does
not meet either of these; thus, it will be necessary to modify the City’s Zoning Ordinance for the 9 AR
Agricultural Residence District to allow farmworker housing as a use “by right.”36
2) Manufactured Housing
Similar to farmworker housing, the City needs to identify those residential districts in which manufactured
housing is allowed.37 Currently, there is no reference to manufactured housing in the Zoning Ordinance,
only to mobile homes. With the exception of design requirements, a city can only subject the
manufactured home and the lot on which it is placed to the same development standards which are
required for a conventional single-family residential dwelling. Thus, the City will need to modify its Zoning
Ordinance to permit manufactured housing in single family districts.
3) SRO Housing
Single room occupancy units (SRO’s) are assumed to meet the needs of extremely low-income
households. If a jurisdiction can show it is meeting the needs of extremely low-income households
(below 30 percent AMI), then it is not required to consider SRO’s in its Zoning Ordinance. However,
according to the housing needs identified in Chapter III for Milpitas, there are over 755 extremely low-
income renter households in Milpitas, the vast majority of which were overpaying for housing in 1999. So
this income group does have need for additional affordable housing. Furthermore, this group has not
been helped by recent affordable housing construction which benefits the upper bound of the low-income
group, i.e., 50 percent AMI instead of 30 percent AMI.
Therefore, to meet these needs, the City will either need to amend its Zoning Ordinance to permit SRO
housing in selected districts, or it will need to adopt an SRO Ordinance.
36
   The two exclusions are as follows: If the City could demonstrate there are no agriculture workers working in
Milpitas, this zoning change would not be needed. However, ABAG currently identifies 180 agricultural workers in
Milpitas’ sphere of influence. (Employment information is presented in Chapter III of this Housing Element.) The
second exclusion would be if the City’s Zoning Ordinance did not indicate any agricultural zoning districts, then it
could be waived out of this requirement. However, there are two zoning districts that specify agricultural uses in
Milpitas.
37
   The applicable state law is Government Code Section 65852.3.
                                                                                                                 7-76

                                                                                       HOUSING ELEMENT
4) Homeless Shelters
Chapter III discussed the need for housing services for homeless individuals and families in the City. To
meet this need, the City has identified the highway services (HS) Zoning District as the district for
homeless shelters as a land use “by right.” According to the City’s Land Use Plan, there are 271 acres of
land designated as HS, of which 44 acres are undeveloped. Parcel sizes range from less than one-half
acre to 23 acres. The median parcel size is 1.3 acres, and the average parcel size is about three acres.
Fifteen parcels are below one acre in size. Thus, the HS zone has parcels that would be of an
appropriate size for a homeless shelter.
Land zoned as HS is located in several parts of the City (near major thoroughfares) and serves as a
gateway to the City. Several new hotels and a mixed use development are located in this zone and
include the Hampton Inn, Extended Stay, and Milpitas Square. The following locations include HS zoned
parcels:
     •    West of I-880 and south of Calaveras Boulevard
     •    North of Montague Expressway, West of I-880, and East of McCarthy Boulevard
     •    East of I-680 near Jacklin Road
     •    Along North Milpitas Boulevard near Minnis Circle
The City will need to revise its Zoning Ordinance for the HS zone to allow homeless shelters as uses “by
right.”
5) Transitional and Permanent Supportive Housing
Finally, as authorized under SB2, sites for supportive transitional and permanent housing need to be
identified. Appropriate sites for supportive transition housing would also be located near services and
facilities and be subject to the same permitting processes as other housing in the zone without undue
special regulatory requirements. It will be necessary to amend the current Zoning Ordinance to state that
supportive transitional housing be allowed as a resident use and only subject to those restrictions that
apply to other residential uses of the same type in the same zone.
E. Housing Resources
The City of Milpitas has access to a variety of funding sources for affordable housing activities. These
include federal, state, and local resources. These resources in combination with high density zoning in
the Specific Plan Areas, has enabled (and will continue to enable) the City to provide affordable housing
opportunities to its residents.
1) Federal Programs
CDBG Program
Through the CDBG program, the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provides
funds to local governments for funding a wide range of housing and community development activities for
                                                                                                        7-77

                                                                                        HOUSING ELEMENT
low-income persons. The City of Milpitas is a CDBG Entitlement City and receives annual allocations
directly from HUD.
Based on previous allocations, Milpitas expects to receive an annual allocation of $579,009 and an
additional $100,000 in Program Income from the Single Family Housing Rehabilitation Program for a total
of $679,009. In accordance with established policies, Milpitas is committed to increasing and maintaining
affordable housing in the City. CDBG funds are used for site acquisition, rehabilitation, first-time
homebuyer assistance, development of emergency and transitional shelters and fair housing/housing
counseling activities. Additional activities in support of the new construction of affordable housing include
site clearance and the financing of related infrastructure and public facility improvements.
HOME Program
While Milpitas does not received HOME funds directly from HUD, Milpitas can compete for funds that are
allocated by the State of California. Milpitas can work with affordable housing developers to support
applications for these funds that can be used for all aspects of affordable housing development.
Section 8 Assistance
The Section 8 program is a federal program that provides rental assistance to very-low income persons in
need of affordable housing. This program offers a voucher that pays the difference between the current
fair market rent and what a tenant can afford to pay (e.g. 30 percent of household income). The voucher
allows a tenant to select housing that may cost above the payment standard. However, in that situation,
the tenant must pay the extra cost. At present, 618 Milpitas households receive Section 8 Vouchers. In
addition, affordable housing developments can request project-based Section 8 assistance.
2) State Programs
California Housing Finance Agency (CHFA)
The California Housing Finance Agency operates several programs that help reduce the cost of housing.
These programs, funded by the sale of tax-exempt bonds, provide permanent financing of affordable
housing developments, as well as financing for homebuyers.
Housing Funds Authorized by State Propositions
Since 2002, California voters have voted for two major housing funding programs. The first is referred to
as Proposition 46. The funds from this program are now expended. The second Proposition, referred to
as Housing and Emergency Shelter Trust Fund Act of 2006, or Proposition 1C, authorized $2.85 billion to
be spent on affordable housing and other related activities. Funds from this Proposition still remain.
Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program
Created by the 1986 Tax Reform Act, the Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program (LIHTC) is used
extensively by developers of affordable housing. Although enabling legislation was passed at the federal
level, allocations of the tax credits are made by the State of California.
                                                                                                          7-78
                                                                                         HOUSING ELEMENT
Affordable housing developers utilize this program in combination with City and additional funding
sources to encourage the construction and rehabilitation of rental housing for lower-income households.
The program allows investors an annual tax credit over a ten-year period, provided that the housing
meets affordable income requirements. The tax credit is typically sold to large investors at a syndication
value.
Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC) Program
The Mortgage Credit Certificate Program (MCC), authorized by Congress in 1984, provides financial
assistance to first-time homebuyers. Similar to the LIHTC Program, the MCC Program was authorized by
the federal government, but is administered by the State. The MCC tax credit reduces the federal income
taxes of qualified borrowers purchasing qualified homes; thus having the effect of a mortgage subsidy.
The current tax credit rate is 15 percent. The MCC reduces the amount of federal income taxes
otherwise due to the federal government; however, the mortgage tax credit cannot be claimed as a
refund. While the MCC is not a direct subsidy, it enables program participants to reduce their federal
income tax withholdings, so that the MCC indirectly provides a monthly benefit.
Santa Clara County administers the MCC Program on behalf of all participating cities located in the
county. There are purchase price and income limits. For example, for a resale of an existing home, the
sales price limit in 2008 was $570,000, and for a new home, the sales price limit was $630,000. Income
limits for 2009 are $97,800 for a one- or two-person household and for a household with three or more
persons, the limit is $112,470. This is between median- and moderate-incomes in Santa Clara County.
3) Local Programs
Redevelopment Housing Set-aside Funds
In accordance with State law, the Milpitas Redevelopment Agency sets aside 20 percent of all tax
increment revenues generated from its redevelopment project areas to fund housing projects that
increase, improve or preserve the supply of affordable housing. Housing developed with these set-aside
funds must remain affordable to low- and moderate-income households for at least 55 years for rentals
and 45 years for ownership housing. Table IV.6 presents information on the assistance provided to
mixed-income and affordable developments since 1999. Between 1999 and 2006, the City provided
$23.6 million in grants and loans to projects that have built (or will build) 1,758 housing units, of which 717
will be affordable. Since January 2007, the City has authorized an additional expenditure of $20.6 million
for developments that will add an additional 580 units, of which 265 will be affordable. These funds came
from the Redevelopment Housing Set-aside Fund. These funds provide direct assistance to developers,
e.g., developer impact fee assistance, as well as second mortgages to homebuyers. The majority of the
funds are loans, so, at some point, these funds will recycle back to the City for future affordable housing
developments.
During the upcoming Housing Element period, the City expects to receive $36 million in annual tax
increment revenue, of which 20 percent ($7.2 million) will accrue annually to the housing set-aside fund.
The City will continue to expend these funds as follows:
     •    Twenty percent ($1.44 million) for down payment assistance.
                                                                                                           7-79

                                                                                        HOUSING ELEMENT
    •   Thirty percent (2.16 million) for financial assistance to developers of affordable rental and
        ownership housing.
    •   Twenty percent ($1.44 million) for rehabilitation of multifamily and single family housing.
    •   Thirty percent ($2.16 million) for land acquisition to benefit affordable housing.
Several of the programs listed under the Five-Year Implementation Plan will be wholly or partially funded
through the use of these Redevelopment Housing Setaside Funds.
Housing Trust Fund of Santa Clara County
The Housing Trust Fund of Santa Clara County provides assistance to first-time homebuyers, the
homeless (through the creation of shelters and other special housing programs), and provides loans for
new affordable housing development. The City of Milpitas contributes to this Trust Fund and in 2009
allocated $925,000. First-time homebuyers in Milpitas are eligible to receive benefits from the Trust Fund.
These benefits include down payment assistance (up to $15,000 as a deferred loan) and mortgage
assistance (below market interest rates and loans with a 40 year amortization). For both programs, there
are household income limits. In the down payment assistance program, the income range is between 60
percent and 100 percent AMI, and for the mortgage assistance program, the income limit is higher at 120
percent AMI.
                                                                                                       7-80

7.6 HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
A. Introduction
Housing Constraints are defined as government measures and non-government conditions that limit the
amount or timing of residential development. Government regulations can potentially constrain the supply
of housing available in a community if the regulations limit the opportunities to develop housing, impose
requirements that unnecessarily increase the cost to develop housing, or make the development process
so arduous as to discourage housing developers. State law requires housing elements to contain an
analysis of the governmental constraints on housing maintenance, improvement, and development
(Government Code, Section 65583(a) (4)).
Non-governmental constraints (required to be analyzed under Government Code, Section 65583(a) (5))
cover land prices, construction costs, and financing. While local governments cannot control prices or
costs, identification of these constraints can be helpful to Milpitas in formulating housing programs.
Additional non-governmental factors that may constrain the production of affordable housing in Milpitas
include infrastructure availability and environmental features.
B. Potential Government Constraints
Government regulations affect housing costs by limiting the supply of buildable land, setting standards
and allowable densities for development, and exacting fees for the construction of homes. Potential
regulatory constraints include local land use policies (as defined in the Milpitas General Plan), zoning
regulations and their accompanying development standards, subdivision regulations, urban limit lines,
and development fees. Lengthy approval and processing times also may be regulatory constraints.
1) General Plan
The last comprehensive update to the Milpitas General Plan occurred in 1994. During the last Housing
Element update, the General Plan was amended to incorporate the land use designations, other policies,
and design guidelines defined by the Midtown Specific Area Plan. Since the 2002 Housing Element, the
General Plan has been updated to incorporate the land use designations, other policies, and design
guidelines defined by the Transit Area Specific Plan.
With the recent amendments incorporating the Midtown and Transit Area Specific Plans, the General
Plan identifies five categories of residential uses, distinguished from one another by unit type and density.
These include R1 (with seven different subcategories depending on minimum lot size and three additional
hillside categories), R2, R3, R4, and R5. In addition, there are three mixed use categories (MXD, MXD2
and MXD3) that allow residential development.
Finally, there are three overlay districts that affect residential development, including the “S” Site and
Architectural Overlay District (S District), the “MHP” Mobile Home Park Overlay District (MHP District),
and the “TOD” Transit Oriented Development District (TOD District). 38 If there is inconsistency between
38
   The Site and Architectural (S) Overlay District is not discussed in detail here. The S District does not impact the
zoning parameters discussed in this section. Instead, the purpose of the S District is to encourage attractive
                                                                                                               7-84

                                                                                             HOUSING ELEMENT
regular zoning districts and requirements under an Overlay District, the Overlay District’s rules apply. The
sites that benefit from the TOD Overlay District are located in the Transit Specific Plan Area. While the
MHP Overlay District currently applies to a small area in the northwest portion of Milpitas zoned for
Highway Services (where mobile home parks are currently located), the Mobile Home Park Overlay
district could be combined with the R1-6, R2, R3-20 and HS districts.
In addition to these zoning categories and overlay districts, the City’s two Specific Plans [Transit Area
(Chapter 5) and Midtown Area (Chapter 8)] provide information on additional development requirements.
The Zoning Ordinance does not repeat all the information provided in the specific plan documents.
Again, as with the Overlay Districts, if there is an inconsistency between the Zoning Ordinance and the
Specific Plan, the Specific Plan regulations prevail. If a standard is not listed in the Specific Plans, then
the Zoning Ordinance prevails.
2) Zoning Ordinance
Densities and Permitted Land Uses
Table V-1 provides a summary of the zoning regulations for the five residential and three mixed-use
categories that allow residential development. Except in the Hillside Overlay District, the R1 zoning
designation spans a range of housing densities (from 4 to 17 dwelling units per gross acre) with minimum
lot sizes ranging from 2,500 SF to 10,000 SF. In the Hillside Overlay District, housing densities range
from three units per acre to 10 acres per unit, and consequently, minimum lot sizes are much greater and
range from 14,520 SF up to 10 acres. Second units are permitted without a conditional use permit in all
the R1 zones. The R2 district permits single family and duplex units, and the remaining residential zoning
districts R3, R4, R5, and mixed use) permit multifamily housing.
Parking Requirements
Table V.1 also provides information on parking requirements specified in the Zoning Ordinance. For the
R1 and R2 residential districts, two spaces per unit are required, if there are three or fewer bedrooms. If
there are four or more bedrooms, three spaces per unit are required, plus one additional space for each
additional bedroom. Parking requirements for R3, R4, R5, and the MXD categories are the same. These
requirements are as follows:
          •   For studios, one covered space is required for each unit.
          •   For one-bedroom units, 1.5 covered spaces are required.
          •   For two- and three-bedroom units, two covered spaces are required per unit.
          •   For four-bedroom units, three spaces are required, of which at least two must be covered.
          •   For five-bedroom units, four spaces are required, of which at least two must be covered.
          •   For guest parking requirements – projects with structured parking must provide 15 percent
              additional parking spaces over the required number of spaces. All of these spaces may be
development and avoid uses that could have negative impacts on the environment, adjacent land uses, traffic or lead
to other negative externalities. The S District accomplishes this through the development review process.
                                                                                                          7-85

                                                                       HOUSING ELEMENT
uncovered. For projects with private garages, 20 percent additional parking spaces are
required. All of these spaces may be uncovered.

Overlay Districts
Table V.2 presents zoning regulation information for the TOD and MHP Overlay Districts. Only some of
the zoning districts are affected by these Overlay Districts. Zoning Districts R3, R4, R5, and the three
mixed use districts benefit from the TOD designation. While not currently utilized, the MHP Overlay
District could be applied to R1-6, R2, and R3-20 Residential Districts. Table V.2 summarizes the
modifications that result from a location in an Overlay District.

The principal differences attributable to the TOD District are densities and parking requirements.
         •   Minimum and maximum densities are higher in the TOD Districts in all residential zoning
             categories. With a TOD designation, builders can construct up to 75 units per acre. The
             lowest allowable density in a TOD District is 21 units (R3).
         •   For all zoning districts, minimum parking requirements are reduced by 20 percent. Guest
             parking requirements remain the same.
The TOD District has two main purposes. The first is to support transit by increasing the number of
residential units near stations and bus stops. The second and related purpose is to decrease parking
requirements. This decrease is justified on the grounds that occupants of TOD units will use transit for
some portion of work or personal trips, therefore lessening demand for auto use.
However, the main purpose of the MHP Overlay District is to “promote the expansion and diversification
of the available housing opportunities within the City of Milpitas by the establishment of standards for the
creation of planned mobile home parks.” 39 The MHP Overlay District establishes a zoning designation
that both permits and regulates mobile home parks. These regulations include parking requirements,
minimum mobile home park size, and maximum densities.

                                                                                         HOUSING ELEMENT
Impacts of Residential Development Standards on the Cost and Supply of Housing
Recent development trends in Milpitas indicate that the zoning regulations adopted by the City since the
2002 Housing Element are encouraging higher density housing near transit and other transportation
corridors. In contrast, little housing is being developed in the hills, which are protected by an Urban
Growth Boundary and hillside development standards.
In comparison to existing densities in the City, the new housing is built at much higher densities and is
primarily multifamily. This was the intent of revised zoning and site development standards adopted since
the last Housing Element, particularly in the two specific plan areas (Midtown and the Transit Area). The
type of housing recently completed, under construction or planned can be described as high density,
middle-income housing.
A comparison between existing citywide residential densities and densities of new residential
developments presented in the 2008 Milpitas Market Study quantifies the impact of higher allowed
residential densities, ranging up to 75 units per acre in the TOD Overlay Districts. As of 2002, according
to Table 2.2 of the updated General Plan, the average citywide residential density figure was five units to
the acre. The new development under construction and approved in Milpitas as of 2008 had an average
density figure of 34 units per acre, or almost seven times higher than existing residential development in
the City at that time.
Higher densities can encourage new development, since one component of development costs (land) is
lower due to a reduction in the amount of land required per unit. In fact, according to the 2008 Milpitas
Market Study, a total of 995 housing units were added to the City’s housing stock between 2000 and
2007. In comparison, the total number of units planned or under construction at the end of 2007 was
3,492 units or over three times the total number of units completed between 2000 and 2007. It can be
concluded that the City’s standards have encouraged new market rate residential development.
Furthermore, since the City implements an affordable housing ordinance, almost 20 percent of these new
units are affordable.
3) Site Development Standards
Through its Zoning Ordinance, the City of Milpitas enforces minimum site development standards for new
residential developments. These standards include lot width, setbacks, lot coverage, and maximum
building height. This information is readily available to the public and is posted on the City’s website. The
City’s standards allow appropriate levels of development. Table V.3 summarizes height and setback
standards by zoning district.
Height Limits
The standard height limit in the R1 and R2 zones is 30 feet. Again, there are different requirements for
the Hillside Combining District. The maximum height in the three hillside districts is lower, at 17 feet.
(See Table V.3.) In the R3, R4, R5, and Mixed Use Zones, maximum heights are considerably higher
than in the R1 and R2 zones, ranging in height from 35 feet (R3) to 150 feet (MXD3).
                                                                                                     7-90

                                                                                       HOUSING ELEMENT
Setbacks
Unlike other specifications, the setback requirements for the residential uses are somewhat similar except
for the Hillside districts, R4, R5, and the Mixed Use zoning categories. For the most part, the front, side,
and rear setbacks in the Hillside Combining District are greater than those that apply to other R1 zones.
The setbacks in the R4, R5, and Mixed Use districts are slightly lower to permit efficient utilization of sites.
                                                                                                      7-91

TOD Heights and Setbacks
Table V.4 provides information only on additional site utilization that is possible under the TOD Overlay
District. Higher building heights for the R3, R4, MXD, and MXD3 are allowed under the Overlay.
Setbacks are similar to the standard requirements for each zoning designation, except for R3 and R4.
Under the TOD Overlay, front setbacks for R3 zones are slightly lower, and for R4 zones, front setbacks
are slightly higher.

4) Standards for Second Units
Second units are addressed in Section XI-10-13.08 of the Zoning Ordinance. Second units are allowed by
right in R1 areas as long as they meet the following minimum standards:
    •    The lot is residentially zoned and contains only one single, legal existing single family housing
         unit.
    •    A maximum of one second unit per lot is allowed.
    •    The unit must be owner-occupied at the time an application for a second unit is submitted.
    •    The second unit may not be sold to a different owner than the owner of the main residence.
         However, the second unit may be rented.
    •    Attached second units cannot exceed 30% of the existing living area, with a maximum of 475 SF.
         If the attached second unit is located in the Hillside Combining District, the maximum area
         increases to 1,200 SF, as long as this does not represent more than 30% of the existing floor
         area of the primary housing unit.
                                                                                                      7-93

                                                                                           HOUSING ELEMENT
     •     There are specified height and setback requirements, again, that vary between Hillside and non-
           Hillside areas. For example, there is a height limit of 15’ in the non-Hillside areas, and 17’ in the
           Hillside areas.
     •     One additional off-street parking space is required and may be tandem parking.
     •     Other standards include the definition of minimum size (150 SF), the maximum number of rooms
           (one bedroom and one kitchen), the requirement for a permanent foundation, and design and
           setback requirements (the second unit must fit in the existing unit’s footprint).
Based on these criteria, the City’s Zoning Ordinance does not present a constraint to second unit
production, particularly since homeowners can develop second units “by right” and separate, covered
parking is not required.
5) Urban Growth Boundary
Milpitas voters approved this Urban Growth Boundary (UGB) in 1998. The UGB establishes an urban
limit line. The boundary is intended to remain in place through 2018 and can only be amended through
a majority vote of the electorate. The UGB was primarily created as a hillside protection measure.
The Urban Growth Boundary has primarily impacted the above moderate-income housing market and has
had little or no impact on low- and moderate-income households. The high cost of hillside construction,
the prestige associated with a “view” or hillside home, and the general character of the area make it
difficult to build more affordable housing in these areas. Utility and road extensions would be costly.
Higher density housing in this area would require large-scale grading, cuts and fills, and would have
substantial adverse environmental impacts. Moreover, the potential for landslides and wildfire in the
hillside areas suggest that increasing population densities in these areas could be imprudent. However, a
limited amount of development potential still exists beyond the Growth Boundary, subject to a slope
density formula that dictates minimum lot sizes.
Aside from potential impacts on the luxury housing market, the City has mitigated impacts from the growth
boundary on the supply of housing by significantly increasing the residential development potential of land
within the existing urbanized area. The rezoning of several hundred acres of former commercial and
industrial sites within the Specific Plan Areas to very high residential densities and mixed use
development has more than compensated for the loss of development potential outside the Urban Growth
Boundary. Moreover, the viability of affordable housing in the Specific Plan Areas is far greater than it
would be on sites in the hillsides, given the higher densities permitted and the proximity to mass transit
and urban services. Finally, the UGB is in keeping with the general principles of “smart growth”
advocated by the Association of Bay Area Governments and planning agencies throughout the San
Francisco Bay Area.
6) Density Bonus Law
During the last Housing Element period, density bonuses had been granted through the use of a Density
Bonus Combining District which could be applied in all residential zones, but which required an additional
step in the development process. One of the program recommendations in the last Housing Element was
to amend the City’s Density Bonus so that it would eliminate the Combining District approach and be
consistent with State Law.
                                                                                                        7-94

                                                                                           HOUSING ELEMENT
Consequently, the City adopted a Density Bonus Ordinance (Section XI-10-54-15 of the Zoning Code) in
2005. The Density Bonus applies to all zoning districts that allow residential development, and the
minimum project threshold size is five dwelling units. In addition to providing higher densities, the
Ordinance also allows reduced parking standards. Table V.5 provides a summary of the key features of
this Ordinance.

                            40% and accompanying density bonus ranges from 5% to 35%). For
                            senior housing, since 100% of units in a development must be targeted
                            to seniors, a uniform density bonus of 20% applies.

                            moderate-income households, one incentive is provided. If a project
                            doubles the percentage of affordable units, e.g., 10% of units for very
Number of Incentives low-income; 20% of units for lower-income, or 20% of units for moderate,
Provided (2)                then two incentives are provided. If a project triples the percentage of
                            affordable units, e.g., 15% of units for very low-income; 30% of units for
                            lower-income, or 30% of units for moderate, then three incentives are
                            provided.
                            There are three ways that the reduction in the number of parking spaces
                            provides a cost benefit to developers. First, for developments outside
Reduced Parking             the TOD Overlay District, the number of required spaces for each unit
Incentive                   size is lower (except for four-bedroom units). Secondly, parking spaces
                            do not need to be covered, and thirdly, there is no requirement for guest
                            parking.

(2) The actual incentives are not defined. Incentives must result in more affordable housing costs.

7) Affordable Housing Requirement
While the City of Milpitas does not have an Inclusionary Zoning Ordinance, it has adopted an Affordable
Housing Requirement as part of its Zoning Ordinance (Section XI-10-6.03). According to this Ordinance, 20
percent of new units are to be affordable. This requirement allows the City to negotiate affordable housing
goals on a project-by-project basis with area developers. In the past, these negotiations have resulted in
several options to comply with the affordable housing requirement including payment of in-lieu fees, land
                                                                                                       7-95
                                                                                               HOUSING ELEMENT
dedication, off-site development, and on-site inclusionary units. Furthermore, the City can waive a
development out of the requirement altogether, if it appears that compliance with the requirement would
render a project financially infeasible. Frequently, the City provides loans, grants, and down payment
assistance to facilitate affordability.
Table IV.6 in the previous chapter provides information on assistance provided to affordable and market rate
projects developed since 1999. There are eight market rate projects listed on this table that were required to
provide affordable units. These include Centria East, Crossing at Montague, Parc Metro, Parc Place,
Paragon, Terra Serena, Town Center Villas, and South Main Senior Lifestyle. Together, these projects have
received (or have received commitments) for a total of over $23.4 million in city financial assistance;
approximately 70 percent of this financial assistance has been (or will be) provided as loans. This assistance
enables the developers to build financially feasible projects while at the same time, providing the required
affordable housing. However, there are also market rate projects (under construction, approved and planned)
that have not requested assistance, but are still required to provide affordable units. These include Fairfield
Murphy Ranch and Matteson Condos. These developments will be able to comply with the City’s affordable
housing requirement without receiving financial assistance from the City.
In addition to financial assistance, the City provides other development incentives, primarily by allowing
modifications to development standards that intensify land utilization. By allowing more units to be built on a
given site, the City assists developers by lowering land costs per unit. Examples of more favorable
development standards include reducing parking requirements, increasing height limits, providing density
bonuses, and reducing setbacks. The City provided these incentives to two recent condominium projects –
Parc Place and Paragon – assisting in the provision of 87 affordable units.
Specific income group targeting for affordable units is not specified in the City’s Zoning Ordinance. The actual
incomes targeted depend, in part, on prevailing market conditions. For example, in the falling housing market
(2008-09), the City and developers encountered problems in marketing deed-restricted moderate-income
units. Since market rate and moderate-income sales prices were fairly close, moderate-income, first time
homebuyers were less interested in purchasing units with resale restrictions because they could afford to
purchase market rate units without restrictions. Thus, the City used some of its redevelopment housing set-
aside funds to offer second mortgages so that low-income buyers could purchase these units.40 This is an
example of the flexibility of the City’s housing policies.
Since the City’s affordable housing requirement is not specified in terms of affordability targeting and can be
waived entirely, depending on project economics, it is difficult to provide a generalized discussion of its
“impacts on the cost and supply of housing.” While compliance with this zoning requirement could result in a
decrease in the profitability of residential development projects for developers (or could increase the cost of
market rate housing in the City if developers passed compliance costs onto buyers), there is enough flexibility
in the City’s implementation of its affordable housing requirement that it has not presented a problem thus far.
In fact, during the last ten years, the City has experienced a significant building boom. 41 (See Table III.16 in
Chapter III.) This building boom illustrates the market neutrality of the city’s affordable housing requirement.
40
   Since much of the new residential development is located in a redevelopment project area, the City can use its
housing set-aside funds to support the affordable housing required under the City’s Zoning Ordinance and California
Redevelopment Law.
41
   Much of this boom can be attributed to higher densities and other development incentives provided under the City’s
two specific plans as well as to an increase in demand due to job growth in Silicon Valley.
                                                                                                              7-96

                                                                                         HOUSING ELEMENT
8) Building Codes and Enforcement
The City of Milpitas has adopted the Uniform Building Code (UBC), the National Electrical Code, the
Uniform Mechanical and Plumbing Code, and the Uniform Fire Code. It also enforces California Energy
Commission’s Title 24 standards for energy efficiency. City codes are updated regularly to reflect
changes made in state and national codes and standards.
The City has not adopted any special requirements above and beyond those in the UBC. Class B (or
better) roofing is required in new residential construction on the Valley Floor. Structures on the hillsides
are subject to special engineering criteria for high wind, representing an added cost for the small number
of homes that may eventually be built in these areas. These structures are also subject to fire-retardant
roofing standards and sprinkler requirements. The City allows the use of the more flexible State Historic
Building Code for historic structures, although the number of eligible structures is small.
While the UBC contains no prohibitions on exterior building materials, the Midtown and Transit Area
Specific Plans disallow certain materials. These include vinyl, aluminum, and T-111 siding, and
horizontal sliding or plastic snap-in windows. These prohibitions should not affect housing affordability or
production. For example, affordable housing projects in the City have used stucco or wood exteriors,
allowing them to better blend with the surrounding community and convey an image of quality and
durability.
9) Site Improvement Requirements
Residential developers are responsible for constructing road, water, sewer, and storm drainage
improvements on new housing sites. Where a project has off-site impacts, such as increased run-off or
added congestion at a nearby intersection, developers may be responsible for additional expenses to
offset impacts from their projects.
The City’s Subdivision Ordinance, which is part of the City’s Municipal Code, establishes the
requirements for new subdivisions, including local street rights-of-way and curb-to-curb widths, sanitary
sewer and storm drainage lines, and easements. These requirements do not restrict market rate housing
development. While there are no special provisions or exceptions in the Subdivision Ordinance for
affordable units, the City Council has the discretion to consider such exceptions. The City allows
narrower streets within new subdivisions if these streets are privately owned and maintained, and if safety
and emergency access concerns are adequately addressed.
10) Design Review
The City of Milpitas requires design review for projects within the “S” overlay zoning district only. These
districts generally apply in commercial, industrial, and multifamily residential areas, and on the hillsides.
Since most single family homes are outside the S district, alterations to individual homes (such as
remodels and additions) are not usually subject to design review. New multifamily projects are typically
                                                                                                       7-97

                                                                                            HOUSING ELEMENT
evaluated through a site plan review process, which includes an evaluation of design attributes by the
Planning Commission. The City does not have a separate design review process.
The City has not adopted citywide residential design guidelines, but has adopted guidelines for the
Midtown and Transit Specific Plan Areas.42 These Guidelines cover site planning and building design,
including massing, windows, materials, color, roof design, landscaping, signage, and lighting. In addition,
there are specific guidelines by building type, covering mixed-use and multifamily residential. These
Guidelines do not pose a constraint, and are intended to ameliorate concerns that could arise when very
high density residential projects are proposed in a city, such as Milpitas, that had primarily consisted of
single family homes.
Subsurface parking is required in higher density housing and can extend no more than five feet above
grade. While the cost of subsurface garages is high, the high densities allowed (up to 75 units per acre),
can support the higher development costs of subsurface parking.
It has been the City’s experience that these Guidelines do not add to development costs or result in a
negative impact on approval certainty, since developers have found that the Guidelines are
straightforward and helpful.
11) Permit Processing
Permit processing time is not a development constraint in Milpitas. Small to medium-sized projects (less
than 50 units) consistent with the General Plan and Zoning Ordinance typically receive final zoning and
tentative map approval within three months after a complete application is submitted. Projects requiring
an environmental impact report, a General Plan Amendment, or a major rezoning may require longer
processing times.
New subdivisions and multifamily construction are subject to environmental review, under the California
Environmental Quality Act. One of the advantages of the two Specific Plan Environmental Impact
Reports (EIRs) is that future projects are expected to rely heavily on those documents rather than
preparing entirely new EIRs to assess broad-based and cumulative impacts (such as geologic hazards
and air quality). Additional environmental review may still be required, but only if the project has the
potential for impacts not already considered.
Once zoning approval is obtained, building permit processing times are relatively short. The City is in
compliance with the Permit Streamlining Act and typically issues building permits within six to eight weeks
after complete applications are received. To expedite the process, an applicant may request an outside
Plan Checker from the City’s approved list. Longer times, ranging from six to nine weeks, are possible
for multifamily developments. Pre-development conferences and meetings with staff are encouraged
before applications are submitted. In this way, concerns can be addressed early and subsequent delays
can be avoided.
The Zoning Code stipulates the residential types permitted, conditionally permitted, or prohibited in each
zone allowing residential uses. Permitted Uses are those uses allowed without discretionary review, as
42
   The Appendix to the Transit Area Specific Plan provides detailed design guideline information for new residential
construction in both Specific Plan Areas.
                                                                                                          7-98

                                                                                           HOUSING ELEMENT
long as the project complies with all development standards. Conditional use permits (CUP) are
approved by the Planning Commission unless appealed to the City Council. Typical findings of a CUP
include that the project is consistent with the General Plan, the use is compatible with surrounding uses,
and would not be a detriment to basic public health, safety, and general welfare. Table V.6 describes the
housing types by permitted, not permitted, and conditional uses.43

Permit Processing Time
The time required to process a project varies greatly from one project to another and is directly related to
the size and complexity of the proposal, the location (if located within the Site and Architectural or Hillside
Overlay Districts) and the number of actions or approvals needed to complete the process. Typically,
projects only requiring Planning Commission Subcommittee review take four to six weeks to process.
Projects only requiring Planning Commission review take eight to 12 weeks to process, while projects
requiring City Council consideration take 14 – 16 weeks to process. Table V.7 identifies the typical
processing time most common in the entitlement process. It should be noted that each project does not
necessarily have to complete each step in the process (i.e., small scale projects consistent with General
Plan and zoning designations do not generally require Environmental Impact Reports (EIRs), General
Plan Amendments, Rezones, or Variances). Also, certain review and approval procedures may run
concurrently. For example, a ministerial review for a single-family home would be processed concurrently
with the design review. Since the majority of EIRs are prepared in response to a General Plan
Amendment request they are often processed simultaneously. The City also encourages the joint
processing of related applications for a single project. As an example, a rezone petition may be reviewed
43
   Since mixed-use zones only allow multifamily housing, most of the mixed use cells in TableV.6 are not
applicable.
                                                                                                         7-99

in conjunction with the required site plan, a tentative tract map, and any necessary variances. Such
procedures save time, money, and effort for both the public and private sector and could decrease the
costs for the developer by as much as 30 percent.

Projects proposed outside of the City’s Site and Architectural and Hillside Overlay Districts that are
consistent with the General Plan and zoning require only a building permit. Typical review and approval
takes four to eight weeks.
For projects proposed within the City’s Site and Architectural and Hillside Overlay Districts, then one or
more planning entitlements are required. The City works closely with developers to expedite approval
procedures so as not to put any unnecessary timing constraints on development. For a typical project, an
initial pre-consultation meeting with the Planning Division, Public Works Department, and the Fire
Department is arranged to discuss the development proposal. Then a tentative parcel map application or
a description of the project must be filed with a site plan. These documents are first reviewed by the
Planning Department and other departments, such as Public Works, for consistency with city ordinances
and General Plan guidelines. Concurrently, the elevations are reviewed by staff for recommendations or
for approval. The plan is then approved at the staff level. Depending on the complexity of the project, a
single family project (one to four units) could be approved in eight to 12 weeks from the date of plan
submission. After the project is approved, the various affected departments perform plan checks and
issue appropriate permits, including building permits. Larger projects requiring tentative maps require
                                                                                                    7-100

review by the City Council. The typical time for processing is 14 to 16 weeks. All of these projects
require public hearings. Planning Commission meetings are held twice a month and the City Council
meets twice each month.
Throughout construction, the Building Department will perform building checks to monitor the progress of
the project. This process does not seem to put an undue time constraint on most developments because
of the close working relationship among city staff, developers, and the decision-making bodies. Table V.8
outlines typical approval requirements for a single-family infill project, a two to four unit subdivision, and a
five or more unit multifamily project.

12) Development Fees
The City of Milpitas charges residential developers several different types of fees for services performed
by City staff, including staff review of building plans and inspection of construction in progress. In
addition, developers pay for sewer and water hook-ups, storm drainage connections, impact fees for
schools, parks and traffic, and additional fees for fire and sewer facilities. Finally, developers of larger
projects may incur costs in complying with the City’s Affordable Housing Policy, either by building the
required affordable units, or by providing land or capital to affordable housing developers.
Table V.9 shows total fees for two residential prototypes in Milpitas.
     •   The first prototype presented in Table V.9 is a single home that is a three-bedroom, two-story
         house. This prototype consists of 2,000 SF of interior space a 400 SF garage. It is sited on a
         5,000 SF lot. The house is located outside the Hillside Combining District and the two Specific
         Plan Areas.
     •   The second prototype is a multifamily development that is wood-frame construction consisting of
         150 units on 4.5 acres (density is 34 units per acre). Each unit has two bedrooms and is 1,200 SF
         in size with 200 SF of parking space per unit. Again, this development is outside the two Specific
         Plan Areas. For this prototype, there are two variations. One assumes that the development is
         located outside the Transit Specific Plan Area, and the second assumes that the development is
         located inside the Transit Specific Plan Area.
                                                                                                       7-101

                                                                                               HOUSING ELEMENT
According to the estimates presented in Table V.9, a single family home could pay $42,700 in
development fees, and a multifamily unit (outside the Transit Specific Plan Area) would pay less, at
approximately $28,600 in fees.44 Both figures are under-estimates of actual fees, since they do not
include the City’s traffic impact fee which varies by location and is difficult to model.

In addition to development fees, the City charges planning fees based on services as needed. (See Table
V.10.) The majority of these fees would apply to subdivisions or multifamily housing, but a few, such as a
conditional use permit or a variance could also apply to single family housing. The City does not consider
these fees to be a burden. Instead, they are necessary charges to cover staff time that is required by
proposed developments. Alterations to existing housing are also levied some fees. These are triggered
by changes that exceed 200 SF.
     44
        Overall development fees, including impact, planning, and connection fees represent approximately six
     percent of total development costs for single family units and ten percent of total development costs for
     multifamily units.

It is important to consider whether these fees are reasonable or whether the fees are too high and could
constrain development. In reviewing the fees, the single largest fee is for parks. An important part of the
fee calculation is land value which is reappraised biannually. The method of calculating this fee has
remained essentially the same since the 2002 Housing Element; however, since land costs have risen in
Milpitas, so have park fees.
Overall, fees in the City are not unreasonable for the Silicon Valley Area. As a point of comparison,
Milpitas’ fees can be compared with the average of fees charged in eight South Bay Cities (seven in
Santa Clara County and one in Monterey County). According to the 2006-07 Survey of South Bay Area
Cost of Development, average fees for a single family unit for the eight cities surveyed was $38,936 for a
single family unit (compared with $42,701 in Milpitas) and $24,072 for a multifamily unit (compared with
$28,616 in Milpitas). While the average fees reported in this survey are slightly lower than fees charged
in Milpitas, they also cover an earlier time period (2006-07). Finally, given that the City experienced major
residential growth between the last housing element and the housing market slowdown starting in 2007,
the fees do not appear to be constraining development.
13) State of California Article 34
Article 34 of the State Constitution requires voter approval for specified “low rent” housing projects that
involve certain types of public agency participation. Generally, a project is subject to Article 34 if more
than 49 percent of its units will be rented to low-income persons, and if the City is the developer. If a
project is subject to Article 34, it will require an approval from the local electorate. This can pose a
constraint to the production of affordable housing, since the process to seek ballot approval for affordable
housing projects can be costly and time consuming, with no guarantee of success.
The provisions of Article 34 allow local jurisdictions to seek voter approval for “general authority” to
develop low-income housing without identifying specific projects or sites. If the electorate approves
general parameters for certain types of affordable housing development, the local jurisdiction will be able
to move more quickly in response to housing opportunities that fall within those parameters.
                                                                                                       7-103

                                                                                              HOUSING ELEMENT
The City of Milpitas has not held an Article 34 election, since it does not directly build affordable housing.
Instead, the City provides loans and grants to affordable housing developers and therefore does not
trigger Article 34. So far, a lack of Article 34 authorization has not been a barrier in the production of
affordable housing.
14) Infrastructure and Public Facility Constraints
Most housing sites in Milpitas are in developed areas that are fully served by infrastructure. The
conversion of older industrial and heavy commercial sites in the Specific Plan Areas to residential and
mixed land uses require that additional infrastructure investment be undertaken.
Furthermore, because many of the sites identified in Chapter IV are located in the Specific Plan Areas, it
is very important to understand whether inadequacy of infrastructure could serve as a constraint to
development during the Housing Element Update period.
Adequacy of infrastructure to accommodate development in the Midtown Specific Plan Area was
discussed in the 2002 Housing Element Update. The 2009 Housing Element Update focuses on the
Transit Area Specific Plan Area, since it was adopted since the last Housing Element period. The Transit
area provides opportunities for high density residential development with good freeway and transportation
access.45 In addition, since the area is undergoing land use conversion from industrial and heavy
commercial to residential and mixed uses, some of the parcels in the Transit Area are large in size, which
facilitates multifamily development.
This subsection discusses the need for infrastructure and public facilities that has been identified in the
Transit Area Specific Plan EIR, as well as some information about infrastructure constraints elsewhere in
the City.
45
   This area enjoys close access to two freeways, two light rail stations, and a future BART station.
                                                                                                       7-104
                                                                                          HOUSING ELEMENT
Roads
Even in the absence of new development in the Transit Area, traffic congestion is already a problem in
Milpitas during peak hours. The Environmental Impact Report for the Transit Area Specific Plan
discusses impacts of planned growth in the area on the roads and highways in Milpitas. The Executive
Summary of the EIR concludes that there will be significant, unavoidable environmental impacts on the
transportation system. These include the following:
      •    Freeway speeds and delays on I-680, I-880, and SR-237 segments will be below the Congestion
           Management Program LOS Standards.
      •    There will be substandard roadway segment operation during peak hours along numerous roads.
      •    Growth in the Transit Area will contribute to substandard intersection operations during peak
           hours along 15 key intersections. However, impacts at two intersections are more easily
           mitigated than are impacts at other affected intersections.
In the detailed listing of impacts, 13 intersections are identified that could operate at unacceptable levels
of service when the area is built out. These intersections are divided into two groups. The first group
consists of roads that are not programmed for improvements and includes the following intersections:
     1.   Tasman/Alder Drive
     2.   McCarthy Boulevard/Alder Drive
     3.   Tasman Drive/N. First St.
     4.   Montague Expressway/Milpitas Boulevard
     5.   Montague Expressway/First Street
The second group consists of intersections that can be improved once funds are generated through a
traffic fee.
     1.   Tasman Drive/I-880 SB Ramps
     2.   Great Mall Parkway/I-880 NB Ramps
     3.   Montague Expressway/McCarthy Boulevard-O’Toole Avenue
     4.   N. Capitol Avenue/Trade Zone Boulevard-Cropley Avenue
     5.   Great Mall Parkway-E. Capitol Avenue/Montague Expressway
     6.   Montague Expressway/Zanker Road
     7.   Montague Expressway/S. Main Street-Oakland Road
     8.   Montague Expressway/McCandless Drive-Trade Zone
Between the time there is new development in the Transit Area and the point at which sufficient funds
accumulate to pay for transportation improvements, the affected roads will be operating below an
acceptable level of service.
                                                                                                    7-105

                                                                                               HOUSING ELEMENT
One of the principal motives in adopting a transit area is to encourage the use of transit. Thus, it is
anticipated that the light rail system and proposed BART extension should also help manage future
congestion, as will the improvement of bicycle and pedestrian facilities planned for the area.46
Water
An updated Urban Water Management Plan was adopted by the City of Milpitas in December 2005. As
described by this Plan, the City of Milpitas receives potable water from the San Francisco Public Utilities
Commission (SFPUC) and the Santa Clara Valley Water District (SCVWD) and distributes this water to
two separate areas of the City. In addition, the City receives recycled water from the San Jose/Santa
Clara Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP), South Bay Water Recycling Program. During normal rainfall
periods, the City has sufficient water supply to meet water demands through 2030. However, the City
could be impacted by drought shortages. During drought periods, the two water wholesalers may not
have sufficient supplies to meet demand. When this situation occurs, it may be necessary
to reduce water deliveries through drought rationing options, such as calls for voluntary
water conservation or mandatory reductions.
As described by the Milpitas Transit Area Infrastructure Financing Technical Report, the Transit Area is
located primarily within the SCVWD’s service zones. The increase in water demand associated with
redevelopment in this area can be met through supplies available from the SCVWD. The Transit Area
Development Impact Fee will fund construction of the additional main lines needed to connect the
development portions of the Transit Area to the City’s water system. The fee will also cover costs to
connect the expansion of the City’s recycled water system to new development. (Recycled water is used
for irrigation and may be used for industrial processes).
In addition, new development will be required to install water saving devices required by the Uniform
Plumbing Cod as adopted by the City of Milpitas. These devices reduce water consumption and
consequently reduce wastewater.
Wastewater
Wastewater from Milpitas is directed to the WPCP for treatment. Improvements needed within the Transit
Area to existing sewer mains are identified in the 2004 Sewer Master Plan Revisions and Draft 2007
Sewer Master Plan Update. The Transit Area Development Impact Fee will provide funds to construct the
improvements necessary to transport wastewater from developing portions of the Transit Area to the
City’s sewage treatment trunk lines connecting the City to the treatment plant.
The additional capacity required to accommodate cumulative growth in the city along with the Transit
Area growth can be accommodated by the City’s contracted capacity at the WPCP. The City has
46
   In November 2008, voters in Santa Clara County passed an increase in the County sales tax to pay for the BART
extension through Milpitas. While it is necessary to secure additional state and federal funding, the proposed BART
Station in the Transit Area is becoming more of a reality. At this time, the planned Milpitas BART Station will be a
below-grade station near Montague Expressway and Capitol Avenue, south of the Great Mall.
                                                                                                            7-106

                                                                                         HOUSING ELEMENT
contractual rights to 14.25 mgd. Thus, the City could need to acquire an additional 0.75 mgd of capacity
at the WPCP if needed. The City will monitor the increase in demand generated by growth throughout
the City, including the net increase attributable to the Transit Area, to determine when additional capacity
will be needed.
Storm Drainage
The Transit Specific Plan Area is located within the lower floodplain areas of local watersheds. Thus, it is
subject to flood hazards. In fact, there are three zones that are categorized by FEMA as 100-year
floodplains. Because of this situation, area-wide planning is required and special construction methods
must be applied to development within much of the Transit Area. The 2001 Storm Drainage Master Plan
identified improvements for the Transit Area. These include construction of a culvert and constructing
additional drainage pipes.
In addition to area-wide improvements, storm drainage studies for new development projects are
performed on a case-by-case basis, with mitigation measures determined for each project. These
measures may include on-site improvements, such as raising development sites with fill or adding storm
water retention pond, and off-site improvements, such as the widening of channels or culverts
downstream. The improvements are typically financed by the developer as a condition of approval.
Most of the large residential projects built during the last few years, including affordable projects, have
been subject to storm drainage improvement requirements. While the storm drainage improvements add
to development costs, they have not been a constraint to development as evidenced by the recent
construction of housing projects in the floodplain.
Solid Waste
The City of Milpitas sends all of its recycling and garbage for processing at the Allied Waste Services
(Allied) Recyclery and disposal at the Newby Island Sanitary Landfill (NISL) respectively. The City's
collection and disposal contracts with Allied (and affiliate companies) end September 5, 2017. Recent
studies estimate that the NISL may remain open until approximately 2025. However, this is dependant
upon the facility obtaining an extension of its State permit.
The City offers residential and commercial recycling programs and maintains outreach programs
promoting source reduction and waste prevention. However, residential and commercial development in
the Transit Area will increase recycling and garbage generation. The Transit Area EIR states that
development in the Transit Area will not cause an appreciable change in the filling rate of the NISL.
Based on the City's waste characterization study of 2002, this is primarily due to effective diversion rates
(recycling program participation).
15) Environmental Constraints
Housing production in Milpitas is constrained by steep hillsides on the east, wetlands on the west, and
City boundaries on the north and south. Because of these physical limitations, future housing
                                                                                                     7-107
                                                                                        HOUSING ELEMENT
development will largely occur through infill and redevelopment. Although development on the hillsides is
theoretically possible, the area has serious seismic and landslide constraints. Hillside homes would be
expensive to construct and could have significant environmental impacts. Residents would be subject to
ongoing geologic and wildfire risks.
The entire City is located in a seismically active area. The closest fault to the Transit area is the Hayward
Fault Zone, located two miles to the east. On sites throughout the Bay Area, housing must meet building
code standards which reflect the area’s earthquake-related ground shaking and liquefaction hazards.
As mentioned earlier in this section, flooding is another environmental constraint that could affect housing
production. Some of the housing sites in the Transit area are located within the 100-year floodplain.
Although flood depths would be very shallow, a combination of on-site and off-site improvements may still
be required before building in areas that could experience flooding.
Although such environmental constraints could ultimately impact the cost of new housing, they are
relatively common in the Bay Area. Natural hazards are a fact of life in Coastal California, and there are
few steps the City can take to reduce their impact on housing costs without endangering public safety.
C. Assessment of Potential Barriers
The City of Milpitas has demonstrated its support of higher density housing, particularly near transit. It
has created two specific plans, rezoned many sites in the specific plan areas to higher densities and
created a TOD Overlay District that further augments allowable residential densities. Other Zoning
Ordinance changes have resulted in reduced setbacks, reduced parking requirements, and higher height
limits. During the residential development boom period in the early part of this decade, builders
responded to these changes by proposing and building many market housing units, as well as required
affordable units. At this time, the Zoning Ordinance, other development standards, and the permitting
process do not constitute barriers to development in Milpitas.
The City continues to enforce its Urban Growth Boundary (UGB) that was approved by voters in 1998.
While the UGB does restrict development on the City’s hillsides, it also protects the hillsides, reduces the
possibility for landslides and wildfires that accompany development, and avoids the need for costly
infrastructure extension. Most importantly, sites in the hillside areas would serve the luxury housing
market only. Since the City has identified an excess number of sites to meet its RHNA allocations without
development of the hillsides, the City has concluded that the UGB is not a barrier to housing
development.
Development fees have increased in Milpitas since the prior housing element, but this trend has not
constrained development. In markets with high demand, these fees can be added to the cost of a new
unit and not constrain development. Under weaker market conditions, there is an imbalance between
development costs and likely revenues. However, this imbalance is not caused by the imposition of fees
alone, but by sales prices that are too low to support new development costs. Finally, the City will provide
developer impact fee assistance for affordable housing units in mixed income developments built in the
redevelopment project area by transferring housing set-aside funds to the General Fund to cover these
fees.
                                                                                                     7-108

                                                                                         HOUSING ELEMENT
Finally, a recent EIR prepared for the Transit Area Specific Plan identified several problems on local
freeways and key intersections, some of which could operate at unacceptable levels of service, once the
Transit Specific Plan Area is built out. The City has adopted a Transit Area Impact Fee that will be used
to improve levels of service at some of the intersections. However, freeway congestion is a regional
issue, and therefore requires a regional solution. In the long run, it is hoped that more development
located near transit will reduce some of the auto trips associated with new development in the Transit
Area.
D. Housing for Persons with Disabilities
Many persons with physical disabilities do not require special housing. However, a small proportion of the
City’s disabled population requires housing that is specially adapted to accommodate their disabilities.
Housing units that meet the special needs of persons with disabilities can be supplied in two ways. First,
it is possible to adapt the regular housing stock to accommodate special needs. Secondly, it is possible
to build special housing units that are accessible and are located near supportive services. In addition,
on-site services may be provided in special needs housing.
The City ensures that new housing developments comply with California building standards (Title 24 of
the California Building Code) which are even more rigorous than the ADA in its accessibility requirements.
The City provides applicants with a check list to assist them in developing Title 24/ADA compliant plans
before they are submitted. Building Department staff is well versed in accessibility requirements. Also,
the City requires ADA-compliant parking, accessible entries, accessible paths of travel through areas
being altered, and handicap-accessible restrooms, drinking fountains and public phones.
Pursuant to State law, Milpitas does not require discretionary review of small group homes for persons
with disabilities (six or fewer residents). The City allows small group homes in all residential zones, and
allows large group residential facilities in the R3 and R4 zones. There are no zoning, design review, or
building code provisions that conflict with the goal of providing a barrier-free environment. The City does
not impose additional zoning, building code, or permitting procedures other than those allowed by State
law. There are no City initiated constraints on housing for persons with disabilities caused or controlled
by the City. For example, the City’s definition of “family” includes unrelated persons who function together
as a single household unit. Also, there are no spacing requirements for group homes.
The City also allows and encourages residential retrofitting to increase the suitability of homes for
persons with disabilities in compliance with accessibility requirements. Such retrofitting is permitted under
Chapter 11, 1998 version of the California Code. Further, the City works with applicants who need
special accommodations in their homes to ensure that application of building code requirements does not
create a constraint. Also, the City provides funding for retrofits.
Finally, the Milpitas Zoning Ordinance [Section 10-54.08(B)(9)] allows for an exception for ADA structures
(ramps and associated railings) in any front, side or rear yard (no closer than three feet from the property
line) from setback requirements. While there are no provisions for exceptions for height to allow for an
elevator shaft to extend beyond the height limitations, with the height limit of 30 feet, it is possible to
accommodate two stories and an elevator shaft.
As part of the update of the housing element in 2002, the City conducted a comprehensive review of its
                                                                                                       7-109

zoning laws, policies and practices for compliance with fair housing laws. While the City has not identified
any zoning or other land-use regulatory practices that could discriminate against persons with disabilities
and impede the availability of such housing for these individuals, it recognizes that reasonable
accommodation is an important policy issue. Thus, as part of proposed Zoning Ordinance changes, the
City will establish procedures for reasonable accommodation in housing for persons with special needs.
E. Potential Non-Governmental Constraints
Cost factors, such as financing, land, and construction costs are the principal non-governmental
constraints to the development of affordable housing. These costs have been steadily increasing in
Milpitas and throughout Santa Clara County. A new trend since the 2002 Housing Element has been a
drop in housing prices (after 2006) while production costs have increased. This lowers profits to the point
that new development is not feasible. In fact, many of residential projects in Milpitas that have received
entitlements are not yet applying for building permits, since they are waiting for prices to rise to the point
where development will be feasible. Because of these market conditions, it was necessary to estimate
current development costs (and not try to obtain costs directly from developers). To simplify this
estimation, a single family house is used as a prototype.
1) Land Costs
Land costs are a major factor in the cost to build housing in Milpitas. According to an appraisal company
that provides updated information on land values for the City’s Park Impact Fee, the 2007 average cost
for land was $55/SF. This land value is a very approximate. For this price, the land would be
unimproved.
The main way that a jurisdiction can decrease the land cost component is by increasing the number of
units that can be built on a given piece of land. The increased densities allowed in the Transit Oriented
Development Overlay District provide a very good example of how the City has supports higher densities
to decrease housing costs. For example, in the R5 and MXD3 zones allowable densities reach 75
dwelling units per acre.
2) Construction Costs
Information on construction costs entered in Table V.11 is from the International Code Council and was
provided by the City of Milpitas Building and Safety Department. The valuation data is effective as of
September 2008. For the purposes of estimating the cost of a single family unit it was assumed that the
construction type is 5B or $138.47/SF, and the garage’s costs would be $35/SF. Thus, for a 2,000 SF single
family home with a 400 SF garage, the total construction cost is $290,000.
In addition to this, the cost of on-site improvements is estimated at $68,400. This estimate is based on
general cost estimates provided by Bay Area builders. Since site development costs vary based on
actual site conditions and intended use, it is difficult to derive a single figure that would apply in all
situations.
                                                                                                        7-110

Note: Costs assume a 2,000 SF house with a 400 SF garage on a 5,000 SF parcel.
3) Financing
Financing is critical to the housing market. Developers require construction financing, and buyers require
permanent financing. Financing can serve as a constraint to new residential development if developers
are unable to access construction financing and if buyers are unable to obtain reasonable mortgage
financing.
     •   If financing is not easily available, then more equity may be required to build new projects. In
         addition, fewer homebuyers can purchase homes, since higher down payments could be
         required.
     •   Higher construction period interest rates for developers result in higher development costs. For
         homebuyers, higher interest rates translate into higher mortgage payments (for the same loan
         amount), and therefore reduces the purchasing power of homebuyers,
At the end of 2008, the problem with financing is the availability of credit and not high interest rates. Bay
Area developers have indicated that banks are lending less for new residential projects. The problem is
that banks appraise the value of the completed project in determining how much construction financing to
provide. When sales prices drop (which has occurred), the bank reduces the after construction appraised
value, and therefore reduces the amount of construction financing that a developer can secure. In this
situation, a developer either has to raise more equity to invest in a project, or postpone development. At
this time, developers are delaying projects.
For homebuyers, it is necessary to pay a higher down payment than in the immediate past. Furthermore,
borrowers must demonstrate credit worthiness and adequate incomes, so that loan applications meet
standard underwriting criteria. While strict adherence to underwriting criteria was not required during the
last eight years, the return to stricter standards is consistent with loan standards prior to 2001.
4) Housing Production Costs
As shown in Table V.11, total development costs for a 2,000 SF single family home on a 5,000 SF lot is
$676,100, including land, site improvements, construction costs, and development fees. This figure does
not include developer profit, payments to equity partners, or marketing costs. According to the figures
shown in Table III.13, none of Milpitas' lower- or moderate-income households could afford to purchase a
                                                                                                      7-111

                                                                                          HOUSING ELEMENT
new home in Milpitas. Although many newly constructed homes, particularly condominiums are smaller
than 2,000 SF, these would still not be affordable to low- and moderate-income households. In fact, in
order to afford the new home described in Table V.7, a household would need an income of at least
$161,000 as well as savings of approximately $135,000 for a down payment. Based on current
household incomes, this income level would place the household at 153% AMI.
The two cost components that have increased the most since the 2002 Housing Element are
permits/fees, and land costs. The current fees charged by the City are not excessive and are vital to
supporting city departments that review, approve, and monitor new building activity. In addition, impact
fees are required to pay for the expansion of public facilities, particularly parks that are required to serve
new residents. Finally, although the land cost per SF is now $55 (in comparison to $45/SF in the last
housing element) is relatively high for the single family house example in Table V.11, it should be
remembered that land costs per unit would be much lower for multifamily housing.
5) Affordable Housing Constraints
In addition to the constraints to market rate housing development discussed above, affordable housing
projects face additional constraints. These are listed below.
Financing Constraints
Multiple funding sources are needed to construct an affordable housing project, since substantial
subsidies are required to make the units affordable to very low-, low- and moderate-income households.
It is not unusual to see six or more financing sources required to make a project financially feasible. Each
of these sources may have different requirements and application deadlines, and some sources may
require that the project has already successfully secured financing commitments.
Since financing is so critical and is also generally competitive, organizations and agencies that provide
funding often can effectively dictate the type and sizes of projects. Thus, in some years senior housing
may be favored by financing programs, while in other years family housing may be preferred. Target
income levels can also vary from year to year.
This situation has worsened in 2008 for two reasons. Similar to market rate development, lenders have
reduced appraised values for completed affordable projects. This reduces the amount of funds provided
to a project by conventional lenders. Secondly, tax credits are no longer selling on a one for one basis.
In other words, once a project has received authorization to sell a specified amount of tax credits to equity
investors, the investors are no longer purchasing the credits at face value, but are purchasing them at a
discount. (Tax credits are not worth as much to investors if their incomes have dropped.)
The City helps to lessen the financing constraint for affordable housing development by providing loans
(either to the developer or to first-time homebuyers), developer impact fee assistance, and sometimes
grants for affordable housing. The City’s Redevelopment Agency (20% Low-Income Housing Set-Aside
Funds) provides the majority of the funds that are used to assist affordable housing units in two ways.
First, the City also provides assistance to non-profit developers, such as Mid-Peninsula Housing
Coalition, to build projects that are completely affordable. The City also helps market rate developers that
                                                                                                      7-112

                                                                                                 HOUSING ELEMENT
are encouraged to provide affordable units under Section XI-10-6.03 (Affordable Housing) in the Zoning
Code.47
Section XI-10-6.03 of the Zoning Code requires that affordable housing units be provided in all new
housing projects. The City of Milpitas negotiates the number of affordable units on a project by project
basis. The City’s goal is that 20 percent of all new units built be affordable. During these developer
negotiations, the City considers a number of factors including location, size of the project, proximity to
transit, and the type of housing to be provided.
Since the end of the 1990’s, the City experienced considerable development activity in its Redevelopment
Project Area and therefore was able to offer significant financial assistance for affordable units. Table
V.12 presents the total number of units assisted, the types of assistance provided, and the total amount of
financial assistance provided. Since 1999, 913 affordable units (located in 14 projects) have received
financial assistance totaling over $34 million. Of this total, about 76 percent of funds are loans which will
eventually cycle back to the City to be used in additional affordable housing developments.

Sources: City of Milpitas and Vernazza Wolfe Associates, Inc.
Size of Projects/Land Acquisition
In addition, the size of projects also relates to financing and management concerns. Small projects are
proportionately more expensive to develop and operate, and so financing sources and affordable housing
developers generally prefer projects of at least 30 to 40 units, with as preference for larger projects.
This preference for larger sites is not a problem in Milpitas. Most new housing developments (both
mixed-income and affordable) are located in one of the two Specific Plan Areas. This redevelopment
consists of changing land uses from industrial/heavy commercial to residential. Thus, there are already
large parcels that would be suitable for residential developments. Also, it is possible to assemble smaller
parcels to create larger sites. In fact, the average project size represented by the affordable units
presented in Table V.12 is 69 units, and the median is 258 units.
G) Policies to Overcome Constraints
47
   XI-10-6.03 Affordable Housing: Affordable housing units should be provided in all new housing projects. While
twenty percent (20%) is the minimum goal, affordable unit requirements will be determined on a project by project
basis, taking into consideration the size and location of the project, the type of housing unit, proximity to transit and
the mix of affordable units in the vicinity. (Ord. 38.777 (8) (part), 6/17/08)
                                                                                                               7-113

                                                                                        HOUSING ELEMENT
The rising costs of land, construction, and financing described above are outside the ability of the City of
Milpitas to change. However, there are two ways in which the City has attempted to mitigate these
constraints.
    •    First, land costs are estimated to average $55/SF. The 2002 Housing Element stated that land
         costs were $45/SF, based on costs in downtown San Jose. While the market determines land
         prices, the City can reduce the land cost per unit by allowing higher densities. The City has
         accomplished this for sites in the Midtown and Transit Specific Plan Areas.
    •    Secondly, since affordable housing developments face the same increasing development costs
         as do market rate units, the City has provided substantial financial assistance to new
         developments to help reduce these high costs. Since 1999, the City has provided (or pledged)
         almost $40 million in assistance that has benefited (or will benefit) almost 2,000 units.
                                                                                                   7-114

                                                                                        HOUSING ELEMENT
7.7 HOUSING PLAN
Based on the needs, resources, and constraints identified above, this chapter presents the Housing Plan
for the City of Milpitas for the 2009-2014 planning period. The City has established this Plan in
consideration of its own local needs and priorities, as well as its obligations under State Housing Element
law.
The Housing Plan is structured as a series of goals and related policies. Related to each policy, there are
one or more programs that the City will implement over the 2009-2014 planning period. These programs
are summarized in a Five-Year Implementation Plan which presents the programs together with
implementing agencies, funding sources and time-frames for implementation. Finally, the Housing Plan
sets forth quantified objectives for housing construction, rehabilitation and conservation for the Housing
Element planning period.
A. Identification of Adequate Sites
Goal
Goal G-1: Provide Adequate Sites for Housing Development in the City of Milpitas.
The City of Milpitas will maintain adequate sites to accommodate its share of the regional housing need,
including sites that would be appropriate for the development of housing affordable to very low-, low-,
moderate- and above moderate-income households.
Implementing Policies and Programs
Policy A-1: The City will facilitate land acquisition and site assembly.
         The City will continue to work with local property owners to assemble small sites for future
         developments.
Policy A-2: While the City is able to accommodate its share of the regional housing need without rezoning
during the current Housing Element period, it has demonstrated a willingness to consider land use
redesignation in order to accommodate specific projects.
         The City will consider land use redesignations if they are needed.
                                                                                                    7-115
                                                                                        HOUSING ELEMENT
B. Housing & Neighborhood Conservation
Goals
Goal B-1: Maintain High Quality Residential Environments
The maintenance and improvement of the quality of life of existing neighborhoods is a high priority for the
City of Milpitas.
Goal B-2: Preserve Housing Resources
Milpitas will strive to maintain and preserve existing housing resources, including both affordable and
market rate units.
Implementing Policies and Programs
Policy B-1: The City will continue to enforce housing codes and regulations to correct code violations in
the most expeditious manner to protect the integrity of housing while minimizing the displacement of
residents. The City will work to have all dwelling units that cannot be rehabilitated demolished, so that
hazards will be eliminated, and land will become available for new housing.
         The City will continue to enforce its existing codes through its Code Enforcement Program,
         utilizing all available authorities to compel property owners to correct code violations. This
         program has been strengthened through the passage of the Neighborhood Beautification
         Ordinance (NBO), which establishes guidelines for the overall maintenance and preservation of
         neighborhoods citywide.
         Through its Replacement/Relocation Program, the City will assist any household displaced
         through code enforcement activities to relocate to other suitable and affordable housing.
Policy B-2: The City will continue to provide assistance for the rehabilitation of housing units occupied by
very low-income and low-income households during the next five-year Housing Element Planning Period.
         Through the Housing Rehabilitation Program, the City will provide funds to assist very low- and
         low-income owner households to undertake repairs to their homes to bring them up to standard
         condition and prolong the useful life of the local housing stock. The City will give priority for
         participation in this program to very low-, and low-income homeowners who are subject to code
         enforcement actions that could otherwise lead to displacement of residents. Assuming adequate
         CDBG funding, the City will continue assisting between six and eight low-income homeowners
         annually.
         The City adopted a Lift Zone Program in the City in 2009. The purpose of this program is to bring
         together residents and property owners to strengthen neighborhoods through neighborhood
         clean-up, blight removal, and housing rehabilitation.
         The City will continue to provide CDBG funds to Rebuilding Together to preserve affordable
         housing. This program provides safety, accessibility, and mobility repairs to mobile and single
         family homes owned by very low- and low-income households.
                                                                                                      7-116
                                                                                         HOUSING ELEMENT
Policy B-3: The City will monitor the need to replace infrastructure as needed to conserve older
neighborhoods.
        When updating its Capital Improvement Program and associated budget, the City of Milpitas will
        allocate resources to rehabilitate and/or replace infrastructure in older neighborhoods whose
        infrastructure is approaching obsolescence.
Policy B-4: Milpitas will collaborate with other public and private entities to ensure that no lower-income
residents are adversely impacted by the conversion of existing affordable housing projects to market rate
rents.
    The City will continue to monitor the status of the 149 units at risk of conversion to market rates at
    Sunnyhills Apartments. The City will work with the Santa Clara County Housing Authority, U.S.
    Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the property owner to insure the continuation of
    subsidies to the 149 low-income renters. If notice is received that the owner will convert the property
    to market rate use, the City will implement the following actions:
        •    Establish contact with public and non-profit organizations, such as Mid-Peninsula Housing
             Coalition, BRIDGE Housing, and other non-profit housing providers working in the Santa
             Clara area, to inform them of the potential conversion status of Sunnyhills Apartments and to
             determine interest in purchasing and/or managing units at-risk.
        •    If the owner decides to convert the development to a market rate use, the City will notify these
             organizations and where feasible, provide technical assistance and support to these
             organizations with respect to financing to acquire or replace these units.
        •    The City will work with tenants of at-risk units and provide them with education regarding
             tenant rights and conversion procedures. The City will also provide tenants at Sunnyhills
             Apartments with information regarding Section 8 rent subsidies available through the Santa
             Clara Housing Authority, and other affordable housing opportunities in the City.
        •    The City will assist tenants to obtain priority status on the Section 8 Waiting List.
Policy B-5: The City will maintain the existing stock of affordable housing provided through the private
market and provide tenant protections for apartment units at risk of condominium conversion.
        The City will continue to administer a condominium conversion ordinance that was enacted with
        the intention of minimizing the negative impacts of conversions on the rental market.
        The City will continue to administer a mobile home rent control ordinance that regulates rental
        rates and landlord tenant relations for the three mobile home parks in Milpitas.
C. New Housing Production
                                                                                                     7-117

                                                                                        HOUSING ELEMENT
Goal
Goal C-1: Facilitate New Housing Production
The City of Milpitas will take necessary steps to promote new housing development and remove public
infrastructure constraints to new housing development.
Implementing Policies and Programs
Policy C-1: The City will continue to use its planning tools to facilitate housing production.
         The Transit Area Specific Plan EIR can be used to expedite environmental review for subsequent
         projects that are consistent with the Transit Area Specific Plan.
         The City will continue to implement the planning and design guidelines specified in the Midtown
         and Transit Area Specific Plans, including the minimum density requirements in the TOD Overlay
         Districts and in all MXD zones (ranging from 21 to 41 units per acre, depending on zoning
         designation).
Policy C-2: The City will continue to address public infrastructure constraints to housing production where
feasible.
         The City will continue to coordinate sanitary and storm sewer improvements with the Cities of San
         Jose and Santa Clara and other relevant agencies if needed to acquire sufficient wastewater
         capacity to serve residential development. Measures to be explored include the reduction of
         wastewater flows (through water conservation programs) and the purchase of surplus capacity
         from other agencies using the regional water pollution control plant.
         The City will continue to work with the Santa Clara Valley Water District to reduce the extent of
         the flood plain on the housing sites identified in the Midtown Specific Plan.
         On an ongoing basis, the City will explore alternatives to the on-site retention of stormwater on
         each housing site, including the development of an area wide retention pond or allowances for
         porous pavement and other pervious surfaces which can absorb runoff.
         The City will continue to pursue state and federal grants and other financial measures to reduce
         the cost of off-site traffic improvements for housing developers in the City. This could also
         include the use of redevelopment funds to offset costs for projects that include a significant
         number of affordable housing units.
         The City will continue to monitor additional infrastructure improvements needed for access to the
         Union Pacific Site.
Policy C-3: The City will facilitate development of executive-luxury style housing to support its economic
development strategy.

Goals
Goal D-1: Promote Housing Affordability for both Renters and Homeowners
The City of Milpitas will use available resources to expand the number of new housing units affordable to
extremely low-, very-low, low- and moderate-income households.
Goal D-2: Support Housing to Meet Special Needs
The City of Milpitas strives to increase the range of housing opportunities for all residents, including those
with special needs and those unable to afford market rate housing within the community. The City of
Milpitas will place a priority on construction of housing that is appropriate to meet the needs of special
needs populations.
Goal D-3: Support Housing Diversity and Creativity in Residential Development
In recognition of the diverse needs of Milpitas’ households, the City supports creativity in the design and
development of housing projects.
Implementing Policies and Programs
Policy D-1: The City will facilitate the development of at least 441 new housing units affordable to
moderate-income households, 421 units affordable to low-income households and 689 new housing units
affordable to very low-income households.
         The City will continue to operate its Below-Market Rate Financing Program for new construction.
         Funds for this program are provided through Redevelopment Housing Set-Asides, CDBG, and
         other available resources, such as in-lieu payments, that can be used to finance affordable
         housing.
Policy D-2: The City of Milpitas will continue to target the provision of at least 20 percent affordable units
within new multifamily residential projects.
         The City will continue to promote affordable units in residential projects. In conformance with
         Section XI-10-6.03 of the City’s Zoning Ordinance, affordable housing requirements are
         negotiated on a project-by-project basis, aiming for a minimum percentage (20 percent) of
         affordable units in all housing developments.
Policy D-3: The City will provide density bonuses and other incentives for projects which provide
affordable units.
         The City will continue to provide density bonuses under its amended Ordinance.
         On a project-by-project basis, the City will continue to assist developers pay for development fees
         for housing developments that provide low-income units.
                                                                                                     7-119

                                                                                        HOUSING ELEMENT
Policy D-4: The City will promote the ability of lower- and moderate-income households to become

households.
         Housing for extremely low-income households includes conventional apartment units as well as
         SRO units. Policy G-2 states that the City will modify the Zoning Ordinance to identify zones for
         SRO Developments as a “by right” land use. In addition, the City will encourage affordable
         housing developers to include units for extremely low-income households in future developments
         and will provide its housing trust funds to help subsidize development costs to achieve
         affordability targeting to extremely low-households.
Policy D-6: Milpitas will support housing services for the homeless.
         The City will continue to facilitate the development of emergency and transitional housing through
         financial and/or other incentives.
         The City will continue to support emergency services and housing resources consistent with the
         City’s ongoing commitment to and participation in the Santa Clara County Continuum of Care
         Plan.
Policy D-7: The City will continue efforts to improve housing opportunities for disabled households in
Milpitas.
         •    Provide funds (through CDBG and other programs) to local non-profits, such as Rebuilding
              Together, assisting residents with home retrofits.
         •    Include units appropriate for disabled households within new housing developments.
         •    Enforce Title 24 of the California Building Code, and the Americans with Disabilities Act
              (ADA) when reviewing proposed development plans.
         •    Assist disabled residents with information on housing resources and suitable housing
              opportunities in the community.
         •    The City will modify the Zoning Ordinance to include a written statement regarding
              reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities. This statement will provide
              exception in zoning and land-use for housing. The process to be followed will be a ministerial
              process, with minimal or no processing fee, subject to approval by the Panning Director.
Policy D-8: The City will continue to encourage developers to provide new units that meet the needs of
both very small and large households.
         In reviewing proposed projects, City staff shall attempt to obtain the inclusion of studio and four-
         bedroom units in new projects as feasible through incentives, including financial and regulatory.
                                                                                                     7-120

                                                                                           HOUSING ELEMENT
Policy D-9: In public outreach efforts, the City will convey to the community that affordable housing can be
attractive, enhance the quality of life, and provide an essential resource for long-time Milpitas residents
and workers.
         The City will consider establishing a public education campaign that provides examples of
         affordable, award-winning projects that are compatible with Milpitas neighborhoods.
Policy D-10: The City will support housing alternatives, such as live/work lofts and manufactured
housing.
         Live work lofts are a conditional use in R4 zones and permitted use in R5 zones. Consistent with
         the Midtown Specific Plan, the City will favorably consider applications for live work lofts as one
         housing type to address the changing needs of Milpitas residents.
         The City will modify the Zoning Ordinance to permit manufactured housing in R1 zones, subject
         to the meeting of architectural requirements as well as the same development standards to which
         conventional single-family residential dwellings on the same lot would be subject.
Policy D-11: The City will support the inclusion of space for child care facilities in new residential
developments.
         The provision of space for child care facilities at major new residential developments permits the
         integration of this needed service in residential areas as they are developed. The City will
         explore the feasibility of encouraging new residential developers to provide space for future child
         care facilities.

gender, sexual orientation, marital or familial status, ethnic background, medical condition, or other
arbitrary factors, so that all residents can obtain decent housing throughout the City.
         The City will work with appropriate Local, State and Federal Agencies to ensure that fair housing
         laws are enforced.
         The City will continue to implement its ordinances and policies prohibiting discrimination in
         housing practices.
                                                                                                      7-121

G. Remove Government Constraints
Goals
                                                                                                      7-122

                                                                                        HOUSING ELEMENT
Goal G-1: Continue to Promote Land Use Policies and Development Standards to Facilitate Housing
Production.
During the last Housing Element Period, Milpitas made extensive changes to its Zoning Ordinance in
order to provide high density, transit oriented development in its specific plan areas. Housing developed
in these areas will continue to provide opportunities for affordable and workforce housing, will reduce the
jobs housing imbalance in Milpitas, and promote the use of alternative means of transportation, such as
transit.
Goal G-2: Remove Government Constraints to the Production of Special Needs Housing
Milpitas supports the development of special needs housing. The City will take necessary steps to
remove government constraints to the development of affordable housing serving special needs
populations.
Implementing Policies and Programs
Policy G-1: The City will continue to enforce land use policies and development standards that facilitate
affordable housing production.
         The City continues to enforce its development standards including minimum housing densities,
         mixed use zoning, and intensive land utilization in its TOD areas. These standards support both
         regional housing goals and financial feasibility goals required by developers.
Policy G-2: The City will modify its Zoning Ordinance to ensure that there are opportunities for special
needs housing.
         The City will modify the Zoning Ordinance to allow homeless shelters as a “by right” land use
         (without discretionary action) in the Highway Services Zone. The City will also modify the Zoning
         Ordinance to ensure that development standards adopted for homeless shelters will encourage
         and facilitate shelters and only subject shelters to the same development and management
         standards that apply to other allowed uses within the identified zone.
         The City will modify the Zoning Ordinance to allow transitional housing as a “by right” land use
         (without discretionary action) in residential zones and only subject to those restrictions that apply
         to other residential uses of the same type in the same zone.
         The City will modify the Zoning Ordinance to list permanent supportive housing as a “by right”
         land use (without discretionary action) as one of the possible uses in residential zones and only
         subject to those restrictions that apply to other residential uses of the same type in the same
         zone.
         The City will modify the Zoning Ordinance to identify zones for farmworker housing as a use “by
         right” (without discretionary action).
         The City will modify the Zoning Ordinance to identify zones for SRO Developments as a “by right”
         land use (without discretionary action).
                                                                                                      7-123

         (1) It should be noted that the total units to be constructed listed in Table VIII.1 are defined by
             the RHNA numbers. As of 2009, a significant number of new units required are already under
             construction, approved or are in the planning process.
         (2) This figure does not include mobile home units rented to seniors on fixed incomes.
         (3) Per HCD guidance, the quantified objective for extremely low-income housing units is
             assumed to be one-half the total of the very low-income units required.

The sources of information for Table VIII.1 are as follows:
   •     The new construction goals by affordability are defined through the Regional Housing Needs
         Determination process conducted by the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG).
   •     The rehabilitation goals are based on the current funding provided by the City’s CDBG
         Rehabilitation Program.
   •     The conservation goal is based on the need to preserve or replace the 149 affordable units at-risk
         to market conversion at Sunnyhills Apartments. In addition, there are 544 mobile home units
         located in three remaining mobile home parks. The City administers a Mobile Home Rent Control
         Ordinance to maintain affordability for those units occupied by low-income seniors, estimated to
         be approximately 65 percent of all mobile home residents.

IX. OTHER REQUIREMENTS
A. Consistency with the General Plan and Other Planning Documents
1) General Plan
A comprehensive update of the City’s General Plan was conducted in 1994. Several amendments have
occurred since then. For example, changes were made to the General Plan to incorporate the Midtown
and Transit Area Specific Plans, including revisions to the General Plan land use map and text for
consistency among these planning documents. The 2009-2014 Housing Element is consistent with the
General Plan.
In the event that future changes to the Zoning Ordinance or other regulations governing the City of
Milpitas result in any inconsistencies between the Housing Element policies and the General Plan, the
City will determine the most appropriate means to achieve overall General Plan consistency.
2) City of Milpitas Consolidated Plan
The City’s most recent Consolidated Plan covers the period 2007-2012. The 2009-2014 Milpitas Housing
Element is consistent with the program and policy goals in this Consolidated Plan. In addition,
information from the Consolidated Plan was utilized in the Housing Element update.
3) City of Milpitas Redevelopment Agency Implementation Plan
The City last updated its Five-Year Implementation Plan in 2006. The 2009-2014 Milpitas Housing
Element is consistent with the goals and expenditures outlined in this Plan.
B. Notification of Housing Element to Water and Sewer Providers
Upon adoption and certification of this Housing Element, the City of Milpitas will provide a copy of the
Housing Element to the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission, the Santa Clara Valley Water District,
and the Milpitas Department of Engineering in the City of Milpitas, pursuant to Government Code Section
65589.7. The purpose of this notification is to ensure that these providers of water and sewer services
place a priority for proposed housing developments for lower-income households in their current and
future resource or service allocations.
C. Review of Conservation and Safety Elements Pursuant to AB 162
Assembly Bill 162 requires that the City of Milpitas review, and if necessary, to identify new information for
its Conservation Element at the time the Housing Element is revised. The purpose of this review is to
identify rivers, creeks, streams, flood corridors, riparian habitat, and land that may accommodate
floodwater for purposes of groundwater recharge and stormwater management. In addition, the Safety
                                                                                                    7-132

                                                                                     HOUSING ELEMENT
Element will be reviewed to identify information regarding flood hazards that could affect development on
the potential sites listed in the Housing Element.
                                                                                                  7-133

7.11 APPENDIX A: HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE PUBLIC MEETINGS
Two public meetings were convened prior to the writing of the Housing Element update. The first meeting
was held in the afternoon of November 6, 2008, and the second meeting was held in the evening of
November 13, 2008.
These meetings had several goals:
   •    Explain the housing element update process.
   •    Explain current housing needs and conditions.
   •    Elicit suggestions regarding housing problems and possible solutions.
The City distributed summary tables of early findings. Also, participants were asked to complete
questionnaires. Since many housing professionals who were invited to the meeting did not attend, these
questionnaires were sent out electronically for follow-up. A summary of comments expressed at these
meetings is presented below.
Market Rate Housing
   •    One resident felt that there remains demand for luxury housing in Milpitas that is unmet since new
        residential development in the hills is zoned for one unit per ten acres in accordance with the
        Hillside Ordinance. This Ordinance was adopted after the electorate voted to constrain
        development in the hills. The resident suggested that the Hillside Ordinance be mentioned as a
        luxury housing constraint. However, staff attending the meeting mentioned that much of the
        hillside area cannot be developed since it is parkland or part of the San Francisco watershed.
        Also, the Hillside Ordinance has not constrained market rate or affordable housing development.
   •    When affordable sales prices at both the upper and lower ranges of the income distribution in
        Milpitas are compared with sales prices of homes recently sold, there is a mismatch at both ends
        of this distribution. In other words, proportionately, there are fewer units selling for under
        $459,000 than there are households that can afford such units, and fewer units priced above
        $1,150,000 than there are households that can afford higher cost housing.
                                                                                                     7-137

                                                                                        HOUSING ELEMENT
Issues Related to New Development in the Specific Plan Areas
    •  What about the lack of infrastructure to industrially zoned land that could be converted to
       residential uses? New development will pay for this infrastructure. The Financing Plan for the
       Transit Area Specific Plan has established a plan to pay for infrastructure.
    •  Traffic congestion is already a problem at certain intersections, such as Main and Montague and
       237 and Main. More development in the Transit Area will worsen already bad congestion
       problems. Thus, the City should work with VTA to run more small buses, not large buses, for
       transportation. This could decrease some of the traffic congestion.
    •  Milpitas schools need to accommodate increases in school enrollment related to new
       development in the Transit Area. Land has been set aside in the Specific Plan to accommodate
       the need for new schools.
Additional Issues
    •  Although the reduction of parking requirements is a possible cost offset to developers who
       provide affordable housing, the result of this policy is a lack of parking in certain areas. This
       parking problem exists in areas where street widths are too narrow to allow parking on both sides,
       as well as space for two-way traffic flow. The built environment (such as street widths planned
       for lower residential densities) no longer serves the needs of current residents, who live more
       densely in multifamily and single family neighborhoods, often due to doubling up in units or
       extended families occupying the same unit.
    •  The link between the housing element and other services, such as education and parks occurs in
       the land use element, not the housing element.
    •  Overcrowded units are more and more of a problem in Milpitas. Multigenerational families, often
       recent immigrants, share the same unit. Staff mentioned that this overcrowding problem is
       included in CDBG reports. Some of the streets affected include Adams-Temple-Selwyn.
    •  Another source of overcrowding is changing lifestyles. For example, when new condo projects
       were first built, young urban professionals moved in. Now, several years later, these couples are
       having children, resulting in overcrowding.
    •  Since the railroad tracks bisect Milpitas, there are only four major streets to use to travel
       east/west. These include 237, Abel/Jacklin, Dixon Landing Road, and Montague Expressway.
       Thus, these streets are more congested.
    •  A first-time homebuyer program is needed. This helps stabilize the community. Also, a first-time
       homebuyer program for school employees would be a good idea. (The City currently establishes
       preferences for new school teachers in the mixed-income developments. In fact, three or four
       teachers moved into very low-income units at Parc Place when the project first opened. The City
       continues to provide outreach about affordable units to teachers. However, a housing program
       that targets $40,000 annual incomes would not help teachers with more experience or teachers
                                                                                                     7-138

                                                                             HOUSING ELEMENT
  with spouses who earn higher incomes. Therefore, a school employee homebuyer program
  targeted to a higher income group should be considered.
• There appears to be an increase in the number of homeless persons in Milpitas. There are
  cooling and warming areas in the City for the homeless. The Sports Center is one example. It is
  possible that more homeless services are needed in Milpitas.
• When asked by staff whether residents at the meeting thought that child care facilities should be
  required at larger developments, there did not appear to be strong sentiments one way or
  another.

7.13 APPENDIX C: METHODOLOGY FOR MILPITAS HOUSING CONDITION SURVEY, 2008
Overview
The purpose of the survey was to assess housing conditions in selected areas in Milpitas. The areas
surveyed were chosen based on suggestions from City staff. The survey had two parts as follows:
    •   Housing/Property Condition Survey – A survey form was completed for each selected parcel.
        The procedure for selecting the parcels is outlined below.
    •   Block Segment Check List – This was a simple checklist completed for each block segment. A
        block segment is the street corridor (both odd and even sides) that is between two cross streets.
        This part of the survey provided the opportunity to gather some information on parcels that were
        not surveyed individually as well as to document conditions for the overall block segment. The
        goal was to provide a general assessment of the conditions of the block segment, focusing on
        specific conditions that violated the City’s Beautification Ordinance.
Areas Surveyed
The three primary areas surveyed were as follows:
    •   Selwyn Park neighborhood including Selwyn, Shirley, and Edsel Drives as well as Dempsey
        Road. (This area is south of East Calaveras Boulevard.)
    •   Area along and off East Calaveras Boulevard near the School District Offices from South Park
        Victoria to Temple Drive.
    •   Adams Street area west to include Fanyon Street on both sides, north to Kennedy Drive, Lynn
        Avenue, North Gadsen Drive and North Temple Drive. (This area is north of East Calaveras
        Boulevard.)
Methodology for Selecting Parcels to Be Surveyed
The streets/blocks surveyed are shown on the map presented at the end of this Appendix. The
procedures for surveying a street were as follows:
         1) Consultant staff surveyed every third parcel. After completing a survey form for the third
             parcel, staff skipped the next two parcels and surveyed the sixth parcel. This procedure was
             continued until the block segment was finished.
         2) On the first street, staff began the survey with the first parcel on the even side of the street
             and surveyed every third parcel on the even side before going to the odd side. The same
             process was repeated for the odd side of the street. This would complete a block segment.
             For the next block segment, staff started the survey with the first parcel on the odd side of
             the street.
         3) The procedure was repeated, starting with the second parcel and then the third parcel.
                                                                                                         7-151

                                                                                      HOUSING ELEMENT
         4) If the selected parcel did not have any housing units (vacant parcel, commercial building,
             etc.), the staff person did not complete a survey form and, instead, proceeded to the next
             parcel on the block and surveyed it.
         5) At the same time, a Block Segment Check List was completed for each block that was
             surveyed.
Instructions for Block Segment Check List
Consultant staff completed the Block Segment Check List after completing the designated parcel surveys
on the block segment. The purpose of this Check List was to record the overall conditions of the Block
Segment. On this list, Staff recorded the presence or absence on the street of any of the conditions on
the Block Segment Survey form. All parcels on the Block Segment were included, not just the ones that
were surveyed.
Staff used the comments section to note conditions that were not included on the Check List, but which
provided additional information about neighborhood conditions.
                                                                                                     7-152

7.14 APPENDIX D: LIST OF ADDITIONAL POTENTIAL HOUSING SITES, CITY OF MILPITAS
The multifamily sites noted on Table IV.3 are located either in the Midtown Specific Plan Area (sites 2
through 6) or the Transit Area Specific Plan Sites 7 through 14). Of these multifamily sites, two are
completely vacant (Sites 3 and 9). This Appendix addresses conditions on the remaining sites that are
not vacant.
When assessing the likelihood of redevelopment on these sites, it is important to consider the general
principle of highest and best use in real estate appraisal and development. While a parcel may be
developed in a use that provides an income stream to the owner, it may make sense to redevelop the site
into a land use that can command a higher income stream. The sites in the Midtown and Transit Specific
Plan Areas that are presently used for industrial and commercial purposes can provide a greater income
stream if they were redeveloped into residential and mixed use developments. Therefore, even though
these sites are not vacant, they are good candidates for redevelopment.
Furthermore, it is possible to consider the ratio of assessed improvement values to assessed values.
This is referred to as the ratio of improvement-value-to-total assessed value (I/AV Ratio). This is another
indicator of the suitability of reuse. While assessed values are not true indicators of market value, this
ratio indicates the relative importance of improvements to overall values. When the ratio is below 50
percent, it is signal that the land is worth more than the built structures and could be a good candidate for
redevelopment and infill housing.48 This measure has been included in the discussion below of non-
vacant parcels.
Midtown Specific Plan Area Site Assessment
Sites 2 through 6 are located in the Midtown Specific Plan Area. This area is undergoing redevelopment.
Several of the residential developments built between 1999 and 2006 are located in the Midtown Area.
Examples include Aspen Family Apartments, earlier phases of Terra Serena, Parc West, Parc Metro and
Parc Place, and several of the current projects, such as Apton Plaza (affordable) and Paragon.
All the sites in the Midtown Specific Plan Area that are included in the inventory are designated as mixed-
use developments. Consequently, when estimating potential units that could be built in mixed-use
districts, the site inventory assumed that 91 percent of each site could be developed with residential uses
and nine percent would be developed with commercial uses. These ratios reflect current development
patterns in mixed-use districts in the City.
Furthermore, the midpoint of allowable residential densities has been used to estimate potential capacity.
This approach takes into consideration the fact that some of the land on each site will be needed for site
improvements, such as parking and drainage.
Table D-1 summarizes information on these non-vacant sites.

• Site 2 consists of five parcels, totaling approximately 2.2 gross acres. This site could support 49
  units. It is located in the Midtown Specific Plan Area, an area undergoing redevelopment. There
  are multiple owners involved, so site assembly is needed. Current land uses include under-
  utilized commercial properties. The I/AV Ratio is 61 percent. (Photo provided.)
• Site 3 consists of five parcels on 1.9 gross acres. This site could support 43 units. It is similar to
  Site 2 in that there are several owners and will require site assembly in order to create a building
  site that is large enough for a feasible affordable, housing development. One of the parcels
  (Serra Way) is vacant. Including the vacant parcel, the I/AV Ratio is 24 percent. (Photo
  provided.)
  (Sites 2 and 3 are located across the street from each other.)
• Site 5 is 1.85 gross acres and contains four parcels that could support 42 units. The site contains
  three small businesses and a large parking area. Buildings appear to be about 40 years old and
  are in fair to poor condition. There are multiple owners. The I/AV Ratio is 15 percent. (Photo
  provided.)
• Site 6 is 1.1 gross acres and can support 25 units. This site is smaller than the size preferred by
  many affordable housing developers. On the positive side, one of the parcels is vacant, and the
  second parcel contains a contractor’s shed. The I/AV Ratio is 25 percent. This site is near Parc
  West at 950 South Main Street (a 68-unit affordable housing development built in 2005).
                                                                                                   7-159

Transit Area Specific Plan Site Assessment
One of the major attractions of the Transit Specific Plan Area is its proximity to current transit (Light Rail)
and to a proposed BART Station. As part of the Transit Area planning process, property owners in the
area were interviewed to learn about existing conditions, future plans for their properties, physical
constraints, and other issues related to new development. Based on information from these interviews,
opportunity sites were identified. In fact, three of the current projects listed in the Housing Element
(Citation, Milpitas Station, and Piper Towers) are located on opportunity sites identified in the Transit Area
Specific Plan. This confirms the Plan’s findings that development can occur on these sites within the five-
year time frame proposed. All, but one, of the Transit Area Specific Plan Area sites included in this
inventory have been identified as opportunity development sites within the next one to five years.49
Similar to the sites in the Midtown Specific Plan Area, several of the sites are wholly or partly zoned as
mixed use. The two exceptions are Sites 10 and 18. Consequently, when estimating potential units that
could be built on mixed use parcels, the site inventory assumed that 91 percent of each parcel could be
developed with residential uses, and nine percent would be developed with commercial uses. These
ratios reflect current development patterns in mixed use districts in the city. Furthermore, the midpoint of
allowable residential densities has been used to estimate potential capacity. This approach takes into
consideration the fact that some of the land on each site would be needed for site improvements, such as
parking and drainage.
     •   Site 7 is approximately two acres and can support about 96 units. The four parcels include two
         vacant buildings and two active businesses. There are multiple property owners. The I/AV Ratio
         is 43 percent. This site is adjacent to the Great Mall Light Rail Station. Current land uses are not
         the highest and best uses, given the site’s proximity to transit. (Photo provided.)
     •   Site 8 consists of a single parcel that is almost five gross acres. It can support over 250 units. It
         is currently occupied by a low-density industrial building and a large surface parking lot. The
         I/AV Ratio is less than one percent. It is adjacent to three current residential projects (Milpitas
         Station, Piper Towers, and Citation) and to Light Rail and the future BART Station.
     •   Site 9 consists of four parcels, is almost 13 gross acres and can support over 400 residential
         units. Current land uses include older industrial buildings with surface parking lots. The same
         company owns all four parcels. Buildings in this complex are vacant and available for lease. The
         I/AV Ratio is 39 percent. This is an excellent site, located near current sites under development
         in the Transit Area.
     •   Site 10 is also large, comprising over four gross acres that could support over 200 housing units.
         It consists of two parcels, of which one is vacant, and the remaining parcel has a small building.
         The I/AV Ratio is three percent. This site is adjacent to the Montague/Capitol Light Rail Station
         and the proposed BART Station. This site is a good location for a transit oriented development.
     •   Site 11 consists of two parcels, is over five gross acres and could support almost 300 housing
         units. The smaller of the two parcels is vacant. The developed lot has a vacant building on it.
49
   The exception is Site 14 – a 4.25 acre parcel with a capacity for over 200 units. Only one of the two parcels at
Site 14 has been identified as an Opportunity Site.
                                                                                                                7-160

  The I/AV Ratio is 50 percent. This site is also adjacent to the Montague/Capitol Light Rail Station
  and the proposed BART Station. This site is a good location for a transit oriented development.
• Site 13 is one large parcel consisting of almost nine gross acres with a vacant building. It could
  support over 470 units. It is adjacent to auto parts and recycling businesses. The I/AV Ratio is
  36 percent. This site is adjacent to Site 18. (Photo provided.)
• Site 14 is over 12 gross acres and can support 365 units under current zoning (R3). One parcel
  is vacant, and the other three have auto related businesses. The buildings are in very poor
  condition. Two of the parcels are under the same ownership. The I/AV Ratio is less than one
  percent. (Photo provided.)
                                                                                                 7-161
