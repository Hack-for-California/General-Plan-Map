ty’s long-term vision and sets forth goals, policies and programs to manage
growth, direct land use decision making, and preserve the environment
and character of the community. The State of California requires every city
and county to have a general plan to guide future development, conserve
resources, and provide for public welfare and safety. Local ordinances and
other plans must be generally consistent with the general plan and appli-
cable policies and programs.
This comprehensive update of the City of Novato 1996 General Plan
provides goals and policies that reflect present-day community values and
priorities and compliance with current state laws and local ordinances.
1.2 EVOLUTION OF THE CITY
Originally the hunting grounds of the Coast Miwok who occupied a village
at Olompali from approximately 6000 B.C, Novato was first settled in 1839
when the Mexican government gave Fernando Feliz the 8,870-acre Novato
land grant. Feliz reportedly constructed an adobe near the location of later
settler Francis De Long’s home, off of what is now Novato Boulevard.
During the latter half of the 19th century, extensive fruit orchards began
emerging along the banks of Novato Creek of the Rancho de Novato land
grant through the partnership of Francis De Long and Joseph Sweetser.
In the ensuing decades, settlers arrived in Novato, increasing the demand
for services and utilities. The first post office was established in 1856, and

chapter 1                          INTRODUCTION
                                          a one-room school and church were built at the corner of DeLong and
                                          Redwood in 1859. The Northwestern Pacific Railroad came to Novato in
                                          1879, spurring the town’s growth and shifting development from Novato
                                          Creek to the area surrounding the new railroad depot.
                                          In 1888, De Long subdivided his 6,000 acres into lots and parcels. The new
                                          town was built along the railroad tracks, and it soon became the business
                                          and distribution center of the surrounding agricultural areas. By the end of
                                          the nineteenth century, the town had a well-developed downtown complete
                                          with hotels, saloons, and restaurants. Residential development also concen-
                                          trated around the railroad and Grant Avenue.
                                          By 1911, an electric sub-station was built, followed quickly thereafter by
                                          telephone, telegraph and water lines. The 1920s saw the continued devel-
                                          opment of Novato; the Sanitary District was formed and sidewalks were
                                          paved. However, the Great Depression brought a halt to Novato’s economic

                                          the Depression, Marin County worked with several Novato businessmen and
                                          landowners to acquire over 900 acres along Novato’s bay shore, which the
                                          County then sold to the federal government for $1. The result of this effort—
                                          the construction of Hamilton Field in 1932—brought an abundance of new
                                          jobs to Novato. Officers’ quarters were built as Hamilton Field expanded
                                          into a full-fledged Army Air Corps base. During World War II, Hamilton was
                                          an important West Coast air training facility. In addition, the Air Transport
                                          Command flew planes, people, and equipment to Pacific War zones from
                                          Hamilton. In 1947, the U.S. Air Force was created as a separate branch of
                                          the Armed Forces and Hamilton Field became Hamilton Air Force Base.
                                          Quartermaster’s Construction Officer Captain Howard B. Nurse designed
825 Grant Avenue, circa 1917.             the layout of Hamilton Field to reflect the Spanish Revival style then popular
                                          in California. Many of the buildings reflect this style and the layout incorpo-
                                          rated many natural features such as knolls, hills and oak groves. At the time,
                                          the architecture and layout of the base was unlike any other Army base in
                                          the nation.
                                          Novato was incorporated in 1960, and residential development in the
                                          1960s and 1970s spread outward along Novato Boulevard, as the City’s
                                          population ballooned from about 17,900 in 1960 to nearly 44,000 by
                                          1980. Since its incorporation, perhaps the one development that had the
                                          most substantial impact on the City was the construction of Highway 101,
                                          which was completed in 1974. The new highway bypassed the City center,
                                          leaving the vestiges of the old Redwood Highway behind in the guise of
Grant Avenue in the 1950s.                Redwood Boulevard. In that same year, the Hamilton Air Force Base was
                                          closed, transferred to the United States Army and other federal entities, and
                                          renamed Hamilton Army Air Field.
                                          Today, Novato encompasses nearly 28 square miles. Existing land use in
                                          Novato is predominately residential in the valley areas west of Highway
                                          101 and in neighborhoods east of the freeway. Most units are single family
                                          detached homes on lots under one acre in size. In the last decade, the
                                          re-use of the Hamilton Army Airfield added over 2,100 new homes to
                                          Novato. It is unlikely that Novato will see redevelopment of that size and
                                          scope again.

chapter 1 INTRODUCTION
              Commercial uses are concentrated downtown along Grant Avenue, along
              Redwood Boulevard, in pockets along Highway 101, and in various small
              clusters and convenience centers. The Vintage Oaks Shopping Center,
              located east of the freeway and south of the Rowland Boulevard inter-
              change, has been serving the region since 1991.
              Offices are located along the freeway, in and around Downtown, near the
              Novato Community Hospital, along Novato, South Novato and Redwood
              Boulevards, and within the industrial parks. Novato Industrial Park contains
              the bulk of the City’s warehousing, distribution, and manufacturing uses.
              Several industrial operations remain near the Downtown, between the rail-
              road and Redwood Boulevard.
              A network of open space surrounds the City. The Loma Verde, Pacheco
              Valley, and Ignacio Valley preserves bound the City on the south and the
              Indian Valley and Indian Tree preserves lie to the west. Mt. Burdell and Rush
              Creek open space form the northern edge, and the Petaluma River and
              San Pablo Bay bound the City on the east. Agricultural activities continue
              primarily outside the City limits.
              In 2015, Novato is home to nearly 53,000 people and provides approxi-
              mately 22,500 jobs. With an abundance of natural beauty, a rich history,
              comfortable neighborhoods, a diversified economy, and a promising life
              sciences industry, the City is well-positioned to continue to thrive into the
              21st century.

1.3 NOVATO’S VISION FOR THE YEAR 2035
Novato’s General Plan vision statement was developed by
the community in 2009 as part of the General Plan Update
process. This vision represents the community’s ideal future:
We, the citizens of Novato, love our community: its natural beauty, quaint downtown and small
town character, safe, quiet neighborhoods, excellent schools and parks, and above all, our
friendly, caring people. We envision a sustainable community that fits naturally into the environ-
ment and provides our basic needs so that all can continue to enjoy the benefits of living in this
very special place.
This General Plan Vision has two fundamental purposes: to preserve and enhance those char-
acteristics of our City that we hold dear, and to provide guidance for the future of our City,
based on sustainable principles.
GUIDING PRINCIPLES
We wish to preserve and enhance:
    •	 the open space, hillsides, ridgelines, creeks, wetlands and other natural features that give
       our City its scenic beauty and define our borders;
    •	 the small town character of our downtown and our historical heritage;
    •	 the safe, quiet and individual character of our distinct neighborhoods, where our residents
       can raise their families and send their children to excellent schools;
    •	 the many small businesses throughout our City that provide our residents with essential
       goods, services and jobs; and
    •	 the financial integrity of our City government so that it may continue to serve the civic
       needs of all of our residents.
As we look to the future, we wish to encourage and promote:
    •	 sustainable development that complements the natural and built environment;
    •	 a variety of housing types dispersed throughout the community, portions of which are
       affordable, for our commercial workforce, public employees, seniors, and those with
       special needs;
    •	 creation of public gathering places, parks, recreational facilities and community gardens
       that provide a sense of community, and allow enjoyment of our natural amenities;
    •	 creation of venues to enrich the cultural and performing arts;
    •	 commercial development that sustains our tax base to meet the needs of our residents
       and supports quality public services;
    •	 establishment of diverse interconnected modes of local transportation, including bicycle
       and pedestrian paths and trails, shuttles, buses, and paratransit that will facilitate mobility;
       and
    •	 improvements to major transportation corridors that are sensitive to the scenic beauty of
       our community.
Our vision is to maintain what we love about our City while providing for a future that
is better than the present.

              Novato’s 1996 General Plan–the fourth such plan since the City’s incorpo-
              ration in 1960 –positioned it for much of the change and improvement that
              has occurred over the past 20 years. At the time of its adoption, the 1996
              General Plan was considered one of the strongest environmental plans
              in the State of California. A comprehensive update of the City’s Municipal
              Code integrated many of the environmental policies and programs of the
              1996 Plan, including hillside, ridgeline, waterway, riparian, bayland and
              wetland protection and restoration.
              The built environment has changed dramatically since 1996. The reuse of
              the Hamilton Army Air Field, which closed in 1988 and left many shuttered
              homes in its wake, added over 2,100 new homes to Novato on the east
              and west side of Highway 101. Several of the historic Spanish Revival style
              buildings were restored and converted into community facilities and senior
              housing, and old aircraft hangars were converted to commercial uses. The
              Hamilton Marketplace was built and the Pacheco Plaza shopping center
              was renovated to service the influx of new residents. Redevelopment also
              brought new open space lands and trails to southern Novato, as well as a
              2,600-acre wetland restoration project that will return a portion of the vast
              tracts of San Francisco Bay marshland lost to development over the past
              century and provide critical habitat for plants, wildlife and waterfowl.
              Novato’s Downtown has been the historic heart of Novato since the railroad
              first came to the City in 1879. A major goal of the 1996 Plan was to revi-
              talize the Downtown, and significant improvements have been made. These
              include a tree canopy on Grant Avenue, improved sidewalks and signage,
              public art, a restored City Hall, a new City administrative office building
              and civic green, and a new gymnastics/recreation center. Several new
              mixed use and commercial buildings have been built, including the Whole
              Foods/Millworks development, the Umpqua Bank building at the corner
              of Redwood Boulevard and Grant Avenue, the Woodside Office Center at
              the corner of Redwood Boulevard and De Long Avenue, Tresch Galleria,
              and 7370 Redwood Boulevard. Today, the Downtown provides expanded
              restaurant and shopping choices for residents and visitors, as well as
              a venue for the farmer’s market in the summer and community events
              throughout the year.
              Several office buildings have been built in the past 20 years to provide new
              employment opportunities for Novato residents. Most of this growth has
              been concentrated in northern Novato where one of two new commuter
              rail stops is under construction. The Fireman’s Fund campus and the Buck
              Institute for Research on Aging anchor the north Redwood Boulevard’s
              commercial space market, where over 1,000,000 square feet in office and
              research facilities currently exist. Several large, vacant parcels provide the
              opportunity for additional growth.
              Following adoption of the 1996 Plan, the City enacted many implementing
              ordinances and plans, including the Downtown Specific Plan and the
              Climate Action Plan, which have been folded into this updated General
              Plan. The Bicycle and Pedestrian Master Plan continues to guide the

1.5 THE 2035 GENERAL PLAN
UPDATE PROCESS
The General Plan Update process began in 2008 with formation of a
General Plan Steering Committee, development of the City’ vision state-
ment, production of an Existing Conditions Report, and some early
community workshops on land use planning for North Redwood Boulevard.
The Steering Committee hosted a community visioning workshop in July
2009 and two community workshops for the North Redwood Boulevard
Planning Study in March and May 2009.
Following this initial phase, the City created a work program in 2013 to finish
the update process. The original Existing Conditions Report was updated.
Building on the successful 1996 Plan, the City led a comprehensive
review of the existing policies and programs to determine what had been
completed, what was no longer needed or relevant, and what should be
carried over or modified for the 2035 Plan. Beginning in September 2014,
the City’s commissions and committees reviewed existing General Plan
policies and programs related to their area of expertise, considered public
input, and provided recommendations. These commissions and commit-
tees included: the Bicycle/ Pedestrian Advisory Committee; the Recreation,
Cultural and Community Services Commission; the Economic Development
Advisory Commission; the Design Review Commission; and the Planning
Commission. A subcommittee of Marin Conservation League provided feed-
back on policies and programs related to the environment. In February and
March of 2015, the City Council discussed these evaluations, took public
testimony, and provided final direction to staff on policies and programs to
incorporate into the draft General Plan.

                                           Concurrently, the City developed eleven “white papers” on key topic areas
                                           in order to resolve important policy issues prior to drafting the Plan. These
                                           covered a broad range of subjects, including:
                                               •	 Bel Marin Keys Industrial Parks
                                               •	 Urban Growth Boundary
                                               •	 Junior Second Units
                                               •	 Water Availability and Conservation
                                               •	 Hillside and Ridgeline Protection
                                               •	 Complete Streets
                                               •	 Climate Change Action Plan
                                               •	 Sea Level Rise and Adaptation
                                               •	 Healthy Eating, Active Living
                                               •	 Downtown Specific Plan
                                               •	 Downtown Parking
                                           The City’s committees and commissions described above also reviewed white
                                           papers and provided recommendations to the City Council. The City Council
                                           discussed the white papers, took public testimony, and provided direction to
                                           staff on policies and programs to include in the draft General Plan.
                                           The City also held several community workshops on “focus areas” that are
                                           likely to change over the next 20 years and could benefit from careful planning.
                                           The North Redwood Boulevard Corridor planning workshops addressed
                                           the area bounded by Olive Avenue to the south and San Marin Drive to
                                           the north. The community’s ultimate vision for the area includes a vibrant,
                                           pedestrian-oriented retail development with gathering places, restaurants
                                           and entertainment in place of the existing commercial and industrial uses.
                                           The City held two workshops on land use options and design character in
                                           September 2014 and two workshops on streetscape design in May and
                                           June 2014.
Community members participated in a series
of workshops designed to develop policy    North of San Marin Drive, the community’s vision for the North, North

                                           commuter rail station. The City held two workshops on land use alternatives
                                           and circulation issues in June 2014.
                                           The third focus area concerns the Northwest Quadrant Neighborhood,
                                           one of the historic neighborhoods of Downtown Novato. The communi-
                                           ty’s vision for the area is to increase reinvestment and revitalization of the
                                           neighborhood through the development of carefully designed housing types,
                                           including single family and small-scale multi-family housing that comple-

                                           March 2015 to explore community concerns and identify ways to revitalize

printed materials (posters, flyers and door hangers), and Spanish translation      Evaluation

1.6 GENERAL PLAN THEMES
Much has changed in 20 years, and as the City looks forward to the next
two decades, two themes emerge as guiding principles for the 2035 General
Plan and underpin the goals, policies and programs of several chapters.

Marin County is considered the healthiest county in California, with low rates
of adult smoking and obesity and high marks on a range of other health
indicators. Novato residents, too, generally enjoy good health and access
                                                                                              +
to healthy foods, exercise opportunities and health care. However, there
are opportunities for improvement. Novato has some of the highest rates           Community
of obesity and lowest rates of physical activity in Marin County. The 2035          Outreach
General Plan contains policies and programs designed to reverse these
trends. These policies and programs are identified with a heart.                 Environmental

1.7 GENERAL PLAN ORGANIZATION
The General Plan is organized into six chapters:
  1.	 Introduction provides background information on Novato and the
        General Plan.
  2.	 Great Places contains sections on land use, community character
        and housing.
  3.	 Environmental Legacy covers natural communities and ecological
        resources, open space and scenic resources, agricultural land, water
        and air quality, mineral resources, and climate change.
  4.	 Living Well covers parks, recreational and cultural facilities and
        programs, healthy eating and active living, and noise.
  5.	 Economic Vitality addresses the economic needs of the City.
  6.	 City That Works contains sections on mobility, public safety, public
        facilities, and governance.
Each chapter describes existing conditions and context for the related topic
areas, followed by goals, policies and programs to guide the City’s manage-
ment and development over the next 20 years. State law requires a General
Plan to cover seven topics, also known as “elements.” Table IN-1 shows the
relationship of the General Plan chapters to the state-mandated elements.

The General Plan is supported by separately-published documents that
provide background information and environmental analysis. The Existing
Conditions Report contains detailed information for each of the topic areas
covered in the General Plan and was used as a reference document during
the development of the Plan. The Environmental Impact Report determines
the type and extent of environmental impacts that would result from imple-
mentation of the General Plan. It identifies requirements for more detailed
environmental analysis that may be required for specific projects considered
in the future.
1.8 ADMINISTERING THE PLAN
The General Plan is used in a variety of ways. City planning staff uses
the General Plan when evaluating development proposals to ensure that

chapter 1                           INTRODUCTION
                                           projects are consistent with the General Plan land use designations and
                                           applicable goals, policies and programs. The City Council and the City’s
                                           boards and commissions use the document to guide decision making.
                                           Importantly, the General Plan empowers the City, public agencies that work
                                           with the City, and private developers to invest in and plan for a future in
                                           accordance with the Plan’s goals and policies.
                                           Each chapter of the General Plan contains a series of goals, objectives,
                                           policies and implementation actions. The goals, objectives, policies and
                                           action items provide guidance to the City on how to direct change, manage
                                           growth, and manage resources over the 20-year life of the General Plan. The
                                           following provides a description of each and explains the relationship of each:
                                               •	 A goal is a description of the general desired result related to a
                                                  particular topic or issue that the City seeks to create through the
                                                  implementation of the General Plan.
                                               •	 A policy is a specific statement that guides decision-making as the
                                                  City works to achieve its goals. The General Plan’s policies set out the
                                                  standards that will be used by City staff, the Planning Commission,
                                                  and the City Council in its review of land development projects,
                                                  resource protection activities, infrastructure improvements, and other
                                                  City actions. Policies are on-going and require no specific action on
                                                  behalf of the City.
                                               •	 A program is an action, procedure or technique to be undertaken by
                                                  the City to help achieve a specified goal or implement an adopted policy.
                                           The following words are used to indicate whether a particular policy or
                                           program is mandatory, advisory, or permissive:
                                               •	 “Must” or “shall” means an action the City is required to follow.
                                               •	 “Should” means an action the City is advised to follow.
                                               •	 “May” means an action which is left to the discretion of the City.
                                           The General Plan contains a series of figures and maps depicting existing
                                           and proposed or future conditions of areas within and near Novato. These

maps and diagrams are intended to provide the reader with a general
understanding of the extent of land uses and conditions. Figures are not
intended to be used for development, permitting or investment purposes for
specific parcels. More detailed printed maps may be available at the City of
Novato. The public may also view maps at MarinMap.org.
The General Plan’s programs set forth a work program for the City, guide
capital improvement projects, and prioritize City expenditures. Some actions
call for additional analysis, studies and implementing ordinances. City
staff will annually report to the City Council on the progress of the Plan’s
implementation.
This General Plan update is based on estimates of future growth and devel-
opment. As time passes, certain assumptions made in the General Plan
may no longer be valid due to changing circumstances or new information.
For this reason, the City will review the growth projections at least every
five years and adjust assumptions underpinning the Plan’s policies and
programs accordingly.
The City should periodically review the entire General Plan to determine
whether it still reflects community concerns and goals. The Housing Element
is required to be updated according to a schedule established by the State
Department of Housing and Community Development. The next revision of
the Housing Element is scheduled for 2023.

2.1 PURPOSE OF THE CHAPTER                                                    View of the San Marin neighborhood from Mt.
                                                                              Burdell.
Known for its scenic Marin County location, agricultural roots, historic
Downtown, and family-oriented neighborhoods, Novato seeks to protect
its small-town character through a coordinated approach to growth
management and land use planning. This chapter presents a framework for
governing future decisions about context-appropriate land use and desirable
development patterns to maintain and enhance the character of Novato.
This framework aims to effectively manage growth and provide needed
housing, jobs and services while encouraging the use of quality design and
infill strategies for new development. By drawing from and building upon
the community’s distinct history, neighborhoods, and commercial areas,
the Great Places chapter sets the stage for maintaining an economically,      THE GREAT PLACES

              2.2 COMMUNITY CHARACTER
              Novato, located in north Marin County in the San Francisco Bay Area, is
              a suburban city framed by undeveloped hillsides and the open water of
              San Pablo Bay. The City covers 28 square miles. The City’s borders are
              defined by major geographical features including Mount Burdell to the north,
              Big Rock Ridge to the west, Indian Valley open space to the southwest,
              Pacheco Valle and Loma Verde open space to the south, Bel Marin Keys
              wetlands to the southeast and the bay plains and Petaluma River to the
              northeast. Much of the urbanized area of Novato occupies a flat north-
              west-trending valley that follows Novato Creek, Vineyard Creek, Warner
              Creek and other tributaries flowing southeast from the hills to the Bay. The
              natural features surrounding the City contribute to Novato’s identity and
              form an important image of the City held by both residents and visitors.
              Most of the development in Novato is residential. Single-family one- and
              two-story homes represent the majority of residential development. Some
              multi-family housing is dispersed throughout the City, mainly located along
              arterial and collector streets.
              Downtown, a focal point of the City, is characterized primarily by one and
              two-story buildings with tree-lined streets and pedestrian amenities. New
              development downtown includes Millworks, a mixed use development
              containing Whole Foods Market and 124 residential units, located at the
              east end of Grant Avenue. Additional commercial development includes
              neighborhood shopping centers and large regional retail shopping centers
              along Highway 101.
              Connectivity, or the facilitation of access between areas, contributes to the
              quality of life and character of the City. Highway 101 and State Route 37
              provide regional access to the City. Highway 101, in particular, is a major
              north/south regional transportation corridor and the most dominant feature
              of Novato’s circulation system. Although it is the primary route connecting
              Novato to the region, it is also a barrier to local connectivity, bisecting the
              City and forcing people over, under or onto the freeway, even for short local
              trips.
              The City is also served by a surface street system ranging from wide, busy
              four-lane streets with medians to narrow, winding two-lane streets in the
              hills. A traditional grid street pattern is located Downtown and in older resi-
              dential areas near Downtown; however, the predominant street pattern in
              the City is curvilinear. Novato also has a system of bike lanes, paths and

chapter 2                     GREAT PLACES
routes throughout the City, mostly west of Highway 101, that connect
neighborhoods to schools, parks, shopping centers and Downtown.
The views from Novato to the surrounding open spaces and hills are
extremely important to Novato residents. These views provide physical
orientation and are integral to the City’s character and sense of place, so
preservation of these views is key to maintaining the City’s identity.
NOVATO AREAS
The City can be roughly characterized in eight areas as shown in Figure
GP-1. Each area comprises both residential neighborhoods and commercial
areas. In Novato, shopping centers, parks and schools tend to function as
neighborhood activity centers.
Retail and employment areas are found throughout Novato, including
Downtown Novato, fourteen neighborhood shopping centers, and office
buildings dispersed around the City. Retail, office and industrial uses are
concentrated in three main areas: Vintage Oaks, Bel Marin Keys Industrial
Parks, and the North, North Redwood Boulevard Corridor.
DOWNTOWN AND ENVIRONS
Downtown Novato is the core of the community. Downtown is generally
defined by the railroad tracks to the east and De Long and Diablo Avenues
to the south, and extends west along Grant Avenue to Seventh Avenue and
north along Redwood Boulevard to Olive Avenue (see Figure GP-6).
Downtown Novato contains many buildings that were built more than
100 years ago. Many of the older one- and two-story buildings were built
between about 1890 and 1930 as banks, hardware stores, blacksmith
shops, grocers and saloons to serve hard-working residents. The City’s only
listed national historic landmark, the Stephen Porcella House and Fashion    The City’s only listed national historic land-
Shop, is located at 800 Grant Avenue and is currently occupied by Dr.        mark, the Stephen Porcella House and
                                                                             Fashion Shop, is currently occupied by Dr.
Insomniac’s coffee shop. The presence of the Dairymen’s Milling Company      Insomniac’s popular coffee shop.
also serves as a reminder of Novato’s agricultural roots.
However, as residential development moved to outlying areas and the
orientation of Highway 101 was changed to bypass downtown, the
economic and cultural importance of Downtown diminished, leaving aging
buildings and vacant lots, particularly in the blocks north of Grant Avenue
and east of Redwood Boulevard. Today, there is renewed investment in
Downtown as evident in the Grant Avenue streetscape improvements and
the Whole Foods Market mixed-use development project. Facades have
been restored, particularly along Grant Avenue. First-floor windows, bays,
awnings and architectural details create visual appeal for shoppers, while
flourishing planters, traditional lampposts, and benches make the side-
walks feel attractive and safe to pedestrians. Ground-floor uses along Grant
Avenue are generally restricted to retail, restaurants, entertainment and
personal service uses in order to maintain the area as a pedestrian-oriented
shopping and dining destination.

Adjacent to the Downtown commercial core are two subareas: the
Northwest Quadrant and the Redwood Boulevard corridor. These three
areas are depicted as Area 4 in Figure GP-1.
The Northwest Quadrant includes the residential neighborhood north of
Grant Avenue and west of Redwood Boulevard. Lots here tend to be small,
with homes close together. Single-family homes are intermixed with one-and
two-story apartment buildings. Many front yards are landscaped and/or
screened from the street by picket fences, wood fences, or wrought iron
fences. Some streets, such as Third Street, are dominated by two-story
apartment buildings dating back to the 1960s and 1970s that are oriented
perpendicular to the street and have minimal architectural detailing. Those
sites with apartment buildings tend to have less vegetation and more paved
area to allow for parking. Streets are highly connected in a grid pattern, but
are relatively narrow and typically have cars parked along both sides.
Redwood Boulevard north of De Long Avenue to San Marin Drive is a major
corridor cutting through Downtown and linking it with major employment
centers at Fireman’s Fund and the Buck Institute to the north and newer
commercial and residential areas to the south. Due to its 175-foot-wide
right-of-way, Redwood Boulevard forms a barrier between the east and
west ends of Grant Avenue. It also disrupts the character of Downtown,
with blocks to the east of the boulevard containing a more traditional mix of
historic shops, offices, and older homes, while the west side of Redwood
Boulevard is lined with contemporary gas stations, service shops and
equipment rental shops with modern, utilitarian designs. A new residential
subdivision west of Redwood Boulevard, known as Atherton Ranch, was
approved by the City in 2000 for attached, and detached residential units.
NORTH
The North area generally extends west from Highway 101 to the eastern
city limit and north of Novato Boulevard to the edge of the Mt. Burdell Open
Space Preserve. Activity centers in the area include San Marin High School,
San Ramon Elementary School, San Marin Plaza shopping center, Pioneer
Memorial Park, Miwok Park, O’Hair Park and Rolling Hills Club. Major envi-
ronmental elements in the area include Novato Creek and Simmons Creek.
Most of the residential development here resulted from the 1961 San Marin
Master Plan. Homes in the area are set back from the street with lawns
in the front. Homes located along major arterials, like Novato Boulevard,
are typically oriented away from the street, facing the interior of the neigh-
borhood, contributing to a feeling of inclusion for neighbors, but exclusion
for those passing through on the busy street. Connectivity between
subdivisions is limited due to the curvilinear street pattern and numerous
cul-de-sacs.
The North area includes the North, North Redwood Boulevard Corridor,
which extends north of San Marin Drive to the City’s northerly boundary
with Olompali State Park. The-mile long corridor contains most of the City’s
remaining vacant commercially-zoned land as well as the new SMART rail
station located just north of San Marin Drive.

                                             The centerpiece of development in the area on the eastern slope of Mount
                                             Burdell is the world-renowned Buck Institute for Research on Aging.
                                             Designed by the famous architect I.M. Pei, the buildings serve as a prom-
                                             inent landmark north of the city and west of Highway 101. This Institute’s
                                             campus includes a complex of three to four-story buildings with smooth,
                                             light-colored stone exteriors dotted with regularly-spaced windows and
                                             capped by jutting angular sky windows.
                                             At the southern end of the corridor, along San Marin Drive, is the 711,000
                                             square-foot office complex known by its principal former tenant, Fireman’s
                                             Fund Insurance. The Fireman’s Fund office campus consists of three four-
                                             story buildings oriented around a man-made pond. The exteriors of the
                                             buildings, built in the early 1980s, are angular and geometric, wrapped by
                                             horizontal bands of alternating glass and concrete.
                                             At the north end of the corridor is the iconic Birkenstock warehouse,

                                             Five vacant parcels along the corridor, comprising about 70 acres, are
                                             zoned for business and professional office use. Coupled with the expansion

                                             play a larger role in Novato’s economy.

                                             denser than development in the south. Homes and lots in the south of the

street pattern is dominated by cul-de-sacs, making Ignacio Boulevard and
Alameda Del Prado essentially the only connections between this area and
the rest of Novato. Activity centers of the area include the College of Marin
Indian Valley Campus, Enfrente Road Fire Station, Loma Verde Elementary
School, Josef Hoog Neighborhood Park, Pacheco Plaza shopping center
and the Marin Country Club. Subareas within the Southwest area include
Ignacio, Country Club, Pointe Marin and Pacheco Valle.
The majority of the Southwest area consists of one- and two-story single
family homes. Most houses have lawns in the front and backyards with
ornamental shrubbery and trees. Some two- and three-story apartment
buildings are located along Ignacio Boulevard near Pacheco Plaza; these
are simple, rectilinear buildings with flat facades, flat roofs and little detailing,
but their appearance is softened by mature trees and patios. Along Hector
Lane and Alameda del Prado, the apartment buildings are articulated into
distinct units with sloped roofs and are screened from the roadway by tall
trees and white picket fences.
CENTRAL
The Central area is the residential area that wraps around Downtown. It is
defined by San Marin Drive to the north, Highway 101 to the east, Arroyo
Avichi Creek and the city limit to the south and McClay Road and Simmons
Lane to the west. The area is noted by its open space, including the
surrounding hillsides and the riparian corridors along Novato and Warner
Creeks. There are views of the surrounding hills in the northwest, southwest
and east of the area. Major activity centers of the area include the Novato
Library and surrounding Lee Gerner Park, Lu Sutton Elementary School, Hill
Middle School, Margaret Todd Senior Center and Marion and Stafford Grove
Parks, as well as the Downtown Novato shopping center and Novato Fair
shopping center. Novato Boulevard tends to funnel traffic past this area and
Downtown, creating a barrier.
South of Novato Boulevard, housing types are mixed and include detached
single family homes, apartment buildings and condominiums. The majority
of the area is made up of single-family homes laid out on grid-like block
patterns with typically suburban patterns of big front yards and ample street
trees on most streets. Numerous cul-de-sacs cut off circulation to major
streets, resulting in courts that feel private.
The northern part of the Central area, north of Novato Boulevard and north-           The Central area’s new Canyon Green neigh-

west towards the slopes of Mt. Burdell, the development pattern resembles
typical suburban subdivisions with curved streets and cul-de-sacs. Most
homes are very similar in size, color, shape and architecture.

from Vintage Way. The buildings are single-story, but have the height of
standard two- or three-story buildings. Their height, in combination with
very wide facades, gives them a bulky appearance, which is alleviated by
breaking individual storefronts into bays with pitched roofs, and providing
a covered walkway along the front of the building. Some of the buildings
feature red paint and white trim to suggest a barn-like theme, a nod to
Novato’s agricultural history. The shopping center faces Highway 101, with
each building turning its back to the Bay wetlands immediately to the east
across the Northwestern Pacific Railroad tracks.
To the north of the Shopping Center, office buildings are scattered along
either side of the wide, curving Rowland Way. These are modern, three- to
four-story buildings with smooth facades of concrete and glass. Pedestrian
access in this area is challenging since each building is separated by an
expansive parking lot and the 5-lane width of Rowland Way.
HAMILTON AND BEL MARIN KEYS
Redevelopment of the former Hamilton Army Airfield in the southeast
section of Novato created the larger Hamilton neighborhood. This area is
to the east of Highway 101, with Nave Drive, which parallels the freeway,
as one of the main streets into this neighborhood. Bolling Circle, Hamilton
Parkway, State Access Road, and Main Gate Road provide additional
entry into Hamilton. Its more comprehensive development has allowed
a range of residential (whether it’s the new single family, multi-family, or
existing US Coast guard housing), commercial (Hamilton Marketplace),
educational (Hamilton School), recreational (Skate Park), open space (trails
and a wetlands restoration project) and religious uses within this section
of the city. Many businesses have located in the former Hangar buildings,
ranging from small pharmaceutical and entertainment software businesses,
to active hangars used by the US Coast Guard, and the Marin Community
Foundation, a large philanthropic non-profit organization. A new Sonoma
Marin Area Rail Transit (SMART) station will be in Hamilton and may be
accessed from Main Gate Road.
The rich architectural heritage is what unifies and best identifies Hamilton.
From the classic Spanish architecture of the Administration Building to the
Base Office Quarters and Hospital buildings, the distinctive architecture
resonates throughout Hamilton. These architectural themes have been           Historic buildings in Hamilton reflect the

the character of Hamilton.
The United States Coast Guard’s Pacific Strike Team (PST) is located in
Hamilton. The PST, one of three special teams that make up the National
Strike Force, is comprised of highly trained Coast Guard professionals
who maintain and rapidly deploy with specialized equipment and incident
management skills to any place or hazard. The PST is an expert authority
in the preparation and response to oil discharges, hazardous substance
releases, weapons of mass destruction events, and other emergencies.
Hamilton is adjacent to the Bel Marin Keys Industrial Parks, a 200-acre
area developed in the 1980s containing a mix of light industrial, commercial
and office uses. The largest tenant is BioMarin, which has approximately

                                               of the local streets in the area terminate in cul-de-sacs. Buildings are mostly

                                               windows and doors. Most of the buildings have a relatively plain, utilitarian
                                               design and each generally has its own parking lot. Some buildings are close

                                               CULTURAL RESOURCES
                                               The term cultural resources applies to a variety of natural and human
                                               made items, including paleontological resources (the fossilized remains of
                                               plants and animals), traditional cultural properties (sites with value to Native
                                               American communities), and archaeological sites and buildings with historic
                                               or architectural significance.
                                               Surveys have found and recorded a total of 102 potential cultural resources,
                                               including both historic and prehistoric sites. These are listed in Tables B-1
                                               through B-5 in Appendix B. Based on the percent of land surveyed, and the
                                               number of resources found during those surveys, there is potential for many
                                               other sites within Novato’s jurisdiction that have not yet been discovered.

                                               There are 17 potential historic period resources in Novato. Historic period
                                               resources are defined as sites, buildings or structures that date to post-con-

2.3 DEMOGRAPHICS AND
GROWTH PROJECTIONS
Home to about 52,500 residents and 2,500 businesses, Novato is a
suburban city with a robust economy that has managed to retain its rural
character through the conservation of its open space and historic Old Town.
Encompassing about 28 square miles, the City has one of the lowest popu-
lation densities among cities and towns in Marin County, second only to the
town of Ross.
Incorporated in 1960, the City experienced a rapid rise in population during
its first two decades, increasing from about 17,900 residents to 43,900
residents by 1980. The City then settled into a slower rate of growth,
adding just over 3,700 residents by 2000. The City grew by approximately
4,300 residents between 2000 and 2010, primarily due to the re-use of the
Hamilton Air Force Base, which added over 2,000 new homes to Novato as
well as new commercial buildings. Past and forecasted population is shown
in Figure GP-2.

The City is not expected to grow much over the next twenty years,
adding about 3,200 residents between 2015 and 2035 according to the
Association for Bay Area Governments (ABAG) latest forecasts. ABAG is a
regional planning agency comprising the counties, cities and towns of the
nine-county San Francisco Bay Area. ABAG uses the 2010 US Census
count as a starting point for population and the number of households, and
then projects growth in five-year increments as shown in Table GP-1. For
employment statistics, ABAG draws on a number of sources, including the
US Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, US Department of
Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, and California Department of Finance.

chapter 2 GREAT PLACES
              ABAG’s forecasts have been controversial in the past, particularly because
              they are used in developing the Regional Housing Needs Assessment,
              which identifies the number of housing units, by income level, for which
              a city must plan over an eight-year period. ABAG updates its projections
              about every two years taking into account changes in labor force demand,
              age and ethnicity. Economic cycles are impossible to predict, but they
              have had a significant impact on the Bay Area’s technology sector-driven
              economy since the dot-com bubble of the early 2000s. Projections are also
              informed by local land use, growth policies and expected infrastructure
              investments.

              ABAG projects jobs will grow faster than population in Novato, at a 10
              percent job growth rate compared to a 6 percent population growth rate.
              The number of employed residents is expected to grow at a slower rate,
              which means some of the new jobs will necessarily be filled by in-bound
              commuters. Historic and forecast job growth is shown in Figure GP-3.

              While Novato’s population is not expected to grow much, the population
              is aging and the share of seniors is projected to increase over the next
              decades. Figure GP-4 shows that the senior population is forecasted to rise
              from 16 percent in 2010 to 25 percent in 2030 and through 2040.

2.4 LAND USE
Land in Novato is classified according to four broad land use categories:
residential areas; commercial and mixed-use areas; business and indus-
trial areas; and community and natural resource areas. As shown in Table
GP-2, the greatest percentage of land in Novato is designated for commu-
nity and natural resource areas. Open space and conservation land alone
comprise more than 47 percent of the land within the City. The second
largest amount of land use is designated for residential use, encompassing
a little more than 37 percent of Novato’s land area. Commercial, mixed-use,
business and industrial uses comprise only 7 percent of Novato’s land area.

              Within each of the land use categories, specific land use designations
              identify uses and the density and intensity of development allowed in each
              designation. Density is defined by the number of dwelling units per gross
              acre, and intensity is defined by the ratio of building square footage to the
              land area.
              LAND USE CATEGORIES
              Novato has a variety of land use categories, or designations, that are
              applied to residential, commercial, business, industrial, community and
              natural resource areas within the City.
              Residential land use designations are applied to areas appropriate for
              single family, two-family, multi-family, and accessory dwelling housing
              options. The City’s neighborhoods support a range of lifestyles and a broad
              range of household income levels. Densities are generally higher Downtown
              and in neighborhoods close to Highway 101, where there are opportunities
              for mixed use and multi-family housing served by public transit. Densities
              generally decrease moving to the edge of the City, where lower densities
              provide a buffer to the rural areas beyond.
              Commercial land use designations are applied to areas appropriate for
              retail and commercial services. The City’s historic Downtown provides
              shopping, restaurants and services to City residents, employees, and visi-
              tors, while neighborhood shopping centers are intended to primarily serve
              local residents. General commercial areas, including the Vintage Oaks
              Shopping Center, attract customers from a broader region. Many office
              sites are intended to encourage development in campus-like settings that
              will attract employers of Novato residents.
              Business and industrial land uses are important to the community’s
              economic health, serving residents as well as nearby communities. These
              uses are located primarily along Highway 101 and Redwood Boulevard.
              Community and natural resource land use designations apply to a wide
              range of open space, agriculture, parks, and civic uses that serve a diverse
              range of community needs. Natural areas, such as the creeks and hills,
              offer opportunities for preservation and conservation. Public facilities provide
              opportunities for social and community development. Land use planning
              aims to improve these amenities and enhance accessibility for all City
              residents.

                                             Table GP-3 details the 20 land use designations and describes the general
                                             land uses intended for the category, applicable building density and/or
                                             intensity, and compatible zoning district(s). For residential uses, residen-
                                             tial density is shown in dwelling units per gross acre. Maximum residential
                                             density is calculated based on the gross acreage and then rounded down
                                             to the nearest whole number.
                                             In addition to building density, State law requires the General Plan to include
                                             a statement of population density for the various land use categories.
                                             Population density is determined by multiplying the average household
                                             size, as determined by the latest decennial U.S. Census, by the number of
                                             dwelling units in a land use category. For example, the average household
                                             size in Novato was 2.53 persons in 2010. The population density in the Low
                                             Density Residential category is therefore 2.8 to 12.7 persons per acre.
                                             For non-residential designations, building intensity is defined by Floor Area
                                             Ratio (FAR), which is the ratio between the amount of gross floor area and
                                             the gross site area. For example, an FAR of 0.5 would allow one-story
                                             building over half of a site, or a two-story building over one quarter of a site.
                                             The Zoning Ordinance contains detailed descriptions of land uses permitted
                                             in each designation, as well as development standards that implement the
                                             General Plan.

2.5 GROWTH MANAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTIONS
Novato aims to contain development and preserve natural lands and agricultural uses adjacent to the City through
the Urban Growth Boundary. Enacted by the voters of Novato in 1997, the Urban Grown Boundary is intended to
constrain the expansion of development that requires sewer and water utilities into the rural areas surrounding the
incorporated City limits to reduce urban sprawl. The City Council may amend the Urban Growth Boundary and
annex new territory into Novato under certain circumstances described in Policy LU-6. While the Urban Growth
Boundary is set to expire in 2017, Program LU 5a calls for the amendment and extension of the effective date of the
Urban Growth Boundary for another 20 years. The Urban Growth Boundary generally follows the City limit line, as
shown in Figure GP-5. The full text of the current voter approved Urban Growth Boundary, effective until November
4, 2017, is contained within Appendix D.

The Marin Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) and the County of
Marin refer potential development outside the Urban Growth Boundary but
within the City’s Sphere of Influence, as shown in Figure GP-5, to the City
for review and comment.
The Sphere of Influence is a boundary defining the probable future physical
boundaries and service areas of the City as determined by LAFCO. There
are 1,188 acres of unincorporated land within Novato’s Sphere of Influence.

shown in Table GP-4. The build-out estimates are, in most cases, signifi-
cantly higher than actual development in 2015 and the amount that is being
projected by 2035. Due to the speculative nature of buildout capacities and
the extreme unlikelihood that every parcel in the City will be developed to its
maximum zoning potential, the General Plan is shifting to the use of 20-year
development projections for long-range planning. Program GP 3a requires
the City to review the General Plan’s growth assumptions periodically and
adjust assumptions, service levels, infrastructure capacity, and development
impact fees as necessary. If citywide growth is exceeding projections, the
General Plan will be updated at that time.

2.6 HOUSING
State law requires the general plan to contain a “housing element,” a
chapter that addresses the local government’s existing and near-term
future housing needs. The housing element must be updated regularly and
is subject to detailed statutory requirements and mandatory review by the
State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD).
Housing element law requires local governments to plan adequately to
meet their existing and projected housing needs, including their share of
the “regional housing need.” The housing element process begins with
HCD allocating a region’s share of the statewide housing need to the local
Council of Governments based on State Department of Finance population
projections and regional population forecasts used in preparing regional
transportation plans. The Council of Governments for Novato and the
nine-county Bay Area region is the Association of Bay Area Governments
(ABAG). ABAG develops a Regional Housing Need Plan allocating the
region’s share of the statewide need to the cities and counties within the
region. That regional share is then classified according to four income levels:
very low income, low income, moderate income, and above moderate
income.
Local governments are not required to build or finance housing, but they are
required to ensure there are adequate vacant and underutilized sites, appro-
priately zoned, to meet the projected housing need. The process provides
local control over where and what type of development should occur in local
communities while providing the opportunity for the private for-profit and
non-profit sectors to meet market demand.
The City adopted its most recent Housing Element on November 18, 2014,
pursuant to the state-mandated timeline for housing element adoption
for the 2015-2023 planning period. HCD certified the Housing Element
on January 22, 2015. The full text of the Housing Element is contained in
Appendix C.
2.7 GOALS, POLICIES AND PROGRAMS
LAND USE
Goal 1: Manage Growth and Maintain Community
Character.
LU 1: Implementation of Land Use Map. Implement the Land Use
Map (Figure GP-5) and Land Use Designations (Table GP-3) by approving
development and conservation projects consistent with adopted land
use definitions, densities and intensities. Ensure consistency between the
General Plan, Zoning Ordinance and other land use regulations.
     LU 1a: Land Use. Use the Zoning Ordinance to specify uses allowed in
     each zoning district, consistent with Table GP-2.

chapter 2 GREAT PLACES
                   LU 1b: Density and Intensity of Development. Allow development at
                   any density or intensity within the range shown by the Land Use Map
                   (Map GP-1) and Land Use Designations (Table GP-3) provided appli-
                   cable objectives, policies and programs of all chapters of the General
                   Plan are met. Maximum densities/intensities (top of stated ranges) may
                   in some cases be achieved, but there is no guarantee of achieving the
                   maximum density/intensity. Developments on properties designated
                   for multi-family residential should not be allowed below the minimum
                   density of the density range unless there are environmental or compati-
                   bility issues that warrant density reduction.
              LU 2: Growth Management Objectives. The City shall seek to manage
              its growth so that:
                        A.	 The natural environment will be protected to the extent feasible.
                        B.	 The relatively high level of services and infrastructure enjoyed by
                             City residents is maintained or enhanced.
                        C.	 The City’s small town character is retained.
              LU 3: Anticipated Growth. Plan the City’s infrastructure and service levels
              to provide capacity for the total amount of development expected by 2035
              as shown in Table GP-4.
                   LU 3a: Review Growth Assessment. Review the General Plan’s
                   growth assumptions periodically and adjust assumptions, service levels,
                   infrastructure capacity and development impact fees as necessary. If
                   citywide growth is exceeding projections, update the General Plan and
                   evaluate the impacts of the additional growth.
                   LU 3b: Infrastructure and Service Level Planning. Coordinate growth
                   projections and the planning of infrastructure and public services with
                   the water, sanitary, fire protection and school districts.
                   LU 3c: Impacts of New Development on Infrastructure and
                   Services. Analyze project impacts on infrastructure capacity and
                   services as part of CEQA review, and require design and mitigation
                   measures in consultation with provider agencies. If CEQA review or
                   other analysis of development projects concludes that a proposed
                   project would result in a significant deterioration of service or would
                   cause available capacity to be exceeded, respond in one or more of the
                   following ways as permitted by state law:
                      a. Require project redesign in order to prevent service from deterio-
                          rating or capacities being exceeded, provided that all economic
                          use of the property is not prevented;
                      b. Condition the project on developer funding of improvements
                          needed to maintain services and/or provide additional infrastruc-
                          ture capacity;
                      c. The project may be approved if it can be found that the project will
                          do one or more of the following:
                          i. generate substantial overriding public benefits,

            iii. benefit the public health, safety, and general welfare of the
                  community.
        d. Deny the project.
LU 4: Development to Pay Fair Share. Require new development to
pay its fair share of infrastructure improvements and public service costs to
maintain infrastructure capacity and service levels in the City, to the extent
allowed by law and except as provided by other policies and programs in
the Plan.
     LU 4a: Development Impact Fees. Establish and periodically review
     public facilities impact fees.
     LU 4b: Funding Fee Study. Consider establishing a surcharge on
     building permit fees to fund the periodic review of impact fees.
LU 5: Urban Growth Boundary. An Urban Growth Boundary (UGB) as
shown on the Land Use Map (Figure GP 6) was approved by the citizens of
Novato in 1987 and remains in effect until November 4, 2017. The full text
of the voter-approved Urban Growth Boundary provisions are contained in
Appendix D.
	    LU 5a: UGB Extension. On or before the expiration of the voter
     approved Urban Growth Boundary, the City Council will consider
     extending the term of the Urban Growth Boundary to improve the City’s
     ability to provide municipal services and discourage urban sprawl and
     the provision of urban services to property outside the City limits.
     LU 5b: Amendments to the UGB. Consider amendments to the poli-
     cies of the UGB to better define permissible health and safety based
     exceptions and to encourage better coordination between the City,
     Marin LAFCO (Local Agency Formation Commission) and the Novato
     Sanitary District to support the implementation of the UGB.
LU 6: Annexations. Consistent with the application of state law, consider
support of annexations that meet the following guidelines:
     a. Areas to be annexed will be able to be served by existing City facili-
     ties and by facilities provided by other agencies, or by environmentally    The Urban Growth Boundary preserves open

     These include transportation, water supply, fire, wastewater treatment,
     schools, and other public services and facilities.
     b. Proposed annexations are or will be contiguous to existing developed
     areas. Annexation and development that “leapfrogs” over vacant and
     undeveloped land will not be supported.
     c. Annexation of an area should not have either short-term or long-term
     negative impacts on the City’s fiscal condition.

              DOWNTOWN
              VISION
              Downtown is the charming, civic, and iconic heart of
              Novato, brimming with boutiques, restaurants and
              gathering places that entice residents and visitors
              to shop, dine, and connect. The harmonious blend
              of carefully-preserved historic buildings and new
              construction makes our Downtown an attractive
              location for business and investment, as well as
              for arts, cultural, and community events. Close to
              residential neighborhoods, Downtown Novato is
              easily navigable and pedestrian and bike-friendly.
              LU 12: Downtown’s Role. Maintain and enhance the Downtown as the
              community’s center for commercial, cultural, social, entertainment and civic
              functions. Retain its small-town ambience and pedestrian character while
              fostering its economic vitality.

chapter 2                     GREAT PLACES
LU 13: Retail Environment. Encourage retail uses on the ground floor to
create a continuous and vibrant streetscape for pedestrians, particularly
along Grant Avenue and Redwood Boulevard. New buildings should be
oriented towards the sidewalk with large display windows and highlighted
pedestrian entries. Continue to limit ground floor uses along portions of
Grant Avenue and Redwood Boulevard to create a continuous pedestri-
an-oriented experience with retail shops, personal services, restaurants and
entertainment venues.
      LU 13a: Zoning Regulations. Consider an update to ground floor use
      regulations to include a provision for uses or buildings that warrant an
      exception.
LU 14: Entertainment and Cultural Facilities. Encourage cultural
facilities, such as theaters, museums and galleries to stimulate nightlife.
Encourage outdoor cafes.
LU 15: Civic Center. Retain government functions Downtown in a compact
civic center. Consider expansion of the City Green into a more usable
space, and improvement of Sherman Avenue to function on occasion as a
continuation of civic space.
LU 16: Automobile-Intensive Uses. Discourage the location of new
automobile-intensive uses such as gas stations, oil changers, car washes,
drive-throughs and mini-marts Downtown.
LU 17: Gathering Places. The Downtown should be comfortable and
festive for a wide variety of public gatherings. New development should
attempt to incorporate outdoor dining or small seating areas, alcoves and
other inviting public spaces. The City should provide a larger community
green, either by expanding the existing City Green in the Civic Center,
possibly utilizing a portion of the very wide North Redwood Boulevard right-
of-way, or other appropriate locations.
LU 18: Pedestrian Amenities. Install pedestrian-oriented street improve-
ments, particularly along Grant Avenue, including benches, planters,
drinking fountains and large canopy street trees. Require where appropriate
that new development provide public art, particularly interactive pieces, to
lend identity and charm to Downtown.
LU 19: Mixed Use. Allow second and third story residential units above
ground floor commercial space in areas designated with Downtown Core
zoning where appropriate. Attempt to minimize conflicts between residential
and commercial land uses through careful design, acknowledging that the
downtown is a more active and dynamic living environment.
      LU 19a: Rezoning. Rezone and change the General Plan Land Use
      Map for properties along Redwood Boulevard between Vallejo Avenue
      and Pinheiro Circle, as identified as Site 1 in Figure GP-7, from General
      Commercial to Downtown Core.
LU 20: Gateway Treatment. Install gateway design elements at the inter-
sections of Grant/Redwood, DeLong/Redwood, Redwood/Olive, 7th/Grant,
and Sherman/DeLong to highlight the sense of entry into Downtown.

function of Redwood Boulevard through median improvements, wider side-
walks, improved bicycle lanes, and large canopy street trees.
LU 25: Parking. Facilitate the provision of adequate parking, emphasizing a
combination of public and private parking facilities. Parking should generally
be located out of or screened from public view, but convenient to find via
appropriate signage.
LU 26: Railroad Depot. Restore and reuse the former depot building if
feasible. In the interim, improve the site for public parking.
LU 27: Former Mission Lodge site. Development should address the
street frontage and sidewalk with windows and entries, and visibility of
parking should be minimized. Building scale and height should be compat-
ible with its location as a gateway site, but should be considerate of the
adjacent single-family homes. Retain mature trees to the maximum extent
feasible, acknowledging the need for visibility of tenants. Protect the adja-
cent residential neighborhood from potential impacts such as noise from a
potential drive-through and loading/refuse areas, and screen parking and
loading areas. Consider vacating and possible sale of portions of Front
Street for a desired development as appropriate.
LU 28: Scown Lane. Encourage pedestrian improvements such as
connections to Grant Avenue between buildings, and consider making
Scown Lane one-way with a striped or elevated pedestrian walkway and
improved lighting.
LU 29: Nugent Lane. Consider vacation and sale or an encroachment
agreement for the portion of Nugent Lane between Machin and Redwood
to the adjacent property owner to improve dining or retail opportunities.
LU 30: Pedestrian Alleys: Encourage the creation of pedestrian ways or
“paseos” for midblock circulation between Grant Avenue and both Cain and
Scown Lanes and between Scown Lane and Sweetser Avenue in conjunc-
tion with redevelopment.
LU 31: Downtown Business Improvement District. The City, in partner-
ship with the Downtown Novato Business Association, will continue to guide
the management of the Downtown Business Improvement District (DBID) to
encourage economic vitality and community connection in our city center
through promotion, events, and beautification.

              inviting gathering places with restaurants and
              entertainment. New commercial development should
              be pedestrian-oriented with an active street frontage
              and convenient pedestrian and bicycle connections
              to the Downtown and the SMART station. New
              residences are encouraged, both on the remaining
              Atherton Ranch site and on the vacant site east

NORTH, NORTH REDWOOD CORRIDOR
VISION
The North, North Redwood Corridor provides an opportunity
for the City to address its economic development objective
of creating new high-wage jobs through development
and redevelopment of properties located between the
scenic slopes of Mount Burdell and U.S. 101. The corridor
should generally be developed with high-quality office
and research and development uses and supporting uses
such as local-serving retail and recreational uses. New
development should maximize the use of the new SMART
railway station in terms of site design, on and off-site
bicycle and pedestrian access and through innovative
employee trip reduction measures. Consider necessary
circulation improvements to the San Marin/Redwood
Boulevard intersection and freeway ramps to address the
City’s traffic level-of-service standards concurrently with the
consideration of any new development. New development,
in conjunction with the City’s traffic impact fees as available,
shall fund needed traffic improvements commensurate
with their impacts and timing of development.

NORTHWEST QUADRANT NEIGHBORHOOD
VISION
The Northwest Quadrant Neighborhood is an
historic, walkable neighborhood that has the potential
to see increased reinvestment and revitalization
through development of carefully designed housing
types that ensure compatibility with the scale and
diversity of residences (both single-family and small
scale multi-family housing types) while preserving
and enhancing the sense of community.
LU 34: Northwest Quadrant Neighborhood. Consider the following land
use, design and circulation objectives for the bounded area and individual
sites depicted in Figure GP-10 in evaluating development and infrastructure
proposals for the Northwest Quadrant Neighborhood:
Neighborhood Objectives
Slow Down Traffic through the Neighborhood

3.1 PURPOSE OF THE CHAPTER
This chapter presents a framework for governing future decisions about
how Novato will sustain open space and natural resources for today’s
residents, as well as future generations. Natural resources are the lands,
habitat, wildlife, plants and trees, air water, minerals and other resources
that occur naturally in the environment, undisturbed by humanity. These
natural resources and open space lands can provide biodiversity, recreation,
agricultural and managed natural resources production, flood risk reduc-
tion, protection from hazardous conditions, and climate change mitigation
and adaptation. The City recognizes that development of open space lands     THE ENVIRONMENTAL

              3.2 NATURAL COMMUNITIES AND
              ECOLOGICAL RESOURCES
              Novato is in the Central Coast Region of California, which supports a wide
              range of terrestrial and aquatic habitat types. As shown in Figure EL-3, the
              central portion of Novato along Highway 101 corridor is primarily devel-
              oped with urban and suburban uses, occupying the valley floors and lower
              elevations of the surrounding hillsides. These largely developed areas are
              bisected by the remaining natural riparian and marshland habitats along
              major drainages such as Ignacio, Novato and Rush Creeks. The open water
              of San Pablo Bay forms the eastern edge of the Novato area, bordered by
              large expanses of marshland habitat and diked baylands which support
              primarily grasslands that continue to be used for grazing. A mosaic of
              grassland and woodland habitats covers the hillsides that form the northern,
              western, and southern edges of the Novato vicinity.
              Historic land use has altered much of the landscape in the Novato vicinity,
              including the plant communities and wildlife dependent upon them.
              Beginning in the mid-nineteenth century and continuing into the present,
              activities such as livestock grazing, firewood harvesting, clearing and disking
              for agricultural production, road building, and urban and suburban devel-
              opment have markedly altered Novato’s natural communities. Nevertheless,
              the remaining natural communities in the area continue to support a diverse
              assemblage of plant and animal species. Even areas now occupied by

Waterways
The Novato area consists of a number of lakes, streams, and creeks,
including the Petaluma River, Stafford Lake, Novato Creek, Rush Creek
and San Pablo Bay, as shown in Figure EL-1. The Petaluma River begins
20 miles north of the City of Petaluma and borders the eastern edge of
Novato. San Pablo Bay borders the eastern edge of the City. Stafford Lake
is a Novato Creek reservoir located approximately 11 miles upstream of San
Pablo Bay.
Novato Creek originates in the hills to the west of the City and flows east for
about 17 miles before emptying into San Pablo Bay. This creek, along with
its numerous tributaries, including Simmons Creek, Vineyard Creek, Warner
Creek, and Arroyo Avichi Creek, drains a watershed of approximately 44
square miles, part of which is shown in Figure EL-2. Rush Creek flows north
and east from Downtown to the Petaluma River.
Salt/Brackish Water Marshland
Coastal salt marsh and coastal brackish marsh occupy large expanses
of the Novato vicinity along the fringe of San Pablo Bay. They are part
of the important wetland ecosystem that comprises the San Francisco
Bay Estuary system. The San Francisco estuary comprised an estimated
628,500 acres of tidal marsh at the time of European colonization. About
90 percent of this habitat has been filled and developed with urban uses or
converted to other habitats, such as diked wetlands, salt ponds, and agri-
cultural and pasture lands. This conversion has had a significant effect on
the health and functioning of the estuary system as a whole, and magnifies

                                              The marshlands provide essential habitat for numerous special-status plant

                                              Freshwater marsh occurs along the larger creeks and tributary drainages,

Grasslands
Much of the remaining undeveloped portions of the Novato vicinity support
grasslands dominated by non-native grasses and forbs. Grasslands occupy
much of the diked baylands that continue to be used as grazing lands
in the eastern portion of the Novato vicinity, as well as the lower slopes
of Mount Burdell and the rolling hills of eastern Novato. Highly invasive
species, particularly Himalayan blackberry (Rubus discolor), poison hemlock
(Conium maculatum), French broom (Genista monspessulana), Scotch
broom (Cytisus scoparius), and fennel (Foeniculum vulgare), are spreading
into grassland habitat along road margins and edges of developed areas.
These species contribute to the risk of fire through increased fuel loads, and
compromise the wildlife habitat values of areas they occupy.
Woodlands
Oak woodlands and other hardwood woodlands occupy much of the
remaining undeveloped hillsides at Black Point, Deer Island, and the lower
slopes of Mount Burdell and Big Rock Ridge in the Novato vicinity. The
woodlands vary in species composition and structure, from dense tree
cover with a continuous canopy and little understory, to open woodlands
with a lush understory of grassland and shrubs, to a widely spaced savanna
surrounded by grasslands. Most of the woodlands are dominated by several
species of oak and other native tree species, including black oak (Quercus
kelloggii), valley oak (Q. lobata), coast live oak (Q. agrifolia), blue oak (Q.
douglasii), California bay (Umbellularia californica) and madrone (Arbutus
menziesii).
The mature woodlands provide denning, nesting and foraging opportunities
for numerous species of small mammals, reptiles, and birds. Mammals and
reptiles found in the woodlands include: deer mouse, woodrat, stripped
skunk, grey squirrel, western skink, newts, ensatina (a type of salamander),
ring-necked snake, and rubber boa. Larger mammals such as black-tailed

most likely forage throughout the woodlands and open savanna.
Riparian Woodland/Scrub
Riparian woodland and scrub occurs along the larger creeks and tributaries
in the Novato vicinity, including Igancio, Novato, and Rush Creeks. Native
willow (Salix spp.), valley oak, coast live oak, and California bay form the
dominant native tree cover along these riparian corridors. Other tree species
include native California buckeye (Aesculus californica), white alder (Alnus
rhombifolia), box elder (Acer negundo var. californicum), Fremont cotton-
wood (Populus fremontii) and black walnut (Juglans hindsii), as well as a
number of non-native invasive species such as silver wattle (Acacia deal-
bata), black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) and plum (Prunus sp.). Riparian
habitat is relatively scarce because it only forms along watercourses and
lakes, and in California much of this habitat has been lost to agricultural     The endangered California clapper rail is found
uses, urbanization and channelization for flood control.                        along Novato Creek.
Riparian habitat tends to be of high resource value to wildlife, due to the
complex structure of the vegetation, available surface water, and the tran-
sition to other habitat types which border the creek corridors, sometimes
referred to as “edge” habitat. The dense cover of trees and shrubs serves
to shade the creeks, and help keep temperatures cooler during the hot
summer months. Surface water is available for aquatic-dependent organ-
isms, and as a source of drinking water for terrestrial mammals and birds.
Creek channels tend to serve as movement corridors for both terrestrial and
aquatic species.
Chaparral and Coastal Scrub
Northern mixed chaparral and coastal scrub occurs in patches in the south-
west of the Novato vicinity. Most of the stands of chaparral are associated
with shallow soils along the upper slopes of Big Rock Ridge. Scrub and
chaparral habitats provide important protective cover for wildlife, many of
which forage in the surrounding grasslands and woodlands.
Special Status Species
Novato’s diverse natural communities host a number of sensitive ecological
and biological resources, including 14 wildlife and 6 plant species deemed
“special status” species by the State and federal government as shown
in Table EL-1. Special-status species are defined as plants and animals
that are legally protected under the Endangered Species Act, California         The threatened Marin western flax is found on
Endangered Species Act, or other regulations, and species that are consid-      Mt. Burdell. Photo credit: Aaron Arthur
ered sufficiently rare by the scientific community to qualify for such listing.
These special-status species tend to occur in the remaining natural commu-
nities in the Novato vicinity, including the baylands along the fringe of San
Pablo Bay and the open space and undeveloped lands along the slopes of
Mount Burdell. Others are dependent on the creeks, freshwater marshes,
and riparian habitat in Novato and other locations for dispersal and essential
breeding habitat.

                                               The Novato area includes a significant amount of land designated for open
                                               space. In total, there are nearly 6,790 acres of open space within the
                                               Novato city boundary, representing 42 percent of the City’s land area. The
                                               majority of this open space is owned and managed by the Marin County
                                               Open Space District (MCOSD). MCOSD manages these areas for habitat

of separation for developed areas. These natural features establish physical
boundaries for the community that are more recognizable than the jurisdic-
tional boundaries created by the city limit.

Other scenic resources are hillsides, Bay plains and Bay shorelines.
Hillsides, whether open and grassy like southern Mt. Burdell, or heavily
wooded, provide a backdrop for developed areas. Bay plains provide
expansive views to the east and south and are important to maintain
the scenic qualities along Highways 101 and 37. Ridgelines and scenic
resources are shown in Figure EL-6.
3.4 AGRICULTURAL LAND
Agricultural land in the Novato area includes valley areas and bayside plains
that were leveed around the turn of the century. Important agricultural crops
grown in the area include nut crops, vineyards, fruit orchards, and field
crops. Agricultural land can also provide valuable wildlife habitat, including
critical habitat for migrating waterfowl and shorebirds during the winter. The
State Department of Conservation has classified much of the Novato area’s
agricultural land, particularly bayfront land, as Farmland of Local Importance
(i.e., land which is currently in agricultural production, or has the capability
of production, but does not meet the criteria for Prime Farmland, Farmland
of Statewide Importance, or Unique Farmland). Some lands along the Bay
produce oat hay, an important animal food source for ranches in West
Marin. Approximately 1,600 acres of these farmed bay lands will be returned
to wetlands in the Hamilton Wetland Restoration Project, a joint project of
the State Coastal Conservancy and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
Within the City limits, one active vineyard, the Pacheco Ranch, and one
small chicken and rabbit ranch are under a Williamson Act contract, which
requires the property owner to maintain the land in agricultural use in
exchange for reduced property taxes. In addition to these farmed lands,
portions of Mount Burdell and Rusk Creek open space preserves are used
for grazing.
                                                                                    During the spring, certain portions of Mount
                                                                                    Burdell are grazed by small herds of domestic

The City that Works chapter discusses the supply of potable water and
flooding. Water is also an environmental resource because of its importance
to wildlife as well as humans. Protecting and improving water quality is crit-
ical to maintaining and enhancing habitat and recharging aquifers.
Two general types of pollutant discharges affect the quality of surface water
and groundwater in the Novato area:
    •	 Point source discharge, which consists of discharge from a pipe or
        other device directly into the receiving waters. Discharge of treated
        wastewater from a sewer plant or an industrial building are common
        examples. Point sources can be managed through periodic monitoring
        and treatment methods.
    •	 Non-point source discharge, which consists of stormwater runoff that
        has drained from streets, parking lots, roofed structures, farms, and
        minor watercourses before it reaches a major creek, river, or other
        water body. This runoff can contain debris, litter, soil, and other natural

       and man-made pollutants. Typical pollutants include organic materials
       that contribute to biochemical oxygen demand, suspended solids,
       pathogens, sediment from construction and erosion, air pollution
       fall-out, gasoline additives, oil and grease, nitrogen and phosphorus
       from chemical fertilizers, animal waste, leached acids from leaves, and
       pesticides. These pollutants come from a variety of sources, including
       pet waste, lawn fertilization, cars, construction sites, illegal dumping
       and spills, and pesticide application. Once pollutants from surface
       runoff reach the receiving waters, they can cause water quality prob-
       lems similar to those found in municipal and industrial point source
       discharges.
Where rain falls on paved surfaces, a much greater amount of runoff is
generated compared to runoff from the same storm falling over a vegetated
area. These large volumes of water are swiftly carried to local streams and
wetlands, can cause flooding and erosion, and wash away important habitat
for wildlife that live in the stream.
To counteract these impacts of stormwater runoff, Novato has adopted
regulations that require management of stormwater for all new develop-
ment. Stormwater management is the use of specific practices, constructed
or natural, to reduce, slow down and/or remove pollutants from stormwater
runoff. Stormwater management practices are essentially designed to
restore or mimic some of the natural processes provided by the vegetative
cover that existed prior to land disturbance. Replacing impervious surfaces
with vegetation allows the soil to naturally filter or biodegrade contaminants
that would otherwise flow into streams, and wetlands, and the Bay.
State and federal regulations work to protect watershed and recharge
areas. In particular, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) program and the State Regional Water Quality Control Board
mandate control of urban runoff to eliminate the percolation of pollutants
from surface runoff into underground water supplies and open bodies
of water. The NPDES program requires the City to inspect, identify, and
prevent illicit discharges such as silt, road debris, oil, or discharges from
any residential, commercial or construction area into drains, waterways and
wetlands. Discharges of materials must be processed or eliminated where
practical.
3.6 AIR QUALITY
Novato typically experiences good air quality due to the almost persistent
westerly flow of air from the ocean. There are little or no pollution sources
upwind or to the west of Novato. Episodes of high particulate levels can
occur in late fall and winter when high pressure over the interior of the
western United States (known as the Great Basin High) produces extended
periods of light winds and low-level temperature inversions. This condi-
tion frequently produces poor atmospheric mixing that results in degraded
regional air quality.

                                               Novato is located within the Bay Area Air Quality Management District
                                               (BAAQMD), which is primarily responsible for assuring that national and
                                               state standards for air pollutants are attained in the San Francisco Bay Area.
                                               BAAQMD is also responsible for adopting and enforcing rules and regula-
                                               tions concerning air pollutant sources, issuing permits for stationary sources
                                               of air pollutants, and monitoring ambient air quality.
                                               Areas that do not violate ambient air quality standards are considered to
                                               have attained the standard. Violations of ambient air quality standards are
                                               based on air pollutant monitoring data and are judged for each air pollutant.
                                               The Bay Area as a whole does not meet the national standard for ozone,
                                               or the more stringent California standards for ozone and particulate matter.
                                               BAAQMD ’s Bay Area 2010 Clean Air Plan contains districtwide control
                                               measures to reduce ozone, particulate matter, air toxics, and greenhouse
                                               gasses. The Plan notes that Bay Area air quality has improved significantly
                                               in recent decades, greatly reducing health effects related to air pollution.
                                               Nonetheless, exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is by far the leading
                                               public health risk from air pollution in the Bay Area.
                                               The closest monitoring station to Novato is located in downtown San
                                               Rafael, which is the only station in Marin County. Pollutant monitoring
                                               results for the years 2010-2014 in San Rafael indicate that air quality in
                                               Marin County has generally been good, although air quality standards for
                                               particulate matter have been exceeded in some years. The State standard
                                               for respirable particulate matter (PM10) was exceeded three times over the
                                               five-year period (vs. 15 for the Bay Area), and the national standard for
                                               fine particulate matter (PM2.5) was exceeded eight times (vs. 33 for the Bay
                                               Area). The primary sources of these pollutants are wood smoke and local
                                               traffic, and their buildup is greatest during the evenings and early morning
                                               periods and on cold, stagnant winter evenings when temperature inversions
                                               prevent the rise and dispersal of pollutants.
                                               3.7 MINERAL RESOURCES
                                               The primary extractive resources in and around the Novato area are sand
                                               and gravel. Crushed rock quarries were located on the southeast slopes of
                                               Mt. Burdell, but these operations are no longer active. Decorative fieldstone
                                               is located on the south side of Mt. Burdell. Sand and gravel have been
                                               produced in the Black Point area, but operations have not been active since
                                               the 1950s. The California Geological Survey has designated four Resource
                                               Sectors in the Novato area (MRZ-2 zones) in the Rush Creek Open Space

                                               shown in Figure EL-7. Approximately 126 acres of the Resource Sectors
                                               located within the City have been urbanized. The remaining 360 acres are
                                               estimated to contain 51.4 million tons of sand, gravel and crushed rock,

3.8 CLIMATE CHANGE
Climate change is a significant, extended change in any measures of
average weather over time. Changes may be seen in sustained rising or
falling temperatures, significantly higher or lower amounts of precipitation, or
changes in wind patterns. Studies predict some positive but mostly negative
impacts resulting from human contributions to greenhouse gas emissions.
Based on these climate change studies, federal, State and local legislation
are increasingly encouraging and/or mandating policies that address and
mitigate the impacts of climate change.
The earth’s atmosphere contains a group of naturally occurring gases
that maintain a habitable climate. These gases allow sunlight to enter the
earth’s atmosphere freely and prevent some of the sun’s heat from exiting
the atmosphere. Because of their ability to contain heat, the gases are
known as greenhouse gases, or GHGs. Natural levels of GHGs exist in
balanced proportion, resulting in steady maintenance of the temperature
within earth’s atmosphere. However, emissions of GHGs from human
activities, such as electrical production and motor vehicle use, continue to
elevate the concentrations of GHGs, upsetting their natural balance. When
GHG concentrations exceed natural concentrations in the atmosphere, the

                                               Since 2005, the State of California has responded to growing concerns
                                               over the effects of climate change by adopting a comprehensive
                                               approach to addressing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the public
                                               and private sectors. Executive Order S-3-05, signed by Governor Arnold
                                               Schwarzenegger in 2005, established long-term targets to reduce GHG
                                               emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 and 80 percent below 1990 levels by
                                               2050. The 2020 GHG reduction target was subsequently codified with the
                                               passage of the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, more commonly
                                               known as AB 32. In 2015, Governor Jerry Brown issued Executive Order
                                               B-30-15, establishing an interim GHG reduction target of 40 percent below
                                               1990 levels by 2030. This is in line with the level the Intergovernmental
                                               Panel on Climate Change has identified in order limit global warming to
                                               2 degrees Celsius — the threshold at which scientists say may result in
                                               potentially catastrophic climate change impacts.
                                               The City of Novato recognizes its vital role in the mitigation of greenhouse
                                               gas emissions and adapting to climate change. In 2009, the City adopted a
                                               greenhouse gas reduction target of 15 percent below 2005 levels by 2020,
                                               consistent with the State’s target, and a 40 percent reduction by 2035.
                                               The City has conducted two inventories of community-wide greenhouse
                                               gas emissions, one for the baseline year of 2005 and another for 2010. The

oxide that are generated by activities within the Novato city limits. These
greenhouse gas emissions are weighted according to their global warming
potential and totaled as “carbon dioxide equivalents.” The inventories found
that community emissions totaled 296,318 metric tons of carbon dioxide
equivalents (MTCO2e) in 2005. By 2010, community emissions had declined
nearly three percent to 287,645 MTCO2e, partially due to the economic
downturn. Community emissions are categorized in seven sectors:
    •	 The Residential sector includes emissions generated by the use of
       electricity, natural gas and propane in homes.
    •	 The Commercial and Industrial sector includes emissions generated
       by the use of electricity and natural gas in commercial and industrial
       buildings and facilities. Emissions generated by schools, governments,
       and public agencies are included in this sector.
    •	 The Transportation sector includes emissions from on-road vehicles
       travelling on local roads within City limits and a proportional share of
       vehicle miles travelling on State highways within Marin County.
    •	 The Off-Road Vehicles & Equipment sector includes emissions from
       vehicles and equipment used for construction and lawn and garden
       activities.
    •	 The Waste sector includes emissions generated by the decomposition
       of solid waste deposited in landfills.
    •	 The Water sector includes emissions generated by the use of elec-
       tricity in treating, conveying and distributing water from the water
       source to users in the community.
    •	 The Wastewater sector represents emissions generated by the
       treatment of wastewater at the Novato Sanitary District Wastewater
       Treatment Plant.
As shown in Figure EL-8 and Table EL-3, the Transportation sector was
the largest emitter of greenhouse gas emissions in both 2005 and 2010,
followed by the Residential sector and the Commercial and Industrial
sector. Emissions declined in all sectors between 2005 and 2010 except
in the Commercial sector, with the greatest reductions occurring in the
Transportation, Waste and Wastewater sectors.

              Emissions are projected to increase 21 percent between the baseline year
              of 2005 and 2035, to a total of 302,450 MTCO2e, in the absence of any
              policies or actions that would occur to reduce emissions. The forecast is
              derived by “growing” baseline emissions by forecasted changes in popu-
              lation, number of households, jobs and vehicle miles traveled according to
              projections developed by the Association of Bay Area Governments and the
              Metropolitan Transportation Commission.
              This General Plan serves as the City’s Climate Action Plan. Policies and
              programs identified with a leaf        include emission reduction measures for
              the Climate Action Plan. Appendix F contains an analysis of anticipated
              emission reductions based on General Plan policies and implementing
              actions. Climate Action policies and actions include:
                  •	 Green building, energy efficiency, and renewable energy to address
                      the energy use and consumption of natural resources to construct,
                      renovate, operate and maintain buildings,

chapter 3                            ENVIRONMENTAL LEGACY
    •	 Land use and transportation to identify more efficient ways to utilize
       land and move about,
    •	 Waste reduction, recycling, and Zero Waste to divert and/or eliminate
       all materials from landfill,
    •	 Water conservation,
    •	 Natural systems to absorb or sequester greenhouse gases, and
    •	 Adaptation to prepare for inevitable climate change impacts including
       sea level rise.
Emission reductions estimated from the full implementation of these local
measures total approximately 17,600 MTCO2e by year 2020 (6.0% of
projected emissions). State actions, which represent reduction strategies
that have been approved, programmed and/or adopted, are projected to
reduce emissions about 57,700 MTCO2e by year 2020 (19.5% of projected
emissions). These actions include the renewable portfolio standard that
increases the percentage of renewable energy in electricity over time,
building code requirements for increased energy efficiency and conservation
in residential and non-residential buildings, light duty and heavy duty vehicle
fuel efficiency standards and regulations, and incentives for solar installation,
solar water heaters, and efficient lighting.

As shown in Figure EL-9, local and State actions combined are
projected to reduce emissions 26 percent below 2005 emission
levels by year 2020, exceeding the City and State’s targets. By 2035,
the continued implementation of these measures would reduce emissions
by 48 percent, which would meet the City’s target for 2035.

                                        Livable, thriving communities provide many opportunities for active lifestyles
                                        and access to healthy food. To achieve this ideal healthy community, Novato
                                        seeks to encourage walking and biking in the community, provide active
                                        recreation opportunities in City parks and facilities, ensure access to fresh
                                        and nutritious food, and create an environment where the healthy choice is
                                        the easy choice.
                                        Poor or inadequate nutrition and lack of physical activity are the root
                                        causes of the obesity epidemic in America, and can lead to a number of
                                        preventable but chronic diseases like diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and
                                        certain types of cancer. According to the Centers for Disease Control and
                                        Prevention, nearly 35 percent of U.S adults are obese, and approximately
                                        17 percent of children are obese. While adult obesity rates in Marin County
                                        are lower (13.5 percent) than the national average, obesity rates in Novato
                                        are generally higher than the County average, ranging from 14 percent to 46
                                        percent in Novato’s various neighborhoods. Nearly 40 percent of Novato’s
                                        youth are overweight or at-risk of being overweight.
                                        Many of Novato’s adults are not physically active on a regular basis. In
                                        most areas of the City, less than 60 percent of adults get moderate physical
                                        activity in a week.
                                        Novato’s commitment to obesity prevention includes making every effort to
                                        plan and construct a built environment that encourages walking and biking
                                        by providing a network of sidewalks, paths, and bike lanes and routes that
                                        connect residential neighborhoods, schools, parks, recreational facilities,
                                        shopping areas, employment centers, and transit centers. The City also
                                        strives to provide an ample number of parks, playgrounds and recreation
                                        facilities throughout the City so access is easy and close by. Novato has
                                        17 City parks or indoor facilities and 13 schools that provide active recre-
                                        ation opportunities. All areas of Novato are within a half-mile walking and
                                        a one-mile biking distance from these facilities, with the exception of the
                                        Bahia and Partridge Knolls neighborhoods, although these neighborhoods
                                        are adjacent to public open space and trails. The Bahia neighborhood also
                                        has several small pocket parks and access to water recreation facilities

Runners on San Marin High School track.
                                        A lack of access to fresh, healthy foods can contribute to poor diets and
                                        higher levels of obesity. Novato currently has 13 grocery stores that sell
                                        meats, fruits and vegetables and dry goods, ranging from small ethnic
                                        markets to supermarkets to bulk retailers like Costco. All areas in Novato
                                        are located within walking or biking distance from these grocery stores, with
                                        the exception of Bahia, Partridge Knolls, and the western portion of Ignacio
                                        Valley. Encouraging healthy food retailers, farmers markets and community
                                        gardens are tools the City can use to expand access to fresh foods and
                                        promote community health.

4.5 NOISE
This section identifies sources of noise and existing and future noise levels
in Novato, and provides standards to address exposure to current and
projected noise sources. The primary source of existing noise in Novato is
vehicle traffic from highways and major roadways. Additional noise sources
include the Sonoma Marin Area Rail Transit (SMART)/ Northwest Pacific
Railroad corridor and the Marin County Airport at Gnoss Field. There are no
industrial plants or factories that significantly affect noise levels in Novato,
but construction, heating and cooling systems, truck loading and unloading,
and recreation activities are among the stationary sources that contribute to
the noise environment.
NOISE TERMINOLOGY
The discussion of noise requires the use of a number of technical terms.
Some of the key noise-related terms used in this chapter include:
    •	 Decibel (dB). A decibel is a unit of measurement which indicates the
       relative amplitude of a sound. The zero on the decibel scale is based
       on the lowest sound level that the healthy, unimpaired human ear
       can detect. People can hear changes of 3 decibels or more. Each 10
       decibel increase sounds like the noise has approximately doubled.
    •	 A-weighted sound level (dBA). The A-weighted sound level is the
       most common method to characterize sound in California. This scale
       gives greater weight to the frequencies of sound to which the human
       ear is most sensitive. All sound levels in this chapter are A-weighted,
       unless reported otherwise.
    •	 Day/night average sound level (Ldn). Since the sensitivity to noise
       increases during the evening and at night, 24-hour descriptors have
       been developed that incorporate artificial noise penalties added to
       quiet-time noise events. Ldn is a measure of the cumulative noise expo-
       sure in a community, with a 10 dB addition to nocturnal (10:00 p.m.
       to 7:00 a.m.) noise levels. This is the measurement that the City of
       Novato normally uses in noise evaluations and analysis.
    •	 Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL). CNEL is the energy
       average of the A-weighted sound levels occurring during a 24-hour
       period, with 10 dB added to the A-weighted sound levels occurring
       between 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. and 5 dB added to the A-weighted
       sound levels occurring between 7:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m.

chapter 4 LIVING WELL
               TYPICAL SOUND LEVELS AND HUMAN RESPONSE TO
               NOISE
               Representative outdoor and indoor noise levels in units of dBA are shown in
               Table LW-2. This table also identifies subjective impressions of these noise
               levels.
               Varying levels of noise impact sleep and speech and cause annoyance. The
               thresholds for speech interference indoors are about 45 dBA if the noise is
               steady and about 55 dBA if the noise is fluctuating. Steady noise above 35
               dBA and fluctuating noise levels above about 45 dBA have been shown to
               affect sleep.

               Highways and Major Roadways
               The most significant source of traffic noise in Novato is from Highway

                                         Redwood Boulevard and others are significant noise sources for land uses
                                         immediately adjoining these roadways.
                                         A noise monitoring survey was conducted in December 2008 to quan-
                                         tify noise levels along Highway 101 and major roadways in Novato. Data
                                         from this survey was used to create a model of existing traffic noise levels
                                         throughout the city. These noise levels, as represented by noise contour
                                         lines, are shown in Figure LW-3. An updated vehicular noise contour map

                                         a 2008 Consent Decree between the City of Novato, NWPCo and North
                                         Coast Railroad Authority (NCRA), NWPCo may operate up to three round
                                         trips per week with a maximum of 18 cars per trip. In addition, all freight
                                         operation must occur during daylight hours until the City of Novato has
                                         established and executed a “Quiet Zone” pursuant to the Federal Railroad
                                         Administration’s (FRA) Train Horn Rule. While there are three spurs in
                                         Novato, one public and two private, NWPCo currently does not provide
                                         service to any Novato customers.
                                         SMART has begun reconstruction of the rail line to support their future
                                         passenger service which is expected to begin in 2016. Once operational,
                                         SMART will provide service to Novato residents and businesses through two
                                         stops, a Novato North –San Marin Station located on Redwood Boulevard
                                         and a Novato South—Hamilton Station located just north of Main Gate
                                         Road. SMART intends to initially operate 14 round trips per day between
                                         Santa Rosa and San Rafael. A new station is planned for Downtown
                                         Novato, with phased construction beginning in 2016. Track and foundation
                                         improvements for the platform will be constructed at that time, and the
SMART trains must sound their horns when remaining platform and related improvements will be completed sometime
leaving a train station.                 thereafter.
                                         In 2008, SMART approved a Supplemental EIR that analyzed noise and
                                         vibration impacts resulting from weekday (12 round trips per day) and
                                         weekend (four round trips per day) passenger rail service, as well as three
                                         cumulative scenarios including potential freight activity (between three and
                                         eight round trips per day). Although the line currently creates a minimal
                                         noise source in the community due to limited freight activity (no SMART
                                         activity), planned full activation of the NWPRR will result in elevated noise
                                         levels along the railroad and in the vicinity of “at-grade” crossings where
                                         railroad tracks and public streets cross one another. Day-night average
                                         noise levels (not near at-grade crossings) are estimated to range from 56 to
                                         59 dBA Ldn at a distance of 100 feet from the tracks, assuming combined
                                         passenger and freight train service. Train warning whistles can generate
                                         maximum noise levels of approximately 105 dBA at 100 feet and would be

               audible throughout the community. However, the City has filed a Notice of
               Intent to establish a Quiet Zone throughout Novato with the Public Utilities
               Commission (PUC), SMART and NCRA, which would eliminate the need for
               passenger and freight trains to routinely sound their whistles within ¼-mile
               of at-grade crossings. Once a Quiet Zone has been established, a train
               operator will still sound the horn when leaving the train station and may
               sound the train horn for emergencies, worker protection, or if there is any
               potential danger. Electronic bells mounted at intersections, which make the
               iconic “ding, ding, ding” sound when a train approaches, would be required
               to adhere to the national standard of between 61 and 91 dBA at a distance
               of 50 feet. Trains would also be a source of perceptible ground borne vibra-
               tion within approximately 50 to 100 feet of the tracks. A noise contour map
               for passenger and freight train operations is shown in Figure LW-4.
               Aircraft
               Aircraft using Gnoss Field Airport intermittently contribute to ambient noise
               levels in the city. This general aviation airport is located north of the City of
               Novato east of Highway 101. Aircraft facilities include a 3,300-foot runway,
               a parallel taxiway, a helicopter landing pad, and aircraft tie-downs and
               hangars with a total parking capacity of approximately 275 aircraft. The
               airport averages about 86,000 aircraft takeoffs and landings per year. Typical
               aircraft types include single and twin engine propeller aircraft and small
               business jet aircraft. The County is proposing to extend the existing runway
               by 1,100 feet as outlined in the Gnoss Field Master Plan. The purpose of
               the extension is to serve existing and anticipated aircraft and activity levels,
               as well as current and future changes in small aircraft design. The County
               encourages airport users to reduce noise and avoid flying over sensitive
               areas to the south and southeast of the Gnoss Field Airport.
               Aircraft noise in California is described in terms of the CNEL, which is
               approximately equivalent to the day/night average noise level (Ldn) but
               includes a 5 dB weighting factor for the evening hours (7:00 p.m. to 10:00
               p.m.). Existing noise contours for Gnoss Field are shown on Figure LW-5.
               The California Division of Aeronautics Title 21 states that the level of noise
               acceptable to persons living in the vicinity of an airport is a community noise
               equivalent level (CNEL) of 65 dB. However, the Gnoss Field Airport Land
               Use Plan recommends that no residential development occur within the 60
               dB CNEL contour and that the County obtain noise easements for devel-
               opment within the 55 dB CNEL noise contour. The 60 dBA CNEL noise
               contour generated by Gnoss Field Airport extends to the northernmost city
               limits.
               Stationary Noise Sources
               Construction, cooling and heating systems, parking lots and special events
               are among the stationary noise sources in Novato. Construction noise
               includes demolition, excavation, grading, delivery of materials, and building
               on a project site or staging area. Stationary noise sources also include:
               mechanical systems for heating, ventilation and air conditioning; service and
               delivery trucks idling, loading and unloading; business and industrial oper-
               ations such as storage facilities and lumber yards; and recreation activities

               and special events. The City’s noise ordinance regulates construction noise
               and prohibits noise that exceeds allowable exterior levels during specified
               time periods.
               Noise and Land Use Compatibility Standards
               The standards listed in Figure LW-6 should be used to evaluate the compat-
               ibility between new land uses and future noise in Novato. Figure LW-6
               should be used in combination with Figures LW-3 to 5 to determine whether
               a proposed development or land use is located in an area requiring special
               noise mitigating measures.

                                      Normally Acceptable: Specified land use is satisfactory, based upon
                                      the assumption that any buildings involved are of normal conven-
                                      tional construction, without any special noise insulation requirements.
                                      Conditionally Acceptable: New construction or development should
                                      be undertaken only after a detailed analysis of the noise reduction
                                      requirements is made and needed noise insulation features are
                                      included in the design.
                                      Unacceptable: New construction or development should generally
                                      not be undertaken because mitigation is usually not feasible.
               The State of California establishes minimum noise insulation performance
               standards for hotels, motels, dormitories, apartment houses and dwell-
               ings other than detached single-family dwellings as set forth in the 2013
               California Building Code. The noise limit is a maximum interior noise level of
               45 dBA Ldn. Where exterior noise levels exceed 60 dBA Ldn, a report must be
               submitted with the building plans describing the noise control measures that
               have been incorporated into the design of the project to meet the noise limit.
               Future Noise Environment
               Future noise levels will be largely attributable to vehicular traffic, and to a
               lesser extent, railroad operations and the Gnoss Field Airport. Projected
               noise contours are shown in Figure LW-7. This figure identifies areas
               that may be exposed to excessive noise levels, defined as those above
               60 dBA Ldn. Policies and programs in this chapter address these noise
               issues through implementation of a variety of noise-mitigating measures
               and, where possible, conditioning future development to limit future noise
               exposure.

4.6 GOALS, POLICIES AND PROGRAMS
Goal LW 1: Provide recreation facilities and programs,
parks and playfields for all age groups throughout the
community.
LW 1: Park Land and Recreation Facilities. Continue to emphasize
improvement of the City’s holdings of undeveloped parkland. Examine
opportunities for acquisition of new park lands and recreation facilities as
they arise.
LW 2: Community and Neighborhood Parks. Provide a network of
community and neighborhood parks within walking distance of all neighbor-
hoods to the maximum extent feasible. As appropriate, identify locations for
additional neighborhood and community parks.
          LW 2a: Parks Master Plan. Develop a master plan for parks and
          recreation facilities, including a financial plan to improve undevel-
          oped parkland, maintain or enhance existing facilities, and acquire
          land for new neighborhood parks. In considering new park facilities
          and improvements, evaluate parking and transit access and require
          screening of lighting and noise protection for nearby residents. The
          plan should identify unmet recreational needs, provide a strategy for
          development and maintenance of pocket parks, and seek opportu-
          nities for collaboration with other public and private entities.
          LW 2b: New Neighborhood Parks. Explore creation of new
          neighborhood parks in underserved areas, such as the Northwest
          Quadrant neighborhood.
          LW 2c: North Redwood Boulevard Median. Consider the creation
          of a linear park within the median of North Redwood Boulevard.
          LW 2d: City Green. Consider the expansion of the City Green,
          including enhancement of Sherman Avenue, to accommodate a
          wide range of community events and activities.
          LW 2e: American Assets Facilities. Look for opportunities to
          obtain public access to the private recreational facilities at the
          American Assets site (former Fireman’s Fund) through future rede-
          velopment of the property.
          LW 2f: Park Use and Maintenance. Examine methods to improve
          parks to maximize use, reduce maintenance costs, and improve
          access and opportunities for recreation, including new products,
          systems and technologies.
LW 3: Collaboration. Expand community access to indoor and outdoor
recreation and park facilities through joint use agreements with the school
district and other community partners. Encourage the establishment of
commercial recreation facilities which provide community access to address
unmet needs and expand the number of high quality recreation facilities in
Novato.

                                               LW 4: New Development. Evaluate new development to maximize
                                               on-site recreational space or access to active recreational oppor-
                                               tunities in the area, including trails. New residential development
                                               should contribute towards communitywide parks consistent with
                                               the anticipated use of community facilities by potential residents of
                                               the proposed development. In larger new developments encourage
                                               developers to provide park space accessible to the surrounding neigh-
                                               borhood as part of their project. Maintain a recreation standard of five
                                               acres of park and recreation facilities per 1,000 residents.
                                                    LW 4a: Parkland Dedication Ordinance. Administer and update
                                                    as appropriate the City’s Parkland Dedication (Quimby) Ordinance to
                                                    assure that new development contributes to addressing community
                                                    park needs.
                                               LW 5: Trails and Paths. Develop and expand a comprehensive and coor-
                                               dinated trails and paths system that serves both recreational and utilitarian
                                               travel that connects to regional trails, schools, open space, parks, recre-
                                               ation facilities and neighborhoods. Consider the access needs of a variety of
                                               users, including school-age children, senior adults, and those with disabil-
                                               ities when designing trails and paths. Minimize impacts to habitats and
                                               wildlife in planning, construction and operation of trails.
                                                          LW 5a: Bay Trail. Work with the Marin County Open Space District,
                                                          the Association of Bay Area Governments, and other regional, state

             and recreational services (31 percent) and financial and professional services
             (30 percent). Retail jobs comprise about 12 percent of all jobs in Novato.

             High-paying jobs are needed in the City in order to attract new workers who
             can also afford to live here. The median single family home price in 2014
             was about $750,000, which would require a minimum annual household
             income of approximately $160,000 assuming a 20 percent down payment.
             The Association of Bay Area Government projects Novato will add about
             3,000 jobs between 2010 and 2035, with most job growth occurring in the
             financial and professional services category. The City has been leading a
             marketing campaign to recruit bio/life science companies to Novato.

5.3 OFFICE AND INDUSTRIAL MARKET
Novato contains approximately 3.4 million square feet of office space
and 1.1 million square feet of industrial space. Major office buildings are
located in Hamilton Landing, Bel Marin Keys, Rowland Plaza, central
Novato (Woodside Office Center and the North Bay Center), and northern
Novato (Fireman’s Fund, 100 Wood Hollow Road, and the Buck Institute for
Research on Aging). The Bel Marin Keys office park also offers light-indus-
trial and warehouse space.
The office market is beginning to recover after a long slump following the
recession that began in 2008, when some office building vacancy rates
were 30 percent or higher. Existing office vacancies will continue to absorb
new demand in the short-term. The new SMART stations at Atherton
Avenue and Hamilton are expected to increase the city’s attractiveness for
new office space, particularly at Hamilton Landing and in northern Novato,
where the Buck Institute could anchor a bio/life sciences industry hub.

The Downtown has unique restaurants,
boutiques and specialty stores.
                                     As shown in Table EV-1, job growth is expected in occupations that typi-
                                     cally require office space. Manufacturing jobs are projected to decline by 31
                                     percent, indicating little if any additional need for industrial space unless it is
                                     related to research and development use.
                                     5.4 RETAIL MARKET
                                     Novato’s retail inventory totals 2.2 million square feet of space concentrated
                                     in neighborhood shopping centers, Downtown Novato, and Vintage Oaks.
                                     The retail vacancy rate is relatively low and continues to fall as the economy
                                     recovers.
                                     Novato’s Downtown has a mix of local-serving stores and restaurants along
                                     Grant Avenue. The blocks east of Redwood Boulevard are beginning to fulfill
                                     the area’s potential as a special goods, entertainment and dining destina-
                                     tion. The City has done much to improve the Downtown with street trees,
                                     lighting, streetscape improvements, and wayfinding signs. The Civic Center,
                                     expanded in 2014 with an administrative office building and City Green,
                                     brought new vitality to the Downtown and an iconic architectural style that
                                     echoes the historic, agrarian roots of the community.
                                     Fourteen neighborhood shopping centers serve residents and workers. Two
                                     shopping centers – the Village at Novato, anchored by Trader Joe’s, and
                                     the Hamilton Marketplace—are relatively new, opening in 2006 and 2008,
                                     respectively. The others were all built prior to 1990. Although some, such
                                     as Pacheco Plaza, have been renovated, others show opportunities for
                                     improvement. The Square Shopping Center, for example, has a very high
                                     vacancy rate and relatively low lease rates.
                                     Vintage Oaks is Novato’s only regional shopping center, located on the east
                                     side of Highway 101 just north of State Route 37. The 620,000 square foot

center hosts a mix of tenants that includes Costco and
Target, Macy’s Furniture and nearly 50 other retailers and restaurants.
Vacancy here is typically very low, even during difficult economic times.
The retail market is not expected to grow much, particularly as on-line shop-
ping continues to command a greater share of retail dollars. Nonetheless,
retail sales tax leakage studies show that there may be opportunities to
attract new retail in underserved categories, especially home furnishings
and appliance stores, building materials and garden equipment, and auto
dealers.
Novato also “leaks” retail sales dollars in the restaurant and clothing store
categories. A “lifestyle center” on North Redwood Boulevard, described in
the Great Places chapter, could provide new dining and shopping venues
as well as places for people to gather and socialize. The Downtown could
expand its dining, apparel, and home furnishing offerings to entice residents
to stay in Novato for shopping and recreation.

                                         The topography and climate of Novato make it ideal for walking and biking,
                                         particularly for those who live on the valley floor. Nonetheless, available data
                                         indicate that Novato residents continue to rely primarily on vehicles for their
                                         transportation needs. Only 2.5 percent of the workforce walks or bikes to
                                         work despite the fact that an estimated 34 percent of Novato residents
                                         work in Novato. Although 18 percent of Novato residents take transit or

EXISTING ROADWAY SYSTEM
Novato’s roadway system includes highways and local streets as shown in
Map CW-1. The City is served by two freeways. US Highway 101 passes
through Novato as it connects Marin County to San Francisco to the south
and Sonoma County to the north. State Route (SR) 37 begins at US 101
in Novato and extends east, connecting to Interstate 80 in Vallejo. There
are six US 101 interchanges that serve the City: San Marin Drive-Atherton
Avenue; DeLong Avenue; Rowland Avenue; Novato Boulevard-SR 37;
Ignacio Boulevard-Bel Marin Keys Boulevard; and Alameda del Prado.
Local streets are classified according to three general types that reflect
a roadway’s volume, local access (number and type of curb cuts and
driveway access), posted speeds, parking, median type, traffic control and
other characteristics. The three street classifications in Novato are shown in
Figure CW-2.

              FIGURE CW-2 ROAD CLASSIFICATIONS
                 Arterial: An arterial is a higher-speed and higher-capacity roadway that links the community
                 to the larger regional roadway network. Novato’s arterials include San Marin Drive, Atherton
                 Avenue, Redwood Boulevard, De Long Avenue, Novato Boulevard, South Novato Boulevard,
                 Wilson Avenue, Mill Road, Rowland Boulevard, and Ignacio Boulevard.
                 Collector: A collector is a relatively low-speed, low-volume street that provides access
                 within and between neighborhoods. Collectors usually serve short trips and are intended to
                 collect trips from local streets and distribute them to arterial streets. Examples of collector
                 streets in Novato include Olive Avenue, Grant Avenue, Center Road, Sutro Avenue, Indian
                 Valley Road, Bel Marin Keys Boulevard, and State Access Road.
                 Local: Remaining streets are considered local streets as they serve local traffic, feeding into
                 the collector and arterial streets.

chapter 6                    CITY THAT WORKS
Novato’s roadway system is largely determined by the City’s location and
topography. Because the City is surrounded by ridges and open space,
there is only one roadway – Novato Boulevard — connecting western Marin
to the City. Highway 101 provides the only northern and southern access
to Novato from other communities, and State Route37 provides the primary
eastern access. This roadway system makes Novato greatly dependent on
well-functioning highways for regional travel.
Truck Routes
The City of Novato’s Municipal Code prohibits any vehicle exceeding the
maximum gross weight limit of five tons from traveling or parking on any
City street except on streets designated as truck routes as follows:
    •	 Redwood Boulevard (from Rowland Boulevard to San Marin Drive)
    •	 Atherton Avenue
    •	 DeLong Avenue (from Redwood Boulevard to US 101)
    •	 Diablo Avenue (easterly of Novato Boulevard)
    •	 Novato Boulevard (northwesterly of Diablo Avenue)
    •	 Rowland Boulevard (from Redwood Boulevard to US 101)
    •	 San Marin Drive
Trucks are allowed to travel on prohibited streets for the purpose of making
pick-ups or deliveries to a location on that street. Passenger buses and
vehicles used for the purpose of installing, maintaining or repairing public
utilities are exempt from weight restrictions.

EXISTING TRAFFIC OPERATIONS
Intersection Operations
Traffic engineers have historically used “Level of Service” or “LOS” to
measure the performance of roadways and intersections. The capacity of
a local street system is typically dependent upon the operation of intersec-
tions rather than the segments connecting them since conflicting vehicle
movements are concentrated at intersections. Traffic analyses therefore
usually focus on the points where two arterial or collector streets intersect.                      “Level of Service” (LOS) is used to

                                            General Plan policies establish standards for acceptable levels of service
                                            for intersections in Novato. Intersections with traffic signals or four-way stop
                                            signs should operate at LOS D or better. For intersections with stop signs
                                            on side streets only, LOS E is acceptable.
                                            Traffic studies prepared for the General Plan Existing Conditions Report
                                            found that nearly all of the 41 intersections studied at that time operated at
                                            acceptable levels of service. The two exceptions were the stop-controlled
                                            intersections of South Novato Boulevard and Redwood Boulevard and
                                            Alameda del Prado and Nave Drive. Both of these intersections operated at
                                            LOS E during the morning peak period.
                                            Roadway and Freeway Operations
                                            Several roadway and freeway segments in Novato are part of the
                                            Marin County Congestion Management Program (CMP) network. The
                                            Transportation Authority of Marin, which serves as the region’s conges-
                                            tion management agency, has established LOS standards for designated
                                            roadways in Marin County. Unlike the LOS standards set by the Novato
                                            General Plan, which focus on intersections, the CMP LOS standards focus
                                            on roadway segments. The standards affecting Novato include a LOS E
                                            requirement for US 101 and a LOS D requirement for SR 37 and designated

Measuring Traffic Impacts with Vehicle Miles Traveled
(VMT)
In 2013, Governor Brown signed Senate Bill 743. Among other things, SB
743 addresses transportation impacts under the California Environmental
Quality Act (CEQA). Specifically, SB 743 requires the Governor’s Office of
Planning and Research (OPR) to amend the CEQA Guidelines to provide
an alternative to LOS for evaluating transportation impacts. Particularly
within areas served by transit, those alternative criteria must “promote the
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, the development of multimodal
transportation networks, and a diversity of land uses.” Measurements of
transportation impacts may include vehicle miles traveled, vehicle miles
traveled per capita, automobile trip generation rates, or automobile trips
generated. Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) is a measurement of the number
of miles traveled by vehicles within a specified region for a specified time
period.
FUTURE ROADWAY OPERATIONS
Land use and transportation must be coordinated so that the capacity of
the transportation system accommodates the traffic generated by the devel-
opment of the community. In order to understand the relationship between
land use and transportation, a traffic forecasting model was prepared for
the General Plan based on the development forecasts presented in the
Land Use chapter. With these traffic projections it is possible to estimate
how much traffic will be generated by new development, what traffic prob-
lems will occur, and what roadway improvements, if any, could relieve
traffic congestion and enhance multi-modal use. Table CW-2 presents a
list of projects in Novato that, when implemented, will accommodate traffic
generated by development consistent with the General Plan, enabling the
roadway system to operate safely and efficiently for all users.

                                           PARKING
                                           Vehicle parking facilities have a significant impact on the attractiveness and
                                           accessibility of neighborhoods, commercial districts and communities as a
                                           whole. In Novato, parking for individual land uses is generally provided either
                                           directly on-site or along the street adjacent to the site.
                                           Residential Parking
                                           On-street parking is typically provided on both sides of the street in resi-
                                           dential neighborhoods, on local roads, on collector streets and occasionally
                                           along the city’s arterials. While an abundance of parking is generally
                                           available in the city’s residential neighborhoods, some of the city’s older
                                           multi-family developments provide more limited on-site parking, resulting in
                                           greater use of on-street parking in these areas.
                                           Downtown Parking
                                           Parking downtown generally consists of public on-street spaces and
                                           parking in private lots that serve businesses. There are two small off-street
                                           public parking lots in the Downtown—the Civic Center lot and the Zenk
                                           lot on Reichert Avenue between Grant Avenue and De Long Avenue. The
                                           Millworks/Whole Foods development includes 26 spaces available to the
                                           general public during business hours in addition to the parking spaces dedi-

                                           Concerns about the availability of parking tend to be focused on the
                                           downtown area. The City conducts an annual parking survey to determine
                                           the occupancy level of on-street parking spaces. The City’s most recent
                                           analysis indicates that 85 percent of on-street parking spaces downtown
                                           are occupied during the peak parking period from noon to 1:00 p.m. on
                                           weekdays. An occupancy rate of 90 percent and above indicates a parking
                                           shortage.
                                           Vacant parking spaces along Grant Avenue, between Redwood Boulevard
                                           and Reichert Avenue, and along adjacent streets are more difficult to find
                                           during the weekday lunchtime hour. However, parking spaces are often

                                           PARK-AND-RIDE LOTS
                                           There are five park-and-ride lots in Novato. The facilities provide short- and
                                           long-term parking for commuters, transit riders and bicyclists. Four of the
                                           facilities are located along the US 101 and SR 37 corridors and are owned
                                           and operated by Caltrans. These facilities are located at the Alameda del

BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN NETWORK
Novato residents and visitors walk and bicycle throughout the City for recre-
ation and for access to schools, employment sites, transit, and shopping.
The City’s climate and mostly flat topography are conducive to walking and
bicycling, and the City’s well-developed network of bicycle and pedestrian
facilities and amenities provides safe and convenient routes for biking and
walking. Maintaining and expanding the bicycle and pedestrian network
helps to reduce the number of vehicles on the road, reduces pollution and
greenhouse gas emissions, and encourages a healthy and active lifestyle for
Novato residents, workers and visitors.
Bicycle Network
Novato has three different classifications of bikeways. Class I paths provide
a completely separated right-of-way for exclusive use by bicyclists, pedes-
trians and other active transportation users. Class II bike lanes, such as
those on Redwood Boulevard, provide a striped and stenciled lane for
one-way travel on a street. Class III bike routes provide for shared use of the
vehicular travel lane, typically on lower-volume roadways.
Altogether, Novato has approximately 33 miles of bikeways within the City’s
boundaries, as shown in Figure CW-3. Map CW-2 shows existing and
proposed bikeways.

chapter 6 CITY THAT WORKS
              Bicycle racks can be found at various businesses, employment centers,
              schools, transit stops and parks throughout Novato. Bicycle lockers for
              long-term bicycle parking are available at the park-and-ride lots at Alameda
              del Prado and Rowland Boulevard. The City of Novato has adopted require-
              ments for bicycle parking for new multi-family and commercial development
              and requires showers and change facilities in large, newly-developed
              employment centers.
              The Novato Bicycle/Pedestrian Plan, adopted in 2015, provides for a
              recommended citywide network of sidewalks, bicycle paths, lanes and
              routes, along with pedestrian- and bicycle-related programs and support
              facilities. The City’s Community Based Transportation Plan (CBTP), also
              adopted in 2015, identifies bike and pedestrian needs focused on improve-
              ments for increased access to transit bus facilities. The goal of both plans
              is to make bicycling, walking and transit use a more viable transportation
              option for people who live, work and recreate in Novato.
              Pedestrian Network
              A neighborhood is walkable when people can travel safely on foot to many
              destinations. Convenient walking distance is a half mile to a mile, a walk that
              would take 10 to 15 minutes. Novato has many walkable neighborhoods,
              and sidewalks are provided on the majority of streets in the city. Downtown
              is walkable because of its small blocks, nearby services and destinations,
              and access to transit services. While the Downtown and surrounding neigh-
              borhoods have nearly complete sidewalk coverage, outlying residential
              neighborhoods have varying coverage. Crosswalks, curb ramps, lighting
              and signs help to make walking safe in the city, and amenities such as
              street trees, landscape plantings, benches, and transit shelters contribute to
              a pleasant pedestrian experience.
              Safe Routes to School
              The Safe Routes to Schools program was initiated in Marin County in 2000
              as an effort to reduce congestion and encourage healthy exercise and
              transportation habits among school-aged children. Ten Novato schools and
              over 5,300 students currently participate in the program.
              Safe Routes to Schools promotes walking and biking to school through
              education and incentives. The program addresses parents’ safety concerns
              by educating children and the public, partnering with traffic law enforce-
              ment, and developing plans to create safer streets. The City participates in
              the construction of safe pathways to Novato schools, and the Novato Police
              Department provides bicycle education and safety programs.

chapter 6                     CITY THAT WORKS
GEOLOGIC AND SEISMIC HAZARDS
Earthquakes
Novato is located in the seismically active San Francisco Bay region, an
area with a long history of tectonic movements. The region sits on the
boundary between two of the Earth’s major tectonic plates—the Pacific and
North American Plates—which move inexorably past each other at a rate
of about 2 inches per year. Much of this motion is accommodated from
time to time by sudden slip on faults, producing earthquake. Although the
San Andreas fault is the main origin of slip, other faults splay out from the
plate boundary throughout most of California. Active and potentially active
faults in the Novato area include the San Andreas, Burdell Mountain, Tolay,
Rodgers Creek, and Hayward fault zones, as shown on Map CW-3. The
nearest potentially active fault is the Burdell Mountain fault, which is located
to the north of the city.
An active fault is defined as one which has had surface displacement over
the past 11,000 years. The San Andreas, Hayward, and Rodgers Creek
faults are all active faults.
The San Andreas fault, located about 9.5 miles west of the city limit, was
the source of the magnitude 7.8 earthquake in 1906. The most recent large
earthquake on the San Andreas fault was the magnitude 6.9 Loma Prieta
earthquake in 1989. The Loma Prieta earthquake caused intense seismic
activity throughout the Bay Area, collapsing a double-decked freeway in
West Oakland and destroying buildings in San Francisco’s fill-based Marina
District.
The U.S. Geological Survey estimates the probability of a large earthquake
of magnitude 6.7 or greater on the northern San Andreas fault within the
next 30 years is about 21 percent. Earthquakes of this magnitude can kill
and injure many people and cause extensive damage to buildings, roads,
bridges and utilities.
The Rodgers Creek fault is the closest active fault, lying 4.8 miles to the
east of Novato. The active Hayward fault is 13.7 miles to the southeast.
There is a 31 percent chance that a large earthquake will occur within the
Hayward-Rodgers Creek fault system within the next 30 years.
Both the Burdell Mountain and Tolay faults are considered potentially active
faults, which mean that there is evidence of surface displacement within the
last 1.6 million years, but not within the past 11,000 years.
Damage in earthquakes is mainly from shaking. The intensity of shaking
that a structure will experience during an earthquake depends upon the
magnitude of the earthquake, the proximity to the epicenter, and the type of
ground materials beneath the structure. Soft soils amplify the shaking, while
hard bedrock does not.
All buildings located in Novato are vulnerable to earthquake damage, but
depending upon construction, some buildings are expected to perform
better than others. One and two story wood-frame buildings generally
perform well, but they may shift if not bolted to the foundation or partially

chapter 6 CITY THAT WORKS
              collapse if cripple walls (short walls that occur between the foundation and
              first floor to create a crawl space) are not braced. Homes with rooms built
              over garages and homes built on hillsides are also vulnerable to collapse
              if walls are not reinforced or braced. Unreinforced masonry buildings are
              very likely to be damaged during earthquakes. While current building
              codes address seismic safety, they are designed to protect occupant lives
              during an earthquake. Newly constructed buildings can still be significantly
              damaged during a major earthquake.
              Structures built in areas of water-saturated granular sediment or fill material
              are susceptible to liquefaction. The ground shaking from an earthquake
              transforms the material from a solid state to a temporarily liquid state.
              Liquefaction is a serious hazard because buildings in areas that experience
              liquefaction may sink or suffer major structural damage. Most single and
              multi-family homes under 10 stories are unlikely to have foundations stable
              enough to withstand liquefaction even if they can withstand ground shaking.
              Areas in Novato with soils susceptible to liquefaction are primarily located in
              low-lying area of fill fronting San Pablo Bay, as shown in Map CW-4.
              Although an earthquake on the Hayward and Rodgers Creek fault complex,
              which runs beneath San Pablo Bay, could create a tsunami, there is
              believed to be little potential for a tsunami to affect Novato.

Landslides
Landslides are a potential hazard to structures, roads and utilities on hill-
sides in Novato. Landslides can move slowly, as in hillside creep, or can
move quickly and disastrously, as is the case with debris flows.
Almost every landslide has multiple causes. Landslides can be initiated in
slopes already on the verge of movement by rainfall, erosion, earthquake,
and disturbance by human activities. Factors that indicate the probable
formation and relative risk of landslide and slope instability include:
    •	 Slope Steepness: Most landslides occur on moderate to steep slopes.
    •	 Slope Material: Loose, unconsolidated soils and soft, weak rocks are
       more hazardous than are firm, consolidated soils or hard bedrock.
    •	 Water Content: Increased water content increases landslide hazard by
       decreasing resistance to sliding and adding weight to the materials on
       a slope.
    •	 Vegetation Coverage: Abundant vegetation with deep roots increases
       slope stability.
    •	 Proximity to Areas of Erosion or Man-Made Cuts: Undercutting slopes
       may greatly increase landslide potential.
    •	 Earthquake Ground Motions: Strong ground shaking may trigger land-
       slides in marginally stable slopes or loosen slope materials and thus

FLOODING
Novato Creek, along with its tributaries such as Warner and Arroyo Avichi
Creeks, is a major source of flooding in Novato. Heavy rains occasionally
cause flood damage in Novato. Properties upstream of the confluence of
Novato, Warner, and Arroyo Avichi Creeks have been particularly suscep-
tible to flooding. Heavy rains in 1980, 1982, 1983, 1986, 1989 and 1998
caused flooding and damage to buildings in these areas. Other areas with
high flood danger include Ignacio, Arroyo San Jose, and Vineyard Creeks.
Flooding along Novato Creek usually occurs in three stages: 1) when the
water levels rise above storm drains water backs up, resulting in flooded
roads and property; 2) when Warner Creek and Arroyo Avichi rise and over-
flow their banks at the confluence with Novato Creek; and 3) when Novato
Creek itself rises to a level where it overflows at low points in its banks. In
addition, localized flooding occurs periodically in certain locations due to
creek blockages such as fallen trees and debris. The frequency and severity
of flooding has been reduced as a result of flood control improvements for
Novato, Warner and Avichi Creeks over the years.
Much of the Bayfront lands are in agricultural, conservation or open space
uses and flood frequently. These areas are reclaimed marshlands which had
been near high tide level when drained. Since reclamation, the loss of water
within the bay mud has led to subsidence, and many areas are now below
mean sea level and require pumping to drain.
Congress passed the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 and the Flood
Disaster Protection Act of 1973 to address the increasing cost of flood-re-
lated disaster relief. The intent of National Flood Insurance Program is to
reduce the need for large, publicly-funded flood control structures and
disaster relief by restricting development on floodplains.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) administers the
National Flood Insurance Program to provide subsidized flood insurance to
communities that comply with FEMA regulations and limit development on
floodplains. FEMA issues Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) for communi-
ties participating in the flood insurance program. The FIRM maps delineate
flood hazard zones in the community.
The FIRM maps play several critical roles. First, the maps are used by local
and county agencies to identify and plan for local or area flood protection.
Second, the maps are used by the banking and insurance industries to
determine if flood insurance is mandated for a specific property or area.
Lands located within the Areas of Special Flood Hazard (areas subject to 1
percent change of flooding in any given year) require that flood protection
insurance be secured for federally-regulated or insured loans. Lastly, the
maps are used at the federal and state level to plan for waterway projects
that are administered by the US Army Corps of Engineers. The most current
FIRM maps were updated and published in 2016.
Map CW-6 shows the areas of Novato that are prone to flooding, as identi-
fied by FEMA. Areas in the 100-year flood zone have a 1 percent chance of
flooding in any given year, while areas in the 500-year flood zone have a 0.2
percent chance of flooding.

All of Marin County, including Novato, is under the jurisdiction of the Marin
County Flood Control and Water Conservation District, which is responsible for
managing stormwater and flooding problems in the County. The District also
maintains weather monitoring stations, stream gauges and precipitation gauges
throughout the County. The District identifies eight zones within the County in
order to focus on issues in specific watersheds. The City of Novato and a size-
able amount of unincorporated area around the City comprise Zone 1.
Hamilton Levee
The FEMA-accredited Hamilton Levee is situated on low-lying land below
sea level. The area behind the levee includes detached single family homes,
townhouses and condominiums, senior living units, rehabilitated hangars
converted to commercial space, a community center, an amphitheater and
park facilities. The levee is located at the eastern edge of development and
protects the development from the waters of San Pablo Bay. In addition a
secondary, outer levee and the raising of wetlands elevation between the
levees provide additional protection to the developments. Storm drainage
water is pumped via two pump stations with adequate flow capacity,
powered by diesel engines from the developments into the bay.
In the highly unlikely event of a levee failure during flooding conditions or a
severe storm, combined with a high tide, parcels could be threatened with
immediate flooding. An imminent threat of levee failure could require a rapid
evacuation of affected residents in a short period of time, with little to no
advanced warning. The Hamilton Levee protection zone is shown in Figure
CW-7.
                                                                                The Hamilton Levee protects homes, busi-

Novato Creek Dam
Novato is subject to potential flooding resulting from the failure of the
Novato Creek Dam at Stafford Lake. This earthen dam, built in 1950, is
designed to withstand an earthquake of a magnitude up to 8.25 on the
San Andreas Fault with an epicenter 10 miles away. The area that would be
inundated in the hypothetical event of a sudden failure of the dam is shown
in Map CW-8.

FIRE HAZARDS
CAL FIRE identifies fire hazard severity zones (FHSZ) based on the severity
of the fire hazard expected to prevail there. These areas are based on
factors such as fuel type (vegetation that is fire prone), slope, aspect,
and fire weather. There are three zones, based on increasing fire hazard:
medium, high and very high. As shown in Figure CW-4, very high fire hazard
severity zones are found in the southwest area of Novato, in the open space
preserves and along creek corridors where homes have been built on hill-
sides covered with grasslands and oak woodlands.
In addition to the State identified FHSZ, local fire authorities using similar
criteria have designated certain State Responsibility Areas (SRA) & Local
Responsibility Areas (LRA) to also be a significant risk from wildfires. The
term wildland urban interface (WUI) is commonly used to describe an area
where urban development has been located in proximity to open space

              or wildland areas. Development located within a wildland-urban interface
              experiences high risk of wildland fire. The wildland urban interface areas in
              Novato, as identified by CAL FIRE and the Novato Fire Protection District
              (NFPD), are shown in Figure CW-5. Development within the wildland urban
              interface is subject to specific requirements for vegetation management and
              for ignition resistive construction features including but not limited to and
              exterior siding, windows, roofs, eaves, vents, decks, and exterior doors.
              The Novato area has experienced catastrophic wildland urban interface fires
              in the past, and NFPD routinely responds to wildland urban interface fires
              annually. In 1923 Novato experienced its largest recorded fire burning some
              40,000 acres. In 1926, it was reported in the local newspaper that “rings
              of fire” were burning in the dry summer oak woodland areas, creating fears
              of one day losing the entire town. That same year the Novato Fire District
              was formed. The fuel, weather, and topographic conditions that support
              the ignition and spread of wildland fires are still present within the District
              and wildland fires have consumed hundreds of acres of land in the last
              several decades. The largest wildland fire in Marin County in recent years
              was the Mt. Vision fire of 1995. This fire, located in Inverness Park in West
              Marin County, destroyed 59 homes and consumed 12,000 acres. Additional
              information on wildfire hazards can be found in the City of Novato’s Hazard
              Mitigation Plan and Emergency Operations Plan and the Novato Fire
              Protection District’s 2009 All Risk Standards of Cover.
              Structure fire risk is greatest in older structures and neighborhoods built
              before modern WUI building codes for fire safety and building systems were
              in place. Wood-frame apartment buildings and condominiums are at risk, as
              are Downtown buildings made of wood that do not have adequate firewalls.
              Closely-spaced mobile homes in the City’s mobile home parks are also at
              increased fire risk.
              The North Marin Water District (NMWD) has adopted minimum fire flow
              standards of 1,000 gallons per minute at hydrants, as specified by Title 22
              of the State of California Administrative Code. In addition, NMWD continues
              to upgrade storage and the water delivery system to assist in fire suppres-
              sion. NFPD has adopted a similar fire flow standard to ensure that there
              exists sufficient water flow in fire hydrants throughout Novato, based on
              peak demand.
              Novato Fire Protection District
              The City of Novato, as well as surrounding unincorporated areas, is served
              by the Novato Fire Protection District (NFPD), an independent special fire
              district formed in 1926. The NFPD provides fire protection services, emer-
              gency medical services, and fire and rescue response for vehicle accidents
              and hazardous material incidents.
              The City of Novato and the Novato Fire Protection District operate a joint
              Emergency Operations Center located in the NFPD Administrative Office at
              95 Rowland Way. The Center facilitates a coordinated response during a
              major emergency or disaster. The City’s Emergency Operations Plan guides
              the planned response to emergency situations as well as coordination with
              other governmental agencies when required.

chapter 6                    CITY THAT WORKS
The City prepares evacuation routes in cooperation with the NFPD which
are intended for use by first responders. Actual evacuation routes may need
to be modified in the field during emergencies. Evacuation policies and
procedures are addressed in the City’s Emergency Operation Plan. The City
has established minimum roadway widths for various types of roadways
within Novato. These standards are contained in Chapter 5 of the Novato
Municipal Code and in the locally adopted NFPD Fire Code Ordinance, by
reference in its roadway and driveway standards.
                                                                            The Novato Fire Protection District provides

                                               POLICE SERVICE
                                               The Novato Police Department (NPD) provides professional and proactive
                                               street patrol, investigative services, traffic enforcement, narcotics enforce-
                                               ment, a 911 dispatch center, and emergency services and preparedness.
                                               The NPD keeps the community safe through education, enforcement and
                                               working closely with neighborhoods. There are approximately 78 staff in the
                                               department, including 59 sworn personnel and a robust volunteer program.
                                               The NPD has developed a number of community-oriented programs
                                               including the Minors Access to Alcohol Prevention and Bicycle/Pedestrian
                                               Safety programs. The Novato Response Team is a special police team
                                               focused on crime prevention and intervention. The Team meets with resi-
                                               dents to provide crime prevention tips, visits schools to mentor youth
                                               and reduce gang involvement, and works with property owners of multi-
                                               family housing to ensure the safety of their residents and the surrounding
                                               community.
                                               Currently, Novato experiences historically low crime rates, with more than
                                               a 45 percent drop in total crime over a 20-year period. There were a total
                                               of nearly 3,500 crimes reported in 2014, a 5 percent decrease from the
                                               previous year. A comparison of 2013 and 2014 reported crimes and arrests
                                               are shown in Table CW-3.

                                               SEA LEVEL RISE
                                               The San Francisco Bay is vulnerable to a range of natural hazards, including
                                               storms, extreme high tides, and rising sea levels resulting from global
                                               climate change. Flooding already poses a threat to communities along the
                                               Bay and there is compelling evidence that these risks will increase in the
                                               future. As temperatures rise globally, sea levels are rising mainly because
                                               ocean water expands as it warms, and water from melting major stores
                                               of land ice sheets and glaciers flow into the ocean. In the past century,
                                               average global sea level has increased by 17 to 21 centimeters (7 to 8

chapter 6                     CITY THAT WORKS
State’s Sea-Level Rise Guidance Document recommends using a range of
2 to 12-inch sea level rise increase by 2030 and 5 to 24-inch increase by
2050.
Available modeling tools show Novato’s low-lying agricultural lands adjacent
to San Francisco Bay are vulnerable to flooding with a 10-inch sea level rise
(much of this area is currently being restored to wetlands in the Hamilton
Wetland Restoration Project). Flooding becomes more pronounced under
storm and king tide scenarios. Although buildings and infrastructure do not
appear to be at risk with a 10-inch sea level rise, other assets may be at
risk, including underground facilities that have unprotected openings (tubes,
conduits, ventilation grates) and water and salt-sensitive electronic and
mechanical components that are at or below ground.
At 20-inch sea level rise, which is expected sometime during the second
half of the century, flooding is expected to impact the residential neighbor-
hood of Bel Marin Keys within the County of Marin’s jurisdiction (see Figure
CW-6). When coupled with a 20-year storm scenario, as shown in Figure
CW-7, some facilities and infrastructure appear to be at risk for flooding,
including State Route 37, the South Novato Electrical Substation and the
Novato Sanitary District. Although outside the Novato city limits, Gnoss
Field, a section of Binford Road, and the railway at the northern border of
Novato would also be impacted.
A vulnerability and risk assessment would provide a detailed mapping
of buildings, infrastructure, habitats, natural resources, and other assets
that would be impacted by sea level rise under various sea level rise and
storm scenarios, and would determine how vulnerable these assets are
to temporary flooding and permanent inundation. Strategies for long-term
adaptation to sea level rise include barriers (seawalls, levees, tidal gates),
elevated development (buildings, roads), floating development, floodable
development, nature-based solutions (horizontal levees, wetlands, dunes,)
and managed retreat. Planning for sea level rise involves not only protecting
existing structures and resources but ensuring new projects are designed to
adapt to potential sea level rise.

                                       6.4 PUBLIC SERVICES AND FACILITIES
                                       Novato residents and businesses are served by a variety of public services
                                       and facilities. Many services are provided by public agencies other than the
                                       City of Novato: water supply is provided by the North Marin Water District;
                                       wastewater collection and treatment, and trash collection and recycling
                                       are provided by the Novato Sanitary District; fire protection is provided by
                                       the Novato Fire Protection District; schools are provided by the Novato
                                       Unified School District; post-secondary education is provided by the Marin
                                       Community College District; and libraries are provided by the Marin County
                                       Free Library District. The Pacific Gas & Electric Company provides electricity
                                       and natural gas distribution, and Marin Clean Energy provides an alternative
                                       electricity source. City facilities include the City Hall, the administrative offices
                                       building, the police station, and the Corporation Yard. The location of these
                                       facilities is shown on Figure CW-8. City recreational and cultural facilities are
                                       described in the Living Well chapter.
                                       The City maintains a high level of communication and cooperation with other
                                       provider agencies, but each of them retains independent decision-making
                                       authority. Because the City cannot compel other agencies to take any specific
                                       actions or to comply with City policy, the General Plan does not include stan-
                                       dards for public services and facilities provided by other agencies.
                                       WATER
                                       The Novato Municipal Water District (NMWD) provides water service for
                                       the City of Novato as well as the surrounding unincorporated areas and
                                       portions of West Marin. Approximately 80 percent of the Novato water
                                       supply comes from the Russian River through the NMWD’s wholesale water
                                       supplier, the Sonoma County Water Agency. The remaining 20 percent
                                       comes from local runoff into Stafford Lake that is treated at the NMWD
                                       Stafford Water Treatment Plant, and a lesser amount of recycled water
                                       developed in cooperation with Novato Sanitary District and Las Gallinas

NMWD has an agreement in place with SCWA to provide sufficient supply
to meet Novato’s current and future water supply needs. However, there
continue to be competing interests for Russian River water, principally to
protect steelhead and salmon listed as threatened or endangered species
under the Endangered Species Act.
Water demand has been decreasing in the NMWD service area in recent
years and is substantially less than what the NMWD has projected in its
most recent 2010 Urban Water Management Plan. This is due to higher
conservation and lower levels of development than originally expected.
The Water District has already met the State-mandated goal to reduce per
capita water use by 20 percent by 2020. Building code and District regu-
lations for high efficiency water fixtures and water-efficient landscapes will
continue to reduce per capita water use.
 The water supply is adequate to meet the demand under General Plan
growth projections. New development offsets new water demand through

              infrastructure.
              WASTEWATER
              The Novato Sanitary District (NSD) is the wastewater service provider
              for the City of Novato and surrounding unincorporated area. In 2010,
              NSD completed a new consolidated wastewater treatment facility which
              combines the flows from two former treatment plants. The total permitted
              capacity for the new treatment facility is 7.0 million gallons per day (MGD).
              In 2012, NSD completed a new recycled water treatment facility with a
              treatment capacity of 1.7 MGD (peak). The plant can provide over 150
              million gallons of water annually for large landscapes, including Stone Tree
              Golf Course, Fireman’s Fund, a cemetery, parks and schools. The District’s
              goal is beneficial reuse of all of its treated wastewater.
              NSD’s collection system consists of over 240 miles of sewer lines and 40
              pump stations. The District continues to work on upgrades of the collection
              system and provides grants to homeowners to upgrade their sewer laterals.
              SOLID AND HOUSEHOLD HAZARDOUS WASTE AND
              RECYCLING
              Weekly garbage service is provided to Novato residents by Novato Disposal
              Service, Inc. through a contract with the Novato Sanitary District. Commercial
              collection is provided up to 6 days per week. Novato Disposal Service
              provides weekly residential curbside recycling, including yard waste and food
              waste composting. The Novato Recycling and Buyback Center accepts
              residential recyclable waste, and a household hazardous waste facility at the
              same location accepts household hazardous and electronic waste.
              Solid waste from Novato is taken to the Redwood Landfill and Recycling
              Center located north of the Novato city limit. The landfill is permitted
              to accept 2,140 tons of material per day and has a design capacity of
              26,077,000 cubic yards. The estimated closure date of the landfill is
              2036. Redwood has plans to install a landfill gas to energy plant, expand
              its composting facility, and build a construction and demolition materials
              recovery facility.
              SCHOOLS
              The City of Novato is served by the Novato Unified School District (NUSD)
              which operates seven elementary schools, one K-8 school, one K-8 charter
              school, two middle schools, two high schools, one alternative high school
              and one K-12 independent study program. School facilities are shown in
              Figure CW-12. All of the NUSD schools currently have sufficient space for
              all enrolled students. According to the 2012 NUSD Facility Master Plan, the
              majority of schools are operating below capacity.
              The Facility Master Plan projects future student enrollment for a ten-year
              period. These projections are based on historical and projected birth data

(used to project future kindergarten students), residential development
and student migration rates. The plan projects that school enrollment will
decrease by approximately seven percent through 2022. This is based
on current and projected declining local birth rates. Declining birth rates
are also being realized across the nation, California, and Marin County.
Projected district enrollment for the 2021-22 school year is 7,349 students.
The College of Marin, established in 1926, is a public community college
that serves Marin County residents. The college has two campuses,
the Kentfield Campus and the Indian Valley Campus in Novato. The
College of Marin acquired Indian Valley College in 1985 to form the Indian
Valley Campus, which occupies a 333 acre site containing 22 buildings.
Approximately 6,620 credit and non-credit students enrolled in the college
for the spring 2013 semester, a decrease of about nine percent from spring
2013.
CITY FACILITIES
City Hall is both a symbol of Novato and the seat of local government.
Originally built in 1896 as Novato’s first Presbyterian Church, the historic
structure was restored in 2009. City Hall anchors the Civic Center, which
includes a new administrative office building and City Green. The 23,000
square-foot administrative building, built in 2014 to LEED Silver standards,
is a modern building designed to complement the historic City Hall next
door. The police station is located across the street on Machin Avenue.
In addition to office buildings and recreational facilities, the City owns and
maintains 152 miles of streets, 144 miles of storm drain, 115 acres of active
use park land, 90 acres of landscaped median islands and roadside land-
scapes, and thousands of street signs and drainage catch basins. The City
is in the process of converting all of its 4,500 streetlights and exterior public
facility lights to high efficiency LED technology.
The City also owns several vacant and historic buildings. These include
the Hamilton Theater and Bachelor Officers’ Quarters in Hamilton and the
Novato Community House, Simmons House, Scott House and Hanen
House in Downtown. In 2016, the City concluded negotiations with the
federal government to release several Hamilton properties from deed
restrictions that had previously hindered their redevelopment. The historic
Downtown properties will require significant funding to renovate and are part
of an ongoing master planning process.

6.5 GOVERNANCE
The City of Novato’s government embraces its role of providing excel-
lent municipal services, preserving the City’s heritage and resources, and
managing change. Effective governance requires transparent and thoughtful
leadership, a skilled and professional staff, and an informed and engaged
community.
 Principles of good local governance include:
Community Participation: Community members are at the center of
public activity and are involved in clearly defined ways in decision making.
The local government utilizes commissions, committees, boards and other
groups to provide informed recommendations. All voices, including those of
the less privileged and most vulnerable, are heard and taken into account in
decision making. The voices of neighborhoods and those directly impacted
are considered as well as the broader community. There is always an
honest attempt to mediate between various legitimate interests and to reach
a consensus on what is in the best interest of the community and on how
this can be achieved.
Responsiveness: Public services are delivered, and requests and
complaints are responded to, within a reasonable timeframe.
                                                                              City Hall is the symbol of Novato and seat of
Efficiency and Effectiveness: The best possible use is made of the            the local government.
resources available. Results are evaluated to determine whether they
met agreed objectives. Systems are evaluated to determine whether it is
possible to enhance the effectiveness of services.
Openness and Transparency: Decisions are made in accordance with
rules and regulations. Information used to make decisions is made available
to the public in such a way as to allow community members to effectively
follow and contribute to the work of the elected officials.
Ethical Conduct: The public good is placed before individual interests.
Conflicts of interest are declared in a timely manner and persons involved
abstain from taking part in relevant decisions.
Competency and Capacity: Professional skills of staff are continuously
maintained and strengthened and there is a commitment to training and
development. Elected officials are supported and motivated to continu-
ously improve their work and knowledge through conferences, training, and
continuing education.
Innovation and Openness to Change: New and efficient solutions to
problems are sought and advantage is taken of technology to enhance
service delivery. There is a readiness to pilot and experiment with new
programs and to learn from the experience of others.
Sound Financial Management: Prudence is observed in financial
management, including in the use of loans, in the estimation of resources,
revenues and reserves, and in the use of funds. Budgets are prepared with
consultation of the public. Risks are properly estimated and managed. The
local government participates in inter-agency and public/private partnerships

                                                provide services.
                                                Accountability: All decision makers take responsibility for their decisions.
                                                Decisions are reported on and explained.
                                                CIVIC ENGAGEMENT
                                                The City of Novato has a long, rich history and practice of public outreach

                                                Council meetings, was an early adopter of video streaming Council meet-
                                                ings online, and it also adopted a larger public noticing radius than all
                                                nearby jurisdictions for development projects. In the past few years, the
                                                City has made key strides in building more robust tools for outreach and
                                                engagement, including revamping its website and launching an online
                                                forum, Open Novato, that provides another avenue for community members
                                                to provide input on citywide issues. The City’s communications efforts are
                                                broad, integral to all City departments and services, and ultimately affect the
                                                success or failure of a project, program, or initiative.
                                                The City strives to create an open process through which it can respond to
                                                its constituents’ needs while balancing competing interests and opposing
                                                views. It is also committed to treating all individuals with respect and
                                                providing courtesy and thoughtfulness in all interactions.
Novato was the first Marin city to televise and
livestream council meetings.
                                                CITY COUNCIL AND STAFF
                                                Novato is a general law city governed by a Council-Manager form of
                                                government. The City Council is elected by the community to make policy
                                                decisions for the City. The City Council sets priorities, approves the budget,
                                                and addresses citywide issues affecting the Novato community. City Council
                                                members are elected at large to overlapping, four-year terms. The Council
                                                members annually select the Mayor and Mayor Pro Tem (Vice Mayor). The
                                                Mayor signs official documents, chairs the Council meetings, and acts as
                                                the official head of the City at public and ceremonial occasions.
                                                The City Council appoints the City Manager, City Attorney, and City
                                                commissions, boards and committees. In the Council-Manager form of
                                                government, the City Council sets policy and the City Manager oversees the
                                                management and operations of all City departments and services.

              nity growth and infrastructure projects so development can be adequately
              served by transportation facilities.
                   MO 1a: Traffic Model. Continue to maintain a Citywide traffic model
                   to evaluate the balance between development and transportation.
                   Continue to assess the cumulative traffic impacts of development
                   proposals on the City’s transportation system.
                   MO 1b: Roadway Improvements. Adopt a list of improvements (Table
                   CW-2) that accommodates future growth consistent with the General
                   Plan, enabling the roadway system to operate safely and efficiently.
                   Prioritize construction of roadway improvements based on consider-
                   ation of relevant factors including, but not limited to, funding availability,
                   periodic analysis of traffic service levels, the location of new develop-
                   ment, and safety considerations.
                   MO 1c: Funding. Ensure that development contributes to funding and/
                   or implementing traffic mitigation measures. Continue to maintain and
                   periodically update the Citywide Traffic Impact Fee.

     MO 1d: Construction Impacts on Streets. Explore methods and options
     to secure funding for street maintenance based upon impacts associ-
     ated with use.
     MO1e: Traffic Signal Timing. Optimize traffic signal timing and demand
     coordination to improve traffic flow and reduce fuel consumption, pollu-
     tion and greenhouse gas emissions.
MO 2: Level of Service Standards. Establish traffic Level of Service
(LOS) standards as follows for use in evaluating the impacts of proposed
development projects so the project can be redesigned or effective miti-
gation measures can be implemented, making improvements to the
roadway system, and determining appropriate traffic impact fees. Continue
to consider LOS standards in evaluating traffic impacts in addition to any
consideration of standards associated with Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT).
     a. At intersections with signals or four-way stop signs: operation at
         LOS D,
     b. At intersections with stop signs on side streets only: operation at
         LOS E.
MO 3: Environmental Design of Transportation Improvements. Seek
to reduce impacts of new transportation improvements on open space
lands, recreational facilities and neighborhood integrity. When transporta-
tion improvements are expected to have negative impacts, seek to reduce
them through design changes or mitigation. Review proposed transportation
improvements to ensure that adequate measures will be implemented to
reduce to the maximum extent feasible any anticipated air quality, noise,
visual, or other impacts.
MO 4: Continuation of Streets. Facilitate the continuation of streets and
bicycle and pedestrian paths through developments wherever reasonable
and feasible to distribute traffic, improve emergency response options and
connect neighborhoods.
MO 5: Through Traffic on Existing Local Streets. Reduce through traffic
on existing local streets as needed and feasible to preserve the peace and
quiet of residential areas. Slow traffic through traffic calming techniques
where advisable and feasible.
     MO 5a: Traffic Calming Guidelines. Develop traffic calming design guide-
     lines that are acceptable to local emergency responders and evaluation
     and prioritization criteria. Consider inclusion of warranted projects in the
     capital improvement program budgeting process as funding permits.
     MO 5b: Clausing Avenue. Retain the existing no-access strip at the
     terminus of Clausing Avenue to preclude vehicular, bicycle and pedes-
     trian access from Landing Court.
MO 6: Design for Complete Streets. Incorporate Complete Streets prac-
tices in the planning, design and operation of the City’s circulation network     Complete streets are those that serve all users,
