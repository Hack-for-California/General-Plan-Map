                                INTRODUCTION
                    A. Overview of 2010 General Plan Update
1.        Long-Term Vision
The Gonzales 2010 General Plan is a long-range plan with a Urban Growth
Area containing approximately 2,150 acres of new land for urbanization.
An additional 2,130 acres of land is designated for urban reserve. The
urban reserve area is not intended for urbanization within the timeframe of
this general plan, but it completes the vision of what the city might look like
in the very long term. There are many reasons for the City’s decision to
establish a long-term planning horizon:
     •    To create a long-term vision to guide new development so that
          ultimately the increments of growth form into a coherent whole,
          becoming something more than a patchwork of large subdivisions.
     •    To preserve key sites essential to the long-term economic health of
          the city.
     •    To ensure a competitive market for development and avoid the
          monopolization of the city’s future development by any one of the
          large land owners within the General Plan area.
     •    To establish the ultimate boundaries of the city in order to identify
          the adjoining agricultural areas that should be reserved for
          permanent agricultural use.
The Gonzales 2010 General Plan is a plan for facilitating urban
development that provides jobs and housing for coming generations of
residents. While it creates the structure upon which new development can
proceed, it does not in itself seek to promote or curtail the rate of
population growth. It assumes that the rate of regional population growth is
largely dependent on external factors out of the City’s control, such as
fertility rates, rates of immigration, and the location and availability of jobs.
It assumes further that private market forces are the best gauge in
                                      Page I-1

GONZALES 2010 GENERAL PLAN                                           JULY 2010
determining the rate at which housing and jobs are to be provided. Finally,
it assumes that AMBAG growth projections are a mirror of the same larger
economic forces that drive private market decisions and that population
growth rates in Gonzales will track AMBAG growth forecasts because they
have historically been an accurate gauge of regional trends.
The Gonzales 2010 General Plan is designed to reorient the City’s approach
to planning from one that relies only on land use designations and density
controls to one that emphasizes neighborhood form and character. The
plan relies primarily on the subsequent adoption of specific plans to
implement the the plan’s long-term vision.
2.      Plan Purpose and Objectives
The Gonzales 2010 General Plan is the City's official policy statement for
the use of land and provides the basis for future decisions regarding the
City's growth and development. The plan provides a framework for
managing increased employment and housing growth while conserving
agricultural land, protecting the small town charm and diversity for which
Gonzales is known. It reflects the aspirations and values of Gonzales'
residents regarding the future form and character of the city. The City’s
vision statement adopted by the Gonzales City Council reads as follows:
        "Gonzales will continue to be a safe, clean, family-
        friendly community, diverse in its heritage, and
        committed to working collaboratively to preserve
        and retain its small town charm."
One of the most important purposes of the General Plan is to provide
direction to landowners and investors by clearly stating the City's
expectations for growth. The plan also provides guidance for public
investment in new facilities such as roads, parks, and public utility systems.
Once the General Plan is adopted, its maps and policies become the basis
for day-to-day decisions by elected officials and City staff, including
decisions on zoning changes and annexation.
As the name implies, the plan is general in nature. It provides broad
policies for development rather than site-specific instructions on where and
                                   Page I-2

JULY 2010                                                      INTRODUCTION
how to build. The document is specific enough to guide growth but
flexible enough to allow for adjustments at a site-specific level.
The Gonzales 2010 General Plan seeks to achieve the following objectives:
    Obj 1. Diverse, Self Sustaining Local Economy. The development of a
            city that has the size, excellence in urban design, and public
            services and facilities necessary to create a vibrant, diverse, and
            self-sustaining local economy and to provide a home for a
            diverse population;
    Obj 2. Long-Term Vision. The development of a city that has a
            coherent long-term vision of development that discourages
            incremental development decisions that could eventually result
            in an incoherent and/or sprawling urban form characterized
            primarily by a collection of residential subdivisions (Land Use,
            Circulation, and Conservation and Open Space elements);
    Obj 3. Small-Town Characteristics. The development of a city that has
            retained essential small-town characteristics by: 1) providing a
            variety of housing types to meet the housing needs of existing
            and new residents, and 2) establishing the highest residential
            densities at a range consistent with other small cities in the
            region (Land Use and Community Character elements);
    Obj 4. Discouragement of Suburban Sprawl. The development of a
            city that discourages low-density suburban development
            characterized by large, single-use housing subdivisions with
            separate car-dependent commercial services.
    Obj 5. Protection of Best Agricultural Lands. The development of a
            city that has a plan for growth that reduces development
            pressure on the highest quality agricultural lands in the
            planning area by promoting growth eastward toward the
            foothills and away from the Salinas Valley floor, by bounding
            urbanization with permanently protected agricultural land, and
            by encouraging compact urban form and the efficient use of
            land resources (Land Use, Circulation, Conservation and Open
            Space, Community Facilities and Services, and Community
            Character elements);

GONZALES 2010 GENERAL PLAN                                           JULY 2010
     Obj 6. Sustainability. The development of a city that has sustainable,
              energy efficient development that successfully manages
              greenhouse gas emissions consistent with state and regional
              goals by emphasizing compact urban form, high connectivity
              and mobility within and between neighborhoods, ample
              opportunity for walking and bicycle use, neighborhood retail
              and other neighborhood commercial uses within neighborhood
              centers to reduce vehicle use within the neighborhood, and
              otherwise designing for the efficient use of energy resources (all
              elements);
     Obj 7. Natural Environment. The development of a city that offers
              residents abundant opportunities to enjoy open space areas and
              the natural environment through the protection, re-creation,
              and enhancement of the area’s natural features (Land Use,
              Conservation and Open Space, and Community Character
              elements); and
     Obj 8. Competitive Development Environment. The development of a
              city with a Urban Growth Area containing land owned or
              controlled by a variety of interests, which is necessary to
              maintain a competitive environment for urban development
              (Land Use element).
                      B. Background and Planning Process
1.       The Gonzales 1996 General Plan
The previous general plan was adopted in July 1996. The Gonzales 1996
General Plan is regarded by city officials as a well-written, concise
representation of the city’s major goals and objectives. The Gonzales 1996
General Plan identified eight major planning themes that would be priorities
for the city: small-town character, agricultural heritage, unified town,
balanced growth, healthy downtown, opportunity for all residents, quality
public services, and build upon local strengths.
It’s notable that the theme of small-town character was identified in the
Gonzales 1996 General Plan as the one “perhaps the most important to its
                                    Page I-4

JULY 2010                                                                            INTRODUCTION
residents,” and the city has been successful in promoting this priority.
Both in terms of population growth and the consumption of land for
residential and non-residential uses, development of the city has essentially
                                                    1
kept pace with the 1996 projections.
The city has also made important strides in improving its historic downtown
as called for in the Gonzales 1996 General Plan. Streetscape improvements
along Fourth Street, including the large archway at Fourth Street and Alta
Street, diagonal parking, new street furniture, and sidewalk bulbouts have
made the downtown vibrant and attractive. A new sit-down restaurant in a
restored historic bank building has also contributed to making downtown
successful.
Yet, in at least one important way the city’s efforts to protect and enhance
small-town character have not been fully successful. The Gonzales 1996
General Plan established the intent to “encourage the design of new
neighborhoods that respect and continue small-town traditions.” This was
a concern in the Gonzales 1996 General Plan because recent new
“suburban” residential subdivisions east of Gonzales Slough were
considered by some residents as being out of character with Gonzales’
vision. More than a decade later, there is a consensus that more recent
subdivisions east of Highway 101 also suffer from many of the same
problems identified in the Gonzales 1996 General Plan.
With regard to the city’s agricultural heritage, the city lived within the
growth boundaries set in the Gonzales 1996 General Plan and in so doing
conserved farmland on the city’s perimeter. During this period, the city
worked successfully with property owners and agricultural businesses to
develop the new Gonzales Agricultural Business Park and to locate several
major new agricultural processors in the park further strengthening
agriculture as a key part of the city’s economic base.

  The Gonzales 1996 General Plan projected a need for 210 additional acres of land for residential use
to accommodate 1,050 new homes through 2015. Approximately halfway through the 20-year
planning period, actual housing units constructed consumed approximately 120 gross acres of
residential land producing 525 housing units. The Gonzales 1996 General Plan also projected a need
for 272 additional acres of land for non-residential use through 2015. Of this amount, 193 acres (70
percent) was designated for industrial use. Actual industrial growth to date utilized approximately 31
acres of industrial land.

The extension of “C” Street across Highway 101, while given prominence
in various places in the Gonzales 1996 General Plan as a way to unify the
east and west sides of Gonzales, was finally determined to be too costly as
the city and home builders came to grips with the project requirements.
Opportunities to strengthen the sense of community cohesion through
urban design were also only partly addressed as new subdivisions were
approved that significantly departed from the development patterns of the
“old” Gonzales west of Highway 101. Rear-yard garages, planter strips
with maturing trees, and grid patterned streets, gave way to streets lined
with garage faces, driveways and large curb cuts, sidewalks placed against
the street with fewer street trees, and curved streets and cul-de-sacs.
With regard to balanced growth and opportunities for all residents, the city
experienced mixed success. Significant new employment opportunities
were realized as new agricultural industry came to town, but new retail
business lagged. Two new apartment projects were built by non-profit
housing providers, in line with the city’s policy of promoting affordable
housing, but the majority of new single family housing was built within a
fairly narrow density and price range.
With regard to promoting a healthy Downtown, the city achieved notable
success. As a result of public improvements made along Fourth Street and
by investments in building maintenance and upgrades by a number of
businesses, including several façade improvement programs, the city’s
central business district has remained vibrant and attractive. The
Downtown Revitalization Committee, appointed by the City Council,
completed a careful assessment of the core area, identifying a number of
continuing problems as well as opportunities for further improvements. The
city supported downtown enhancement through several additional
professional studies of economics, parking and civic beautification.
Between 1996 and 2010 the city made remarkable progress in
improvements to all areas of public services. Police and fire services,
consistently viewed as high quality, kept pace with increasing demand. A
large, modern new Police Station was constructed in the downtown, and
the Fire Station was retrofitted to resolve earthquake safety issues. Extensive
street maintenance was performed in the older part of town and to south
Alta street and a decorative wall was constructed along the northwest
portion of the city to buffer residents from adjacent agricultural activities.

Two large new water reservoirs were constructed providing a significant
margin of security for the community. Sewer treatment capacity was
substantially increased to support full-buildout of the Gonzales 1996
General Plan. Drainage improvements along Gonzales Slough have
reduced flooding potential. A plan for major improvements to the Gloria
Road/101 interchange was completed and received approval of Caltrans, a
major step in improving access and safety to keep pace with planned
growth. Fifth Street remains a bottleneck between east and west Gonzales
and will require more attention in the future.
School capacity issues remain in the elementary and middle schools.
However, preliminary planning is well underway for a new elementary
school site east of Highway 101. A new joint-use gymnasium has been
completed at the middle school site, with funding and technical assistance
from the city. The city also completed construction of a small community
center building at Centennial Park, and acquired title to property for a new
multi-use community center adjacent to the new joint-use gymnasium. The
first phase of Canyon Creek Park was constructed along Gonzales Slough
and land was acquired for park expansion. Renovation of the community
swimming pool was completed. City recreational programs have been
increased in all areas. Improved cooperation between the city and
Gonzales Unified School District has significantly increased opportunities
for mutually supportive projects and resource sharing.
The city’s proximity to Salinas and Monterey and the major population
centers to the north, its location on Highway 101, its beautiful natural
setting, a reputation as a safe, friendly family oriented community with a
relaxed pace of life, and the availability of open land for development of
housing, business and industry, have all worked to bring pressure for
growth to the city. With this new growth has come many opportunities and
challenges for the citizens of Gonzales.
2.       General Plan Development in Two Phases
Phase I Efforts
In early 2004, the City Council called for a selective update of the General
Plan in two phases. Phase I was launched in May 2004 when the city
conducted a visioning process with the Gonzales Planning Commission to
                                     Page I-7

GONZALES 2010 GENERAL PLAN                                         JULY 2010
solicit ideas about the future of Gonzales and to identify needs that would
be the focus of an updated General Plan. In November 2004, the city
considered the preliminary results of analysis concerning population and
housing growth in Gonzales and discussed trends in urban planning and
neighborhood-based development. This latter topic was a subject of a joint
Planning Commission/City Council workshop in February 2005 conducted
with the assistance of the Local Government Commission.
Additional Phase I efforts included numerous community meetings with
local churches, the Chamber of Commerce, services clubs, the business
community, and farmworkers. City staff also coordinated with the
Monterey County Local Agency Formation Commission to solicit staff input.
Finally, city staff gathered comments from area property owners to gauge
their interest in the General Plan update process.
Phase II Efforts
Phase II of the General Plan Update, which began in October 2006,
focused primary attention on the development of new Land Use and
Circulation Diagrams, the development of a Sustainability Element, and the
selective update of policies and implementing actions in all the elements to
ensure internal consistency throughout the document. The city designated
strategic areas for industrial, commercial, and open space uses in the new
Land Use Diagram and required the subsequent development of specific
plans for the remaining large portions of the growth area within which
urbanization would occur on a neighborhood-by-neighborhood basis. The
city developed Specific Plan Procedures and Neighborhood Design
Guidelines as part of Phase II work to facilitate review and processing of
specific plan applications.
Citizens Advisory Committee and Other Public Outreach
A commitment to increase public participation was made in the early stages
of Phase II with the creation of the Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC).
The City Council appointed a 21-member Citizens Advisory Committee
(CAC) and charged it with the task of reviewing goals and objectives,
evaluating land use alternatives, and responding to policy options for the
future. The CAC began its work in May 2007 and completed its work after
15 meetings in 2009. The CAC included residents with a broad spectrum
                                    Page I-8
JULY 2010                                                      INTRODUCTION
of interests and perspectives. Representatives of local agricultural industry,
real estate, retail stores, downtown businesses, students, seniors, clergy, and
recreation interests were also included, along with members representing
the local school board, library, newspaper, environmental groups, historic
preservationists, the Hispanic community, and public safety agencies. The
CAC also included a number of interested citizens not affiliated with an
interest group who wished to become more active in shaping the
community's future.
All CAC meetings were open to the public and were advertised in the
Gonzales Tribune. Additionally, the city maintained a mailing list for non--
CAC members wishing to be notified prior to the meetings. The CAC
meetings were covered by the Gonzales Tribune and were typically
followed with articles in the weekly paper.
Other forums for public comment on the plan have been the Planning
Commission and City Council meetings, at which staff has provided
updates on work in progress. These meetings have also been well-
publicized in the Gonzales Tribune and have been televised on local
access cable. Groups with special interests have also contributed, primarily
through one-on-one interviews conducted over the course of the project.
These groups include housing advocates, farmers, social service agencies,
the school district, and representatives of local law enforcement and water
agencies.
Plan Deliberations and Adoption
Four alternative land use plans were developed during the spring and
summer of 2007. Each one envisioned a similar balance between
residential, commercial, and industrial growth, but each distributed growth
differently within the Planning Area. The Citizens Advisory Committee
(CAC) conducted workshops on the four land use alternatives and
developed a fifth alternative that represented the consensus of the CAC. In
fall 2009, the Planning Commission and City Council conceptually
approved the plan with minor modifications. This became the basis of the
preferred alternative studied in the General Plan environmental impact
report.

GONZALES 2010 GENERAL PLAN                                             JULY 2010
An Administrative Draft General Plan and EIR were reviewed by City Staff,
with several rounds of revisions made prior to public release. A Public
Review Draft General Plan and Draft EIR were published in April 2010.
The document was made available for public review and was circulated to
government agencies including the County of Monterey, the Association of
Monterey Bay Area Governments, the Gonzales Union and. Gonzales High
School Districts, and the Monterey County Local Agency Formation
Commission. The Gonzales City Planning Commission conducted public
hearings on the plan and EIR in _____ 2010. The Commission considered
written comments and oral testimony in their deliberations. After
recommending various changes, the Commission forwarded the document
to the Gonzales City Council. The City Council conducted a public hearing
on _____ 2010. The General Plan was adopted by the City Council on                _
2010. The result of this careful and inclusive process is a General Plan
which reflects the priorities of the residents and businesses of Gonzales.
                  C. Relationship to Other Plans and Programs
The California Supreme Court has called the general plan the “constitution
for future development.” The general plan expresses the community’s
development goals and embodies public policy relative to the distribution
of future land uses, both public and private. Accordingly, the General Plan
is part of the foundation for local regulations and actions that relate to the
city's future. These include the zoning ordinance, the subdivision
ordinance, public works projects, housing programs, development
approvals, and any specific plans or redevelopment plans that might be
adopted in the future. While all future actions cannot be anticipated by the
General Plan, the State Attorney General has opined that actions as listed
above must be consistent with the adopted General Plan. “Consistency” as
defined by the Attorney General (58 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 21, 25 (1975)) is as
follows: “An action, program, or project is consistent with the general plan
if, considering all its aspects, it will further the objectives and policies of the
general plan and not obstruct their attainment.” ( 2003 General Plan
Guidelines, p. 164).
The General Plan Guidelines cautions against the use of ambiguous policies
in a General Plan. “When writing policies, be aware of the difference
                                     Page I-10

JULY 2010                                                       INTRODUCTION
between “shall” and “should.” “Shall” indicates an un-equivocal directive.
“Should” signifies a less rigid directive, to be honored in the absence of
compelling or contravening considerations. Use of the word “should” to
give the impression of more commitment than actually intended is a
common but unacceptable practice. It is better to adopt no policy than to
adopt a policy with no backbone” (2003 General Plan Guidelines, p.15).
1.       Relation to Engineering Standards and Public Works
Implementation of the Gonzales 2010 General Plan relies heavily on
engineering standards and public works projects. The design of streets,
utility corridors, and drainage facilities has a major impact on
neighborhood form and character, and without close coordination between
planning and public works, much of the vision of the Gonzales 2010
General Plan would be lost. Government Code §65402 requires the
Planning Commission to review the conformity of public land acquisitions
or sales, street vacations, and construction of public buildings, with the
General Plan. Government Code §65401 empowers the City Council to
prepare and submit a list of all public works projects for study or
construction during each ensuing year. Such lists must be submitted to the
Planning Commission for review as to their conformity with the General
Plan.
2.       Relation to Zoning
The California Government Code (Section 65860) requires zoning
ordinances (including zoning maps) in general law cities to be consistent
with the General Plan. This does not mean that the maps and diagrams
need to be identical. This underscores the need to consult the text as well
as the Land Use Diagram when making land use decisions. Various
policies in the plan (addressing water and sewer extensions, road
improvements, etc.) provide guidance on when rezoning would be
appropriate.
There are other distinctions between the zoning ordinance and the General
Plan. First, boundaries on the General Plan map are generalized while
zoning boundaries typically follow parcel lines. Second, the General Plan
land use classifications are broader than the Zoning Ordinance
classifications. Multiple zoning districts may exist within a single General
                                    Page I-11

GONZALES 2010 GENERAL PLAN                                           JULY 2010
Plan classification, as long as all of the unit types allowed in each zoning
district are also permitted in the corresponding General Plan category.
3.       Relation to Subdivision Regulations
The Government Code specifies that cities may not approve a tentative or
final subdivision map unless the subdivision, including its design and
improvements, is consistent with the General Plan. Consistency may be
found only when the city has an adopted General Plan and the proposed
subdivision is compatible with its policies, programs, and land uses. This
includes consistency with the Open Space Element, which contains
provisions for parkland dedication or in-lieu fees. Where specific plans
have been adopted subsequent to the General Plan, subdivisions will also
need to be found consistent with those more detailed plans.
4.       Relation to California Building Codes
California law requires the city to adopt the California Building Codes in
the form approved by the state. However, the city can adopt variations from
the state codes in certain limited circumstances if justified by local
conditions. The General Plan is an appropriate vehicle for documenting
such local conditions and specifying the reasons that variations from State
law are required.
5.       Relation to Environmental Review Procedures
The General Plan is subject to the provisions of the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). An Environmental Impact Report (EIR)
was prepared to support the Gonzales 2010 General Plan. The EIR
evaluated and proposed mitigation measures for all significant adverse
impacts of the plan. Section 15080 of the State CEQA Guidelines requires
that consistency with the General Plan be considered during environmental
review for subsequent projects. The impacts of such projects will normally
be considered significant if they conflict with the adopted environmental
plans and goals of the city.

                      D. Definition of the Planning Area
The location of the City of Gonzales and its relation to the region is shown
in Figure I-1. The Planning Area and the existing Sphere of Influence is
shown in Figure I-2.
By law, the General Plan must cover all territory within the City limits as
well as land outside the city which "bears relation to its planning." Thus, the
Planning Area may extend beyond City limits. Planning for unincorporated
areas adjacent to the city provides a means for the city to inform land
owners in the area and other public agencies, especially the Monterey
County, of its concerns and intentions for the future. It also provides a
means for guiding the orderly extension of roads, services and utilities and
ensuring that appropriate limits to urban growth are maintained.

The Planning Area for the Gonzales 2010 General Plan includes all land
within the City limits and an area extending approximately one-mile
outside of the new General Plan area. The city has determined that land
use decisions within this area could affect its ability to achieve the basic
goals of this General Plan. The city will formally request an opportunity to
review and comment on development proposals submitted to the county
within the Planning Area to ensure consistency with the city’s General Plan.
Generally, it is the city’s intent that uses in the Planning Area should be
limited to continuation of existing uses and agricultural activities until
properties are formally annexed to the city for development purposes. The
Monterey County General Plan should be consulted for additional
information on this area.
                        E. Organization of this Document
The General Plan contains 10 chapters, including an introduction, eight
elements, and an implementation section. The Land Use Element describes
existing land uses in the city and presents concepts for the city's future
physical development. The Circulation Element addresses mobility issues,
including street improvements and provisions for trucks, bicycles,
pedestrians, rail, and mass transit. The Housing Element explores social,
economic, and housing conditions in Gonzales and develops policies and
programs to meet current and future affordable housing needs.
The Community Health and Safety Element focuses on natural hazards,
with policies protecting residents and property from earthquakes, floods,
fire, and other environmental hazards. The element also addresses city
police and fire services. It also addresses noise conditions in Gonzales and
incorporates measures to minimize future noise problems. The
Conservation and Open Space Element addresses historic and cultural
resources, vegetation and wildlife, parks, soil resources, water resources, air
resources, and open space.
The Community Services and Facilities Element profiles water, sewer,
drainage, solid waste, school, and library services and identifies how these
                                     Page I-19

GONZALES 2010 GENERAL PLAN                                          JULY 2010
services should be managed in the future. The Community Character
Element describes urban design issues in Gonzales. It includes provisions
to protect existing neighborhoods as well as provisions to ensure that new
development is attractive and appropriate.
The Sustainability Element addresses energy conservation and measures to
be taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions over the life of the plan. An
implementation chapter at the end of the document summarizes the
regulatory changes and other actions needed to carry out the plan.
Each element in the plan consists of text, maps, and other diagrams or
illustrations. The text includes a description of background conditions and
a discussion of future conditions which includes goals, policies, and actions
for the future. Goals describe ideal future conditions or end states ("clean
air and water") and are usually broad and abstract. Policies provide direct
guidance on decisions relating to these goals and suggest specific
implementation measures, or actions. In some cases, these actions are
explicitly stated following the policies, with responsible parties or timelines
identified.
An Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the General Plan has been
prepared and is available for review under separate cover. The EIR
includes mitigation measures for plan impacts, as well as an analysis of
plan alternatives.

                                  LAND USE
                                A. Introduction
1.       What Is the Land Use Element?
The Land Use Element presents the diagrams, designations, and policies
that will guide future land use decisions in Gonzales. Probably more than
any other plan element, the Land Use Element will have a major impact on
the form and character of Gonzales over the next 35 years or longer. Its
policies address such issues as conservation of residential neighborhoods,
urban expansion, economic development, maintenance of a healthy
downtown, and creation of quality new neighborhoods and business areas.
The requirements for the Land Use Element are spelled out in Government
Code Section 65302(a). The element must designate the general
distribution, location, and extent of land used for housing, business,
industry, open space (including agriculture and parks), education, public
buildings and lands, and waste disposal facilities. Standards for population
density and building intensity in each planning designation are required.
The Land Use Diagram in this Element designates the general extent of
development envisioned for the long term. The Land Use Diagram
embodies the goals and policies of the General Plan and as such is
definitive and has controlling effect in any balancing required to reconcile
the various and sometimes competing objectives conveyed by the narrative
and policies of the General Plan. Nonetheless, the narrative and policies of
the General Plan are, absent any implied objectives that compete with the
Land Use Diagram, definitive in their own right, and users of this document
are advised to refer to them as well as the diagram when evaluating
proposed development and capital improvement projects.
2.       Organization of the Element
The Land Use Element begins with a description of current land use
patterns in Gonzales. Both the regional and the local setting are
                                   Page II-1
GONZALES 2010 GENERAL PLAN                                           JULY 2010
considered. Current trends are examined to determine where the city may
be headed in the future. Issues relating to these trends are discussed.
The element proceeds with a vision of what Gonzales will be like 35 years
or more in the future. This vision is articulated first with population
projections and second with some basic concepts about how and where
development should take place. The Land Use Diagram illustrates these
concepts graphically and the text defines the various land use categories
and activities depicted on the diagram.
The final section of the element includes land use goals, policies, and
implementing actions. These statements respond to the various issues
identified by the Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC), the Planning
                                                                             -
Commission, the City Council, and the residents of Gonzales throughout
the General Plan program. They provide a means of protecting the city's
best qualities and enhancing the quality of life in the future.
                           B. Land Use Framework
1.       Physical Setting
The physical setting of Gonzales has shaped past development patterns and
will continue to do so in the future. The city is located in the central part of
the Salinas Valley, 16 miles south of the City of Salinas and 33 miles north
of King City. San Jose and San Francisco lie to the north, about 70 miles
and 120 miles respectively.
The combination of climate, soil, terrain, and water have made the Salinas
Valley one of the State's most productive agricultural regions for well over
a century. The valley is rich in history and has played a major role in
California's cultural development and its folklore. Its farms continue to be
major contributors to the State's economy and provide thousands of annual
and seasonal jobs, as well as secondary jobs in food processing and
agricultural businesses. At Gonzales, the valley floor is about six miles
wide, with fields of lettuce, broccoli, asparagus, strawberries, grapes,
nursery crops, and other field crops and vegetables planted nearly to the
base of the Sierra de Salinas on the west and the Gabilan Mountains on the
east. The city is surrounded on all sides by prime agricultural lands,
                                   Page II-2
JULY 2010                                                              LAND USE
although there is general recognition that the best soils lie to the west of
Highway 101.
The entire Salinas Valley is drained by the Salinas River, which originates
in the Coast Range south of King City and flows north to Monterey Bay.
The river is located about two miles west of Gonzales and is fed by a
number of creeks descending from surrounding hills and from sloughs
which cross the valley. One of these sloughs bisects Gonzales, creating a
natural drainageway through the city and providing some visual relief on
the otherwise flat terrain. The hills to the west of the valley are taller, more
dramatic, and more densely wooded than those to the east. The eastern
hills are drier and more rolling, as is typical of the large ranches that
dominate eastern Monterey County.
The valley is crisscrossed by a rectangular grid of mostly unimproved roads.
Highway 101 and the Union Pacific Railroad angle across this grid and
provide the main transportation arteries through the valley. River Road
runs from Gonzales to the western shoulder of the valley and provides
scenic vistas to citrus and avocado orchards, grazing land, and vineyards
on the slopes of the Sierra de Salinas, as well as expansive views across the
valley. Johnson Canyon Road runs from Gonzales to the valley's eastern
shoulder, with a number of ranches and dairies located in the vicinity. East
west roads run between the two sides of the valley at quarter-mile, half-
mile, or one-mile intervals bisected at right angles by north-south roads
running at similar intervals. The roads frame a patchwork quilt of farms
ranging in size from about 20 acres to several hundred acres. A complex
network of irrigation canals and furrows crosses the area, with water
pumped from the ground and from San Antonio and Nacimiento Reservoirs
to the south.
From Gonzales, the Salinas Valley appears expansive, stretching all the
way to the horizon on the north and south and well into the distance on the
east. Only the steep hills to the west are an obvious physical barrier.
Without terrain or water features defining the city's boundaries, edges are
formed for the most part by agriculture. Sometimes a road or highway
separates the urban edge from the surrounding farmland; in other cases,
there may only be a fence or an unmarked property line.
                                    Page II-3
GONZALES 2010 GENERAL PLAN                                         JULY 2010
Man-made features like highways and railroads also frame the edges of
Gonzales. The Union Pacific railroad tracks roughly define the western
boundary of the urbanized area, although some agricultural industry is
located west of the tracks. Iverson Road roughly defines part of the eastern
boundary, although new development east of Iverson Road adjacent to the
Johnson Canyon Landfill is also anticipated in the long term.
Given the lack of physical constraints and the precedent of new housing
and shopping areas east of Highway 101, Gonzales is a likely candidate for
additional growth during the coming decades. With the exception of
Chualar, an unincorporated farming town, and Chualar Canyon to the
northeast, Gonzales is the first community reached when traveling south
from Salinas and the Monterey Bay area. Driving time to Salinas is roughly
20 minutes, to Monterey about 30 minutes, and to the Southern Santa Clara
Valley about an hour. The 2000 Census reported that home prices in
Gonzales were 62 percent of the Monterey County median and were
significantly less than prices in the San Francisco Bay Area. In short, the
City is well-positioned for expansion.
2.      Existing Land Use
This section presents a profile of existing land uses in Gonzales. It
describes land uses at two geographic levels: the "Planning Area," which
encompasses the entire city, proposed urban expansion area, and
surrounding farm areas; and the "City," which encompasses only those
areas within the 2010 City limits.
Planning Area
According to the General Plan Guidelines (Government Code §65300), the
plan must cover the territory within the boundaries of the adopting city or
county as well as “any land outside its boundaries which in the planning
agency’s judgment bears relation to its planning.” The Gonzales Planning
Area extends about three miles in all directions from the City limits and
includes the City's wastewater treatment plant along the Salinas River. The
Planning Area is shown on Figure I-1 in Chapter I, Introduction.
On the north, the Planning Area includes the northern Highway 101
interchange and the agricultural areas along both sides of Associated Road.
On the south, the Planning Area extends beyond the southern Highway
                                    Page II-4

JULY 2010                                                            LAND USE
101 interchange and includes the agricultural areas on both sides of Gloria
Road. On the west, the Planning Area extends to the Salinas River to
include the wastewater plant (although the plant is not contiguous with the
rest of Gonzales, it is contained within the City limits). On the east, the
Planning Area extends into the foothills east of Iverson Road and the
Johnson Canyon Landfill.
The pace of new development in the Central Salinas Valley over the last
decade has created a need to define an expanded Planning Area, within
which the City can work to maintain an envelop of open space separating
Gonzales from its neighbors. The City has defined its Planning Area
broadly to convey this position, and land contained in the Planning Area
that is not designated for development should remain in open space and
agricultural use. Policies addressing this position are presented later in this
element.
The City of Gonzales, described below, occupies approximately 1,200
acres of the Planning Area. Outside the city and to the north, the Planning
Area contains vegetable crops on either side of the railroad and Highway
101. There are a number of farm homes, surrounded by clusters of mature
trees, but otherwise vistas are uninterrupted. There is a labor camp to the
west of the railroad and a gas station at the northern interchange of
Highway 101 at Associated Lane.
To the east of the City limits, land is planted in vegetable and row crops.
Parcel sizes tend to be larger than those to the north and there is a gentle
upslope to the east. Trees are absent, save for the occasional clusters
around farm houses. The picture is very much the same to the south,
where large farms and fields of row crops are uninterrupted to the Soledad
Correctional Facility. Beyond the city limits on the west, the Planning Area
includes a number of agricultural businesses and packing sheds along
Gonzales River Road and west of the Union Pacific tracks. To the north
and south of this area, large scale field crop and truck farms are
predominant. The City's wastewater treatment plant is located 1.7 miles
west of the Southern Pacific Railroad on the northeast bank of the Salinas
River.

GONZALES 2010 GENERAL PLAN                                            JULY 2010
Parcel sizes outside the City limits tend to be large. Most are larger than 40
acres and several even exceed 500 acres. There has been virtually no rural
residential ("ranchette") development on the city's perimeter. As a result,
the transition from urban uses to farmland is abrupt in most places. The
large size of the surrounding parcels suggests that much of Gonzales' future
growth will be in developments larger than those built in the past. Given
the impacts of such development on the city's character and services,
phasing plans will be critical when new projects are proposed.
Land use patterns outside the City limits create a number of conditions that
will affect how and where Gonzales expands. As mentioned earlier,
growth immediately north of the city was blocked in 1991 by acquisition of
an agricultural easement along the northern City limits. Growth to the
west, at least residential growth, is difficult because of the Union Pacific
Railroad and the established presence of industry in the area. Westerly
growth is further constrained by an agricultural easement on a 540-acre
ranch just beyond the current City limits. Because of noise concerns, the
existing industrial character of the area, and the difficulty of increasing
traffic at grade-level railroad crossings, the area west of Gonzales is not
well-situated for new urban development.
By contrast, the areas to the northeast, southeast, and east of the City are
relatively unconstrained. The only existing land uses are agricultural, and
there are very few physical or man-made barriers other than Highway 101,
which makes the area well-suited for expansion.
The City
Over the past 13 years, the City of Gonzales has added approximately 600
acres of land into its incorporated area. Approximately one-third of this
new area has been dedicated to residential use east of Highway 101 and
one-third has been dedicated to industrial use west of Alta Street.
Overall, residential use in Gonzales represents approximately one-third of
all land use, and of this amount about 80 percent is single-family
residential housing. Industrial use represents almost 13 percent of land use.
Streets and highways represents approximately 17 percent, and public/semi
public use (including the wastewater treatment plant) represents

                             approximately 8 percent). Commercial use represents about two percent of
                             land use.

While there is some mixing of land uses in Gonzales, most of the
residential, industrial, commercial, and public areas are clearly separated.
The City's physical form reflects its various stages of development. The
core of Gonzales is the original townsite, extending four blocks by ten
blocks, with streets aligned parallel and perpendicular to the railroad.
West of the original townsite, land uses are industrial in character, with
packing sheds, agricultural implement and machinery shops, and similar
uses predominating. East of the original townsite and beyond the Slough,
Centennial Park and the city's three public schools provide a buffer to the
newer subdivisions beyond. The newest development lies east of Highway
101, where the California Breeze subdivision is located south of Fifth
Street, and Arroyo Estates, Sunrise Ranch, and the Gonzales Shopping
Center are located to the north. South of the original townsite, the City
limits taper and form a right triangle. The area contains apartments, a large
winery, a cemetery, a feed store, an electrical shop, a vegetable processing
plant, and vacant land.
The existing City is built on virtually flat terrain, with the Gonzales Slough
providing the only significant relief. The Slough flows in its natural channel
through much of the City, but is culverted in some areas. In most places,
grasses, wildflowers, and mostly non-native plants grow along the banks.
Monterey pines and pepper trees have been planted along the banks in
some residential yards. Although a trail runs along the Slough for some of
this length, it is non-continuous and the area has never officially been
dedicated as a public park.
The new growth area identified in this General Plan Update lies east of the
existing city and gently slopes upward toward the foothills of the Gabilan
Mountains. The area contains prime agricultural soils that decrease in
value as they extend away from the city toward the foothills. The area is
actively farmed (row crops and vineyards), and much of the area east of
Iverson Road is used to raise livestock. The Johnson Canyon Landfill is also
located east of Iverson Road. The new growth area is bisected by Johnson
Canyon Creek, which is the major drainage through the area. There are
also minor drainages along the northern perimeter of the area adjacent to
Associated Lane and along the southern perimeter adjacent to La Gloria
Road. In most cases, these drainages have been channelized into
                                   Page II-11

agricultural drainage ditches, with little evidence remaining of the natural
topography that originally existed.
3.      Areas Subject to Flooding
According to Government Code 65302 (a), the Land Use Element shall
“identify areas covered by the plan which are subject to flooding and shall
be reviewed annually with respect to those areas.” The areas within the
Gonzales Planning Area that are subject to flooding are shown in Figure II-
2 below. A full discussion of flood control issues and policies is presented
in Chapter V, Community Health and Safety.

4.       Principal Issues
With a population of about 8,800 and about two square miles of land area,
Gonzales is still a relatively small town. However, the City’s population
has increased by 50 percent and its land area by 100 percent in the last 15
years. Given the rate of population growth predicted for Monterey County
during the next few decades, Gonzales will probably continue expanding
                                                     st
rapidly through much of the early and middle 21 Century.
The same qualities that have made the Salinas Valley attractive for
agriculture for more than a century now make it an attractive location for
urban growth. The flat terrain and loamy soils are easily developed and the
uncongested roadways, relatively inexpensive real estate, and proximity to
employment centers to the north are attractive to prospective homebuyers.
The lure of affordable housing and a "small-town lifestyle" drew new
residents to all of the Salinas Valley cities during the 1990s and early
2000s. At the same time, the prospect of steady work and a better life have
continued to fuel immigration from Mexico and other Latin American
countries. While this migration has a very different economic origin, it too
creates the need for land to support new housing and business.
Today, Gonzales is at a crossroads; the future holds many possibilities. The
City could become more urban in character, with large-scale residential
development on its perimeter. It could focus on economic development,
investing in infrastructure to attract new business and industry. It could
capitalize on its freeway interchanges, creating new highway-oriented
activity centers. It also could discourage growth altogether. In determining
the best option for the future, a number of issues become apparent. These
are addressed in this element through policies and action programs.
One of the primary challenges for Gonzales today is the creation of viable
new neighborhoods that function well in relation to existing neighborhoods
and that reinforce the community’s sense of itself. The Gonzales 1996
General Plan saw this challenge in terms of maintaining “small-town
ambiance” and sought to achieve this goal by limiting the City’s ultimate
size to about 10,000 residents. This approach, however, is being
overwhelmed by regional growth pressures that dwarf the demands that
                                    Page II-15

GONZALES 2010 GENERAL PLAN                                           JULY 2010
were placed on the City in the 1990s. Now, the greater threat posed to
Gonzales’ small-town ambiance is incremental growth that, in the absence
of a long-term vision, could result in a large patchwork of disconnected
subdivisions. The basic challenge then is one of creating a vision within
which market forces are encouraged to move beyond the incremental
utilitarianism of subdivisions to the broader scope of neighborhood and
community building.
The Gonzales 2010 General Plan adds approximately 4,280 acres of
potentially developable land to the existing City of approximately 1,200
acres, which represent approximately more land than needed to
accommodate urban development at rates projected by AMBAG. Of this,
approximately 2,130 acres lies within an Urban Reserve Overlay
designation. This land is not available for development within the time
frame of this General Plan but is included to show a longer-term vision of
how the City may develop over time. The new growth area encompasses
properties whose owners have expressed a long-term interest in urban
development and forms the basis of the ultimate vision of a coherent and
well-designed city. While much of the detailed planning for this sizable
area will be undertaken through the development of future Specific Plans in
the decades to come, this General Plan update has identified major centers
for new industrial and commercial development that are strategically
located for easy access and expansion and sized to serve for the long term.
Closely aligned with the issue of overall growth and vision is the character
and quality of new development. Preserving small-town character also
means encouraging new development that is compatible with what is there
now. In fact, some of the development that has taken place in Gonzales in
the past 20 years has not been sympathetic to the town's character. Much
of the newer multi-family development is regarded as boxy and
unattractive, and sometimes inappropriately dense for its setting. The larger
single family developments, while more highly regarded, do not reflect the
character or ambience of a small town. Members of the Advisory
Committee, as well as Planning Commissioners and Council members,
expressed a strong interest in encouraging new development that more
closely matched the existing community fabric.
There is also a strong interest in attracting jobs, as well as housing, to the
community. Because of its location and cheaper land prices, Gonzales is
                                    Page II-16

JULY 2010                                                             LAND USE
vulnerable to becoming a bedroom community for Salinas and the
Monterey Peninsula. This would probably result in City expenses
increasing faster than the local tax base and could strain local services. To
be competitive in attracting business, Gonzales needs industrially and
commercially designated land, as well as additional water and sewer
capacity.
Another land use issue is the emergence of an "East" and "West" Gonzales
as more and more development occurs east of Highway 101. Without
careful planning, the area east of the freeway could develop as virtually a
separate city. The economic health and future of Downtown Gonzales is
also of concern, particularly as new commercial developments are
constructed in developing areas. The market niche once filled by the
downtown will change as outlying centers are built. To survive, the area
must remain attractive and convenient and must capitalize on its strengths
and unique qualities.
The use of the Gonzales Slough and other historic drainages brings up
other issues related to the City's future. These drainages serve many
purposes--drainage, flood control, plant and animal habitat, and passive
recreation (walking, biking), among them. Future land use decisions could
affect these functions as well as the long-term character and environmental
quality of the area. Planning is complicated by ownership and
jurisdictional issues. Some sections are privately owned; others are owned
by the City or School Districts. Activities are subject to review or
permitting by a number of agencies, including the Army Corps of
Engineers, State Department of Fish and Game, Regional Water Quality
Control Board, and Monterey County Water Resources Agency.
Numerous natural resource issues also influence land use in Gonzales.
Foremost among these are the protection of prime agricultural lands, air
quality, and the availability of water. These are all regional issues and they
affect all of the cities in the Salinas Valley, as well as many other cities
throughout the county and state. Agriculture has been Gonzales' lifeblood
since the town was founded, and it is still the economic mainstay of the
community. The City would like to retain its agricultural roots even as the
economy diversifies and the population grows. This not only requires a
development pattern which minimizes urban sprawl onto farmland, but
                                     Page II-17
GONZALES 2010 GENERAL PLAN                                         JULY 2010
also one which minimizes conflicts between urban and agricultural uses on
the perimeter of the City.
                             C. Land Use Concept
1.       Projections
Projections are used to estimate how much land will be needed for new
housing and employment in Gonzales. Overall projections for the
Monterey Bay Area are based on factors like employment, birth and death
rates, and migration trends. In Monterey County, these factors are expected
to bring the 2009 population of 431,892 up to around 530,362 by the year
2035 (AMBAG 2008).
The Association of Monterey Bay Area Governments (AMBAG) takes the
figures for the region as a whole and allocates them to cities based on
factors like local growth policies, specific development plans, and the
availability of public services. These projections are periodically updated
as new developments are approved, economic conditions change, and
General Plans are updated. AMBAG's most recent projections (2008)
showed Gonzales growing to 23,418 people in the year 2035, an increase
of about 14,393 over the current 2009 population of 9,025 persons.
This plan designates slightly more than 1,400 acres of additional land for
residential growth, or enough land to accommodate a total City population
of about 37,000. Complete development of all of this land, referred to as
"buildout" or "holding capacity," should not occur before the year 2050,
provided current AMBAG growth rates hold true. The excess land is
provided to give the housing industry some flexibility in selecting sites and
to recognize that not all landowners with property bearing "neighborhood
residential" plan designations intend to sell or develop their properties by
2035. Some of the land designated for housing is likely to remain in
agricultural production throughout the planning period.
Because the land supply exceeds projected growth demand, it is important
that new development is phased and that development only be allowed if it
is contiguous with existing development or is located within a new
neighborhood developed under a Specific Plan that sets forth orderly
                                   Page II-18
JULY 2010                                                             LAND USE
development consistent with the approved Neighborhood Design
Guidelines and Standards and Community Character policies. This will
ensure that the City does not suddenly grow much faster than desired and
will also allow urban services to keep pace with growth. Although a
growth management system (limiting the number of new homes that may
be built each year) is not proposed at this time, the need for such a system
should be evaluated from time to time in the future. If Gonzales appears to
be using up its land supply much faster than anticipated, it may become
necessary to regulate the rate of growth.
AMBAG also projects employment for cities and counties in the Monterey
Bay Area. The number of jobs in the Gonzales area is projected by
AMBAG to increase from approximately 1,063 in 2010 to 1,324 in 2035.
This employment projection is at substantial variance from the projections
of this General Plan; the 310 jobs that AMBAG says will be added over the
course of 25 years does little more than account for the number of new
jobs that would be created by the school district and the City to
accommodate new development. A total of approximately 5,400 jobs
could be accommodated by this General Plan at buildout if commercial
and industrial designated land is utilized up to 80 percent.
2.      Neighborhood-Centered Growth through Specific Plans
Neighborhoods provide important focal points for social interactions,
which are the basis for healthy communities and strong economies. A
well-designed neighborhood contains activity centers like schools, parks,
community facilities, and small-scale retail and commercial services—all
within easy walking distance. A well-designed neighborhood also provides
a variety of housing types that creates an interesting residential character
suited to a variety of living situations and income status. For all these
reasons, the General Plan uses the neighborhood as the fundamental
building block for new development.
Implementation of the neighborhood strategy will occur through the
approval of Specific Plans. Each Specific Plan will be required to contain
one or more neighborhoods and be designed consistent with adopted
                                     Page II-19

GONZALES 2010 GENERAL PLAN                                                    JULY 2010
Neighborhood Design.2 Smaller properties (i.e., less than 125 acres) would
be grouped to form a neighborhood or allowed under prescribed
conditions to “attach” to an existing Specific Plan area by filing an
addendum to the adopted Specific Plan.
For the purpose of the Gonzales 2010 General Plan, a neighborhood is
approximately 3/8-mile radius in size, a size that reflects the current scale
of residential neighborhoods in the historic area of town west of Highway
101. Also neighborhoods would usually contain at least the following:
    9    One centrally-located elementary school (in some cases, a middle
         school),
    9    One centrally-located neighborhood park,
    9    A full mix of residential types, and
    9    Neighborhood-serving commercial and civic uses and public
         services.3
Any given neighborhood may also include community-wide facilities such
as major parks, high school campuses, or places of worship.
Figure II-3 shows a prototypical neighborhood.
2
  The community commercial core mixed-used area would be the subject of a
specialized Specific Plan designed to facilitate community commercial and retail
core uses. Specialized Specific Plans would be also required for highway
commercial, light industrial/business park and heavy industrial/manufacturing
areas as set forth in Implementing Action LU-2.1.2 – Commercial/Industrial
Specific Plans.
3
  Neighborhood-serving commercial may be designed to serve two neighborhoods,
and where this is the case, one of the neighborhoods might not contain such uses
(see Policy LU 8.8). In order to maintain a scale appropriate to a residential setting,
individual neighborhood commercial uses should generally be small-scale, which
typically would be less than 5,000 square feet for any individual commercial use.
Commercial uses may occasionally be larger as appropriate. Mixed commercial
uses are encouraged within neighborhood centers and should be pedestrian-
oriented uses that serve the immediately surrounding area. These may include
walk-in uses such as restaurants, retail stores, health/fitness facilities, personal
services, community service organizations, and similar uses. Auto oriented uses
with drive-through travel lanes are discouraged as they are inconsistent with the
pedestrian oriented character of neighborhood commercial centers.

3.       Land Use Diagram
The Land Use Diagram for Gonzales is comprised of one large-scale
diagram showing the entire Planning Area (Figure II-4), plus three inset
diagrams showing more detail in key areas (Figures II-5, II-6, and II-7). The
Planning Area depicted in the diagram is approximately 19,200 acres and
contains a growth area of approximately 4,280 acres. Of this, 2,150 acres
is available for urbanization within the horizon of this General Plan and is
referred to as the “Urban Growth Boundary.” The remaining 2,130 acres is
unavailable for urbanization within the horizon of this general plan and is
subject to an “Urban Reserve Overlay.” The urban reserve area is regarded
as the most likely path for long-term development and is included in the
Land Use Diagram to give expression to the the City’s long-term vision for
growth.
Existing and future capacity estimates for the Urban Growth Area are
shown in Table II-2 and Table II-3, respectively, and are primarily intended
to demonstrate the rough extent of growth enabled by the Gonzales 2010
General Plan. These capacity estimates are not intended as a projection or
forecast of the rate of population or employment growth.

Most of the City's near-term employment growth is anticipated in the
industrial area west of Alta Street and north of Gonzales River Road. A
variety of businesses are accommodated there, including both agriculturally
                                   Page II-34
JULY 2010                                                           LAND USE
related and non agriculturally related enterprises. In the longer term, the
north and south interchanges are envisioned as accommodating highway-
oriented commercial uses, as well as industrial uses.
One of the principal features of the Land Use Diagram is the creation of a
Community Commercial Mixed Use designation to complement and
extend the Downtown Mixed Use designation into the growth area east of
Highway 101 in the vicinity of Johnson Canyon Road and Fanoe Road.
The extent of proposed residential expansion accommodated in the
General Plan Update requires commercial and office uses beyond the
capacity of the existing Downtown to accommodate. Development of a
community commercial area in the vicinity of Johnson Canyon Road
provides room to expand commercial and office uses and creates a strong
connection to the existing Downtown Area. The area would be designed
to complement and reinforce the character of Downtown. Big-box retail
and other commercial uses geared toward highway users would be
discouraged in this location in favor of community-oriented retail, office,
and higher density residential uses organized around a “Village
Center/Main Street” concept.
The plan shows the Gonzales Slough, the Johnson Canyon Creek, and other
drainages as major linear open space in the city, providing areas for flood
control, recreation, and natural habitat conservation.
Existing residential neighborhoods in Gonzales will remain largely
unchanged under the plan. Most of the existing single family housing areas
are designated as Low Density Residential, while the neighborhoods with
intermixed single family homes, duplexes, triplexes, and fourplexes are
designated as Medium Density Residential.
                          D. Land Use Designations
The 18 designations shown on the Land Use Diagram are described below.
Each description indicates the general types of uses that are intended in
areas with these designations. The descriptions are broad enough to allow
flexibility and are subject to more specific regulation and interpretation
through Specific Plans or zoning.
                                  Page II-35

GONZALES 2010 GENERAL PLAN                                          JULY 2010
Standards for development intensity are provided for each designation. For
residential uses, intensity is expressed in terms of the allowable range of
dwelling units per gross acre. Gross acreage includes all land (including
streets and rights-of-ways) designated for a particular residential use, while
net acreage excludes streets and rights-of-way. Normally, gross acreage
contains about 25 percent less land for its designated use than its net acre
equivalent.
For commercial and industrial uses, intensity is expressed in terms of Floor
Area Ratio (FAR). FAR is the gross floor area of structures on a site divided
by the site area. For instance, an FAR of 0.5 would allow a 5,000 square
foot building on a10,000-square-foot parcel. The intensity standards define
the maximum levels of development permitted. However, these
maximums do not establish entitlement to a specific level of development
without first conforming to all other City policies and development
standards.
1.       Low Density Residential (4-7 units per gross acre)
The primary purpose of this designation is to define those areas that are
appropriate for single family detached homes. Residential densities from 4
to 7 units per gross acre are permitted. Single family houses are the
predominant use, although duplexes are allowed where they meet the
density standard and the character of the neighborhood already reflects a
mix of housing types. The zoning district that most closely corresponds to
this General Plan designation is the R-1 Single Family District. This
designation has been applied to 429 acres in the Gonzales Planning Area,
including about 297 acres that are already developed.
2.       Medium Density Residential (8-12 units per gross acre)
The primary purpose of this designation is to define those areas that are
appropriate for new duplexes, triplexes, fourplexes, and townhouses, as
well as those areas that are already developed with a mixture of single
family homes, in-law units, and various attached housing types.
Residential densities from 8 to 12 units per gross acre are permitted. This
designation has been applied to 47 acres of land in Gonzales, including 39
acres that have already been developed.

3.      High Density Residential (13-24 units per gross acre)
The primary purpose of this designation is to define those areas that are
appropriate for multi-family residential uses, as well as those areas that are
already developed with such uses. Residential densities of 13 to 24 units
per gross acre are permitted. This designation has been applied to 10 acres
of land in Gonzales, including two acres that have already been developed.
4.      Neighborhood Residential (3-24 units per gross residential acre)
The primary purpose of this designation is to define those areas that are
appropriate for new residential development within the context of a
neighborhood. The Neighborhood Residential designation, which is
applied only within new growth areas, includes a full range of housing
types typically found in healthy and diverse neighborhoods. The
Neighborhood Residential designation shall be implemented only through
the development of a Specific Plan. The mix of residential uses shall be
within the parameters set forth in Table II-4 below, and the average
residential density within a neighborhood shall be between seven (7) and
nine (9) dwelling units per gross acre. This land use designation has been
applied to approximately 980 acres of the new growth area added as part
of the 2010 General Plan Update.

5.        Neighborhood Commercial Mixed Use
The primary purpose of this designation is to define those areas that are
appropriate for new commercial development appropriately scaled to serve
one or two neighborhoods. This designation is applied only within new
growth areas and shall be implemented only through the development of a
4
  A minimum average density of seven (7) dwelling units per gross residential acre shall be
provided within new neighborhoods.
5
  To promote rental availability rather than private ownership, units designed for rental use
shall generally be multiple units on single parcels rather than individually parceled.
6
  Allowable only in very limited circumstances where larger lots may be appropriate to buffer
the City’s edge and transition from urban density to permanent agriculture.
7
  Rental units in this category shall generally be second dwelling units that are ancillary to a
primary home, and both contained on a single parcel.

JULY 2010                                                                LAND USE
Specific Plan. In order to maintain a scale appropriate to a residential
setting, individual neighborhood commercial uses should generally be
small-scale, which typically would be less than 5,000 square feet for any
individual commercial use. Commercial uses may occasionally be larger
as appropriate. A mix of residential and commercial uses are allowed in
this designation. Commercial uses should be pedestrian-oriented uses that
serve the immediately surrounding area and may include walk-in uses such
as restaurants, retail stores, health/fitness facilities, personal services,
community service organizations, and similar uses. Auto oriented uses
with drive-through travel lanes are discouraged as they are inconsistent
with the pedestrian oriented character of neighborhood commercial
centers. Second-story residential uses are also allowed in the
Neighborhood Commercial designation. The physical form of buildings in
the neighborhood center should be distinguishable from the form of the
residential neighborhoods that surround them, and buildings within the
Neighborhood Commercial designation should in most cases be two
stories. The maximum floor area ratio is 1.0. This land use designation has
been applied to approximately 13 acres of the new growth area added as
part of the 2010 General Plan Update.
6.       Neighborhood
The primary purpose of this designation is to provide a template for new
neighborhoods in areas where detailed land uses are not defined as part of
a General Plan Land Use Diagram Inset. The Neighborhood designation
comprises a mix of uses typically found in healthy, viable neighborhoods,
including a full range of housing types, retail and service commercial,
public parks, civic uses, places of worship, schools, public utilities, and
other public, quasi-public, and institutional uses. Land use intensities for
non-residential uses shall be a maximum of 1.0 Floor Area Ratio.
Residential uses shall be consistent with the parameters set forth in the
Neighborhood Residential designation (set forth above), including the full
mix of required residential uses. Commercial uses shall be consistent with
the parameters set forth in the Neighborhood Commercial Mixed Use
designation (also set forth above). For standards and recommendations
concerning other uses within the Neighborhood designation, see the
following chapters: for public parks see Chapter VI; for schools see Chapter
VII.

GONZALES 2010 GENERAL PLAN                                          JULY 2010
The Neighborhood designation shall be implemented only through the
development of a Specific Plan, and the precise mix of uses shall be
determined through the Specific Plan process. This land use designation
has been applied to approximately 450 acres of the new growth area added
as part of the 2010 General Plan Update, primarily in the area east of
Fanoe Road and Herold Parkway. This designation is also widely used in
the urban reserve area.
7.       Downtown Mixed Use
The primary purpose of this designation is to promote the integrated
development of retail, service, banks, public, office, and housing
development in downtown Gonzales. It is specifically intended to foster
mixed use projects that maintain downtown as the civic and cultural focal
point for the City, as well as an active retail area. Such development
should be pedestrian-oriented, compatible with the goal of maintaining
downtown's historic character, and oriented towards local residents. A
maximum Floor Area Ratio of between 0.5 and 3.0 applies in areas with
this designation. Residential densities shall be a maximum of 24 dwelling
units per gross acre.
The designation has been applied to 18 acres, primarily encompassing the
existing blocks along Alta Street between Eighth Street and C Street. While
virtually all of the land is already developed, much of it is underutilized
and could be used more intensely. In some cases, this might occur through
demolition and rebuilding. More commonly, this would occur through
rehabilitation and retrofitting of older buildings.
8.       Community Commercial Mixed Use
The primary purpose of this designation is to promote the development of a
viable commercial core area that complements and extends the historic
downtown area into the new growth areas identified in the Land Use
Diagram. Allowed uses in this designation include: retail commercial,
service commercial, professional offices, sit-down restaurants, cafes, movie
theaters, medical facilities, medium- and high-density housing (including
mixed-use residential), and other uses that are compatible within a core
area environment. Such development should be pedestrian-oriented,
compatible with the goal of complementing but not competing with the
                                    Page II-40
JULY 2010                                                         LAND USE
downtown area's civic character, and oriented towards both local residents
and regional visitors.
This new land use designation may be implemented only through the
development of a Specific Plan. Land area devoted to single-family
attached and multi-family homes shall not occupy more than 35 percent of
the community commercial core area. A maximum Floor Area Ratio of 1.5
applies in areas with this designation. This designation has been applied to
90 acres of land in Gonzales in the vicinity of Johnson Canyon Road east of
Fanoe Road. Figure II-5 shows a prototype of the community commercial
development.

9.       Highway Commercial
The primary purpose of this designation is to define commercial areas that
cater to highway travelers and/or regional markets, including big-box retail,
fast-food restaurants, lumber yards, motels, auto malls, building contractor
storage yards, and other uses that serve local and regional needs for goods
and services. The designation is intended primarily for service and retail
uses whose operational needs and characteristics are not considered
appropriate for the downtown or the community commercial mixed-use
areas. The maximum permitted Floor Area Ratio is 0.5.
The designation has been applied to 46 acres of land in Gonzales,
including the existing shopping centers on Fifth Street east of Highway 101,
and east of the southern Interchange with Highway 101. This designation
is also used in the urban reserve area.
10.      Light Industrial/Business Park
The primary purpose of this designation is to define those areas that are
appropriate for “job centers” in the new growth area. Allowed uses
include: campus-like office complex development as well as industrial
parks, including single and multi-story office, flex-space, and industrial
building for single and multiple users, light industrial and warehouse uses,
and research and development activities. Other uses may include
wholesale, bulk retail, and business with limited customer access,
commercial recreation, and other uses that require large, warehouse-style
building. Small-scale retail and service uses serving local employees and
visitors may be permitted as secondary and accessory uses. This new land
use designation may be implemented only through the development of a
Specific Plan.
The designation has been applied to 20 acres of land in Gonzales located
east of the northern and southern interchanges with Highway 101 and
adjacent to the Johnson Canyon Road Landfill. This designation is also
used in the urban reserve area.

GONZALES 2010 GENERAL PLAN                                          JULY 2010
11.     Industrial/Manufacturing
The primary purpose of this designation is to define those areas that are
appropriate for heavy industrial and manufacturing uses, the location of
which may create land use conflicts with residential uses and schools. The
emphasis is on agricultural services, but other types of industry compatible
with the policies in the General Plan are encouraged. The designation
permits industrial parks, light manufacturing, warehousing, wineries, auto
and farm equipment sales or repair establishments, feed stores,
lumberyards, construction supply companies, and similar and compatible
uses. Compatible highway-serving uses like gas stations, restaurants,
motels, and truck stops are permitted in this area. The maximum permitted
Floor Area Ratio is 0.5.
The designation has been applied to 467 acres of land in Gonzales,
including 325 acres of land west of Highway 101 and 147 acres of land
east of Highway 101. This designation is also used in the urban reserve
area.
12.     Public/Quasi-Public
The primary purpose of this designation is to accommodate a variety of
public, non-profit and institutional uses which meet health, safety,
education, and welfare needs. The maximum allowable Floor Area Ratio is
0.7.
The designation has been applied to 624 acres in the City, including 429
acres of developed land and 195 acres of undeveloped land. The
undeveloped land includes a 50-acre site reserved for future expansion of
the wastewater treatment plant. It also includes a site for a community
center adjacent to Fairview Middle School. The site depicted on the Land
Use Diagram is approximate. The vacant land also includes a small
expansion area for the Gonzales cemetery.
13.     Parks and Open Space
The primary purpose of this designation is to accommodate park,
recreation, and open space uses. Both active recreation areas (e.g., City
parks), and passive recreation areas (trails, natural open space, etc.) are
included. Since the land is intended for park and open space use, no
                                  Page II-46
JULY 2010                                                           LAND USE
standard of development intensity is provided. However, recreational or
other public buildings are permitted in parks if they are consistent with an
adopted park master plan or findings that the use is publicly beneficial and
will not compromise the character or use of the park.
This designation also includes agricultural buffers located along Associated
Lane and La Gloria Road, which would occupy approximately 56 acres of
land. There are 155 acres with this designation. Other lands with this
designation include the existing Centennial Park, Central Park (Gonzales
Square), and Meyer Park, and the undeveloped lands along the Gonzales
Slough, Johnson Canyon Creek, and smaller drainages located in the
vicinity of Associated Lane and La Gloria Road.
14.     Agriculture
The primary purpose of this designation is to promote the long-term
conservation of land in agricultural use outside the General Plan growth
area, generally north of Associated Lane and south of Gloria Road. It
applies to more than 5,800 acres within the Planning Area. The maximum
allowable density is one unit per 40 acres. Permitted uses are farming and
associated farm residences.
Although agriculture is a form of open space, this designation is separate
and distinct from the “Parks and Open Space” definition prescribed above.
Land in this designation would retain its open character but would be used
for the managed production of resources (e.g., crops and livestock), as
opposed to conservation, recreation, or protection of public health and
safety. Most agricultural land is privately owned and supports activities
which are not conducive to public access (including pesticide spraying and
operation of heavy equipment and machinery).
15.     Permanent Agricultural Edge Overlay
The primary purpose of the designation is to demark those parts of the
adjacent Urban Growth Area and Urban Reserve Area beyond which the
City intends to permanently protect agricultural lands. As an overlay
designation, permitted uses are those of the underlying designation, which
in most circumstances is “Agriculture.”
                                  Page II-47

GONZALES 2010 GENERAL PLAN                                            JULY 2010
16.      Agricultural Buffer Overlay
The primary purpose of this designation is demark those parts of the Urban
Growth Area where measures must be put in place to alleviate potential
physical conflicts between existing or planned agricultural uses (either
within or outside the Urban Growth Boundary) and urban uses planned
within the Urban Growth Boundary. Measures include physical separation
between the conflicting uses—typically 200 feet in width—plus other
vegetation, walls, or other screening deemed necessary to ensure that
property owners on both sides of the buffer may enjoy full and
unencumbered use of their property for its designated use without
experiencing significant deleterious effect from the neighboring use. While
the Agricultural Buffer Overlay symbol is located along the boundary
between two conflicting uses—overlying both agricultural lands as well
and planned urban area—the measures to be put in place shall in all cases
be located on land designated for urban uses and shall not infringe in any
way on property upon which permanent agricultural uses exist or are
planned. In areas where agricultural uses are intended to eventually
convert to urban use (i.e., within the Urban Growth Boundary), agricultural
buffer measures should be designed in such a way to facilitate an orderly
and coherent transition to urban use. As an overlay designation, permitted
uses are those of the underlying designation.
17.      Historic District Overlay
The primary purpose of this designation is to demark that part of Gonzales
that forms a coherent historic district and within which the City shall ensure
than new development or redevelopment does not compromise the
integrity of the historical district or the buildings and other structures within
it that have the highest cultural and historic value. This designation has
been applied to about eight blocks around the center of Gonzales,
including most of the downtown core. Development, modifications to
existing buildings, and demolition within the Historic District will be
subject to design review requirements which ensure that the integrity of
historical and cultural features are retained. If additional historic resources
are discovered or are relocated, the overlay district may be expanded to
ensure their protection. As an overlay designation, permitted uses are those

18.     Urban Reserve Overlay
The primary purpose of this designation is to demark land that is not
intended for development under this general plan, but that nonetheless is
regarded as the most likely path for long-term development. This area is
included in the Land Use Diagram to give expression to the the City’s long-
term vision for growth and to enable a comprehensive approach to
planning.
19.     Urban Growth Boundary
The purpose of this line is to bound and enclose the land intended for
development under this general plan.
                        E. Goals, Policies, and Actions
1.      Overall City Development
Goal LU-1:      A logical, orderly development pattern that matches the
                City's ability to provide urban services.
Policies
Policy LU-1.1 Jobs/Housing Balance
Promote a balance between housing growth and job growth. Encourage
the provision of housing at a pace that keeps up with job growth in the
City. Conversely, encourage the creation of jobs at a pace that keeps up
with housing growth in the City
        Implementing Action LU-1.1.1 – Land Use Assignments. Designate
        land that can support a mix of different housing types and a mix of
        different job types consistent with the land use assignments set forth
        in the section entitled: “Land Use Concept” above.
Policy LU-1.2 Development Pays Fair Share
Require new development to pay its fair share of the cost of capital
improvements and facilities needed to serve that development consistent
                                    Page II-49

GONZALES 2010 GENERAL PLAN                                           JULY 2010
with the policies, standards, and implementing actions of this General Plan
and State law requiring a nexus between such requirements and project
impacts.
        Implementing Action LU-1.2.1 – Capital Improvements. Coordinate
        capital improvements through the adoption and implementation of
        Specific Plans that contain a program of implementation measures
        including regulations, programs, public works projects and
        financing measures necessary to implement the Specific Plan.
        Implementing Action LU-1.2.2 – Availability of Services. Through
        Specific Plan development, coordinate new residential development
        with the provision of essential community services and facilities,
        such as roads, water, sewer, schools, parks, police and fire services,
        sanitary facilities, and drainage facilities. Approve development
        projects only when sufficient municipal services and utilities are
        available to serve that development or when there are guarantees
        that such services and utilities will be provided in a timely fashion
        after entitlements are vested.
        Implementing Action LU-1.2.3 – Impact Fees. Continue using public
        facility impact fees to meet the needs for on-site and off-site facility
        improvements generated by new development. Periodically
        evaluate these fees to make sure they are sufficient to cover
        improvement costs.
Policy LU-1.3 LAFCO Applications
Submit Sphere of Influence and annexation requests to LAFCO only for
lands within the Urban Growth Boundary depicted on the Land Use
Diagram. In addition, submit applications as may be required to facilitate
the expansion of the wastewater treatment facility located on Gonzales
River Road or other essential public utilities.
        Implementing Action LU- 1.3.1 – Plans for Services. Establish the
        timing of Sphere of Influence and annexation applications based on
        completion of plans for services, plans for public facilities, and
        financing plans that demonstrate compliance with LAFCO
        standards.

        Implementing Action LU- 1.3.2 – Coordination with Monterey
        County. Encourage Monterey County to consult and coordinate
        with the City before approving any project that is located within the
        City's Planning Area, as depicted on Figure I-1. Regularly review
        private and public development proposals in Monterey County that
        could impact the City and provide comments to the County as
        appropriate. Work with Monterey County to develop agreements
        per LAFCO policy on Sphere of Influence amendments and
        annexations.
Policy LU-1.4 City-Centered Growth
Support the concept of "City-Centered Growth" in the Salinas Valley. This
concept concentrates urban uses in and around South County cities and
conserves the remainder of the valley for agriculture.
        Implementing Action LU-1.4.1 – AMBAG Growth Projections.
        Maintain a General Plan growth area and LAFCO Sphere of
        Influence that contain a supply of land for urbanization that meets
        or exceeds AMBAG growth projections.
        Implementing Action LU-1.4.2 – Regional Planning. Continue to
        provide local representation to other public agencies, including:
        AMBAG, LAFCO, the County of Monterey and MBUAPCD.
        Implementing Action LU-1.4.3 – Utility Prohibition Zones. Specific
        plans shall include utility and road prohibition areas along the
        interface of the planned development area and permanent
        agricultural edge, which in subsequent subdivisions will be
        dedicated as “no-access” strips.
2.      Specific Plans and Development Phasing
Goal LU-2:      Orderly growth and development phasing through the use
                of Specific Plans

GONZALES 2010 GENERAL PLAN                                        JULY 2010
New development outside of the City’s incorporated area as of 2008 shall
be organized through the use of Specific Plans that contain self-contained
neighborhoods with the uses prescribed by the applicable land use
designations shown in the Land Use Diagram.
       Implementing Action LU-2.1.1 – Neighborhood Residential Specific
       Plans. Adopt Specific Plans for all areas within the Urban Growth
       Boundary prior to City approval of development entitlements. Such
       Specific Plan areas shall be no smaller than 125 acres, and
       organized into complete neighborhoods each of which is no smaller
       than 125 acres, no larger than 400 acres, and designed consistent
       with adopted Neighborhood Design Guidelines and Standards.
       Smaller properties (i.e., less than 125 acres) may combine with
       other properties to undertake the development of a Specific Plan or
       may attach to an existing Specific Plan by gaining City approval of a
       Specific Plan addendum.
       Implementing Action LU-2.1.2 – Commercial/Industrial Specific
       Plans. Adopt Specific Plans for areas designated “Community
       Commercial,” “Highway Commercial,” Light Industrial/Business
       Park,” or “Industrial/Manufacturing” prior to City approval of
       development entitlements. Such Specific Plans shall be organized
       into one of three Specific Plans areas—the “North Interchange
                                                        th
       Area,” the “South Interchange Area,” and the 5 Street Community
       Commercial Area. In the South Interchange Area, non-residential
       land north of La Gloria Road may be combined with the Specific
       Plan prepared for neighborhood residential development
       immediately north of La Gloria Road. Likewise, in the North
       Interchange Area, land designated for residential use located west of
       Gonzales Slough may be combined with the Specific Plan prepared
       for non-residential uses in the vicinity.
       Implementing Action LU-2.1.3 – Development Policies and
       Standards. Use development policies and standards contained in
       Specific Plans to identify permitted uses, accessory uses,
       conditionally permitted uses, and prohibited uses within each
       Specific Plan area. These uses should be consistent with the Land
       Use category designation definitions in this element as well as the
       goals and policies of this Plan.

3.       Unified East and West Gonzales
Goal LU-3:         Stronger ties between the established neighborhoods west of
                   Highway 101 and the new neighborhoods east of Highway
                   101.
Policies
Policy LU-3.1 East-West Connections
Strengthen existing connections between the east and west sides of
Highway 101.
                                               th
         Implementing Action LU-3.1.1 – 5 Street Corridor. Redesign the
           th
         5 Street corridor into an attractive boulevard that serves as a major
         “spine” that ties the historic city center to the new community
         commercial center proposed in the vicinity of Johnson Canyon
         Road and Herold Parkway, and that substantially improves
         pedestrian and bicyclist mobility.
          Implementing Action LU-3.1.2 – Residential Development West.
         Promote residential development on the west side of the freeway
         utilizing the Gonzales Redevelopment Agency and other resources.
         Most opportunities for new housing west of Highway 101 are in the
         Downtown Mixed Use District and on the few remaining vacant
         infill or potential redevelopment site.
Policy LU-3.2 Street Connectivity
Maintain continuity in the street pattern between the east and west sides of
the freeway, continuing elements of the "grid" of the original townsite as
much as possible as the area east of Highway 101 develops. New street
and block patterns within neighborhoods should form a well connected
pattern that provides direct travel routes, facilitates walking and biking, and
provides more than one way of reaching a destination allowing vehicle
traffic to gently filter through a neighborhood rather than forcing all trips
onto heavily traveled collectors and arterials.
         Implementing Action LU-3.2.1 – Address Street Connectivity in
         Design Guidelines. Ensure that adopted neighborhood design
                                     Page II-53

GONZALES 2010 GENERAL PLAN                                            JULY 2010
        guidelines contain guidance addressing street connectivity within
        and between neighborhoods.
4.      Attractive, Vibrant Downtown
Goal LU-4:       A vibrant, well-defined, attractive Downtown that provides
                 a focus for civic activities, shopping, culture, and services,
                 and a destination for local residents.
Policies
Policy LU-4.1 Downtown as Civic and Cultural Core
Maintain Downtown Gonzales as the social and cultural core of the
community, and encourage the locations of businesses and services in the
Downtown that provide cultural enrichment and extend the hours during
which Downtown is an active place. New development in the Downtown
area shall only be permitted where it is compatible in scale and character
with adjoining uses and will not create adverse impacts on adjoining
homes and businesses.
        Implementing Action LU-4.1.1 – Civic Uses Downtown. Maintain
        civic uses such as City Hall and the Post Office in a central location
        and avoid creating "east" and "west" branches of such uses.
        Exceptions shall be made for police and fire stations if response
        times from a single location would exceed acceptable levels.
        Implementing Action LU-4.1.2 – Ground-Level Retail. Revise the
        Gonzales Zoning Ordinance Mixed-Use District to eliminate
        ground-floor residential uses in the predominantly commercial core
        area of the Downtown and encourage Downtown projects that
        contain ground-level retail, service, or public facility development
        with upper story office or housing development. Such projects are
        especially encouraged when they rehabilitate existing buildings or
        add architecturally compatible second stories to existing buildings in
        the downtown area.
        Implementing Action LU-4.1.3 – Main Street Character. Revise the
        Gonzales Zoning Ordinance to encourage Downtown development
        that strengthens the "Main Street" character of the area and that
                                    Page II-54

JULY 2010                                                            LAND USE
       discourages or excludes projects that are inconsistent with that
       character. Inconsistent projects would include "big box" retailers,
       auto sales and repair establishments, storage yards, "drive through"
       restaurants, and other projects which have a scale and design that is
                         ,
       not conducive to the goal of maintaining small-town character.
       Implementing Action LU-4.1.4 – Pedestrian Environment. Revise
       Downtown development standards to ensure that new projects
       provide a safe, attractive, and comfortable environment for
       pedestrians in the Downtown area. Projects should have active
       pedestrian frontage oriented towards streets and sidewalks.
       Wherever feasible, parking for new development should be located
       to the rear of buildings or in on-street spaces along Fourth or Alta
       Streets rather than in large parking lots in front of buildings and
       businesses.
       Implementing Action LU-4.1.5 – Public Amenities. Revise
       Downtown development standards to ensure that new projects
       include public amenities such as street trees, benches, and
       landscaping.
       Implementing Action LU-4.1.6 – Regulate Conversion of Single
       Family Use. Enact zoning changes that allow the conversion of
       single family homes to office, service, and retail uses within the
       Downtown Mixed Use District, subject to discretionary review.
       Implementing Action LU-4.1.7 – Maintain both Residential and
       Commercial Uses. Utilize the Gonzales Redevelopment Agency
       and other resources to encourage retention of the existing
       residential and commercial properties within the Downtown Mixed
       Use District. Inclusion of such properties in this District is not
       intended to make these uses non-conforming or encourage their
       replacement with other uses.
       Implementing Action LU-4.1.8 – Rental Housing Downtown.
       Revise Downtown development standards to encourage
       opportunities for rental housing within mixed use projects.
       Implementing Action LU-4.1.9 – Grant Programs. On an on-going
       basis, investigate low-interest loans, grants, and other financial
                                  Page II-55

GONZALES 2010 GENERAL PLAN                                           JULY 2010
        programs (including the California Main Street Program) which
        assist the private sector in efforts to rehabilitate Downtown
        commercial buildings, and provide awnings, landscaping, or other
        improvements that make Downtown more attractive and
        economically competitive.
        Implementing Action LU-4.1.10 – Incentives for Downtown
        Residential. Provide incentives and other programs to promote the
        retention and development of rental residential units on the upper
        floors of buildings in Downtown.
        Implementing Action LU-4.1.11 – Support Chamber of Commerce.
        Provide ongoing support to the Gonzales Chamber of Commerce to
        encourage shopping in Downtown Gonzales.
5.      Neighborhood Conservation
Goal LU-5:       Protection of the integrity, scale, cohesiveness, and
                 character of existing residential neighborhoods.
Policies
Policy LU-5.1 Conserve Existing Housing Stock
Conserve and maintain the existing housing stock and the scale and
character of existing neighborhoods.
        Implementing Action LU-5.1.1 – Housing Rehabilitation. Utilize
        the Gonzales Redevelopment Agency and public grant programs to
        provide resources and technical assistant that encourage the
        rehabilitation of deteriorating housing units to current standards of
        safety, sanitation, and aesthetics.
        Implementing Action LU-5.1.2 – Neighborhood Protection.
        Maintain development standards that ensure existing single family
        neighborhoods are protected from intrusion by higher-density
        development that is incompatible in scale and character with the
        neighborhood.

           Implementing Action LU-5.1.3 – Code Enforcement. Enact code
           enforcement measures and programs that do not impose
           disproportionate hardships on low-income families, disabled
           persons, or seniors.
           Implementing Action LU-5.1.4 – Secondary Units. Promote
           secondary units (in-law apartments) on single family lots as a means
           of increasing the affordable housing stock provided that the units
           are compatible with the scale and character of the neighborhood
           and include adequate provisions for off-street parking.
6.         Residential Development
Goal LU-6:              New residential development that is organized into
                        “neighborhoods” serving as the fundamental building block
                        for residential growth, that is compatible with the City's
                        small-town character, and that meets the housing needs of
                        current and future Gonzales residents.
Policies
Policy LU-6.1 Neighborhoods as “Building Blocks”
Employ a neighborhood-based growth strategy whereby new pedestrian-
oriented neighborhoods, complete with schools, park and recreation
facilities, a wide range of housing types, and neighborhood-serving
commercial services,8 form the basic planning unit or “building block” for
new residential growth.
           Implementing Action LU-6.1.1 – Housing Mix in Neighborhoods.
           Ensure that new Neighborhood Residential development complies
           with the housing mix requirements described in Table II-3 to ensure
8
  Neighborhood-serving commercial may be designed to serve two neighborhoods, and where this is
the case, one of the neighborhoods might not contain such uses (see Policy LU 8.8). In order to
maintain a scale appropriate to a residential setting, individual neighborhood commercial uses should
generally be small-scale, which typically would be less than 5,000 square feet for any individual
commercial use. Commercial uses may occasionally be larger as appropriate. Mixed commercial uses
are encouraged within neighborhood centers and should be pedestrian-oriented uses that serve the
immediately surrounding area. These may include walk-in uses such as restaurants, retail stores,
health/fitness facilities, personal services, community service organizations, and similar uses. Auto
oriented uses with drive-through travel lanes are discouraged as they are inconsistent with the
pedestrian oriented character of neighborhood commercial centers.

         that a full range of housing types and complementary uses are
         included within future neighborhoods.
Policy LU-6.2 Utilize Land Efficiently
Utilize land efficiently to maintain a compact development pattern,
enhance walkability, and limit farmland conversion in areas outside the
identified General Plan growth area.
         Implementing Action LU-6.2.1 – Establish Minimum Densities.
         Adopt development codes as part of Specific Plans or separately
         that establish minimum development densities and discourage
         construction of housing at substantially lower gross densities than
         the maximum permitted by the General Plan, particularly on sites
         designated for medium- and high-density housing. Single-family-
         detached housing construction in these locations is generally
         inconsistent with the City's goal of providing a wide range of
         housing choices. Exceptions should be made for sites where
         environmental constraints (flood plains, etc.) preclude development
         at the maximum allowable density. In such instances, only the
         unconstrained portions of the site should be considered
         "developable" for purposes of density calculation.
         Implementing Action LU-6.2.2 – Achieve Minimum Density.
         Within new Specific Plan areas designated for residential use, ensure
         that new Neighborhood Residential development achieves an
         overall residential density between seven (7) and nine (9) dwelling
         units per gross residential acre. Densities within each Specific Plan
         neighborhood area may (and should) vary as long as the overall
         density target is met.
Policy LU-6.3 Attractive Design
Require new residential development to be attractively and coherently
designed consistent with the Neighborhood Design Guidelines and
Standards.
         Implementing Action LU-6.3.1 – Design Guidelines. Adopt
         neighborhood design guidelines that address the appropriate design
                                    Page II-58

JULY 2010                                                          LAND USE
        for new residential development. Use the policies in the Community
        Character Element of this plan to develop design guidelines.
7.      Commercial Development
Goal LU-7:      A stronger role for Gonzales as a market center for the
                Central Salinas Valley.
Policies
Policy LU-7.1 Reserve Land for Long-Term Revenue Generation
Designate and/or otherwise reserve sufficient portions of the uniquely
situated land in the vicinity of the three Highway 101 interchanges to
accommodate the City’s long-term need for revenue generation.
        Implementing Action LU-7.1.1 – Maintain Commercial
        Designations at Interchanges. Defer requests for amendments to
        the Land Use Diagram that would reduce the amount of
        commercial land available at the three Highway 101 interchanges
        until such time that the next comprehensive General Plan update is
        undertaken.
        Implementing Action LU-7.1.2 – Highway Commercial at
        Interchanges. Direct new highway-commercial and visitor-serving
        development to the area adjacent to the city’s northern and
        southern highway interchanges to improve the city’s ability to
        capture revenue from Highway 101 travelers.
        Implementing Action LU-7.1.3 – Office Use in Highway
        Commercial. Discourage office development in the areas
        designated "Highway Commercial" on the Land Use Diagram. As
        much as possible, offices should be concentrated in the Downtown
        Mixed-Use District, in neighborhood centers, and/or in the
        Community Commercial area planned in the vicinity of Johnson
        Canyon Road and Fanoe Road.

GONZALES 2010 GENERAL PLAN                                        JULY 2010
Policy LU-7.2 New Community Commercial Core Mixed Use
Development
Promote new community commercial core mixed use development east of
Highway 101 that is centrally located and a logical extension of the
existing downtown.
        Implementing Action LU-7.2.1 – Community Commercial Core
        Mixed Use Development East of Highway 101. Establish a
        community commercial core mixed use area along Johnson Canyon
        Road east of Herold Parkway. This commercial area is intended to
        primarily serve as a community and regional destination, as
        opposed to a highway stopover point for travelers. New uses
        should provide an aesthetically appealing, pedestrian-friendly
        environment that promotes socializing, shopping and
        entertainment. The area should also contain a mix of higher density
        residential uses designed to complement the commercial uses.
Policy LU-7.3 Protect Downtown Commercial Uses
Encourage new commercial development outside of the Downtown Mixed
Use District to contain uses that do not compete with Downtown or
adversely affect the viability of Downtown stores and businesses.
        Implementing Action LU-7.3.1 – Market Studies. Require a market
        study and fiscal impact assessment for any shopping center of
        25,000 square feet or greater. The study should address the
        probable impact of the center on the downtown area and should
        identify measures to reduce adverse impacts on Downtown. Where
        appropriate, these measures should be incorporated as conditions
        of approval for the development.
Policy LU-7.4 Appropriate Scale and Design for Neighborhood
Commercial Centers
Design new neighborhood commercial centers to be an integral part of the
neighborhood which they serve. Neighborhood commercial development
contained within a Specific Plan area shall be scaled to serve one or two
neighborhoods (not the community or region), consistent with adopted
Neighborhood Design Guidelines and Standards. These uses should be
                                   Page II-60

JULY 2010                                                           LAND USE
pedestrian-oriented and serve the immediately surrounding area.
Appropriate uses include small grocery stores, restaurants, retail stores,
health/fitness facilities, personal services, community service organizations,
and similar uses. Where neighborhood commercial uses are scaled to
serve two neighborhoods they should be located in an area that is central
to the two neighborhoods along their common edge, so as to provide
roughly equivalent pedestrian access from each neighborhood. If
neighborhood commercial uses are scaled to serve two neighborhoods in
this way, each neighborhood shall still contain a neighborhood center
located in its approximate geographic center. In this case, such
neighborhood centers should contain other community-serving uses, such
as: schools, public services, civic uses, places of worship, community
centers, small business incubator space, and/or parks.
        Implementing Action LU-7.4.1 – Design Guidelines to Address
        Commercial Scale and Design. Adopt neighborhood design
        guidelines that address the appropriate scale for new neighborhood
        commercial development. Design themes should be consistent with
        the character of the uses, the site, and the surrounding land uses
        and should promote the identity of the center as a neighborhood or
        community focal point. Use the policies in the Community
        Character Element of this plan to develop design guidelines.

                                 CIRCULATION
                                 A. Introduction
1.       What is the Circulation Element?
The Circulation Element addresses the movement of people and goods
within and through Gonzales. It is one of the mandated elements of the
General Plan and contains policies and programs for streets, highways,
public transit, railroads, bicyclists, and pedestrians. Each of these aspects of
the city's transportation system will be impacted by the changes in land use
that are planned in this document. This element summarizes these impacts
and describes the improvements that will be needed to ensure continued
mobility in Gonzales.
The intent of the element is to present policies and action programs for
future transportation planning. As the city grows and the number of
vehicles on the streets increases, it will be necessary to improve the street
system in a safe, efficient, and cost-effective way. It will also become
necessary to provide alternatives to the automobile, both for the benefit of
those without cars and for the benefit of the environment. At the same
time, provisions for parking and traffic safety will be needed to address
existing problems and future community needs.
The element also considers future traffic impacts associated with regional
growth, especially on Highway 101. Growth in freeway traffic must be
regarded as a regional problem, and the City must work with neighboring
cities, Monterey County, and regional agencies to develop effective
solutions.
2.       Organization of the Element
The element begins with an explanation of its intent and scope. An
overview of each component of the existing circulation system is provided,
including a description of existing traffic conditions. This is followed by a
discussion of major circulation issues and a description of the circulation
                                     Page III-1
GONZALES 2010 GENERAL PLAN                                          JULY 2010
concept being promoted by the element, including projections of future
circulation needs based on the Land Use Diagram. The Circulation
Diagram illustrates the major proposals for road, bicycle, and pedestrian
improvements. The Diagram is followed by goals and policies to guide
future circulation decisions and implementing actions.
3.       Relationship to the Land Use Element
The circulation system and development pattern of any community,
including Gonzales, are interdependent. Each pattern of land use generates
different requirements for mobility and safety. The future circulation system
must be designed to adequately serve the level of development allowed by
the plan, encourage and support a wide range of mobility options, and
connect the existing community with newly developing areas. System
improvements may include new road connections, traffic signals, road
widening, roundabouts, traffic calming measures, pedestrian connections,
realigned highways and roadways, and modified overpasses and
interchanges. The General Plan must incorporate ways to guide
development so that the desired circulation system is constructed with the
minimum expenditure of public funds, while maximizing options for all
modes of mobility, and with the minimum disruption of existing uses.
At the same time, the qualities of the existing circulation system are a major
consideration in designating areas for future development. For instance, the
Union Pacific Railroad and Highway 101 have both had great impacts on
past land use decisions in Gonzales. Since the cost of relocating such
facilities is high, the Land Use Diagram must recognize the opportunities
and limitations presented by them.
The link between land use and circulation is further reinforced through the
use of common population and employment projections in the Land Use
and Circulation Elements of the General Plan. Table II-3 of the Land Use
Element projects that "buildout" of the Gonzales 2010 General Plan would
create about 7,700 new homes and 5,400 new jobs in the City. These
estimates are used in the Circulation Element to project how many trips will
be generated by future growth and what types of road improvements will be
needed.

                           B. Circulation Framework
1.      Streets and Highways
The street and highway system consists of a regional roadway system that
connects Gonzales with other cities and regions and a local roadway
system that interconnects the various parts of the city and provides access
to the regional roadway system.
Regional Roadway System
Gonzales is linked to other cities in the Salinas Valley by U.S. Highway
101, which runs in a north-south direction through the City. The highway
is two lanes in each direction with a center median. The City is served by
interchanges located at North Alta Street and Old Stage Road a mile north
of downtown, Fifth Street about a quarter-mile east of downtown, and
South Alta Street and Gloria Road about a mile south of downtown. The
freeway was constructed as a bypass around the City, removing most
regional traffic from City streets. A full complement of north- and
southbound ramps are provided at each interchange, although development
adjacent to the Fifth Street Interchange has constrained the City’s ability to
improve this facility.
Gonzales is also linked to the County roadways system via the following
two-lane local roads:
     •  Gonzales River Road, which provides a connection from Alta Street
        west to River Road (County Route G17), which in turn parallels
        Highway 101 along the base of the Sierra de Salinas.
     •  Johnson Canyon Road, which provides an extension of Fifth Street
        east to Iverson Road and beyond into the Gabilan Mountains.
     •  Old Stage Road, which runs north from the Highway 101/Alta Street
        (north) Interchange paralleling Highway 101.
     •  Gloria Road runs east from Highway 101 to Highway 25 in Central
        San Benito County, through the hills east of Gonzales.

GONZALES 2010 GENERAL PLAN                                          JULY 2010
    •    Iverson Road, which serves the eastern side of the General Plan area
         and provides a connection from Gloria Road to Johnson Canyon
         Road and beyond northward skirting the base of the Gabilan
         Mountains.
    •    Foletta Road, which serves the northern extents of General Plan area
         paralleling Highway 101 and connects Gonzales with Chualar to
         the north.
Local Roadway System
The local roadway system includes a grid of north-south and east-west
streets, with some of the east-west streets extending across Gonzales Slough
into subdivisions characterized by curvilinear streets and cul-de-sacs. Fifth
Street continues east from the grid and crosses Highway 101, providing
access to the newer subdivisions east of the freeway, as well as farms on the
east side of the Salinas Valley. A network of farm roads forms a large grid
that includes Associated Lane on the north, and Fanoe Road/Herold
Parkway closest to and paralleling Highway 101. Gloria and Iverson Roads
form the south and eastern limits of this local roadway system. Lanini Road
provides access to the area west of the Union Pacific tracks south of Gloria
Road. Finally, access into the existing industrial park west of Alta Street is
provided by Gonzales River Road (mentioned above) and a recently
improved grade crossing at Fermin Lane.
Figure III-1 shows the existing network of streets and roads in the Gonzales
Planning Area.
