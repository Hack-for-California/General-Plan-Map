   thunderstorms are another potential cause
   of flooding in the basin. These storms
   usually occur in localized areas in high
   mountain canyons and have significant
   effects on down-stream areas. Storm water
   is quickly collected in steep canyons and
   proceeds downstream with increasing
   velocity. This "flash flood" does the most
   damage, decreasing as the water spreads
   into sheet-flows as slopes decrease. Other
   causes of flooding such as dam failure and
   excessive snow pack melting are not a major
   threat to the basin.

      converting to urban uses, to a point
      where there will be little significant

    •  A Land Use paradox exists in the

      predominately a built-out residential
      community, which nonetheless has a
      surplus of vacant commercial land.

      should be considered as an alternate or

Since the California Environmental Quality
Act (CEQA) focuses on physical changes to
the environment, it is the City's Land Use
Element that most directly influences the
general distribution and general location and
extent of land uses. In formulating the land
use policies presented therein, the City's
Community Development Department
(Department)       conducted     a    detailed
assessment of the existing land uses then
evident within the planning area and
compared those land uses against existing
public policies (as reflected in the 1983
General Plan) to identify future growth
opportunities that may occur in accordance
with those policies.
Focusing on the Sphere of Influence, the
Department examined existing land uses as
well as parcel sizes and configuration and
compared those conditions to existing
development patterns within and adjacent to
the community. The Department formulated
draft recommendations concerning possible
deviations from existing land use policies
and       solicited      comments         and
recommendations         concerning      those
deviations from the City's General Plan
Citizen Advisory Committee (GPCAC).
Based on feedback obtained from the
GPCAC, the Department prepared a draft
land use plan for inclusion in the Land Use
Element.
Based on the potential build-out projections
contained in the draft Land Use Element, the
projected increase in the number of dwelling                                                  15

         designated lands within the planning area, as measured in acres. A broad range of land uses have been
         identified and specific floor-area-ratios (FAR) assigned to each use. Employment projections, derived on a per
         acre or per square foot basis, where then determined for each use and totaled to produce the employment
         projections presented herein. Recognizing that the precise nature of each land use and its employment potential
         cannot be known pending the City’s receipt of a formal development application, this methodology
         accommodates a range of land uses as will be anticipated to occur in accordance with the policies of the General
         Plan Update.

      Each of the following strategies address distinct areas of
Montclair and are not suggested for or conducive to City-wide
application. The precise areas for each strategy are not defined
herein but may be subsequently defined by the Commission and/or
the Council as part of their deliberations on the pending project.
28
    The Montclair Transcenter is located within an adopted specific
plan area (i.e., North Montclair Specific Plan). As indicated therein,
"the 20-acre Transcenter is the largest such facility between Union
Station in Los Angeles and the San Bernardino Station. It will
accommodate approximately 1,500 commuter vehicles and
includes a 1.5-acre service commercial area, which will
accommodate a child care center and other commercial/offices
uses" (p. II-3).
29
    The "Planned Development" District is included in the General
Plan Update on a limited number of properties within the City.
Under this alternative, that district would be expanded to include
such other properties as may be identified by the Planning
Commission and/or City Council as additional sites suitable for that
designation.

     Referencing the "Discussion" (as prepared by OPR) following
Section 15382 of the Guidelines (defining "significant effect on the
environment), referencing Hecton v. People of the State of
California, the court "ruled that a claim that a project would cause
a decline in property values was not enough by itself to require an
EIR to be prepared" (i.e., did not constitute a significant effect on
the environment).

   3.5.2 Cultural Resources
   Relative to the potential significance of
   cultural resource impacts, a project may be
   deemed to have a significant impact if the
   project will:
   • Cause a substantial adverse change in the
     significance of a historic resource as
     defined in Section 15064.5 of the
     Guidelines;
   • Cause a substantial adverse change in the
     significance of an archaeological resource
     pursuant to Section 15064.5 of the
     Guidelines;
   • Directly or indirectly destroy a unique
     paleontological resource or site or unique
     geologic feature; and/or
   • Disturb any human remains, including
     those interred outside of formal
     cemeteries.
   As further indicated in Section 15064.5(b) of
   the Guidelines, relative to historic resource,
   "a project with an effect that may cause a
   substantial adverse change in the
   significance of a historical resource is a
   project that may have a significant effect on
   the environment."

        During the Fiscal Year 1998 session, the Governor restored the
   mandate and funds for councils of governments to prepare a
   "Regional Housing Needs Assessment" (RHNA). SCAG is now
   required to produce a draft RHNA by June 30, 1999 and local
   jurisdictions are required to submit draft housing elements to the
   State by June 30, 2000. The "1999 Regional Housing Needs
   Assessment" (RHNA99) is not presently available and, therefore,
   has not been incorporation herein.

         A "community design element" is included as an optional
   element in both the 1983 General Plan and General Plan Update.
   Although the following discussion focuses on the issues of
   community design and urban form, this analysis is not confined to
   the goals, policies, and programs outlined in that element.
   16
        Most of this area falls within the boundaries of the "North
   Montclair Specific Plan" and the "Montclair Redevelopment
   Agency's Project Area III."
   17
          By this statement, the Lead Agency is not stating that
   implementation of the General Plan Update is either absent any
   impacts upon either district or that revenues generated from
   development fees will offset the costs to provide new or expanded
   facilities or cover administrative costs incurred by those new
   students.

         Although constituting important planning documents relative to
   the City's solid waste management efforts, neither the SRRE nor
   the HHWE constitute elements of the "City of Montclair General
   Plan."

        As used herein, the terms "reactive organic gases" (ROG),
   "reactive organic compounds" (ROC), and "volatile organic

        On February 12, 1993, the Governing Board of the SCAQMD
   adopted an CEQA Air Quality Handbook "as guidance to assist
   local government agencies and consultants in developing the
   environmental documents required by CEQA." As indicated in the
   accompanying staff report ,"the CEQA Air Quality Handbook is an
   advisory tool for analyzing and mitigating air quality impacts from
   new projects."

        Only approximately five acres of new park lands are anticipated
   to occur during this planning period. Since the precise timing of
   that development cannot be predicted and since it is assumed that
   all such development will occur during a single 12-month period, in
   order to reflect a worst-case scenario, this single event has been
   represented as an annual event herein.

       The City could formulate performance-based land use standards
   that, although not restricting the type of use authorized on a
   particular piece of property, would establish a quantifiable standard
   relative to each of the exogenous effects associated with those
   uses. Under this approach, as an alternative to the formulation of
   conventional land use districts, eligible land uses would be
   established by the ability of those uses to satisfy the adopted
   performance standards.

        This analysis has not attempted to quantify the precise impacts
   (e.g., number of peak-hour trips) associated with each of the
   development options addressed herein. This analysis has sought
   to assess the comparative impacts associated with different project
   alternatives and to determine whether and how the project's
   identified impacts can be reduced or avoided. In lieu of a precise
   quantification, which may not be possible in the absence of a
   precise delineation of the land uses represented by each
   alternative, this analysis provides a qualitative assessment
   concerning whether individual impacts would be increased or
   decreased under each of the development options identified
   herein.

   In the absence of a comprehensive
   assessment of build-out projections, no
   mechanism would exist to ensure the
   provision of needed services and systems
   adequately sized and located in response to
   those short-term, mid-term, and long-term
   demands attributable to the intensification of
   the planning area.
   (5) The 1999 General Plan facilitates the
   formulation of capital improvement plans
   that serve to promote the goals, objectives,
   and public policies outlined therein.
   (6) Adoption of the 1999 General Plan will
   allow individual service providers operating
   in the City to formulate improvement plans in
   response to the projected demand for
   services and systems throughout the
   planning area.
   (7) Adoption of the 1999 General Plan will
   allow the police and fire departments to
   formulate plans for the expansion of existing
   staffing and the provision of adequate
   facilities and equipment to adequately
   service future project area demands.
   (8) Adoption of the 1999 General Plan will
   promote comprehensive planning efforts
   undertaken to ensure the provision of a high
   quality of life for the residents of the City and
   those individuals employed throughout the
   community.
   (9) Adoption of the 1999 General Plan allows
   the City to formulate specific plans that
   promote the attainment of the goals,
   objectives, policies, and programs outlined
   therein for distinct geographic areas of the
   community.
   (10) Adoption of the 1999 General Plan will
   create a "business friendly" environment that
   encourages the establishment of new and
   expansion of existing businesses throughout
   the City.
