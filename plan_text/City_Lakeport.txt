I. INTRODUCTIO
I.       INTRODUCTION
The Lakeport General Plan is the official document used by decision makers and citizens to
guide and interpret the City’s long range plans for development of land and conservation of
resources. All California cities and counties are required by State law to have a general plan that
addresses seven specific topics, called elements, which include: Land Use; Transportation;
Housing; Open Space; Conservation; Safety and Noise. General Plans may also include optional
elements dealing, for example, with design and community identity. The Lakeport General Plan
includes the seven mandatory Elements as well as three optional Elements including an Urban
Boundary Element, Community Design Element and Economic Development Element.
The General Plan must contain a land use map that describes the location and boundaries of each
land use designation, such as Industrial, Single Family Residential, or Park, and the specific
restrictions that apply to each designation. In addition, the Plan contains policies and supporting
information adequate to make informed decisions concerning the future of the community. The
Plan identifies methods for improving public facilities and services to meet the anticipated
growth, and establishes a framework for the implementation of the City’s zoning, subdivision
and other land use regulations.
The General Plan represents an agreement among the residents of Lakeport on basic community
values, ideals, and aspirations to govern a shared environment. The Plan has a long-term
horizon, addressing a 20-year time frame. At the same time, it brings a deliberate, overall
direction to the day-to-day decisions of the City Council, Planning Commission, and city staff.
Public Participation
In 2004, the City decided to update its General Plan to provide the public decision-makers and
private developers with clearer and more effective policy guidance. A General Plan Advisory
Committee was established by the City and met a total of seven times in public sessions to
review and fine-tune each element of the Draft General Plan.
The result of this effort is a General Plan built upon the ideas of Lakeport residents—a guide in
text and maps to the opportunities and conditions for new development based on a balance
among the social, environmental and economic needs of the community.
The Planning Area
The General Plan applies to both public and privately owned land within the City’s boundaries
and its Sphere of Influence (SOI). The SOI is unincorporated land representing the ultimate
future boundaries of the City. This area is currently under County jurisdiction, and regulated by
Lake County’s General Plan and Zoning Ordinance. State law permits the City to plan for areas
outside of its boundaries, if those areas have a direct relationship to the City’s planning needs.
Although the County is not bound by Lakeport’s General Plan, the City will work with the
County to assure that County land use decisions within the Lakeport SOI are compatible with
this General Plan.
Introduction                                                                           August 2009

How to Use this General Plan
The General Plan will be used by the City Council and the Planning Commission to guide land
use and planning-related decisions. The City’s staff will use the Plan on a day-to-day basis to
administer and regulate land use and development activity. The public can use this Plan to
understand Lakeport’s approach to land use planning and the community’s standards with regard
to urban design, conserving natural resources, future development and neighborhood
conservation. The development community can use the Plan to analyze potential development
patterns for proposed projects.
The General Plan is divided into chapters corresponding to the following plan elements: Land
Use; Urban Boundary; Transportation; Community Design; Economic Development;
Conservation; Open Space, Parks and Recreation; Noise; and Safety. The Housing Element was
previously adopted in July, 2004 and certified by the State of California Department of Housing
and Community Development (HCD). Each chapter starts with a discussion of purpose, existing
and future conditions and the goals of the City as they related to the chapter. These are followed
by a brief overview and analysis of the major factors related to the issues and goals. At the end
of each chapter are policies and implementation programs that will guide the City’s actions
during the life of the Plan. Goals, policies, implementation programs and standards are defined
below:
•   Goal: a general expression of community values. It indicates, in a general manner, an ideal
    future or condition to which planning efforts are directed.
•   Policy: a specific statement that guides decision making and how a goal will be implemented
    and may include standards, objectives, maps or a combination of these components. It
    indicates a clear commitment by the City Council.
•   Implementation Program: a specific action, procedure or technique to carry out policies of
    the General Plan.
•   Standards: policy statements which include a specific quantitative measure of performance.
The text of the Plan should be considered in relation to the Land Use Map. The boundaries of
land use designations shown on this map are based on existing land use patterns and natural and
man-made features. They are not precise legal boundaries. The Zoning Map provides the
precise legal boundaries of the Zoning Districts that are consistent with the underlying General
Plan Land Use designations.
The Organization and different topics covered by the General Plan are indicated in the Table of
Contents. Many of the technical terms used in the Plan are defined in the Glossary (see
Appendix A). Separate technical documents (bound separately) include the Background Report
and the Environmental Impact Report.
August 2009                                                                           Introduction

Intent of the Plan
The General Plan takes a long range and comprehensive perspective to the year 2025. It also
addresses immediate land-use related problems.
New and significant policies contained in the updated General Plan include the following:
•   A proposed modification to the SOI that includes the proposed Specific Plan Area south of
    the current SOI, elimination of the area immediately north of the city, and minor
    modifications to the southwestern portion of the sphere to remove agricultural areas.
•   Combining the low and medium density residential designations to allow for greater
    flexibility in considering re-zoning requests.
•   General guidelines for how the proposed Specific Plan Area should be developed.
•   An Economic Development Element.
•   Significant revisions to the Community Design Element.
•   New policies on human services and human care facilities such as child care centers and
    elderly care facilities.
•   A change to the Land Use designation from major retail to office for several parcels located
    north of Eleventh Street adjacent to Hwy 29.
•   Policies related to the use of Best Management Practices.
•   An annexation to the south side of the city to the west of State Highway 29 that encompasses
    approximately 121 acres.
Administering the General Plan
Once adopted, the General Plan does not remain static. State law permits up to four General
Plan Amendments per year (Government Code Section 65358). Most amendments propose a
change in land use designation of a particular property. As time goes on, the City may determine
that it is also necessary to revise portions of the text to reflect changing circumstances or
philosophy.
State law provides direction on how Lakeport can maintain the plan as a contemporary policy
guide: It requires the City’s Community Development Department to report annually to the City
Council on the “status of the plan and its implementation” (Government Code Section 65400[b]).
In addition, the City should comprehensively review the Plan every five years to determine
whether or not it is still in step with community values and conditions.
State law requires that any decision to amend the General Plan be based on factual information
and analysis, termed “findings of fact.” These findings are the rationale for making a decision

either to approve or deny a project. The following minimum findings should be made for each
General Plan Amendment:
1. The proposed General Plan Amendment is deemed to be in the public interest.
2. The proposed General Plan Amendment is consistent and compatible with the rest of the
    General Plan and any implementation programs that may be affected.
3. The potential impacts of the proposed General Plan Amendment have been assessed and
    have been determined not to be detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare.
4. The proposed General Plan Amendment has been processed in accordance with the
    applicable provisions of the California Government Code and the California Environmental
    Quality Act (CEQA).
City initiated amendments, as well as amendments requested by other public agencies, are
subject to the same basic processes and requirements described above to ensure compatibility
and consistency with the General Plan. This includes appropriate environmental review, public
notice, and public hearings leading to an official action by a resolution of the City Council.

II. LAND USE ELEMEN
II.      LAND USE ELEMENT
Purpose
The Land Use Element functions as a guide for the ultimate pattern of development for the City
at build-out. The Land Use Element has perhaps the broadest scope of the seven mandatory
elements of the General Plan. It provides an overview of the land use characteristics, objectives,
policies, and implementation programs for achieving the City’s land use goals over the next 20
years. The General Plan Land Use Map, which is also a part of this Element, graphically
represents the City's land use goals and objectives.
Existing Land Use
Existing land use information is essential to an understanding of current development patterns
and acreages devoted to particular land uses. Existing land use information and a vacant and
underutilized land use inventory for the Lakeport Planning Area was developed by the Lakeport
Community Development Department. The information was then entered into a geographic
information system at the parcel level, then used for statistical analysis and mapping.
General Plan Land Use Classification System
To translate objectives and policies of the Land Use Element into diagram or map form, a set of
designations or classifications must be adopted to serve as a guide for general land use
distribution. Determining the land use designation for any area is generally based on multiple
criteria, which may include:
•   Existing patterns of development when compatible with objectives, policies, and programs of
    the General Plan;
•   Accessibility/Circulation;
•   Availability of public services and facilities and potential for their expansion or extension;
•   Geo-physical characteristics of the area such as slope, wetland or flood prone designation,
    soils, geography, vegetative cover, and biological significance;
•   Existing parcel size;
•   Desire to protect or buffer certain uses from other, incompatible uses.
The Land Use Element establishes 11 land use designations with which development must be
consistent. For each designation, the uses allowed and the standards of density and intensity are
specified. Other policies relating to these land use designations are found in the policy section of
the Land Use Element and throughout the General Plan.
Land Use Element                                                                         August 2009

The boundaries of land use designations shown in Figure 1 are based on existing land use
patterns and natural and man-made features, and are not precise legal boundaries. To accurately
interpret the General Plan Land Use Map, refer to the Zoning Map which provides the precise
legal boundaries for the Zoning Districts consistent with the underlying General Plan Land Use
designations.
The General Plan establishes designations for land both in the City and outside the City limits
within the City’s Sphere of Influence as defined by the Local Agency Formation Commission
(LAFCO). The Sphere of Influence is the ultimate physical boundary of the City. Land within
the Sphere of Influence is subject to land use designations assigned by Lake County. The
General Plan Land Use Map will identify the City’s pre-zone designation for land within the
Sphere of Influence which may be annexed in the future.
General Plan Land Use Designations
RESIDENTIAL (R)
Designates areas suitable for single family dwellings up to 7.3 units per acre and multifamily
developments comprising up to four units within a single structure at a maximum density of 19.3
dwelling units per acre. Consistent zoning districts include, but are not limited to, R-1 and R-2.
HIGH DENSITY RESIDENTIAL (HDR)
Designates areas suitable for multifamily residential development at a density of 19.4 to 29.0
dwelling units per acre. Senior multifamily1 uses are permitted at a density not exceeding 45
dwelling units per acre. The high density residential designation allows convalescent and other
hospital uses. Limited office uses would be permitted with a Conditional Use Permit pursuant to
criteria contained in the Zoning Ordinance. Consistent zoning districts include, but are not
limited to, R-3 and R-5.
LIGHT RETAIL (LR)
This designation is intended to provide for small neighborhood oriented retail establishments,
either on individual sites or in small shopping centers. Typical light retail uses include, but are
not limited to: food markets; self-service laundries; variety shops; and the broad class of retail
business known as convenience goods outlets. These sites typically provide required on-site
parking on well-designed sites with good access. Maximum Floor Area Ratio (FAR) of 0.35.
Consistent zoning districts include, but are not limited to, C-1.
MAJOR RETAIL (MR)
This designation is the principal retail designation for the Lakeport area; the place for regional
and local serving retail establishments, specialty shops; banks; professional offices, motels;
business and personal services. Other uses permitted in this designation include commercial

b) The specific plan shall include a statement of the relationship of the specific plan to the
     general plan.
A specific plan may also address any other subjects which in the judgment of the planning
agency are necessary or desirable for implementation of the general plan. The specific plan is
also required to comply with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) including the
preparation of the required environmental documentation for the adoption of the specific plan. In
this case, it is likely that an Environmental Impact Report would be required.
The Specific Plan Area is a high priority for the City for a number of reasons. First it is the site
of the City's wastewater treatment, storage, and disposal facilities which must be operational at
all times and expanded periodically in order to comply with the Regional Water Quality Control
Board (RWQCB) permit and accommodate future growth. Second, a preliminary analysis has
been completed that indicates that the existing treatment facility could be upgraded to tertiary
treatment and the treated water used to irrigate parks, golf course, landscaping, and food crops
(subject to RWQCB permit). This is beneficial because water is a valuable commodity in
Lakeport. Third, the City has had an interest in the feasibility of developing a golf course for
many years.
This Specific Plan Area has not been subject to any public land use evaluation or planning
process by the City of Lakeport except for the development activities associated with the
wastewater treatment facilities. Prior to the submittal of an application to LAFCO to amend the
City’s Sphere of Influence to include the Specific Plan area, the City will be required to complete
a Specific Plan for this area in accordance with state Planning and Zoning laws. See the Urban
Boundary Element for related policies and programs.
Summary of Maximum Densities Permitted in each Land Use
Designation
The maximum building intensity and population density [for residential districts] that would be
permitted by each Land Use Designation are summarized in Table 1. It should be emphasized
that these figures provide the maximum potential building and population that could occur
without taking into account the constraints imposed by the natural environment, vehicular access,
the provision of necessary services, and the standards contained in the Community Design
Element. The City may restrict the maximum density figures indicated below to take into
account these factors.
Floor Area Ratio (FAR) has been used to define the maximum permitted building intensity for
non-residential land uses. FAR is the ratio of the square footage of the building to the site (see
Table 1). Refer to the Glossary for a more detailed definition of this term.

                 with R-2 Zoning throughout areas of western Lakeport that currently lack
                 developed and cohesive infrastructure. Development at R-2 densities should
                 include infrastructure improvements concurrent with all new residential
                 development.
                 Responsibility: Community Development and Public Works Departments.
Policy LU 1.7: Prezone.      When prezoning or rezoning property to the R-1 or R-2 zoning
                 designations, the City shall take into account the following:
                 •   The current inventory of parcels zoned R-1 and R-2 and weigh that against

                 •   Availability of infrastructure
Policy LU 1.8: Specific Plan Area. The City shall implement the provisions of Section 65450
                 through 65457 of the California Government Code and complete a Specific Plan
                 for the area designated Specific Plan Area upon inclusion of the area within the
                 Lakeport Sphere of Influence, prior to pre-zoning, annexation, and applications
                 for development (entitlement) proposals.
                 The Specific Plan for the Specific Plan Area shall include a text and diagram
                 which specify the distribution, location, and extent of uses of land, including
                 open space, public and private transportation, sewage, water, drainage, solid
                 waste, energy, and other essential facilities proposed to be located within the

                  neighborhoods; and urban design amenities such as sidewalk width; public open
                  spaces; landscaping; and signage.
Policy LU 2.4: Pedestrian Orientation. Emphasize compact form and pedestrian orientation
                  in new community and neighborhood shopping areas.
Policy LU 2.5: Efficient Site Design.         Encourage efficient site design that minimizes the
                  number of driveways, provides adequate parking and integrates site design with
                  adjacent developments.
Policy LU 2.6: Neighborhood Identity. Contribute to neighborhood identity by providing for
                  local shopping centers that many residents can reach by foot or bicycle.

                  to locate in and near Downtown.
Policy LU 2.8: Bed and Breakfast Inns.            Revise the Zoning Ordinance to allow Bed and
                  Breakfast Inns as a permitted use, rather than a conditionally permitted use, in
                  the Central Business District.
Service Commercial Zoning
To date there have been relatively few industrial and manufacturing jobs in Lakeport in
comparison with other cities in California. Service commercial uses are now preferred in areas
that were once designated industrial. Improvements to regional transportation facilities and
increasing reliance on telecommunications in business, will give the local economy an
opportunity to become more diversified.
Land designated for service commercial uses are located in two areas with good highway and
street access in the southern portion of the City, adjacent to South Main Street. One is located
within City limits between Industrial Drive and Peckham Court, the other in the Sphere of
Influence on South Main Street and is identified in Figure 2 as South Area # 2. These areas
require additional City services and road access. A Specific Plan should be prepared for this
area because of constraints such as insufficient road ROW, lack of utilities and infrastructure and
services.
It is intended that the industrial uses be restricted to those which are non-polluting and have few
adverse impacts on the environment.
OBJECTIVE LU 3:         TO PROVIDE FOR SUFFICIENT COMMERCIAL TO SUPPORT THE
                        LOCAL EMPLOYMENT BASE, GENERATE REVENUE FOR THE CITY,
                        AND COMPLIMENT THE EXISTING LAND USES IN LAKEPORT.
Policy LU 3.1: Preserve Major Retail. Preserve the Major Retail land use designation.
                  General Plan amendments to re-designate Major Retail land to other uses shall
                  be discouraged.

                Program LU 3.1-a: Require a fiscal and economic impact analysis for General
                Plan amendments to change land use designations for commercial areas.
                General Plan amendments to change designations to other uses shall be
                permitted only if clearly demonstrated that this change will not adversely affect
                the diversity of the City’s economy and employment base.
                Responsibility: Community Development Department.
Policy LU 3.2: Encourage Access. Encourage the establishment of improvement districts,
                increased involvement of the Redevelopment Agency, and other means of
                providing additional City services and roads to designated areas.
Policy LU 3.3: Environmental Compatibility. Limit uses to those which are compatible with
                the rural environment and which do not endanger the quality of the environment
                and scenic beauty on which Lakeport’s tourism depends.
Policy LU 3.4: Ancillary Uses. Permit limited ancillary commercial, retail and service uses in
                areas to serve the needs of the businesses and employees located in these
                employment centers and to reduce vehicle trips.
Policy LU 3.5: Designate Truck Routes. Designate appropriate truck routes and “heavy
                commercial streets” in order to accommodate truck traffic and avoid
                unanticipated conflicts.
Policy LU 3.6: Minimize Community Impacts. Design development to minimize potential
                community impacts adversely affecting residential and commercial areas in
                relation to local and regional air quality and odor, adequacy of municipal
                services, local traffic conditions, visual quality, and noise levels.
Policy LU 3.7: Buffers. Buffer industrial and heavy commercial land uses from adjacent
                residential, commercial, and recreational areas.
Policy LU 3.8: Design Standards. The City should consider adopting design standards for
                major retail areas.
Policy LU 3.9: Planned Development.          A Planned Development Combining District (PD)
                shall be required for the area generally bound by Kimberly Lane, South Main
                Street, Campbell Lane and Hwy 29. This is to ensure a creative and efficient
                approach to the use of land, to provide for greater flexibility in the design of
                development projects and to address the need for roadway, water, sewer and
                storm drainage infrastructure.
Infill Development
The development of vacant or underdeveloped land within the City is referred to as infill.
Lakeport has a high proportion of vacant and undeveloped land: twenty five percent of the land
August 2009                                                                       Land Use Element

within City limits remains vacant and another 12% is underdeveloped2. Most of this land is
located near or adjacent to City boundaries in the west, northwest and northern areas of
Lakeport.
One of the goals of the General Plan is to encourage the development of vacant and
underdeveloped properties through infill development, with additional single and multifamily
residential housing on the west side of Lakeport.
Many vacant and underdeveloped parcels do not have the full range of urban services. Obstacles
that have prevented development of vacant and underdeveloped areas include the relatively high
cost of providing urban services, the lack of adequate roads, rough terrain, and relatively high
construction costs. Lakeport can encourage the development of vacant and underused parcels by
using innovative subdivision standards, obtaining grant funds to provide public services and
utilities, establishing of special assessment districts, reimbursement agreements, and amending
the General Plan and the Zoning Ordinance and to increase the permitted density for specific
areas. [Note: The Transportation Element contains implementation programs facilitating
improvements to the road system serving vacant and undeveloped land.]
OBJECTIVE LU 4:           TO ENCOURAGE AND FACILITATE INFILL DEVELOPMENT WHICH
                          COMPLIMENTS THE CHARACTER OF LAKEPORT.
Policy LU 4.1: Facilitate Infill Development.                   Establish special assessment districts,
                   reimbursement agreements, or other similar methods to facilitate development
                   of vacant and underdeveloped properties. Utilize grant funds and/or low
                   interest loan funds wherever feasible to reduce the costs of providing
                   infrastructure and urban services.
Policy LU 4.2: Flexible Standards. Revise and update the Zoning and Subdivision Ordinances
                   within 3 years of approval of this General Plan Update to establish innovative
                   and flexible subdivision standards that encourage infill development.
Policy LU 4.3: Density Increases. Consider amendments to the General Plan and the Zoning
                   Ordinance to increase residential density of vacant and underdeveloped land
                   within City limits where such an increase in density is found to be necessary for
                   development to take place. Approval of density increases shall consider the
                   impacts on City services, the existing development pattern, traffic, schools,
                   other public services and the standards contained in the Community Design
                   Element.
Infrastructure and Public Services
The adequacy of the City’s infrastructure and the provision of basic City services are among the
most critical issues facing the community. The availability and condition of the infrastructure
2
  Underdeveloped land is defined as having uses much below the maximum permitted by the General Plan. For
  example a ten acre parcel with one dwelling located in an area designated as High Density Residential would be
  considered underdeveloped.

                 and revenues, including redevelopment tax increment revenues that are
                 available for the improvement of the sewer system.
STORM DRAINAGE SYSTEM
Lakeport is traversed by several streams and drainage areas which flow into Clear Lake. The
development that has occurred during the past ten years has accentuated existing drainage
problems and has increased the potential for flooding. Continued construction of new buildings
increases the area of impermeable surface and thus the amount of stormwater that flows through
the City’s storm drain system.
This section of the General Plan presents policies and implementation programs to ensure that
improvements to the City’s storm drainage system are provided commensurate with new
development. The Safety Element contains more detailed discussion of flood hazards and the
policies and programs designed to reduce the risk of flooding; overall priorities for
improvements to the City’s storm drain system; and area-specific improvements required by the
City.

Description and Performance of Stormwater Best Management Practices
A stormwater Best Management Practice (BMP) is a technique, measure or structural control that
is used for a given set of conditions to manage the quantity and improve the quality of
stormwater runoff in the most cost-effective manner. BMPs can be either engineered and
constructed systems ("structural BMPs") that improve the quality and/or control the quantity of
runoff such as detention ponds and constructed wetlands, or institutional, education or pollution
prevention practices designed to limit the generation of stormwater runoff or reduce the amounts
of pollutants contained in the runoff ("non-structural BMPs"). No single BMP can address all
stormwater problems. Each type has certain limitations based on drainage area served, available
land space, cost, pollutant removal efficiency, as well as a variety of site-specific factors such as
soil types, slopes, depth of groundwater table, etc. Careful consideration of these factors is
necessary in order to select the appropriate BMP or group of BMPs for a particular location.
Goals of Stormwater Best Management Practices
Stormwater BMPs can be designed to meet a variety of goals, depending on the needs of the
practitioner. In existing urbanized areas, BMPs can be implemented to address a range of water
quantity and water quality considerations. For new urban development, BMPs should be
designed and implemented so that the post-development peak discharge rate, volume and
pollutant loadings to receiving waters are the same as pre-development values. In order to meet
these goals, BMPs can be implemented to address three main factors: flow control, pollutant
removal and pollutant source reductions.
In areas undergoing new development or redevelopment, the most effective method of
controlling impacts from stormwater discharges is to limit the amount of rainfall that is
converted to runoff. By utilizing site design techniques that incorporate on-site storage and
infiltration and reduce the amounts of directly connected impervious surfaces, the amount of
runoff generated from a site can be significantly reduced. This can reduce the necessity for
traditional structural BMPs to manage runoff from newly developed areas. There are a number
of practices that can be used to promote on-site storage and infiltration and to limit the amount of
impervious surfaces that are generated. However, the use of on-site infiltration can be limited in
certain areas due to factors such as slope, depth to the water table, and geologic conditions.
•   Site design features such as providing rain barrels, dry wells or infiltration trenches to
    capture rooftop and driveway runoff, maintaining open space, preserving stream buffers and
    riparian corridors, using porous pavement systems for parking lots and driveways, and using
    grassed filter strips and vegetated swales in place of traditional curb-and-gutter type drainage
    systems can greatly reduce the amount of stormwater generated from a site and the associated
    impacts.
•   Street construction features such as placing sidewalks on only one side of the street, limiting
    street widths, reducing frontage requirements and reducing the radius of cul-de-sacs also
    have the potential to significantly reduce the amount of impervious surfaces and therefore the
    amount of rainfall that is converted to runoff.

•   Construction practices such as minimizing disturbance of soils and avoiding compaction of
    lawns and greenways with construction equipment can help to maintain the infiltrative
    capacity of soils.
OBJECTIVE LU 7:        TO DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN A STORM DRAINAGE SYSTEM WHICH
                       ENSURES THE SAFETY AND WELFARE OF RESIDENTS, VISITORS

III. URBAN BOUNDARY ELEMEN
III.     URBAN BOUNDARY ELEMENT
Purpose
The purpose of the Urban Boundary Element is to define the limits for extending City services
and infrastructure in order to accommodate new development anticipated within the 20-year time
frame of this General Plan. The Urban Boundary Element is also intended to provide guidance
related to future annexation of land from the City’s Sphere of Influence. The Urban Boundary
Element is not a state-mandated element; however, it is an important element because it limits
leap-frog development and provides for an orderly transition from rural to urban land uses. The
element recognizes the community’s dedication to orderly and managed growth of the city’s
boundaries and the desire to maintain the rural character of many of the areas and neighborhoods
within the Lakeport Sphere of Influence.
Another critical aspect to expansion of the City of Lakeport is the provision of infrastructure and
services concurrent with new development and annexation. Annexations to the City must be
located within the SOI and adjacent to existing City boundaries in order to be approved by the
Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO). By State law, the City must be notified of any
proposed land use changes within its SOI and be provided an opportunity to comment on the
changes.
The Lake County LAFCO reviews changes to SOIs, annexations to cities and special districts in
Lake County, the adequacy of public services to proposed annexations, and the effect of these
actions on prime agricultural land. LAFCO has adopted local goals, objectives and policies to
guide its decision-making. Lake County LAFCO’s purpose with regards to SOIs is as follows:
1. To ensure orderly urban growth in the areas adjacent to a city, community or district, and in
     particular those areas which might reasonably become a part of such entities at some time in
     the future.
2. To promote cooperative planning efforts between the various cities, County and districts, to
     ensure proper effectuation of their respective general plans.
3. To coordinate property development standards and encourage timely urbanization with
     provisions for adequate and essential services such as sewer, water, fire and police
     protection.
4. To assist other governmental districts and agencies in planning the logical and economical
     extension of all governmental facilities and services, thus avoiding unnecessary duplications.
5. To assist property owners to plan comprehensively for the ultimate use and development of
     their land.
Applications to amend City limits, for example, are presented to LAFCO, which then approves,
approves with conditions, or denies the application.
Urban Boundary Element                                                                 August 2009
City of Lakeport General Plan 2025                                                       Page III-1

The conversion of agricultural lands to urban uses and the provision of urban services by
growing communities are important issues to the County and LAFCO. Potential revenue losses
to counties resulting from annexations have created problems in the relationship between cities
and counties in California, and Lake County is no exception. In order to accomplish a smooth
transition, the County of Lake and the City of Lakeport should enter into an agreement that
outlines procedures and understandings for future annexation areas. The Lakeport area’s
planned growth will, at some time, require annexation to the City. Long range planning in the
Lakeport SOI should reflect a vision shared by both parties, and contain a revenue stream that
can be relied on for the duration of the agreement. An agreement will permit both parties to
focus their limited resources on other matters; its absence will necessitate that the City and
County coordinate their planning programs in a piecemeal fashion.
In determining the Sphere of Influence of each agency, LAFCO must consider and prepare a
written statement of its determinations with respect to the following four factors as stated in
Section 56425 (e) of the Cortese-Knox-Hertzberg Act:
a) The present and planned land use in the area, including agricultural and open-space lands.
b) The present and probable need for public facilities and services in the area.
c) The present capacity of public facilities and adequacy of public services provided by the
    agency.
d) Any social or economic communities of interest in the area that the Commission determines
    is relevant to the agency.
In order to prepare and update Spheres of Influence, LAFCO is required to conduct a review of
the municipal services provided in the county, region, subregion, or other appropriate designated
area. A full discussion of the policies and requirements related to annexation of land from the
Sphere of Influence in to the City limits can be found in the Local Agency Formation
Commission of Lake County Policies, Standards, and Procedures, Amended July 16, 2003. Key
issues related to city annexations include:
a) Annexations of Streets. Annexations shall reflect logical allocation of streets and rights of
    way. Specifically:
    i) LAFCO may require inclusion of additional territory within an annexation in order to
         assure that the city reasonably assumes the burden of providing adequate roads to the
         property to be annexed. LAFCO will require cities to annex streets where adjacent lands
         that are in the City will generate additional traffic or where the annexation will isolate
         sections of county road, but will not require annexation of roads that will create isolated
         sections of city maintained road.
    ii) LAFCO will favorably consider annexations with boundary lines located so that all
         streets and right-of-ways will be placed within the same jurisdiction as the properties
         which either abut thereon or use the streets and right-of-way for access. Except in
August 2009                                                               Urban Boundary Element
Page III-2                                                      City of Lakeport General Plan 2025

        extraordinary circumstances, cities shall annex an entire roadway portion when 50% or
        more of the frontage on both sides of the street will be within the city after completion of
        the annexation.
b) Urban Boundaries. LAFCO will normally adjust annexation boundaries to include adjacent
    urbanized areas in order to maximize the amount of developed urban land inside the city, and
    to minimize piece-meal annexation. As used herein, “urbanized areas” are areas that are
    developed for industrial, commercial or residential use with a density of at least one
    residential unit per 1.5 acres and which receive either public water or sewer service.
c) Pre-zoning Required. The Cortese-Knox-Hertzberg Act requires the City to prezone
    territory to be annexed, and prohibits subsequent changes to the general plan and or pre-
    zoning designations for a period of two years after completion of the annexation, unless the
    city council makes a finding at a public hearing consistent with the provisions of GC 56375
    (e). The City’s prezoning must take into account the likely intended development of the
    specific property. In instances where LAFCO amends a proposal to include additional
    territory, the Commission’s approval of the annexation will be conditional upon completion
    of pre-zoning of the new territory.
ANNEXATION APPLICATION PROCEDURES
While Cortese-Knox-Hertzberg Act permits initiation of applications to LAFCO either by
resolution of the City or by direct landowner/voter petition, LAFCO prefers that the resolution
procedure be utilized wherever feasible. Use of the resolution of application procedure is
preferable because: 1) it involves the City early in the process to assure that the City is
supportive of the proposal, and 2) better integrates CEQA processing by the City as lead agency.
Each applicant shall be advised of this policy at the earliest possible time.
ESTIMATED DEMAND FOR LAND 2005 - 2025
The number of residential, commercial and industrial acres needed in the City of Lakeport
through 2025 is based on population projections through 2025 (see Table 2) and an analysis of
vacant and under-utilized lands currently within the City limits (Tables 3 and 4). By 2010, the
population of Lakeport is estimated to be approximately 5,521 with 34 acres of residential land
needed, 13 acres of commercial land needed, and 10 acres of industrial land needed. By 2025,
the population of Lakeport is estimated to be approximately 6,859, with a total of 156 acres of
residential land needed, 22 acres of commercial land needed and 45 acres of industrial land
needed. Most of the projected land needed can be found in existing vacant infill areas within the
City.

The increased demands for land were projected in a manner that would provide for a sustainable
balance between jobs and housing. Increased demand for residential land comes from the
anticipated population growth in Lakeport over the next 20 years. The projected demand for
additional commercial and industrial lands will provide the employment and tax revenue base
needed to support the anticipated increase in population through the life of this General Plan.

The Urban Growth Boundary for the City of Lakeport is the same boundary as the Lakeport
Sphere of Influence (Figure 3).
                          OBJECTIVES, POLICIES & PROGRAMS
OBJECTIVE UB 1:        TO PROVIDE FOR AN ORDERLY AND EFFICIENT TRANSITION
                       FROM RURAL TO URBAN LAND USES.
Policy UB 1.1: Identify Edges. Identify and use natural and man-made edges, such as Clear
                 Lake, local roadways, and hillsides, for urban development limits and growth
                 phasing.
Policy UB 1.2: Designate Sufficient Land.        Designate an adequate amount of commercial,
                 industrial, and residential land within the Sphere of Influence to meet
                 anticipated land demands throughout the life of the General Plan.
OBJECTIVE UB 2:        TO MINIMIZE URBAN SPRAWL AND LEAP-FROG DEVELOPMENT.
Policy UB 2.1: Infill Development.        The City should encourage infill development, but
                 recognize that infill development can only provide some of the land needed for
                 residential development in the future.
Policy UB 2.2: Annexation Priority: The City should pursue annexations based on the
                 following priority system:
                 1. Commercial and industrial land along South Main Street and Soda Bay
                     Road.
                 2. Land designated as Specific Plan Area
                 3. Land within the southern, southwestern and western Sphere of Influence.
Policy UB 2.3: Urban Management Agreement.              Work with Lake County to ensure that
                 development outside the City limits is supportive of and complimentary to the
                 future growth plans of the City of Lakeport. The two jurisdictions should work
                 towards developing an urban management area agreement.
OBJECTIVE UB 3:        TO IMPLEMENT GROWTH POLICIES WHICH WILL GUIDE THE
                       TIMING, TYPE, AND LOCATION OF GROWTH, PRESERVE
                       RESOURCE LANDS, PROTECT NATURAL FEATURES AND OPEN
                       SPACE, AND ENCOURAGE TECHNIQUES WHICH ENCOURAGE
                       ENERGY CONSERVATION.
Policy UB 3.1: Transitional Buffers. Utilize low density and rural residential land uses as a
                 buffer and transition between long-term agricultural and open space uses and
                 higher density urban development.
Urban Boundary Element                                                              August 2009

Policy UB 3.2: Open Space Gateways. Encourage the use of parks and open space to enhance
               gateways to the City.
Policy UB 3.3: Commercial and Industrial Annexations.              The City shall pursue the
               annexation of land within the Sphere of Influence that is currently used for
               commercial and industrial purposes.
Policy UB 3.4: Residential Development and Annexations. Residential development should
               be discouraged within the Lakeport Sphere of Influence prior to annexation.
OBJECTIVE UB 4:      TO DESIGNATE GROWTH AREAS THAT CAN BE SERVED BY
                     LOGICAL INFRASTRUCTURE EXTENSIONS.
Policy UB 4.1: Urban Services Extensions. The full range of urban services including water,
               sewer, and storm drainage systems shall not be extended outside of the urban
               boundaries for the purposes of development in rural areas.
Policy UB 4.2: Urban Services and Annexations. Prior to annexation of residential land into
               the Lakeport City limits, it must be demonstrated that the full range of urban
               services including water, sewer, and storm drainage systems are in place and
               can sufficiently serve the area to be annexed.
               Program UB 4.2-a: Annexations in the Southern SOI. Pursue annexation of
               commercial and industrial lands within the proposed southern SOI.
               Program UB 4.2-b: Pursue application to LAFCO to amend the Sphere of
               Influence as shown in Figure 3.
               Program UB 4.2-c: Prior to the submittal of an application to LAFCO to
               amend the City’s Sphere of Influence to include the Specific Plan Area, the City
               shall prepare a Specific Plan in accordance with the state Planning and Zonings
               Law, Chapter 3, Local Planning, Article 8 (Specific Plans). Specific issues that
               must be addressed include, but are not limited to, maintaining adequate sewer
               treatment capacity to meet the future needs of Lakeport; hillside development
               regulations; the presence of environmentally-sensitive habitat including oak
               woodlands; Lampson Airport flight path corridor; storm water drainage and
               water quality; and transportation/circulation impacts.

IV. TRANSPORTATION ELEMEN
IV.      TRANSPORTATION ELEMENT
Purpose
It is a requirement of Government Code §65302(b) that every General Plan include a
Transportation Element which consists of “the general location and extent of existing and
proposed thoroughfares, transportation routes, terminals, and other local public utilities and
facilities, all correlated with the Land Use Element of the General Plan.” This Transportation
Element is in conformance with the requirements of the Government Code.
The Transportation Element discusses transportation issues for the City and the Sphere of
Influence. The Element describes the existing circulation system and travel characteristics. It
also projects future traffic, based on the build-out of the land uses described in the Land Use
Element and identifies the resulting anticipated roadway deficiencies.               Policies and
implementation programs contained in this Element provide a guide for decisions regarding
transportation system improvements to accommodate Lakeport’s anticipated growth.
The Transportation Element is organized in the following manner: each issue is first briefly
described with relevant background information; then policies and implementing programs are
presented.
Goals
The City has the following goals for transportation:
•   Develop a City and area-wide circulation system that is safe and efficient.
•   Develop and manage a street and highway system which accommodates future growth.
•   Improve safety on streets for vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists.
•   Preserve the peace and quiet of residential areas.
•   Reduce dependence on the automobile.
•   Regard the quality of life in Lakeport as important as mitigating traffic problems.
Traffic Volume and Level of Service
“Level of Service” is a qualitative measure of traffic operating conditions whereby a letter grade,
‘A’ through ‘F’, corresponding to progressively worsening traffic operating conditions, is
assigned to an intersection or roadway segment. At a signalized intersection, the LOS is
determined by comparing existing traffic volumes and future forecasts to Level of Service
thresholds employed by applicable planning agencies. Level ‘A’ represents free flow conditions
and level ‘F’ represents jammed conditions where traffic flow is at or over the capacity of the
roadway and consequently moves very slowly. The current Level of Service design standard is a
level ‘C.’ Table 6 below explains in more detail the Level of Service Concept.

LEVEL OF SERVICE THRESHOLDS
No readily identifiable thresholds have previously been used which equate daily traffic volumes
with general planning Levels of Service. Thus thresholds previously developed by the Florida
Department of Transportation and employed by many California planning agencies have been
used to identify Levels of Service thresholds on City streets.
According to the Florida Department of Transportation the presence of a raised median could
increase Level of Service thresholds by about 5 percent. While the presence of wider shoulders
and or bicycle lanes will promote overall safety, the general capacity of the street may not be
affected by this extra width. Resulting LOS thresholds are presented in Table 7 below while the
definitions of each street type are presented in Table 8 and the classifications for each major
roadway are shown in Table 9.

Definitions of Street Types
 Street Type       Definition
 Freeway           A freeway is a divided highway with full-control of access. Complete separation of
                   conflicting traffic movements is provided. It is thus the highest form of roadway
                   design, and is intended to provide for the expeditious movement of large volumes of
                   traffic between, across, around or through a city, area, or a region. It is not intended
                   to provide access to abutting land.
 Arterial          The primary function of an arterial is to provide for: [1] traffic movement between
                   areas and across portions of a city; [2] direct service to principal traffic generators;
                   and [3] a connection to the freeway-expressway system. A subordinate function of
                   arterials is the provision of direct access to abutting land. Since the primary function
                   of this street type is to provide for the movement of vehicles rather than afford
                   access to abutting land or temporary parking for vehicles, arterial streets are
                   typically subject to regulation and control of parking, turning movements, entrances,
                   exits, and curb use where conditions warrant. Control of access may also be
                   required at some locations.
 Collector         Collector streets link small areas of neighborhoods to the arterial street system.
                   They also carry much of the through-traffic within residential, industrial, and
                   commercial areas and serve to connect adjacent neighborhoods. An important part
                   of their function is to provide access to abutting property.
 Local Street      Local streets are intended to provide direct access to residential, commercial,
                   industrial or other abutting land. These streets should serve local traffic movements
                   and are not intended to handle through-traffic.

EXISTING ROADWAY NETWORK AND TRAFFIC FLOW
Lakeport’s roadway network is defined and constrained by two barriers: Clear Lake on the East
and State Highway 29 on the West. The majority of the city is laid out in a rectangular grid
pattern which is interrupted by hilly terrain. In these hilly areas the street system becomes
discontinuous and through traffic is difficult. Many of the City’s streets are narrow, not
improved to current standards, and will require upgrading. In addition, further development of
the street system between Bevins and Main Streets is prevented by large areas devoted to public
facilities such as the City corporation yard and the Lake County Fairgrounds.
Although construction of the State Highway 29 freeway has reduced congestion downtown, it is
now a barrier inhibiting east-west circulation through the Planning Area. Access across State
Route 29 is only available at: Eleventh Street; Martin Street; Lakeport Boulevard; the South
Main Street intersection with Highway 29; and the Hill Road crossing, as indicated in Figure 4.
State Route 29 permits vehicles to bypass the downtown area and carries the largest amount of
traffic through Lakeport. When the HW 29 bypass was constructed in 1970, it carried between
2,000 and 4,000 vehicles per day significantly reducing the amount of through traffic on Main
Street and other city streets. Lakeport has grown considerably resulting in an increase in traffic
volumes on Main Street. Traffic volumes will continue to increase commensurate with
population growth in Lakeport and the County.
Traffic volumes continue to increase on arterials and many collectors, particularly in the
downtown area. The central core, bounded by First, Third, Forbes and Park Streets, generates
more vehicular traffic than anywhere else in Lakeport. The majority of north-south through
traffic is carried on State Route 29 and on the Main Street, High Street, Lakeshore Boulevard
corridor. East/west traffic volumes are the highest on Lakeport Boulevard and Eleventh Street.
In January 2005 traffic counts were made at locations on major roads in Lakeport in order to
supplement data available from Caltrans and other recent studies. This sample of current traffic
volumes was intended to look at those roads which already carry major traffic volumes and
which are expected to carry high traffic volumes in the future. Count locations are presented in
Figure 5, while the counts themselves are described in Table 10. The current daily traffic
volumes on most of these roads fall within the Level of Service ‘C’ standard, indicating that
current traffic conditions in the community are good.

CURRENT PEAK HOUR LEVELS OF SERVICE
The a.m. (7:00 to 9:00 a.m.) and p.m. (4:00 to 6:00 p.m.) peak hour Levels of Service were also
determined for three major intersections in Lakeport in January 2005. These locations were
identified based on local knowledge of locations where improvements may soon be warranted.
Levels of Service were calculated using the methodologies presented in the 2000 Highway
Capacity Manual, and the results are presented in Table 11. At all-way stops, the “overall” Level
of Service for all motorists has been determined. At intersections controlled by side street stops,
the Level of Service for the “worst” movement has been presented.
As shown, the overall Level of Service at each location is within the City’s LOS ‘C’ standard.
However, the volume of traffic at the Main Street / Lakeport Blvd intersection already satisfies
Caltrans Warrant No. 11 (peak hour volume) for signalization.

SEASONAL TRAFFIC VARIATION
The volume of traffic on the major roads around Lakeport can vary throughout the year,
primarily as a result of seasonal tourist activity. Volume observed during the late summer
months (July, August and September) can be much higher than data collected in the winter. It is
reasonable to expect that counts conducted in January would be indicative of “average” or
“below average” conditions.
To provide perspective on this issue, data available from Caltrans regarding the volume of traffic
on SR 29 and SR 175 was obtained and reviewed. To provide a rough indication of the
variation, daily traffic volumes recorded in the “peak month” were compared to the reported
annual average daily traffic volume. As noted in Table 12, peak month volumes are an average
of about 8 percent higher than the annual average.

ROADWAY IMPROVEMENTS
Congestion on the City’s arterial and collector street systems, including the downtown area will
become a problem. Actions are needed to improve existing traffic flow and mitigate the impacts
of existing and future land development. Major improvements to the existing system are
necessary, including road widening, additional crossings over/under the freeway, new roads,
additional traffic controls, including signalization of intersections, and perhaps one-way couplet
systems.
The policy section recommends that traffic engineering and planning evaluation of the one-way
couplets be carried out prior to their inclusion into the City’s Capital Improvement Program.
One-way couplets may have potentially adverse impacts on the character of the downtown area
and adjacent residential neighborhoods, parking and safety.
Funds will not be available to build all the roadway improvements required to offset or
significantly improve future traffic congestion in Lakeport and its Sphere of Influence. The
roadway improvements listed in Appendix B, however, represent the most important and cost
effective improvements. These recommended improvements constitute the City’s Long Range
Roadway Improvement Program. The locations of these improvements are located in Figure 6.
The recommended roadway improvements listed below have a high, medium and low priority
rating. The following criteria have been used to develop these priorities: Criteria 1: Projects
that increase the north-south capacity of the roadway network; Criteria 2: Projects that increase
east-west capacity of the roadway network; and Criteria 3: Improvements to the local street
network to close gaps and improve the safety and efficiency of the roadway system. The priority
ranking of recommended roadway improvements should be reviewed periodically in relation to
available funding and the City’s changing needs.
Lakeport has several characteristics which increase the difficulty of improving the roadway
system such as: hilly terrain; a relatively large amount of undeveloped land located within City
limits; and many substandard roads. The policies contained below provide a systematic
approach to improving the City’s roadway system. Additional capacity is needed to carry the
increased amount of projected traffic. The recommended improvements to the roadway system
are organized under policies and implementation programs for System-wide Improvements,
Route Completion, and Road Maintenance and Improvement.
Transportation Element                                                                             August 2009
City of Lakeport General Plan 2025                                                                     Page IV-9

The local street system in Lakeport is incomplete and has many discontinuous, narrow, and
unimproved streets. In many areas hilly topography has prevented the completion of the
collector system, leaving gaps in the street system. Consequently, through traffic is forced to
take local streets through residential neighborhoods and through the Main Street corridor.
Poorly designed and improperly maintained roads have been a continuing problem in Lakeport.
Many roads were built before City standards and planning regulations existed. The improvement
of the City’s roads to meet current standards will increase the capacity and safety of the roadway
system.
FUNDING
As the City continues to grow, there will be a need to identify increased revenue sources in order
to maintain and improve the Lakeport street system. New development shall pay for its share of
multi-modal transportation improvements required to accommodate the growth that it generates.
Approval of new developments and/or financial contributions toward improvements required as
the result of project approval. The transportation impacts of development occur throughout the
region irrespective of jurisdictional boundaries. Development in the County near to the City will
affect traffic near Lakeport, and similarly the growth of Lakeport will impact the County’s
roadway system. For this reason, it is necessary to establish a regional traffic mitigation fee
program involving Lake County and the City.
BICYCLE TRANSPORTATION
The City has a fragmented bicycle circulation network which uses a variety of local streets.
East-west routes through the City are limited. Few improvements have been made to the
bikeways system in the past due to a lack of funds. The importance of a safe and comprehensive
bikeways system is recognized and will be more fully incorporated into the City’s transportation
planning. Lakeport is a sufficiently small and compact community where it is still practical to
use a bicycle for many trips. (Bikeways are also discussed in relation to paths and trails in the
Conservation, Open Space and Parks Element.)
The California Street and Highways code has established three categories of bikeways based on
needs and physical conditions of the right-of-way. The bikeway categories are as follows:
•   Class 1 Bikeway-Bike Path-Bike Trail: these facilities are constructed on separate right-of-
    ways, are completely separated from the street traffic and have minimal crossflows of
    automobile traffic. The state standard for minimum paved width of a two-way bike path is
    eight feet.
•   Class 2 Bikeway-Bike Lane: A restricted right-of-way for the exclusive use of bicycles with
    vehicle parking and crossflow by pedestrians and motorists permitted. Bike lanes are
    normally striped within paved areas of highways and are one-directional with a minimum
    standard width of five feet.

•   Class 3 Bikeway-Bike Route: A route for bicyclists designated by signs or other markings
    and shared with pedestrians and motorists. Bike routes are typically designated to provide
    linkages to the Bikeway system where Class 1 or 2 Bikeways cannot be provided.
The existing bikeways system in Lakeport provides a basis for expanding bicycle use for both
work and recreation related trips. Increasing the number of Class 1 and 2 bikeways and
providing additional bike storage facilities at public transit facilities, commercial/office
developments and schools would significantly promote greater use of bicycles near the City.
Figure 7 indicates the existing and future bikeways in Lakeport.
FACILITIES FOR PEDESTRIANS
Many residential areas in the City are built without sidewalks. The construction of sidewalks
would significantly increase pedestrian safety, particularly for children going to and from school.
Funds to construct sidewalks in these areas are available form Improvement Districts where
property owners agree to pay for sidewalk construction and from the City’s General and
Redevelopment Funds. Use of the City’s General Fund to build sidewalks is unlikely, unless
community-wide benefit can be demonstrated. It is recommended in the Policy section that the
City carry out an inventory and map existing sidewalks in relation to schools, parks and major
arterials to identify priority areas for sidewalk construction and inform the community of the
financing options for such improvements.
The importance of improving facilities for pedestrians in Lakeport is acknowledged in various
sections of this Plan. In some areas of the City, the lack of sidewalks represents a potential
safety hazard and City policies now require that sidewalks be installed at the time of
development. Providing additional pedestrian paths in the Downtown area is one of the key
aspects of the Urban Design Standards. The Conservation, Open Space and Park Element
identifies existing and proposed walking trails throughout the community.
Generally, sidewalks should be installed along both sides of all downtown streets, arterials,
collectors and on all streets leading to public transit facilities and to schools. In low density
residential areas, sidewalks on only one side of the street may be appropriate, depending on the
street configuration, topography and location of the development.
In older areas already developed without sidewalks, and in low density residential areas which
typically have a swale adjacent to the road instead of a sidewalk, curb and gutter, it may be
preferable to build an asphalt pathway to separate pedestrians from vehicular traffic.
Adequate lighting is essential for safety for all pedestrian facilities. Much street lighting is
vehicular rather than pedestrian-oriented. Pedestrian-oriented lighting is typically located lower
to the ground and is more closely spaced than vehicular-oriented lighting.

PUBLIC TRANSIT
The Lakeport area is served by Lake Transit. Fixed route service links the City with Ukiah via
SR 29, SR 20, and US 101 (Route &), as well as with Northshore and Southshore communities
(Route 1 and Route 4) from the 3rd Street/Main Street transit hub. A door to door dial-a-ride
service is also available.
Public transit is financed through a portion of the State sales tax which is reserved for that
specific use. The local transportation planning agency, Lake County/City Area Planning Council
(APC), is responsible for administering the funds in Lake County. Requests for new service,
service changes, and service reductions are considered by the APC.
TRAFFIC SAFETY
As vehicular traffic increases and roadways and intersections become more heavily used, the
potential for conflict increases. The demand for safer intersections and roadways and the
necessity for appropriate measures to improve traffic operation will increase with growth. The
emphasis of the policies below is to improve traffic safety below by identifying and removing
roadway hazards.
AIR TRANSPORTATION
Lampson Field is located in the County outside of Lakeport’s Sphere of Influence. It provides
the principal air transportation facility in western Lake County. Although there are no scheduled
commercial flights into Lampson Field, it has a significant volume of private aircraft operations
and provides an air taxi service. The County’s Master Plan for Lampson Field Airport describes
the expected growth in airport operations and related development to the year 2010. The City is
represented on the Airport Land Use Commission (ALUC) and is working to mitigate impact on
Lakeport of the proposed Lampson Field Airport expansion. In addition, sea planes regularly
land on Clear Lake near the city boundaries. Additional policies and programs relating to
Lampson Field Airport are contained in the Safety Element.

                 Program T 3.1-a: Carry out a thorough evaluation of the effectiveness of the
                 one-way couplet systems listed in Appendix B that takes into consideration:
                 their effectiveness; cost; and impacts on safety, parking, community identity,
                 existing residential neighborhoods and on the downtown area. Ensure that
                 Lakeport residents and business people are fully informed about the couplet
                 evaluation study and have every opportunity to participate in its review through
                 community workshops and public hearings.

Policy T 4.1:    Traffic Mitigation for New Development. Require new development to
                 provide off-site improvements that adequately mitigate traffic problems they
                 generate.
Policy T 5.1:    Disruption of Street Improvements. Strive to make improvements to the
                 street network in a manner that minimizes disruption to adjacent residential
                 neighborhoods.
                 Program T 5.1-a: Establish, in cooperation with Caltrans and the County,
                 mitigation measures to reduce the impact of adjacent neighborhoods for both the

V. COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMEN
V.       COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT
Purpose
This Community Design Element is intended to address the built and natural environment. This
includes the image and character of Lakeport’s neighborhoods; the quality of buildings, streets,
and public spaces; the community’s historical attributes; and the importance Clear Lake has in
defining the character of the City.
Community design is about community building. It is broader in scope than the mere appearance
of a building; it concerns the built character, order, and sense of place of the area. It is the
interrelationship between various components (buildings, transportation systems, open space,
vistas, interaction of humans between each other and the natural environment, heritage, and
economics) that, when put together, make up a total community. Good community design is
building communities that are safe for children to walk to school and for the elderly to cross the
street. It is how to maintain the downtown as a place where local residents, as well as visitors
want to go to shop, dine, and interact with each other. It balances the often conflicting goals of
respect for the environment with economic gain. It creates places for people to feel comfortable
with each other and with the built environment.
Aspects of Community Design in the Built Environment
RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT
Residential districts in Lakeport provide residents with a wide array of lifestyles and home
choices. Over 18 percent of the housing units in Lakeport are mobile homes, most located within
mobile home parks. Residential areas in the northwest portion of the City and within the Sphere
of Influence are predominately large-lot rural residential neighborhoods. Residential areas near
the city-center follow a more traditional small lot residential development pattern with grid
streets, minimal building setbacks, and residential densities in excess of 7 units per acre.
As the residential population of Lakeport continues to grow, additional housing units and
residential neighborhoods will be developed both as infill, and as new construction around the
periphery of the existing developed areas of Lakeport. Future patterns of growth will have a
significant impact on the character and sense of place of the City.
Safe, comfortable housing is, of course, a key element of a livable community. New
development must respect the scale and intensity of adjacent older neighborhoods. New
development should provide physical connections through streets, lanes and/or trails wherever
possible so that pedestrians, bicycles, automobiles, and other forms of transit can move safely
and easily between local destinations, and between home and work.

RURAL RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT
Much of the existing residential development within the Lakeport Sphere of Influence and
around the periphery of the City limits is rural in nature, with homes located on relatively large
lots (1 acre and larger). These areas, commonly referred to as “Conventional Subdivisions”
include residential developments where all the land is divided into houselots and streets, with the
only open space typically being undevelopable wetlands, steep slopes, floodplains, and
stormwater management areas.

      These two figures represent
      land use patterns in a typical
      conventional subdivision. Most
      of the land on the project site is
      parceled into private lots, which
      leaves very little land left over
      for habitat preservation and
      open space.

 As future development takes place around the periphery of Lakeport, and within the Sphere of
 Influence, every attempt should be made to cluster residential lots where feasible. Future
 subdivision of large parcels or tracts of land for residential development should attempt to
 protect and enhance the natural environment. Primary sensitive conservation areas such as
 bodies of water, easements, floodplains, steep slopes, wetlands, and wooded areas should be
 preserved and protected from encroaching residential development. Site designs, lot layouts, and
 the positioning of roads and infrastructure should also respect natural buffers, historical
 components, landmarks, prime views, land contours and public vistas. Properly designed
 clustered residential development should allow every lot to front publicly owned and preserved
 open space.
                                                Figure 9a, Clustered Residential Subdivision
These two figures represent
clustered residential development
patterns. By placing smaller lots
relatively close together, large
amounts of contiguous open space
are preserved, which allows for
improved habitat conservation,
greater public access, and a
network of trails which would not
be possible in a conventional
subdivision.

TRADITIONAL NEIGHBORHOOD DEVELOPMENT
Wherever practical, new residential neighborhoods and new residential developments in and
around Lakeport should follow traditional neighborhood design guidelines. Traditional
neighborhoods are characterized by the following traits:
•   Streets are arranged on the grid system, rather than curvilinear streets with cul-de-sacs or flag
    lots.
•   Roads are generally narrower than conventional subdivisions, and have curbs, bike lanes, and
    a planting strip between the road and the sidewalk.
•   Development standards are flexible to allow for a variety of lots sizes, minimal setbacks, and
    zero lot lines.
•   Where practical, garages should be placed to the rear of the parcel, accessible through an
    alleyway.
•   Homes should be oriented towards the streets and common areas and have front porches and
    verandas.
•   Generous planting of street trees.
•   Parks and schools should be established within or near these types of residential
    neighborhoods.
                 Figure 10, Traditional Neighborhood Design Street Section
Street design can have a tremendous impact on the character and pedestrian friendliness of a
neighborhood. Street trees provide shade, enhance the walking experience, and provide a safety
buffer between vehicles and pedestrians. Narrow street widths act as a traffic calming measure,
additionally enhancing the walkability of neighborhoods.
Traditional residential neighborhoods are particularly appropriate near or adjacent to mixed-use
developments, civic facilities, schools, and parks.

INFILL, REDEVELOPMENT, AND OLDER AREA REVITALIZATION
Infill and reuse opportunities will become increasingly important as compact development within
the existing urban area continues. Compact development maximizes the efficient use of land and
infrastructure and avoids the intrusion of urban uses on the natural landscape. Infill and reuse
strategies must also be major components of economic development and redevelopment
planning. Infill uses, by definition, are additions to the existing community and must respect the
pre-existing uses, patterns, and community aesthetics. Wherever possible, infill strategies should
create areas which contain mixtures of complementary uses that are within safe, easy and
convenient walking distance of each other.
COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT
Over the next 20 years Lakeport will continue to grow and expand its economic base and
commercial land uses. Much like residential neighborhoods, commercial areas must serve
unique purposes and adapt to suit the existing conditions and future needs of the community and
the neighborhood in which they are located. The placement, design, density, and orientation of
new commercial development within Lakeport will have an impact on the future character of the
City.
There are a variety of forms that commercial development can take, and each has corresponding
effects on other types of land uses, traffic, air quality, pedestrian accessibility, and aesthetic
quality.
LINEAR DEVELOPMENT
Linear commercial development, or strip development, typically focuses on lining new offices
and businesses along a single major roadway. This type of growth creates a “strip” of
commercial uses, typically encompassing both sides of a roadway. Characteristics of linear
development include the following:
•   Parking is situated in the front of the building,
                                                            Figure 11
    with lots generally running the length of the           Linear Commercial Development
    building
•   Buildings are set back relatively far back from the
    roadway to allow for larger parking areas in front
    of the development.
•   Parking lots are provided for individual buildings,
    increasing the total amount of land needed for
    new developments.
•   Landscaping improvements must cover a large
    linear area around the front and sides of lots,
    increasing the amount of landscaping needed to
    effective screen and shield buildings.

NODAL DEVELOPMENT
Nodal, or clustered, commercial development groups offices and businesses around major
intersections, allowing for a more concentrated pattern of growth. By clustering similar or
complimentary land uses, nodal development allows for such conveniences as shared parking
and access, pedestrian friendly site design, common public open spaces, and reduced overall land
consumption. Characteristics of nodal development include the following:
•   Parking is set to the rear of buildings to reduce impacts on the streetscape and improve the
    visual aesthetic quality of the development.
•   Building setbacks are reduced, allowing for businesses to locate closer to the street. This
    allows for greater building visibility and more convenient pedestrian access.
•   Shared parking facilities result in a lower overall land consumption than what is normally
    found with traditional linear commercial development.
•   Landscape improvements typically consume less space.
•   Businesses and offices which compatible or complimentary uses located within the same
    development improve the consumer draw to that location and have positive economic ripple
    effects.

                 In 1985, California joined a growing national movement to improve the quality of
life in America's towns, cities and neighborhoods by restoring the economic health of Main
Streets historic, traditionally designed central business districts. Developed by the National
Trust for Historic Preservation's National Main Street Center, the Main Street Approach
organizes a district's comprehensive revitalization efforts into a four-point framework:
organization, promotion, design, and economic restructuring. This framework ensures the
district's place as the heart of a community.
A certified local Main Street program must meet stringent criteria set forth by California Main
Street as well as complete an application and pass an on-site assessment conducted by the state
program. California Main Street does not provide funding; the program provides training;
information, research, and referral services, and technical assistance.
The program is focused on enhancing the economic, social, cultural, and environmental well-
being of historic and traditional commercial districts located in California's diverse cities,
towns, and neighborhoods, California Main Street has helped communities build strong broad-
based organizations to implement and manage the revitalization process.
DOWNTOWN COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT
Lakeport has been able to maintain its small town charm and attraction to visitors in part by
maintaining the vitality of its downtown. The downtown commercial area’s landscaping,
history, retail opportunities, pedestrian accessibility, and proximity to Clear Lake are all positive
attributes that create the cultural and economic core of the City for both residents and visitors.
The Downtown Master Plan, adopted in 1989, established urban design guidelines specifically
for downtown Lakeport; the area defined by Martin St. to the south, Seventh St. to the north,
Forbes St. to the west, and Clear Lake to the east. The purpose of the Plan is to revitalize the
downtown and strengthen its role within the community. Key goals of the Downtown Master
Plan include:
•    To increase property values through construction of new commercial and multifamily
     residential development and renovation of existing structures.
•    To provide facilities and amenities for the downtown which encourage pedestrian movement
     and special events.
•    To preserve and enhance historic buildings and sites.

•   To retain Lakeport’s small town character while accommodating growth and economic
    development.
•   To improve retail sales volumes of downtown businesses.
MIXED-USE DEVELOPMENT
In addition to downtown and pure commercial               Figure 13, Mixed Use Development
developments, the City may seek to include
mixed-use developments in some areas. Mixed-
use areas will include those developments
consisting of more than one type of land use.
Typical types include combinations of multi-
family residential and office, multi-family
residential and commercial retail, or commercial
institutional.
Mixing land uses (commercial, residential,
recreational, educational, and others) in
neighborhoods or places that are accessible by
bike and foot can create vibrant and diverse communities. Mixed land uses are critical to
achieving great places to live, work, play, shop, and meet friends. Mixed land uses also convey
substantial fiscal and economic benefits. Commercial uses in close proximity to residential areas
often have higher property values and therefore help increase local tax revenues. Mixed-use
developments also reduce the amount of land consumed through shared parking arrangements,
and vertical rather than horizontal building expansion.
Figure 14, Mixed Use Street Section
                                                 Mixed-use development combines ground-floor
                                                 retail with upper-story offices or residential.
                                                 Buildings have varied, interesting facades with
                                                 frequent doors, windows, and architectural
                                                 styles appropriate to the regional character.
                                                 Buildings are set at the street, with on-street
                                                 parking, or close to the street (as shown in
                                                 Figure 14), with a modest amount of diagonal
                                                 parking in front.      This maintains a close
                                                 relationship between the street, sidewalk, and
                                                 buildings, and keeps the street and sidewalk as a
                                                 pedestrian-friendly realm. In contrast, modern,
                                                 suburban-style retail development surrounds
                                                 low, monotonous buildings with large parking
                                                 lots, discouraging walking.

Lighting
Exterior lighting for pedestrian areas, building facades, and landscape design features should be
complementary in style, color, and lamping with public street and pedestrian lighting. It is not
necessary to duplicate light fixtures used on city streets but fixtures proposed for building
exteriors should work effectively with street lighting. The following policies for architectural
lighting are intended to improve the lighting of public and private development throughout the
city.
Lighting should serve functional, safety, and aesthetic purposes. Light can be used to identify
important civic buildings, thus giving cohesion to the physical structure of the community; to
convey a private image for commercial or residential development; and to increase the use of
public places at night. The objectives of a lighting program for Lakeport are:
•   Encourage an abundance of high-quality outdoor lighting to give important areas of the city
    vitality and sparkle at night.
•   Have on-site lighting contribute to site security.
•   Have on-site lighting complement and reinforce the architecture.
•   Have on-site parking area lighting fixtures and illumination levels be consistent throughout
    the city.
•   Prevent on-site lighting from casting glare onto adjacent parcels and streets.
•   Encourage lighting design that is in conformance with energy saving guidelines.

               manner to define spaces and to relate to buildings and structures.
               Program CD 7.3-a: Continue to enforce the Zoning Ordinance, which includes
               landscape standards. Require older commercial areas to provide landscaping
               and to maintain existing landscaping.
Policy CD 7.4: Tree Preservation.       Facilitate the preservation of existing native trees, the
               planting of additional street trees, and the replanting of trees lost through
               disease, new construction or by other means. Achieve continuity of streets
               through the use of repetition of similar trees and shrubs. (Additional policies
               and programs relating to trees are consolidated in the Conservation, Open Space
               and Parks Elements)
Policy CD 7.5: Xeriscaping. Utilize drought resistant landscaping such as xeriscape. Limit the
               amount of turf or lawn area of the site and require use of water conserving
               irrigation systems.
Policy CD 7.6: Signage. Facilitate the installation of attractive and functional signs.
               Program CD 7.6-a: Revise the sign ordinance to encourage good design in
               signage. The ordinance should consider the following items:
               •    Visual Compatibility. Each sign should consider visual compatibility with
                    the surroundings. Each sign should be designed to complement the
                    architectural and landscape styles of the main buildings or buildings with
                    respect to visual elements such as construction materials, color, or other
                    design details.
               •    Scale of Signage. The scale of signs, letters, and symbols should be
                    appropriate to their use, whether to catch the eye of a passing motorist or
                    strolling window shopper. Color should be used carefully. Limited use of

                     several colors with strong contrast between background and signing is
                     recommended to make the signs easily readable.
                 •   Quality of Signage. Signs should be constructed with quality materials and
                     in a craftsman-like manner to ensure both an attractive appearance and a
                     durable project.
                 •   Public Signage. Public signing and graphics for traffic control and public
                     information should be consistent throughout the city. Special colors and
                     consolidation of signs on special frames could add a positive element to the
                     streetscape.
                 •   Prohibited Signage. Promotional banners, balloons or similar promotional
                     devices should not be allowed, except when used on a temporary basis to
                     celebrate a specific event approved by the city. Moving, flashing, or sound
                     emitting signs should be prohibited. Exposed lamps or tubing, except neon,
                     should be discouraged. All conduit, wiring, transformers, raceways, and all
                     fastening devices for sign, face, side, and exposed structures should be
                     concealed from public areas. An effort should be made to reduce copy
                     down to the minimum necessary to convey the message.
                 •   Temporary Signage. Temporary development, real estate, and leasing signs
                     should be permitted only during the development phase for the purpose of
                     identifying the business or company developing and leasing the parcel.
Policy CD 7.7: Lighting Fixtures. Utilize the following guidelines for the review of exterior
                 lighting fixtures:
                 •   Night lighting of buildings should be done in a selective fashion and should
                     be indirect in character with no source of light visible.
                 •   Keynote special features such as towers and decorative cornices.
                     Emphasize repetitive elements such as columns.
                 •   Use light to articulate architectural composition, such as spotlighting
                     vertical elements of a vertical building and illuminating roof eaves.
                 •   Use interior light sources as part of the total design. Architectural lighting
                     should articulate and animate the particular building design.
                 •   Height. Light standard heights should be related to the lighting need of the
                     use: street lights up to 30 feet high; parking areas up to 18 feet high;
                     walkways and malls up to 15 feet high; planting areas up to 3 feet high.
                 •   Function. Lighting for pedestrian movement should illuminate changes in
                     grade, path intersections, seating area, and any other areas along a path
Community Design Element                                                               August 2009
City of Lakeport General Plan 2025                                                       Page V-17

                   which, left unlit, would cause the user to feel insecure. As a rule of thumb,
                   one foot candle per square foot is adequate. Building-mounted light fixtures
                   should be used judiciously. Their primary purpose should be to illuminate
                   pedestrian spaces. Subtle accent lighting of unique architectural elements
                   should be considered. The arbitrary lighting of building facades and roofs
                   should be prohibited.
               •   Hazards. Light posts should be located in such a manner that they will not
                   become safety hazards to pedestrians or vehicles. Lights should not blink,
                   flash or change intensity. Shatterproof or vandal resistant coverings are
                   recommended for low-level lighting where there is danger of breakage.
                   Lighting should not intrude on adjacent property or cause glare into drivers’
                   eyes. Any light source over 10 feet high should incorporate a cut-off shield
                   to prevent light spill. Service area lighting should be contained within the
                   service yard boundaries and enclosure walls. No light spillover should
                   occur outside the service area. The light source should not be visible from
                   the street.
               •   Energy. Lighting systems should be energy efficient.
Policy CD 7.8: Aesthetic Character. Install a variety of planters, benches, tree grates, bike
               racks, and trash receptacles to enhance the aesthetic character of the downtown
               area. Select street furniture that relates well to the historic character of the
               Downtown. Place street furniture in landscaped areas so as not to impede
               pedestrian movement.
Policy CD 7.9: Alternative Energy. The City shall encourage and make maximum use of
               energy from alternative sources, including, but not limited to solar power, wind
               power, hydropower, and water pumping.

VI. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMEN
VI.     ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
Purpose
The purpose of the Economic Development Element is to provide guidance for economic
development within the City of Lakeport in order to attain an economically viable and self-
sustaining community. In this sense, economic viability means providing a range of housing and
employment opportunities that meet the needs of both residents and workers, attracting families
and businesses to create demand for planned land uses and establishing and funding public
service levels that preserve and enhance Lakeport’s quality of life.
The Economic Development Element is an optional element of Lakeport’s General Plan.
Authority for the Economic Development Element is found in State Government Code § 65303,
which allows cities and counties to add optional elements beyond State-mandated elements. The
Economic Development Element is not a required element in the General Plan; however, once
adopted an optional element carries the same legal weight as any of the other elements.
Economic Characteristics
The City of Lakeport supports approximately 45% of all jobs in Lake County. Additionally the
majority of Lake County Government offices are located within the City of Lakeport. There are
six business centers in the Lakeport area, including the historic downtown area which is
designated as a California Main Street City. The City’s permanent retail trade area population is
approximately 30,000, and per capita sales figures are among the highest in the region, and
generally higher than the State average. This can be attributed to at least three characteristics of
the Lakeport area: a high level of spendable income by residents; the recognition of Lakeport as
a local retailing center; and the impact of tourism.
Lakeport is known as a regional recreational destination, and this attribute should be maximized
in any effort undertaken by the City to encourage and foster economic development. The clean
air, natural beauty, and the multitude of recreational opportunities afforded by Clear Lake and
the surrounding areas are great assets to the community and provide an economic advantage to
visitor serving businesses.
The largest business sector (in terms of number of businesses) in Lakeport’s economy is services
(45 percent), followed by retail trade (19 percent), and then finance, insurance and real estate (9
percent). These three sectors account for 639 businesses or 73 percent of all businesses in
Lakeport.
The classification of “services” includes some of the larger revenue-generating businesses such
as the hospital and other health care providers, but also many of the small “mom and pop”
businesses such as repair services, child care, building maintenance, and beauty shops. Total
employment in the services sector is 2,342 persons.
Economic Development Element                                                          August 2009
City of Lakeport General Plan 2025                                                       Page VI-1

Much like the services sector of the economy, the retail sector of the economy is characterized
by small retail stores greatly outnumbering the large ones. One half of the 171 retail trade
businesses fall into just seven categories: eating places, used merchandise, gifts and novelties,
grocery, auto and home supply, miscellaneous retail, and miscellaneous food stores.
The majority of the sales revenue in the City is derived from a minority of businesses. The top
5.4 percent of businesses with revenue over $1 million per year generate over 65 percent of the
total revenue in the City of Lakeport. The top 10.9 percent of businesses with revenue over
$500,000 per year generate almost 76 percent of the revenues in the City. This group of larger
businesses includes some large retailers, the school district, banks, a developer and some
construction companies, a few grape growers, utilities, a pharmaceutical preparation company, a
racing association and some others. One-half of the jobs in Lakeport are concentrated in just
forty establishments.
Lakeport’s commercial base is spread widely throughout the City in multiple shopping centers, at
small commercial nodes, and in dozens of free-standing business locations such as: Shoreline
Center, Bruno’s Foods, K-Mart, Vista Point Center, Hamburger Hill, Nylander Neighborhood
Center, and Willow Tree Plaza. This makes it difficult for Lakeport to create a “sense of place”
and an identifiable center. It also creates a busy auto-dependent shopping environment.
The City has undertaken previous efforts to improve economic conditions within the City. In
March 2003, the City of Lakeport Business Retention and Recruitment Strategy was completed.
This report was funded by a Planning and Technical Assistance Grant from the California
Department of Housing and Community Development. One key issue which was identified
within the report was the concern expressed by local business owners with the local government
of the City. Many survey respondents contacted during the study believe that city codes,
standards, fees, and expectations from local small businesses are unrealistic and prohibitive. The
business people who were interviewed raised specific concerns about the City relating to:
•   Development and infrastructure costs imposed;
•   Inconsistent code enforcement;
•   Last minute changes to approved project plans;
•   Limited or poor communication about City policies, expectations, and activities; and
• Limited outreach to the business community.
                          OBJECTIVES, POLICIES, & PROGRAMS
The following objectives, policies, and programs are intended to facilitate positive economic
growth and development within Lakeport.

VII. CONSERVATION ELEMEN
VII. CONSERVATION ELEMENT
Purpose
The Conservation Element provides direction regarding the conservation, development, and
utilization of natural resources. Its requirements overlap those of the open space, land use, safety
and transportation elements. The conservation element is distinguished by being primarily
oriented toward natural resources. Population growth and development continually require the
use of both renewable and nonrenewable resources. One role of the conservation element is to
establish policies that reconcile conflicting demand on those resources.
There are nine mandatory issues which must be addressed by the Conservation Element: water
and its hydraulic force; forests; soils; rivers and other waters; harbors; fisheries; wildlife;
minerals and other natural resources.
Biological Resources
Lakeport is uniquely situated in an area that is rich in biological resources. There is an abundance
of fish in Clear Lake, many species of plant and animals in nearby wetlands and hundreds of
acres of oak savannah woodlands. Protecting these valuable resources is essential for maintaining
a healthy environment, sustaining the region's tourist industry, and the quality of life of the
community. The policies and implementation programs in this element are intended to protect
biological resources from development and careless management practices.
The Lakeport region is composed of a variety of plant communities that support a diversity of
wildlife species. Each plant community is dependent on special ecological factors within that
particular plant community. Micro-habitats occur within each plant community and are
generally the result of a unique physical and/or biological factor. Most of the rare, threatened
and endangered plants in Lake County occur in micro-habitats such as vernal pools and/or
serpentine soils. The habitat types in the vicinity of the City of Lakeport are presented and
described below.
SHORELINE
The remaining undeveloped portions of the Clear Lake shoreline are composed of marsh and
riparian habitat that supports a diverse and abundant variety of fish and wildlife. Wildlife that is
common to shoreline areas includes a variety of ducks, herons, grebes, egrets, ospreys and fur-
bearing mammals. Large populations of catfish, crappie, largemouth bass, carp and hitch are
found in Clear Lake along the shores. A majority of the wetland habitat located along the Clear
Lake shoreline has been lost to urban and agricultural development.

City of Lakeport General Plan 2025                                                        Page VII-1
RIPARIAN AREA
Riparian areas occur along the banks or edges of rivers or creeks, and typically include tree
species such as willows, maple, cottonwood, and alder, with an understory of shrubs and vines.
Riparian areas provide cover and nesting habitat for a variety of birds. Riparian areas generally
act as a movement corridor where many wildlife species migrate or disperse into other habitats to
forage for food or to carry out a distinct part of its life cycle.
Much of the sediments being deposited in Clear Lake are filtered out by vegetation, marshes and
creek-bank structures. Changing the course of streams and altering vegetation along their banks
can result in changes to the natural hydrologic processes.
OAK WOODLANDS
Oak woodlands occur in inland valleys and foothills usually with a hard pan or rocky soil
between 4 and 20 feet deep. Some of the dominant plants in an oak woodland include blue oak,
coast live oak, interior live oak, and foothill pine, with manzanita, coffeeberry, redberry, currant,
gooseberry, and toyon to a lesser extent. Annual goldfields, poppies, lupines, and other forbs are
commonly found in the spring in this plant community.
Oak woodlands support many large mammals including blacktail deer, mountain lion, black
bear, coyote, bobcat and grey fox. Small mammals include the grey squirrel, California ground
squirrel, and a variety of mice. Birds include turkey vultures, eagles, hawks, owls, quail,
mourning dove, mockingbird, scrub jay, western meadow lark, finches, and sparrows.
CHAPARRAL
Chaparral communities occur in the inland foothills on dry slopes and ridges with shallow soils
and are often found on serpentine soils. Common plants found in chaparral communities include
ceanothus, manzanita, hollyleaf cherry, chamise, scrub oak, birchleaf mountain-mahogany, and
red shank. Chaparral communities provide habitat for various kinds of snakes and lizards, as
well as many birds and mammals along the chaparral/oak woodland ecotone.
AGRICULTURAL LAND
Agricultural land that is actively tilled and intensively managed for long durations is generally
low in plant and animal diversity due to the marginal habitat qualities that they provide. Small
mammals that can commonly be found in agricultural land include pocket gophers, deer mouse,
and California ground squirrel, among others. Small mammals are the main food source for
raptors such as red-tailed hawk, red-shouldered hawk, American kestrel, and barn owl, and for
large mammals such as coyote, raccoon, striped skunk, and opossum. Common birds found in
agricultural land include western scrub jay, American crow, house finch, killdeer, and European
starling among others.
The disturbed field margins of agricultural lands are located along the perimeter of fields. Plant
diversity in this habitat type is higher compared to agricultural land, as this area is generally not

regularly managed. Plants that can commonly be found in disturbed field margins include
mustards, filarees, clovers, wild oats, bromes, foxtail barley, Italian ryegrass, and fiddle-neck
among others. Wildlife in disturbed field margins is generally similar to that of active
agricultural areas.
URBAN
Urban areas consist of structures, roads, and parking areas. The plant diversity in this type of
habitat is generally low and is composed of primarily of ornamental landscaping plants as well as
plants commonly found along disturbed field margins. Wildlife in the area is very limited as
food sources are scarce. Wildlife that is commonly found in these areas is similar to those found
in agricultural and disturbed areas although they are less abundant and are generally passing
through rather than occupying the area.
Water Resources
The City of Lakeport currently obtains its water from two primary sources: Groundwater
sources and water from Clear Lake treated at the City’s water treatment plant. The groundwater
supply consists of four wells located in Scotts Valley. Two of the wells are on Scotts Creek
adjacent to the City’s old pumping plant and two wells are located on the Green Ranch.
Seasonal fluctuation in the underground water table means that the wells are only viable for
portions of the year. When water supply from the wells in Scotts Valley is limited, the City
relies on treated surface water from Clear Lake.
The City constructed the Interim Water Supply Project in 1981 and 1982 to draw and treat water
from Clear Lake for use in the community. This project included a raw water intake structure in
Clear Lake, a 14-inch diameter raw water intake line, a raw water pump station, a 10-inch
diameter pipeline which conveys water from the raw water pump station to a package water
treatment plant. The treatment plant, located on Konocti Avenue, consists of a raw water
holding basin, chemical feed systems, flocculation, tube sedimentation, gravity filtration,
activated carbon contactors and disinfection. In 1999 the treatment facility was expanded, and
can now treat up to 1,200 gallons per minute. The City has diversified water resources which
ensure that the water supply is stable and reliable.
In order to ensure an adequate supply of clean potable water to accommodate existing and
future needs, the City of Lakeport must strive to protect the quality of the groundwater as well
as the quality of Clear Lake.
The continued protection and improvement of Clear Lake and its tributary streams will depend
on the application of more stringent regulations to reduce erosion, siltation, and the inflow of
sewage and other pollutants. In addition, it is necessary to maintain adequate fresh water
inflow from its watershed. At present, Yolo County Flood Control and Water Conservation
District controls water rights for Cache Creek and for Clear Lake above a specified water level.
The continued access to adequate water supplies depends on a combination of conservation,
access to riparian and groundwater supplies and the purchase or exchange of surface water from

Yolo County Flood Control and Water Conservation District. To be effective, such measures
need to be implemented in a coordinated fashion among local, state and federal agencies.
Agriculture
Agriculture has played a key role in Lakeport's history and economic development. The
cultivation of grapes, fruit crops, nuts and livestock continues to represent an important part of
the region's economy and way of life. Not only are agricultural uses important economically, but
they provide open space areas, preserve view corridors, and maintain the rural atmosphere valued
by Lakeport residents.
It is important that future urban development not decrease any further the amount of prime
agricultural land, since it is a valuable and irreplaceable resource. Prime agricultural land is
characterized by good to excellent soil conditions, available water and sufficient acreage to
support a viable farming operation. The Lake County Agricultural Commissioner has determined
that there are no prime agricultural lands within City limits. There is, however, prime agricultural
land in the southern portion of the Sphere of Influence and outside of the Sphere of Influence, in
the Scotts Valley area.
Policies and programs in this element relating to agriculture seek to preserve remaining prime
agricultural land in the Planning Area. These areas have previously been designated Urban
Reserve or Open Space, and are not priority areas for annexation. Additionally, there are several
policies and implementation programs in this element to protect those wishing to continue
farming by reducing the conflict between agricultural and urban land uses.
Mineral Resources
There are no mineral extraction or other mining operation at present within the Lakeport City
limits and Sphere of Influence. Sand, gravel and borax deposits are extracted in the Scotts Valley
and Big Valley Areas. These mining operations have a significant impact on ground water
capacity, siltation of streams and highway traffic.
The current Lakeport General Plan prohibits any mining or mineral extraction activities within
the City and calls for the City to work with the County of Lake to discourage such land uses
within the City’s Sphere of Influence.
Air Quality
The climate of the Lakeport Planning Area, according to the Sunset Western Garden Book, is
identified as Zone 7, which is referred to as California’s Digger Pine Belt. It is indicated that hot
summers and mild, but pronounced winters give this area sharply defined seasons without severe
winter cold or innervating humidity. The average maximum temperatures range from a low of
approximately 54 degrees Fahrenheit in December to a high of about 92 degrees Fahrenheit in
July. Rainfall is concentrated predominantly during the five months from November to March.
August 2009                                                                  Conservation Element

Lake County is unique in California since it is the only county in the state which is considered an
attainment area or is unclassified for all of the federal and all of the state criteria air pollutants.
Air quality is a key consideration in maintaining the environmental aesthetic qualities of
Lakeport which contribute to the charm, economy, and quality of life of the city. The
maintenance of good air quality requires a balance of regulating major and minor point sources
of air pollution, with good land use planning and transportation management to minimize
emissions from motor vehicles, stationary sources and impacts on the public, residents, business
and industry.
The Lake County Air Quality Management District (LCAQMD) is responsible for regulating
both point and area sources of air emissions including qualifying industrial and commercial
businesses, all open burning operations including agricultural, prescribed and residential burning
and grading activities on serpentine surfaces. The LCAQMD enforces its Rules and Regulations,
which implement federal and state air quality requirements, through a permit system that
functions independently of the County planning process. Because the County is an attainment
area (or is unclassified) for all criteria pollutants, both federal and state, it is not required to
prepare an Air Quality Management Plan. Instead, the District’s focus is on the prevention of
significant deterioration in air quality, and this goal is pursued mainly through the District’s
permitting process and the regulation of point sources of air emissions. The AQMD reviews all
planning and environmental documents submitted for review and comment and actively
participates in the planning process where District permits are determined necessary and/or
where projects are otherwise subject to District regulation or are a significant potential source of
air emissions.
Although the County is an attainment area, on several instances since 1990 pollutant
concentrations have equaled (but not exceeded) the state standards for ozone and for particulate
matter (PM10). Vehicles, unpaved roads, solid fuel combustion from agricultural, forest and
range management, and residential burning are major contributors of PM-10 emissions. The
Geysers Geothermal Power Plants and steam production wells are also sources of air pollutants
within the Lake County Air Basin.
There are also a number of areas in Lake County that contain serpentine rock and soils. These
areas have been mapped and identified to contain regulated amounts of asbestos. The Lakeport
Planning Area has serpentine lands that have been or are likely to be developed. Unless
adequately mitigated, the disturbance of serpentine will release asbestos to the air and water.
GLOBAL WARMING
In California, observational trends from the last half century show warmer winter and spring
temperatures, decreased spring snow levels in lower- and mid-elevation mountains, up to one
month earlier snowpack melting, and flowers blooming one- to two-weeks earlier than under
historical conditions (Cayan et al. 2006b). Research suggests that human activities, such as the
burning of fossil fuels and clearing of forests, contribute additional carbon dioxide (CO2) and
other heat trapping gas emissions into the atmosphere. Future global climate change could have
widespread consequences that would affect many of California’s important resources, including
its water supply.

Assembly Bill 1493
In 2002, then-Governor Gray Davis signed Assembly Bill (AB) 1493. AB 1493 required that the
California Air Resources Board (ARB) develop and adopt, by January 1, 2005, regulations that
achieve “the maximum feasible reduction of greenhouse gases emitted by passenger vehicles and
light-duty truck and other vehicles determined by the ARB to be vehicles whose primary use is
noncommercial personal transportation in the state.”
Executive Order S-3-05
Executive Order S-3-05, which was signed by Governor Schwarzenegger in 2005, proclaims that
California is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. It declares that increased temperatures
could reduce the Sierra’s snowpack, further exacerbate California’s air quality problems, and
potentially cause a rise in sea levels. To combat those concerns, the Executive Order established
total greenhouse gas emission targets. Specifically, emissions are to be reduced to the 2000 level
by 2010, the 1990 level by 2020, and to 80% below the 1990 level by 2050.
The Executive Order directed the Secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency
(CalEPA) to coordinate a multi-agency effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the target
levels. The Secretary will also submit biannual reports to the governor and state legislature
describing: (1) progress made toward reaching the emission targets; (2) impacts of global
warming on California’s resources; and (3) mitigation and adaptation plans to combat these
impacts. To comply with the Executive Order, the Secretary of the CalEPA created a Climate
Act Team (CAT) made up of members from various state agencies and commission. CAT
released its first report in March 2006. The report proposed to achieve the targets by building on
voluntary actions of California businesses, local government and community actions, as well as
through state incentive and regulatory programs.
Assembly Bill 32, the California Climate Solutions Act of 2006
In September 2006, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed AB 32, the California Climate
Solutions Act of 2006. AB 32 requires that statewide GHG emissions be reduced to 1990 levels
by the year 2020. This reduction will be accomplished through an enforceable statewide cap on
GHG emissions that will be phased in starting in 2012. To effectively implement the cap, AB 32
directs ARB to develop and implement regulations to reduce statewide GHG emissions from
stationary sources. AB 32 specifies that regulations adopted in response to AB 1493 should be
used to address GHG emissions from vehicles. AB 32 also includes language stating that if the
AB 1493 regulations cannot be implemented, then ARB should develop new regulations to
control vehicle GHG emissions under the authorization of AB 32.
AB 32 requires that ARB adopt a quantified cap on GHG emissions representing 1990 emissions
levels and disclose how it arrives at the cap; institute a schedule to meet the emissions cap; and
develop tracking, reporting, and enforcement mechanisms to ensure that the state achieves
reductions in GHG emissions necessary to meet the cap. AB 32 also includes guidance to
August 2009                                                                  Conservation Element

institute emissions reductions in an economically efficient manner and conditions to ensure that
businesses and consumers are not unfairly affected by the reductions.
Senate Bill 1368
SB 1368 is the companion bill of AB 32 and was signed by Governor Schwarzenegger in
September 2006. SB 1368 required the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to
establish a greenhouse gas emission performance standard for baseload generation from investor
owned utilities by February 1, 2007. The California Energy Commission (CEC) must establish a
similar standard for local publicly owned utilities by June 30, 2007. These standards cannot
exceed the greenhouse gas emission rate from a baseload combined-cycle natural gas fired plant.
The legislation further requires that all electricity provided to California, including imported
electricity, must be generated from plants that meet the standards set by the PUC and CEC.
Senate Bill 97
SB 97 (Chapter 185, Statutes 2007) was signed by Governor Schwarzenegger on August 24,
2007. The legislation provides partial guidance on how greenhouse gases should be addressed in
certain CEQA documents. SB 97 requires the Governors Office of Planning and Research
(OPR) to prepare CEQA guidelines for the mitigation of GHG emissions, including but not
limited to, effects associated with transportation or energy consumption. OPR must prepare
these guidelines and transmit them to the Resources Agency by July 1, 2009. The Resources
Agency must then certify and adopt the guidelines by January 1, 2010. OPR and the Resources
Agency are required to periodically review the guidelines to incorporate new information or
criteria adopted by ARB pursuant to the Global Warming Solutions Act, scheduled for 2012.
Various gases in the Earth’s atmosphere, classified as atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs),
play a critical role in determining the Earth’s surface temperature. Solar radiation enters Earth’s
atmosphere from space, and a portion of the radiation is absorbed by the Earth’s surface. The
Earth emits this radiation back toward space, but the properties of the radiation change from
high-frequency solar radiation to lower-frequency infrared radiation. Greenhouse gases, which
are transparent to solar radiation, are effective in absorbing infrared radiation. As a result, this
radiation that otherwise would have escaped back into space is now retained, resulting in a
warming of the atmosphere. This phenomenon is known as the greenhouse effect.
Among the prominent GHGs contributing to the greenhouse effect are carbon dioxide (CO2),
methane (CH4), ozone (O3), water vapor, nitrous oxide (N2O), and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).
Human-caused emissions of these GHGs in excess of natural ambient concentrations are
responsible for enhancing the greenhouse effect (Ahrens 2003). Emissions of GHGs contributing
to global climate change are attributable in large part to human activities associated with the
industrial/manufacturing, utility, transportation, residential, and agricultural sectors (California
Energy Commission 2006a). In California, the transportation sector is the largest emitter of
GHGs, followed by electricity generation (California Energy Commission 2006a). A byproduct
of fossil fuel combustion is CO2. Methane, a highly potent GHG, results from offgassing
associated with agricultural practices and landfills. Processes that absorb and accumulate CO2,
often called CO2 “sinks,” include uptake by vegetation and dissolution into the ocean.
Conservation Element                                                                   August 2009
City of Lakeport General Plan 2025                                                       Page VII-7

As the name implies, global climate change is a global problem. GHGs are global pollutants,
unlike criteria air pollutants and toxic air contaminants, which are pollutants of regional and
local concern, respectively. California is the 12th to 16th largest emitter of CO2 in the world and
produced 492 million gross metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents in 2004 (California Energy
Commission 2006a). Carbon dioxide equivalents are a measurement used to account for the fact
that different GHGs have different potential to retain infrared radiation in the atmosphere and
contribute to the greenhouse effect. This potential, known as the global warming potential of a
GHG, is also dependent on the lifetime, or persistence, of the gas molecule in the atmosphere.
For example, CH4 is a much more potent GHG than CO2. As described in the General Reporting
Protocol of the California Climate Action Registry (2006), one ton of CH4 has the same
contribution to the greenhouse effect as approximately 21 tons of CO2. Expressing GHG
emissions in carbon dioxide equivalents takes the contribution of all GHG emissions to the
greenhouse effect and converts them to a single unit equivalent to the effect that would occur if
only CO2 were being emitted. Consumption of fossil fuels in the transportation sector was the
single largest source of California’s GHG emissions in 2004, accounting for 40.7% of total GHG
emissions in the state (California Energy Commission 2006a). This category was followed by the
electric power sector (including both in-state and out-of-state sources) (22.2%) and the industrial
sector (20.5%) (California Energy Commission 2006a).
Feedback Mechanisms and Uncertainty
Many complex mechanisms interact within Earth’s energy budget to establish the global average
temperature. For example, a change in ocean temperature would be expected to lead to changes
in the circulation of ocean currents, which, in turn would further alter ocean temperatures. There
is uncertainty about how some factors could affect global climate change because they have the
potential to both enhance and neutralize future climate warming.
Direct and Indirect Effects of Aerosols
Aerosols, including particulate matter, reflect sunlight back to space. As particulate matter
attainment designations are met, and fewer emissions of particulate matter occur, the cooling
effect of anthropogenic aerosols would be reduced, and the greenhouse effect would be further
enhanced. Similarly, aerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei, aiding in cloud formation and
increasing cloud lifetime. Clouds can efficiently reflect solar radiation back to space (see
discussion of the cloud effect below). As particulate matter emissions are reduced, the indirect
positive effect of aerosols on clouds would be reduced, potentially further amplifying the
greenhouse effect.
The Cloud Effect
As global temperature rises, the ability of the air to hold moisture increases, facilitating cloud
formation. If an increase in cloud cover occurs at low or middle altitudes, resulting in clouds
with greater liquid water content such as stratus or cumulus clouds, more radiation would be
reflected back to space, resulting in a negative feedback mechanism, wherein the side effect of
more cloud cover resulting from global warming acts to balance further warming. If clouds form
at higher altitudes in the form of cirrus clouds, however, these clouds actually allow more solar
radiation to pass through than they reflect, and ultimately they act as a GHG themselves. This
August 2009                                                                   Conservation Element

results in a positive feedback mechanism in which the side effect of global warming acts to
enhance the warming process. This feedback mechanism, known as the “cloud effect”
contributes to uncertainties associated with projecting future global climate conditions.
Other Feedback Mechanisms
As global temperature continues to rise, CH4 gas currently trapped in permafrost, would be
released into the atmosphere when areas of permafrost thaw. Thawing of permafrost attributable
to global warming would be expected to accelerate and enhance global warming trends.
Additionally, as the surface area of polar and sea ice continues to diminish, the Earth’s albedo, or
reflectivity, is also anticipated to decrease. More incoming solar radiation will likely be absorbed
by the Earth rather than being reflected back to space, further enhancing the greenhouse effect.
The scientific community is still studying these and other positive and negative feedback
mechanisms to better understand their potential effects on global climate change.

              districts.
Agricultural Resources
OBJECTIVE C 7:         TO PROTECT AND ENHANCE AGRICULTURAL RESOURCES.
Policy C 7.1: Annexation of Agricultural Lands.            Discourage the annexation of prime
              agricultural lands for urban uses.
              Prime agricultural land is generally defined as Class I and II based on the
              methodology of the Soil Conservation Service classification system (see Section
              56064 of the California Government Code for a full definition).
Policy C 7.2: Wastewater for Irrigation.         Explore the alternative use of wastewater for
              irrigation purposes beyond the existing spray irrigation activities. This can be
              accomplished by pursuing the Sphere of Influence amendment and annexation of
              the Specific Plan Area which includes the City’s sewer treatment facility. In the
              event that treatment facility is converted to a tertiary treatment facility, there may
              be additional opportunities for wastewater irrigation for certain types of food
              crops in addition to potentially using the water to irrigate parks, playgrounds, and
              other similar uses subject to RWQCB permit. A small portion of the CLMSD
              property is designated as "prime agricultural land" and "farmland of local
              importance." The City will attempt to maintain the "prime agricultural land" by
              leasing it for agricultural purposes.
Policy C 7.3: Coordination with Lake County.            Continue the coordination of land use
              planning between the County of Lake and Lakeport to preserve existing
              agricultural lands.

Policy C 8.1: Stream and Creek Protection. Preserve and protect streams and creeks in their
              natural state to the maximum extent feasible. [Streams, creeks and other riparian
              corridors are considered to be in a natural state when they support their own
              environment of vegetation, wildlife and have not been concretized or
              channelized.]
              Program C 8.1-a: Develop, in cooperation with the County and the State
              Department of Fish and Game, guidelines for the construction and maintenance of
              watercourses which assure that the native vegetation is not unnecessarily removed
              and that maintenance minimizes disruption of wildlife breeding activities.
              Incorporate these guidelines, where appropriate, into the Zoning Ordinance and
              Public Works Department maintenance procedures.
              Program C 8.1-b: Revegetate watercourses with native plant species that are
              compatible with the watercourse maintenance program and which do not
              adversely impact flow.
Policy C 8.2 Clear Lake. Prohibit any filling of Clear Lake below 7.79 as indicated by the
              Rumsey Gauge.
              Program C 8.2-a: Enforce the Zoning and Subdivision Ordinances to prohibit

              within the Lakeport Planning Area and oppose any filling of Clear Lake.
Policy C 8.3: Soil Erosion. Soil erosion shall be controlled to prevent flooding and destruction
              of natural waterways, to maintain water quality and to reduce public costs of flood
              control and watercourse maintenance.
              Program C 8.3-a: Grading Permits shall be issued for all new construction, where
              applicable. An approved erosion control plan and revegetation plan shall be
              included in the grading plan, wherever determined appropriate by the City, to
              include measures to mitigate erosion during and after construction.
              Program C 8.3-b: Consider the adoption of a Hillside Protection Ordinance in the
              Zoning Ordinance that includes specific performance criteria for the protection of
              hillside areas.
Policy C 8.4: Water Quality. Continue to cooperate with the County, Lake County Watershed
              Protection District (LCWPD) and other agencies to develop and implement
              measures to improve the quantity and quality of water resources.

of the General Plan considers the existing open space, parks, and recreational opportunities, then
it presents some standards for meeting the needs of the community, and lastly it identifies some
future needs. Objectives, policies, and implementation programs are then recommended to guide
decisions based on the projected open space, parks, and recreational demands of the community.
There are four general considerations addressed by the objectives, policies, and implementation
programs. These include the coordination of public resources to meet demand, the quality and
quantity of recreational facilities, the availability of recreational facilities for public use, and the
provision of open space sites.
Open space, parks, and recreation are a key component to a balanced and healthy community.
Leisure time is used according to a persons needs and desires, as well as the quality and quantity
of recreational opportunities available. The City of Lakeport maintains a system of open space,
parks, and other recreational opportunities for its citizens. In addition to parks, recreational
facilities are provided at the Highland Springs Reservoir, Lake County Fairgrounds, the County
Park, Clear Lake State Park, and the Westshore swimming pool, which is located on Lakeport
Unified School District (LUSD) property. Community use of school playing fields provides
additional recreational facilities.
Open Space
Lakeport is fortunate to be surrounded by a generous amount of open space. Over 50 percent of
all land in Lake County is publicly owned, and approximately two thirds of this area is available
for public use. The majority of this land has limited recreational use, however, since it is
inaccessible to the public. Lakeport residents typically use the Library Park area or nearby State
and County Parks for open space related recreational activities.
Open space, which is unimproved land, serves several functions, some of which are listed below:
•    It preserves natural resources such as riparian corridors, plant and animal habitats;
•    It provides passive recreational opportunities in areas with scenic and/or interesting natural
     environments and limited active recreational opportunities such as jogging and equestrian
     trails;
•    It provides a visual buffer between developed and non-developed areas;
•    It preserves a distinctive community identity; and

•   It limits development from occurring in areas with hazardous conditions, such as those with
    unstable soils and steep hillsides.
Parks
The policies and implementation programs contained in this section provide the framework that
is needed for the City to proactively plan and develop park facilities based on anticipated
demand for these facilities. Parkland acquisition is an ongoing priority. Funding sources for
park land acquisition and development may come from a variety of sources including
dedications, developer in-lieu fees pursuant to the Quimby Act, redevelopment tax-increment
funds, the City’s general fund, grants, neighborhood assessments, and general obligation and
revenue bonds. The City’s parkland standard is set at five acres of developed parkland per 1,000
residents.
As shown in Table 14, the City has approximately 63.5 acres of parkland, not including
recreational facilities at the schools (see Figure 15). Lakeport’s park and recreational facilities
include parks and undeveloped parks.

                                                        develop as funds become available).

   Most of the 5 acres is used for parking
Open space and recreation facilities at Lakeport’s schools are also considered part of the park
inventory due to the cooperative agreement between the City and school district. Not including
the school district’s park acreage, there are approximately 12 acres of City owned parkland per
1,000 residents. Only 16.5 acres of the City owned parkland had been developed as of 2004,
giving Lakeport a ratio of 3.3 acres of developed parkland per 1,000 residents. This is below the
adopted goal of 5 acres per 1,000 residents.
Recreation
LAKE RECREATION
Clear Lake is renowned for its many recreational opportunities. Boating (including fishing,
personal watercraft, and water-skiing) is the principal recreation activity on the Lake. There are
also beaches and swimming areas. Over the years there has been a general increase in and
promotion of lake recreation.

Boating
Fishing season is open 365 days a year on Clear Lake and the lake is famous for its many fishing
tournaments. The largest tournament activity involves bass fishing; there are numerous bass
tournaments throughout the year with as many as 300 boats participating in any one tournament.
Civic organizations such as the local Chamber of Commerce aggressively court fishing
tournaments because of the significant revenue generated by them. The principal bass
tournament locations are at City of Clearlake, Lakeport, and Konocti Harbor Resort and Konocti
Vista Casino. There are also fishing derbies at a variety of locations for other fish such catfish,
carp, crappie, and blue gill. In addition to the fishing events, there are other boating related
events including the Nor-Cal Boat and Ski races, personal watercraft poker runs, and a seaplane
fly-in.
The Clear Lake Management Plan notes the need to explore measures to encourage use of more
efficient powerboats and personal watercraft on Clear Lake.

               develop parkland pursuant to the Quimby Act.
               Program PR 1.6-b: Reevaluate and update the population to parkland ratio
               every two years and amend the Park Dedication Ordinance as appropriate.
               Program PR 1.6-c: Prepare, prior to acceptance of any parcels for park or open
               space, a thorough analysis of geotechnical or other related hazard potential.
               Identified hazards shall be fully repaired before acceptance of land by City.
Policy PR 1.7: Funding Sources. Consider the following funding sources for park acquisition,
               development/improvement and maintenance and the operation of recreation
               programs:
               •   Sale or trade of City-owned land for the acquisition of comparable facilities
                   elsewhere within the Lakeport Planning Area;
               •   Redevelopment Tax Increment Revenues;
               •   Transient Occupancy Tax revenues;
               •   General Obligation and Revenue Bonds;
               •   Neighborhood Assessments;
               •   Grant and foundation funds;
               •   Recreation concession revenues;

Policy PR 1.8: Joint Use Parks.        The City will work with LUSD to develop joint use of
               neighborhood parks on school sites using an integrated and comprehensive
               design which embodies the principle of ‘school-in-the-park.’ The City's
               neighborhood park/school sites should serve the entire community and provide
               a broad range of cultural, recreational and educational activities.

                 expanded use of school facilities for parks and recreational uses.
Policy PR 1.9: Facilities Sharing.         Cooperate and work with the County Recreation
                 Department to share facilities and programs.
Policy PR 1.10: Heritage Sites. Identify, recognize and protect sites, buildings, structures and
                 districts with significant cultural, aesthetic and social characteristics which are a
                 part of the City's heritage.
                 Program PR 1.10-a: Adopt a cultural resources management ordinance to
                 identify, recognize, protect and preserve sites, buildings, structures, districts and
                 objects that reflect significant elements of Lakeport's cultural, social, aesthetic,
                 architectural or natural heritage.
                 Program PR 1.10-b: Prior to altering any structure with historical significance
                 within the City of Lakeport, the General Plan shall be consulted and any
                 alterations shall be in compliance with General Plan policies. For structures
                 over 45 years old an architectural historian and a historic archaeologist should
                 conduct archival and/or field research to determine the structure’s historical
                 value. Relocation of historic structures should only be done if there is no other
                 alternative available.
                 Program PR 1.10-c: During review of future development projects, the City
                 shall evaluate the need for the project to have a qualified archeologist conduct
                 the following activities: (1) conduct a record search at the Archeological
                 Information Center and other appropriate historical repositories, (2) conduct
                 field surveys where appropriate, and (3) prepare technical reports, where
                 appropriate, meeting California Office of Historic Preservation Standards. In the
                 event there is a likelihood of resources present the appropriate tribe
                 representatives shall be notified in order to determine whether the presence of
                 an on-site monitor is required. If the project is located within 150 feet of a
                 known or recorded archaeological site, the tribe will be notified prior to
                 commencement of any work and a monitor will be present during the
                 excavation portion of the project and will observe the work to ensure that
                 archeological resources are not damaged.
                 In the event that archaeological resources are encountered during subsurface
                 construction for land development projects, land alteration work in the general
                 vicinity of the find shall be halted and a qualified archaeologist shall be
                 consulted. Prompt evaluations could then be made regarding the finds and
                 course of action acceptable to all concerned parties could then be adopted. Local
                 Native American organizations and tribe representatives shall be consulted if
                 human remains are encountered.

IX. NOISE ELEMEN
IX. NOISE ELEMENT
Purpose
The purpose of the Noise Element is to protect the health and welfare of the community by
promoting development which is compatible with established noise standards. This section has
been prepared in conformance with Government Code § 65302(f) and the guidelines adopted by
the State Office of Noise Control, pursuant to Health and Safety Code § 46050.1. Existing and
future noise problems in Lakeport and its Sphere of Influence have been identified. The Noise
Element will provide policies and implementation programs designed to reduce the community's
exposure to excessive noise levels. Accomplishing this task requires an evaluation of the noise
from sources such as roads, highways, recreation areas, aviation and from stationary sources
such as factories.
Noise Characteristics
Noise is defined as unwanted sound. Airborne sound is a rapid fluctuation of air pressure above
and below atmospheric pressure. Sound levels are usually measured and expressed in decibels
(dB) with 0 dB corresponding roughly to the threshold of hearing.
Most of the sounds which we hear in the environment do not consist of a single frequency, but
rather a broad band of frequencies, with each frequency differing in sound level. The intensities
of each frequency add together to generate a sound. The method commonly used to quantify
environmental sounds consists of evaluating all of the frequencies of a sound in accordance with a
weighting that reflect the fact that human hearing is less sensitive at low frequencies and extreme
high frequencies than in the mid-range frequency. This is called "A" weighting, and the decibel
level so measured is called the A-weighted sound level (dBA). In practice, the level of a sound
source is conveniently measured using a sound level meter that includes an electrical filter
corresponding to the A-weighting curve.
Although the A-weighted noise level may adequately indicate the level of environmental noise at
any instant in time, community noise levels vary continuously. Most environmental noise
includes a conglomeration of noise from distant sources which create a relatively steady
background noise in which no particular source is identifiable. To describe the time-varying
character of environmental noise, the statistical noise descriptors, L10, L50, and L90, are
commonly used. They are the A-weighted noise levels equaled or exceeded during 10%, 50%,
and 90% of a stated time period. A single number descriptor called the Leq is now also widely
used. The Leq is the average A-weighted noise level during a stated period of time.
In determining the daily level of environmental noise, it is important to account for the difference
in response of people to daytime and nighttime noises. During the nighttime, exterior
background noises are generally lower than the daytime levels. However, most household noise
also decreases at night and exterior noise becomes very noticeable. Further, most people sleep at
night and are very sensitive to noise intrusion. To account for human sensitivity to nighttime
noise levels, a descriptor, the Ldn (day/night average sound level), was developed. The Ldn
Noise Element                                                                           August 2009
City of Lakeport General Plan 2025                                                        Page IX-1

divides the 24-hour day into the daytime of 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM and the nighttime of 10:00 PM
to 7:00 AM. The nighttime noise level is weighted 10 dB higher than the daytime noise level.
The Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) is another similar 24 hour average which
includes both an evening and nighttime weighting.
Human Response to Noise
The effects of noise on people can be categorized as follows:
•    subjective effects of annoyance, nuisance, dissatisfaction;
•    interference with activities such as speech, sleep, learning; and
•    physiological effects such as startling, hearing loss.
The levels associated with environmental noise, in almost every case, produce effects only in the
first two categories. Workers in industrial plants can experience noise in the last category.
Unfortunately, there is as yet no completely satisfactory way to measure the subjective effects of
noise, or of the corresponding reactions of annoyance and dissatisfaction. This is primarily
because of the wide variation in individual thresholds of annoyance, and habituation to noise
over differing individual past experiences with noise. In general, the more a new noise exceeds
the previously existing ambient noise level, the less acceptable the new noise will be judged by
the hearers.
The following relationships will be helpful in understanding the significance of increases in the
A-weighted noise level:
•    Except in carefully controlled laboratory experiments, a change of 1 dB cannot be perceived.
•    Outside of the laboratory, a 3 dB change is considered a just-perceivable difference.
•    A change in level of at least 5 dB is required before any noticeable change in community
     response would be expected.
•    A 10 dB change is subjectively heard as approximately a doubling in loudness, and would
     almost certainly cause an adverse change in community response.
In any typical noise environment about 10 percent of the population will object to any noise not
of their own making and 25 percent will not react or complain at all, regardless of the level of
noise being generated. Consequently, noise control measures are most beneficial to the remaining
65 percent of the population who are neither ultra-sensitive nor insensitive to noise. Negative
reaction to noise generally increases with the increase in difference between background (or
ambient) noise and the noise generated from a particular source such as traffic operations. In
most situations, noise control measures need to reduce noise by 5 to 10 dB(A) in order to
effectively reduce complaints.
August 2009                                                                          Noise Element

People generally have the ability to distinguish one sound from a background of sounds, such as
a telephone ringing over music. However, certain noise levels can render a sound inaudible. For
example, heavy trucks can interfere with a conversation. Face-to-face conversation usually can
proceed where the noise level is up to 66 dB(A), group conversations up to 50 to 60 dB(A), and
public meetings, up to 45 or 55 dB(A), without interruption.
Sleep interference is more difficult to quantify, although studies have shown that progressively
deeper levels of sleep require louder noise levels to cause a disturbance. The California Office
of Noise Control (ONC) recommends that individual events within sleeping areas should not
exceed 50 dB(A) in residential areas exposed to noise levels of 60 Ldn, or greater. Interior noise
standards of 45 Ldn will protect against sleep interference.
Environmental noise, in almost every case, produces effects which are subjective in nature or
involve interference with human activity. However, brief sounds at levels exceeding 70 dB(A)
can produce temporary physiological effects such as constriction of blood vessels, changes in
breathing and dilation of the pupils. Steady noises of 90 dB(A) have been shown to increase
muscle tension and adversely affect simple decision making. Long-term exposure to levels
exceeding 70 dB(A) can cause hearing loss.
Existing Noise Sources in Lakeport
The primary noise generators in Lakeport are vehicular traffic (including automobiles, trucks,
buses, and motorcycles), boaters on Clear Lake, and during events at the race track at the County
Fairgrounds.
The level of vehicular noise varies with the volume of traffic on a given roadway, the percentage
of trucks, buses and motorcycles, the speed of the traffic, and the distance from the roadway.
The major traffic noise generators are Highway 29, Main Street, Lakeport Boulevard, 11th
Street, and High Street. Along most streets, the presence of densely-packed buildings will
reduce the noise exposure significantly for subsequent rows of buildings. A row of buildings will
generally reduce the noise level by about 5 decibels, significantly reducing the influence of local
traffic noise beyond the street itself.
While the noise generated by the roadway system is most pervasive in the City of Lakeport, noise
generated at the Lake County Fairgrounds and by activity on Clear Lake is also occasionally
significant. Automobile races are frequently held at the Lake County Fairgrounds in the
evenings, when nearby residents are most sensitive to intrusive noises. Noise sources at the races
include the stock cars, the public address system, the crowd noise, and spectator traffic.
Noise generated by power boats on the lake is another major noise source in Lakeport. Large
powerboats equipped with inboard engines without mufflers generate noise levels as high as 110
dBA at a distance of 50 feet. Larger outboard engines also generate noise levels of 65 to 95 dBA
at a distance of 50 feet. When many boats are starting up together, for example early in the
morning during a bass tournament, significant noise levels can be generated. Noise generated
from boaters on Clear Lake has the potential to affect residents living well beyond the lake shore.
Noise Element                                                                           August 2009
City of Lakeport General Plan 2025                                                         Page IX-3
Other noise sources which occasionally represent problems in the City include: barking dogs; the
use of power tools; seaplanes; helicopters; and machinery. The noise generated by these sources
is most effectively controlled through the enforcement of the local noise ordinance.
At present, no significant amount of noise is produced by Lampson Field, a general aviation
airport located outside of the City's Sphere of Influence. The City will continue to work with the
County Airport Land Use Commission (ALUC) to monitor airport noise and implement suitable
mitigation measures if they become necessary.
Future Noise Levels
Future noise levels will be largely attributable to vehicular traffic. Portions of several of the
principal streets and highways listed below are projected to experience a significant increase in
noise over 60 dBA.
•    6th Street
•    11th Street
•    20th Street
•    Hartley Street
•    Hill Road
•    Lakeport Boulevard
•    Main Street
•    Martin Street
•    Scotts Valley Road
•    Parallel Drive
•    Highways 29 and 175
It is anticipated that residences adjacent to the above streets will be exposed to excessive noise
levels, defined as those over 60 dBA. The appropriate response contained in this section is to
implement a variety of noise-mitigating measures and, where possible, condition future
residential development to limit noise exposure.
Noise and Land Use Compatibility Standards
The most effective means of controlling noise is to prevent the development of incompatible land
uses, rather than implementing after-the-fact techniques such as sound walls, earth berms or
additional residential sound proofing. The objective of the Noise and Land Use Compatibility
Standards is to provide an acceptable community noise environment and to minimize noise-
related complaints from residents.
The Standards listed in Table 15 should be used to evaluate the compatibility between land uses and
future noise levels in Lakeport.
August 2009                                                                         Noise Element

 Office Building, Business, Commercial & Professional                              Up to 65db
 Industrial, Manufacturing, Utilities                                              Up to 70db
The following considerations should be taken into account when using the Noise and Land Use
Compatibility Standards:
1. The standard for maximum outdoor noise levels in residential areas is a Ldn of 60 dB. This
    standard is applied where outdoor use is a major consideration, such as backyards in single family
    housing developments and recreation areas in multifamily developments. This standard should not
    be applied to outdoor areas such as small decks and balconies typically associated with multifamily
    residential developments, which can have a higher standard of 65 Ldn;
2. The maximum acceptable interior noise level in new residential development required by the State
    of California Noise Insulation Standards is an Ldn of 45. This standard continues to be applied to
    single family and all other residential development in Lakeport. In addition, the interior noise level
    for offices shall be Ldn 45 dB or less;
3. These standards are not intended to be applied reciprocally. In other words, if an area is
    currently below the desired noise standard, an increase in noise up to the maximum should
    not be permitted. The impact of a proposed project on an existing use should be evaluated
    in terms of the potential for adverse community response based on existing community
    noise levels, regardless of the compatibility standards; and
4. The Land Use and Noise Compatibility Standards should be reviewed in relation to the
    specific source of noise. These standards are based on measurement systems which average
    noise over a 24-hour period and do not take into account single-event noise sources. For
    example, aircraft noise normally consists of a higher single-noise event than vehicular traffic
    and has been linked to sleep interference and other significant problems, but occurs
    infrequently in Lakeport. Different noise sources yielding the same composite noise
    exposure do not necessarily create the same environment. Additional standards may be
    applied on a case-by-case basis where supported by acoustical analysis to mitigate the
    effects of single-event noise sources.

X. SAFETY ELEMEN
X.      SAFETY ELEMENT
Purpose
The purpose of the safety element is to reduce the potential risk of death, injuries, property
damage, and economic and social dislocation resulting from fires, floods, earthquakes and other
hazards. This element is required to include mapping of known seismic and other geologic
hazards and also to address other locally relevant safety issues such as:
•   hazardous materials spills;
•   hazardous and toxic materials storage and disposal;
•   wildland and urban fires;
•   emergency response capacity;
•   flooding, storm drainage; and
•   potable water quality.
A second purpose of this element is to guide land use planning and policy decisions in order to
achieve an acceptable level of public safety from known natural and man-made hazardous
events.
Geologic and Seismic Hazards
SEISMIC HAZARDS
Earthquakes originate as movement or slippage occurring along an active fault. These
movements generate shock waves that result in ground shaking. Structures of all types, if not
designed or constructed to withstand ground shaking, may suffer severe damage or collapse.
Likewise, some slopes will collapse due to the soil or geological characteristics resulting in
hazard both in terms of collapse of structures located thereon, or collapse of structures within the
path of resulting land slides.
The severity of damage to buildings from earthquakes is related to the intensity of
groundshaking, soils and geologic characteristics, and the type of building construction used.
High risk areas in Lakeport do not have any critical facilities such as high-occupancy buildings,
hospitals, or schools. The land use pattern that has evolved in Lakeport has, in general, avoided
high-risk areas.
Lakeport is located in a highly active earthquake area and the potential exists for a significant
seismic event in the future. Immediately east of the city, between the city limits and Clear Lake,
there is a potentially active rupture zone. Potentially active rupture zones are faults which have
been active in the past 2,000 years. Little is known about this shoreline fault rupture zone,
however, it represents a potentially significant hazard and must be taken into consideration when
development occurs in the vicinity. Within the past 200 years, no major earthquakes have
occurred along faults in Lake County.
Safety Element                                                                         August 2009
City of Lakeport General Plan 2025                                                        Page X-1

To the west of the city lie the San Andreas fault and the Healdsburg fault, 30 and 15 miles away,
respectively. Both of these faults have been responsible for moderate to major seismic events in
the past. The maximum earthquake magnitudes observed to date are 8.5 for the San Andreas
fault and 6.75 (Richter Scale1) for the Healdsburg fault.
Figure 17 shows the 2001 Fault-Rupture Hazard Zones maps prepared by the California
Geological Survey. Most of the ground shaking which has occurred in past years in the Lakeport
area has come from faults in the Mayacamas and Mt. Konocti area. Additionally, fault zones run
diagonally in a southeast to northwest direction through the Potato Hill, Lake Pillsbury and
Sanhedrin areas. In the far southeastern corner of the County there is a fault zone in the Jericho
Valley, an area that runs along the Lake/Napa County line.
Communities containing structures built with unreinforced masonry walls are particularly
susceptible to damage from earthquakes. The Unreinforced Masonry Law passed by the State
Legislature in 1986 [SB 547], requires all cities and counties in Seismic Zone 4 to identify
potentially hazardous unreinforced masonry buildings. The City has complied with this
legislation and identified several unreinforced masonry buildings. Implementation of an
inspection and reinforcement program was carried out to help mitigate hazards associated with
seismic effects on structures. A comprehensive structural rehabilitation program was not carried
out city-wide.
In addition to unreinforced masonry buildings, other key community structures are also
considered at-risk in the occurrence of a seismic event.

LIQUEFACTION
Liquefaction is a phenomenon in which the strength and stiffness of the soil is reduced by
earthquake shaking or other rapid loading. Liquefaction and related phenomena have been
responsible for tremendous amounts of damage in earthquakes around the world.

  Seismic waves are the vibrations from earthquakes that travel through the Earth; they are recorded on instruments
  called seismographs. Seismographs record a zigzag trace that shows the varying amplitude of ground oscillations
  beneath the instrument. Sensitive seismographs, which greatly magnify these ground motions, can detect strong
  earthquakes from sources anywhere in the world. The time, locations, and magnitude of an earthquake can be
  determined from the data recorded by seismograph stations. The Richter magnitude scale was developed in 1935
  by Charles F. Richter of the California Institute of Technology as a mathematical device to compare the size of
  earthquakes.

Liquefaction occurs in saturated soils, that is, soils in which the space between individual
particles is completely filled with water. This water exerts a pressure on the soil particles that
influences how tightly the particles themselves are pressed together. Prior to an earthquake, the
water pressure is relatively low. However, earthquake shaking can cause the water pressure to
increase to the point where the soil particles can readily move with respect to each other. When
liquefaction occurs, the strength of the soil decreases and, the ability of a soil deposit to support
foundations for buildings and bridges is reduced. Liquefied soil also exerts higher pressure on
retaining walls, which can cause them to tilt or slide. This movement can cause settlement of the
retained soil and destruction of structures on the ground surface. Increased water pressure can
also trigger landslides and cause the collapse of dams. Because liquefaction only occurs in
saturated soil, its effects are most commonly observed in low-lying areas near bodies of water
such as rivers, lakes, bays, and oceans. Soils in and around Lakeport, especially near the lake
shore, are susceptible to liquefaction during a seismic event.
SEICHES OR DAM FAILURES
A significant seismic event near Lakeport could potentially cause large waves to form on Clear
Lake called a seiche. Seiching is the formation of standing waves in a water body due to wave
formation and subsequent reflections from the ends. These waves may be incited by earthquake
motions (similar to the motions caused by shaking a glass of water), impulsive winds over the
surface, or due to wave motions entering the basin. The various modes of seiching correspond to
the natural frequency response of the water body.
A seiche inundation zone has been identified, which is an area between the normal shoreline of
Clear Lake and ten feet above flood stage, which is approximately at the 1,431 ft. contour
elevation (see Figure 18). The risks associated with seiche are considered to be relatively low
compared to the risks from earthquake and liquefaction within the Lakeport area.
The City of Lakeport Municipal Sewer District (CLMSD) maintains an earthen dam in the south
west part of the Planning Area, near the intersection of Highways 29 and 175, for the retention of
treated wastewater. The dam will store a total of 660 acre feet of water and has been approved
by the State. The possibility of catastrophic collapse of this dam is remote. Should this occur,
however, the spill-out would result in a relatively minor inundation that would probably be
contained by existing drainage courses, with a low probability of loss of life or property damage.
Nonetheless, the City should require the CLMSD to prepare inundation maps, a warning system
and drainage plans in case of a seismic event when new construction or expansion to this facility
occurs.
LANDSLIDES
Landslides are a significant geologic constraint to development in the Lakeport Planning Area.
The landslide potential of an area is a function of the area’s hydrology, geology, and seismic
characteristics. Clay soils, which underlie many hillsides in Lakeport are particularly susceptible
to sliding. Although landslides generally occur in areas with steep slopes, they may occur on
slopes with a grade of 20% or less in geologically unstable areas. Since zones of moderate to
high landslide potential exist in Lakeport, soils tests carried out by a registered soils engineer or
geologist are essential wherever landslide potential is indicated or suspected. Foundations for

structures built in areas with steep slopes in excess of 20% must be carefully engineered to avoid
increasing landslide risk.
Flooding
Flooding has historically been one of Lakeport’s major safety concerns. Clear Lake and its
tributary drainages have a long history of flooding. In the past twenty years, federal disasters
due to flooding were declared six times in the City of Lakeport during 1983, 1986, 1995 (twice),
1997, and 1998. Flooding in Lakeport historically results from two distinct types of events:
shoreline flooding due to high lake levels and wind velocity, and stream bank flooding caused by
high intensity cloudburst storms over one or more of the drainage areas. Conditions in the winter
tend to be conducive to both types of flood conditions at the same time.
Stream bank flooding affects most drainage within the city. Cloudburst storms lasting as long as
three hours can occur in the watersheds of Lakeport practically anytime during the fall, winter,
and spring and may occur as an extremely severe sequence in a general rainstorm. Cloudbursts
are high-intensity storms that can produce floods characterized by high peak flows, short
duration, and relatively small volume of runoff. In small drainage basins, such as those existing
in the Planning Area, cloudbursts can produce peak flows substantially larger than those of
general rainstorm runoff.
Lakeport is traversed by several streams and drainage areas which flow into Clear Lake. The
development that has occurred during the past twenty years has accentuated existing drainage
problems and has increased the potential for flooding. Continued construction of new buildings
increases the area of impermeable surface and thus the amount of storm water that flows through
the city’s storm drain system.
Water Supply Quality
The health of the entire community is dependent on a supply of potable water that is consistently
free from organic wastes, chemical contamination and other impurities. Lakeport obtains its
potable water from Clear Lake and from four wells located in the Planning Area. Potential
sources of contamination of the City's drinking water from agricultural runoff, chemical spills, and
groundwater contamination must be prevented. Ongoing monitoring of the quality of potable
water supplies for both coliform as well as trace quantities of chemical pollutants must be carried
out on a regular basis. The policies and implementation programs in this element focus on both
prevention of potable water contamination and water quality monitoring.
Asbestos Risk
The primary risk of exposure to asbestos in Lakeport comes from the disruption of naturally
occurring serpentine soil throughout the area (see Figure 19). The word asbestos refers to
several types of fibrous minerals. In its natural state, asbestos occurs throughout much of the
world, and is found in two-thirds of the rocks in the earth's crust. Asbestos fibers are released
into the air by construction and farming activities which agitate the soil, and are also released
naturally by erosion.

Asbestos is also used as an insulating material in public buildings and can pose a potential
health hazard. The Lakeport Unified School District has determined that public schools within
the City's Planning Area are in compliance with the 1986 Federal and State Building Codes for
asbestos insulation.
Emergency Preparedness
The City has an adopted Emergency Operations Plan. The purpose of this plan is to ensure that
the City will be prepared and respond effectively in the event of emergencies to save lives and
restore and protect property; repair and restore essential public services; provide for the
protection and distribution of medical, food, water and other vital supplies; and coordinate
operations with Civil Defense emergency organizations and other jurisdictions to maintain
continuity of government.
The County of Lake has prepared a comprehensive countywide emergency plan which will
provide the basis for an integrated and multi-jurisdictional response to large scale emergency
situations associated with natural and man-made disasters and Civil Defense operations.
Wildland and Urban Fire Hazards
The combination of vegetation, topography, climate and population density create a significant
potential for hazards from wildfires within the Lakeport Planning Area. There are many vacant
and undeveloped areas within the City and its Sphere of Influence, particularly on the west side
of Highway 29 and the northern portions of the City, including mobile home parks. Rugged
topography and highly flammable vegetation make residential development potentially unsafe
unless adequate fire safety measures are taken.
Urban fire hazards occur principally in older structures with common walls and attics and where
rear access is not possible. There are a number of older buildings in the downtown area which
have a high fire potential for these reasons.
The area within the City is served by the Lakeport Fire Protection District/County Fire Protection
District. Any location within City limits can be reached within three to five minutes. Locations
within the Sphere of Influence can be reached in five to seven minutes. This rapid response time
can be attributed to the combination of full-time staff and emergency personnel in the Lakeport
Fire Protection District and a large number of volunteers.
Police Protection
The Lakeport Police Department continues to maintain adequate staffing levels and equipment to
provide protection of persons and property in Lakeport. This is accomplished through annual
reviews of the police budget, which takes into account increases in demand for services resulting
from additional mandates and a changing service area. Traffic-related activity, however, has
increased substantially in recent years relative to other police activities. The volume of traffic
which passes through Lakeport is increasing, irrespective of locally-generated land use and
traffic changes occurring within the City's Planning Area. Traffic enforcement requires an
Safety Element                                                                       August 2009

increasing police presence on city streets. Similarly, as unincorporated areas develop, and/or
become annexed to the City, increasing demands will be placed on available personnel and
equipment.
Transportation and Storage of Hazardous Materials
There exist potential public safety hazards in the Lakeport Planning Area associated with
hazardous materials transported by truck, the storage of hazardous materials, asbestos insulation
in public buildings and potential contamination of drinking water by hazardous materials.
The transportation and storage of hazardous materials is clearly a regional problem. A large
quantity of hazardous products are transported on highways where the potential for release of this
material into the environment represents a potentially significant public health risk. The policies
and programs dealing with hazardous materials in this element incorporate and build on other
relevant portions of the Safety Element of the Lake County General Plan.
Radioactive materials are distinguished from other hazardous materials and specific federal and
state regulations have been developed for these substances. The use and storage of radioactive
materials in Lakeport is limited to medical facilities, since no other primary users of radioactive
materials, such as research laboratories, nuclear power plants or military facilities, are located
within the Planning Area. The principal potential danger to Lakeport residents from these
materials is related to the possibility of a truck accident whereby containers holding radioactive
materials would rupture.
Aviation Hazards
Lampson Field Airport potentially affects land uses in Lakeport in the form of noise and safety
impacts, although it is located outside of the Planning Area. The County owns and operates this
general aviation airport and has prepared a Master Plan that reflects anticipated growth in general
aviation activity for the next 20 years. The Master Plan attempts to prohibit and/or reduce
obstacles to air navigation, exposure of persons on the ground to accident and crash hazards, and
noise impacts through building height restrictions, land use limitations and building standards to
reduce interior noise.
The County's Airport Land Use Commission (ALUC) regulates land use in an area surrounding
Lampson Field which includes a portion of Lakeport's Planning Area. The City must submit
projects within the County's ALUC referral area for their review and determination of
consistency with the policies of the Airport Master Plan. In addition, the City's General Plan
must be consistent with the policies established by the Airport Master Plan for the referral area.

on neighboring properties and the community as a whole, from the standpoint of site and
landscape design, architecture, materials, colors, lighting, and signs, in accordance with a set of
adopted criteria and standards. “Design Control” requires that certain specific things be done and
that other things not be done. Design Control language is not often found within a zoning
ordinance. “Design Review” usually refers to a system set up outside of the zoning ordinance,
                                                  6

whereby projects are reviewed against certain standards and criteria by a specially established
design review board or committee. (See “Architectural Control.”)
Detachment: Withdrawal of territory from a special district or city; the reverse of annexation.
Detention Dam/Basin/Pond: Dams may be classified according to the broad function they serve,
such as storage, diversion, or detention. Detention dams are constructed to retard flood runoff
and minimize the effect of sudden floods. Detention dams fall into two main types. In one type,
the water is temporarily stored, and released through an outlet structure at a rate that will not
exceed the carrying capacity of the channel downstream. Often, the basins are planted with grass
and used for open-space or recreation in periods of dry weather. The other type, most often
called a Retention Pond, allows for water to be held as long as possible and may or may not
allow for the controlled release of water. In some cases, the water is allowed to seep into the
permeable banks or gravel strata in the foundation. This later type is sometimes called a Water-
Spreading Dam or Dike because its main purpose is to recharge the underground water supply.
Detention dams are also constructed to trap sediment. These are often called Debris Dams.
Developable Acres, Net: The portion of a site that can be used for density calculations. Some
communities calculate density based on gross acreage. Public or private road rights-of-way are
not included in the net developable acreage of a site.
Developable Land: Land that is suitable as a location for structures and that can be developed
free of hazards to, and without disruptions of, or significant impact on, natural resource areas.
Development Agreement: A legislatively-approved contract between a jurisdiction and a person
having legal or equitable interest in real property within the jurisdiction (California Government
Code §65865 et. seq.) that “freezes” certain rules, regulations, and policies applicable to
development of a property for a specified period of time, usually in exchange for certain
concessions by the owner.
Development Impact Fees: A fee or charge imposed on landowners or developers, the amount of
which is designed to pay for the cost of providing, to new development areas, impact-generated
infrastructure and other facilities and services, or to address environmental and related impacts.
Dwelling, Multi-family: A dwelling unit within a building containing three or more dwelling units
for the use of individual households; an apartment or condominium building is an example of
this dwelling unit type.
Dwelling, Single-family Detached: A dwelling, not attached to any other dwelling, which is
designed for and occupied by not more than one family and surrounded by open space or yards.
Dwelling Unit: One or more rooms, designed, occupied or intended for occupancy as separate
living quarters, with cooking, sleeping and sanitary facilities provided within the unit for the
exclusive use of a household.

Easement: Usually the right to use property owned by another for specific purposes or to gain
access to another property. For example, utility companies often have easements on the private
property of individuals to be able to install and maintain utility facilities.
Easement, Conservation: A conservation easement is a restriction placed on a piece of property
to protect the resources (natural or man-made) associated with the parcel. The easement is either
voluntarily sold or donated by the landowner, and constitutes a legally binding agreement that
prohibits certain types of development (residential or non-residential) from taking place on the
land.
Easement, Scenic: A tool that allows a public agency to use an owner’s land for scenic
enhancement, such as roadside landscaping or vista preservation.

other group of persons occupying a hotel, lodging house or institution of any kind [California].
Family Income: According to the Census, a family includes a householder and one or more
people living in the same household who are related to the householder by birth, marriage, or
adoption. All people in a household who are related to the householder are regarded as members
of his or her family. Family income includes all income earned by family members and includes
wages, salary, commissions, bonuses, or tips; self-employment income from own nonfarm or
farm businesses, including proprietorships and partnerships; interest, dividends, net rental
income, royalty income, or income from estates and trusts; Social Security or Railroad
Retirement income; Supplemental Security Income (SSI); any public assistance or welfare
payments from the state or local welfare office; retirement, survivor, or disability pensions; and

                                                  9

Fire Hazard Zone: An area where, due to slope, fuel, weather, or other fire-related conditions, the
potential loss of life and property from a fire necessitates special fire protection measures and
planning before development occurs.
First-Time Home Buyer: Defined by HUD as an individual or family who has not owned a home
during the three-year period preceding the HUD-assisted purchase of a home. Jurisdictions may
adopt local definitions for first-time home buyer programs which differ from federally funded
programs.
Fiscal Impact Analysis: A projection of the direct public costs and revenues resulting from
population or employment change to the local jurisdiction(s) in which the change is taking place.
Enables local governments to evaluate relative fiscal merits of general plans, specific plans, or
projects.
Flood, 100-Year: The magnitude of a flood expected to occur on the average every 100 years,
based on historical data. The 100-year flood has a 1/100, or one percent, chance of occurring in
any given year.

from the exterior face of exterior walls, or from the centerline of a wall separating two buildings,
but not including any space where the floor-to-ceiling height is less than six feet.
Floor Area Ratio (FAR): The gross floor area of all buildings including garages on a lot divided
by the lot area; usually expressed as a numerical value (e.g., a building having 10,000 square feet

Frequency: The measure of the rapidity of alterations of a periodic signal, expressed in cycles
per second or hertz.
General Plan: The General Plan is a legal document, adopted by the legislative body of a City or
County, setting forth policies regarding long-term development. California law requires the
preparation of seven elements or chapters in the General Plan: Land Use, Housing, Circulation,
                                                 10

lending institutions making home mortgage loans to publicly disclose the location and
disposition of home purchase, refinance and improvement loans. Institutions subject to HMDA
must also disclose the gender, race, and income of loan applicants.
Home Ownership Made Easy (HOME) Program: The HOME Investment Partnership Act, Title II
of the National Affordable Housing Act of 1990. HOME is a Federal program administered by
HUD which provides formula grants to States and localities to fund activities that build, buy,
and/or rehabilitate affordable housing for rent or home ownership or provide direct rental
assistance to low-income people.
Homeless: Unsheltered homeless are families and individuals whose primary nighttime residence
is a public or private place not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a regular sleeping
accommodation for human beings (e.g., the street, sidewalks, cars, vacant and abandoned
buildings). Sheltered homeless are families and persons whose primary nighttime residence is a
supervised publicly or privately operated shelter (e.g., emergency, transitional, battered women,
and homeless youth shelters; and commercial hotels or motels used to house the homeless).
Household: The US Census Bureau defines a household as all persons living in a housing unit
whether or not they are related. A single person living in an apartment as well as a family living
in a house is considered a household. Household does not include individuals living in
dormitories, prisons, convalescent homes, or other group quarters.
Household Income: The total income of all the persons living in a household and includes all
income earned by household members and includes wages, salary, commissions, bonuses, or
tips; self-employment income from own nonfarm or farm businesses, including proprietorships
and partnerships; interest, dividends, net rental income, royalty income, or income from estates
and trusts; Social Security or Railroad Retirement income; Supplemental Security Income (SSI);
any public assistance or welfare payments from the state or local welfare office; retirement,
survivor, or disability pensions; and any other sources of income received regularly such as
Veterans' (VA) payments, unemployment compensation, child support, or alimony. A household
is usually described as very low income, low income, moderate income, and upper income based
upon household size, and income, relative to the regional median income.
Households, Number of: The count of all year-round housing units occupied by one or more
persons. The concept of household is important because the formation of new households
generates the demand for housing. Each new household formed creates the need for one
additional housing unit or requires that one existing housing unit be shared by two households.
Thus, household formation can continue to take place even without an increase in population,
thereby increasing the demand for housing.
Housing and Community Development Department (HCD): The State agency that has principal
responsibility for assessing, planning for, and assisting communities to meet the needs of low-
and moderate-income households.
                                                 12

defects (lacks complete kitchen or bathroom); (2) meets the definition of overcrowded; or (3)
spends more than 30% of income on housing cost.
Housing Unit: A house, an apartment, a mobile home or trailer, a group of rooms, or a single
room that is occupied as a separate living quarters, or, if vacant, is intended for occupancy as a
separate living quarters. Separate living quarters are those in which the occupants live separately
from any other individual in the building and which have direct access from outside the building
or through a common hall. For vacant units, the criteria of separateness and direct access are
applied to the intended occupants whenever possible.
HUD: See U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Impact Fee: A fee or charge imposed on developers to pay for a jurisdiction’s costs of providing
services to new development.
Impervious Surface: Surface through which water cannot penetrate, such as roof, road, sidewalk
and paved parking lots. The amount of impervious surface increases with development and
establishes the need for drainage facilities to carry the increased runoff.
Impulsive Noise: Sound of short duration, usually less than one second, with an abrupt onset and
rapid decay.
Income Category: Four categories are used to classify a household according to income based on
the median income for the county. Under state housing statutes, these categories are defined as
follows: Very Low (0-50% of County median); Low (50-80% of County median); Moderate
(80-120% of County median); and Upper (over 120% of County median).
Industrial: The manufacture, production, and processing of consumer goods. Industrial is often
divided into “heavy industrial” uses, such as construction yards, quarrying, and factories; and
“light industrial” uses, such as research and development and less intensive warehousing and
manufacturing.
Infill Development: Development of vacant land (usually individual lots or left-over properties)
within areas that are already largely developed.

colleges; (2) churches and other religious organizations; and (3) other non-profit activities of a
welfare, educational, or philanthropic nature that cannot be considered residential, commercial,
or industrial. (See “Public and Quasi-public Facilities.”)
Intensity, Building: For residential uses, the actual number or the allowable range of dwelling
units per net or gross acre. For non-residential uses, the actual or the maximum permitted floor
area ratios (FARs).

general plan and dealt with by the plan’s objectives, policies, plan proposals, and implementation
programs.
Jobs/Housing Balance; Jobs/Housing Ratio: The availability of affordable housing for
employees. The jobs/housing ratio divides the number of jobs in an area by the number of

to share authority in order to plan and carry out a specific program or set of programs that serves
both units.
Land Banking: The purchase of land by a local government for use or resale at a later date.
“Banked lands” have been used for development of low- and moderate-income housing,
expansion of parks, and development of industrial and commercial centers. Federal rail-banking
law allows railroads to bank unused rail corridors for future rail use while allowing interim use
as trails.

substantially in mixed traffic and in non-exclusive, at-grade rights-of-way. Passengers typically
board vehicles from the street level (as opposed to a platform that is level with the train) and the
driver may collect fares. Vehicles are each electrically self-propelled and usually operate in one
or two-car trains.
Linkage: With respect to jobs/housing balance, a program designed to offset the impact of
employment on housing need within a community, whereby project approval is conditioned on
the provision of housing units or the payment of an equivalent in-lieu fee. The linkage program
must establish the cause-and-effect relationship between a new commercial or industrial
development and the increased demand for housing.
Liquefaction: The transformation of loose, wet soil from a solid to a liquid state, often as a result
of ground shaking during an earthquake.
Live-work Quarters: Buildings or spaces within buildings that are used jointly for commercial
and residential purposes where the residential use of the space is secondary or accessory to the
primary use as a place of work.
Lmax: The highest root-mean-square (RMS) sound level measured over a given period of time.
Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO): A five- or seven-member commission within
each county that reviews and evaluates all proposals for formation of special districts,
incorporation of cities, annexation to special districts or cities, consolidation of districts, and
merger of districts with cities. Each county’s LAFCO is empowered to approve, disapprove, or
conditionally approve such proposals. The LAFCO members generally include two county
supervisors, two city council members, and one member representing the general public. Some
LAFCOs include two representatives of special districts.
Loudness: A subjective term for the sensation of the magnitude of sound
Manufactured Housing: Housing that is constructed of manufactured components, assembled
partly at the site rather than totally at the site. Also referred to as modular housing.

Mineral Resource: Land on which known deposits of commercially viable mineral or aggregate
deposits exist. This designation is applied to sites determined by the State Division of Mines and
Geology as being a resource of regional significance, and is intended to help maintain the
quarrying operations and protect them from encroachment of incompatible land uses.
Mixed-use: Properties on which various uses, such as office, commercial, institutional, and
residential, are combined in a single building or on a single site in an integrated development
project with significant functional interrelationships and a coherent physical design. A “single
site’ may include contiguous properties.
Mobile Home: A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is at least 8 feet in width
and 32 feet in length, is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used as a dwelling unit
when connected to the required utilities, either with or without a permanent foundation.
Mortgage Revenue Bond (MRB): A state, county or city program providing financing for the
development of housing through the sale of tax-exempt bonds.
Multiplier Effect: The recirculation of money through the economy multiplies its impact on jobs
and income. For example, money paid as salaries to industrial and office workers is spent on
housing, food, clothes and other locally-available goods and services. This spending creates jobs
in housing construction, retail stores (e.g., grocery and drug stores) and professional offices. The
                                                  16

wage paid to workers in those industries is again re-spent, creating still more jobs. Overall, one
job in basic industry is estimated to create approximately one more job in non-basic industry.

subsidized flood insurance in communities where such flood insurance is not available privately.
National Historic Preservation Act: A 1966 federal law that established a National Register of
Historic Places and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, and that authorized grants-in-
aid for preserving historic properties.
National Register of Historic Places: The official list, established by the National Historic
Preservation Act, of sites, districts, buildings structures, and objects significant in the nation’s
history or whose artistic or architectural value is unique.
Natural State: The condition existing prior to development.
Neighborhood: A planning area commonly identified as such in a community’s planning
documents, and by the individuals residing and working within the neighborhood.
Documentation may include a map prepared for planning purposes, on which the names and
boundaries of the neighborhood are shown.
Neighborhood Unit: According to one widely-accepted concept of planning, the neighborhood
unit should be the basic building block of the city. It is based on the elementary school, with
other community facilities located at its center and arterial streets at its perimeter. The distance
from the school to the perimeter should be a comfortable walking distance for a school-age child;
there would be no through traffic uses. Limited industrial or commercial would occur on the
perimeter where arterials intersect. This was a model for American suburban development after
World War II.
Noise: Unwanted sound
Non-attainment: The condition of not achieving a desired or required level of performance.
Frequently used in reference to air quality. (See “Attainment.”)
Non-conforming Use: “Nonconforming use” means a use which, though lawful when
commenced, is now unlawful due to change in the regulations concerning the use.

a zoning map, that modifies the basic underlying designation in some specific manner.
Overpayment: The extent to which gross housing costs, including utility costs, exceed 30 percent
of gross household income. Severe overpayment, or cost burden, exists if gross housing costs
exceed 50 percent of gross income. Depending on the specific housing programs, the cost
calculations may differ.
Parcel: The basic unit of land entitlement. A designated area of land established by plat,
subdivision, or otherwise legally defined and permitted to be used, or built upon.

Peak Noise: The level corresponding to the highest (not RMS) sound pressure measured over a
given period of time. This term is often confused with the “Maximum” level, which is the
highest RMS level.
Performance Standards: Zoning regulations that permit uses based on a particular set of
standards of operation rather than on a particular type of use. Performance standards provide
specific criteria limiting noise, air pollution, emissions, odors, vibration, dust, dirt, glare, heat,
fire hazards, wastes, traffic impacts, and visual impact of a use.
Physical Defects: A housing unit lacking complete kitchen or bathroom facilities (U.S. Census
definition). Jurisdictions may expand the Census definition in defining units with physical
defects.
Planned Community: A large-scale development whose essential features are a definable
boundary; a consistent, but not necessarily uniform, character; overall control during the
development process by a single development entity; private ownership of recreation amenities;
and enforcement of covenants, conditions, and restrictions by a master community association.
Planned Unit Development (PUD): A description of a proposed unified development, consisting at
a minimum of a map and adopted ordinance setting forth the regulations governing, and the
location and phasing of all proposed uses and improvements to be included in the development.
Planning Commission: A body, usually having five or seven members, created by a city or
county in compliance with California law (§65100) which requires the assignment of the
planning functions of the city or county to a planning department, planning commission, hearing
officers, and/or the legislative body itself, as deemed appropriate by the legislative body.
Pollution, Non-Point: Sources for pollution that are less definable and usually cover broad areas
of land, such as agricultural land with fertilizers that are carried from the land by runoff, or
automobiles.
Pollution, Point: In reference to water quality, a discrete source from which pollution is
generated before it enters receiving waters, such as a sewer outfall, a smokestack, or an industrial
waste pipe.
Poverty: The income cutoffs used by the Census Bureau to determine the poverty status of
families and unrelated individuals included a set of 48 thresholds. The poverty thresholds are
revised annually to allow for changes in the cost of living as reflected in the Consumer Price
Index. Poverty thresholds are applied on a national basis and are not adjusted for regional, state,
or local variations in the cost of living.
Prime Agricultural Land: (1) Land used actively in the production of food, fiber, or livestock. (2)
All land which qualifies for rating as Class I or Class II in the Natural Resources Conservation
Service land use compatibility classifications. (3) Land which qualifies for rating 80 through
100 in the Storie Index Rating.
                                                   19

Prime Farmland: Land which has the best combination of physical and chemical characteristics
for the production of crops. Prime Farmland must have been used for the production of irrigated
crops within the last three years. Prime Farmland does not include publicly-owned lands for
which there is an adopted policy preventing agricultural use.
Private Road/Private Street: Privately owned (and usually privately maintained) motor vehicle
access that is not dedicated as a public street. Typically the owner posts a sign indicating that the
street is private property and limits traffic in some fashion. For density calculation purposes,
some jurisdictions exclude private roads when establishing the total acreage of the site; however,
aisles within and driveways serving private parking lots are not considered private roads.
Project-Based Rental Assistance: Rental assistance provided for a project, not for a specific
tenant. A tenant receiving project-based rental assistance gives up the right to that assistance
upon moving from the project.
Public and Quasi-public Facilities: Institutional, academic, governmental and community service
uses, either owned publicly or operated by non-profit organizations, including private hospitals
and cemeteries.
Public Housing: A project-based low-rent housing program operated by independent local public
housing authorities. A low-income family applies to the local public housing authority in the
area in which they want to live.
Public Services: See “Municipal Services.”
Reclamation: The reuse of resources, usually those present in solid wastes or sewage.
Reconstruction: As used in historic preservation, the process of reproducing by new construction
the exact form and detail of a vanished structure, or part thereof, as it appeared during a specific
period of time. Reconstruction is often undertaken when the property to be reconstructed is
essential for understanding and interpreting the value of an historic district and sufficient
documentation exists to insure an exact reproduction of the original.
Recreation, Active: A type of recreation or activity that requires the use of organized play areas
including but not limited to, softball, baseball, football and soccer fields, tennis and basketball
courts and various forms of children’s play equipment.
Recreation, Passive: Type of recreation or activity that does not require the use of organized play
areas.
Redevelop: To demolish existing buildings; or to increase the overall floor area existing on a
property; or both; irrespective of whether a change occurs in land use.
Redevelopment Agency: California Community Redevelopment Law provides authority to
establish a Redevelopment Agency with the scope and financing mechanisms necessary to
remedy blight and provide stimulus to eliminate deteriorated conditions. The law provides for the
                                                  20

planning, development, redesign, clearance, reconstruction, or rehabilitation, or any combination
of these, and the provision of public and private improvements as may be appropriate or
necessary in the interest of the general welfare by the Agency. Redevelopment law requires an
Agency to set aside a minimum of 20% of all tax increment dollars generated from each
redevelopment project area for the purpose of increasing and improving the community’s supply
of housing for low and moderate income households.
Rehabilitation: The upgrading of a building previously in a dilapidated or substandard condition
for human habitation or use.
Regional: Pertaining to activities or economies at a scale greater than that of a single jurisdiction,
and affecting a broad geographic area.
Regional Housing Needs Plan (RHNP): The Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNP) is
based on State of California projections of population growth and housing unit demand and
assigns a share of the region’s future housing need to each jurisdiction within the Sacramento
Area Council of Governments (SACOG) region. These housing need numbers serve as the basis
for the update of the Housing Element in each California city and county.
Retrofit: To add materials and/or devices to an existing building or system to improve its
operation, safety, or efficiency. Buildings have been retrofitted to use solar energy and to
strengthen their ability to withstand earthquakes, for example.
Rezoning: An amendment to the map and/or text of a zoning ordinance to effect a change in the
nature, density, or intensity of uses allowed in a zoning district and/or on a designated parcel or
land area.
Richter Scale: A measure of the size or energy release of an earthquake at its source. The scale
is logarithmic; the wave amplitude of each number on the scale is 10 times greater than that of
the previous whole number.
Ridgeline: A line connecting the highest points along a ridge and separating drainage basins or
small-scale drainage systems from one another.
Right-of-way: A strip of land occupied or intended to be occupied, usually under an easement, by
certain transportation and public use facilities, such as roads, railroads, and utility lines.
Riparian Lands: Riparian lands are comprised of the vegetative and wildlife areas adjacent to
perennial and intermittent streams. Riparian areas are delineated by the existence of plant
species normally found near freshwater.
Sanitary Landfill: The controlled placement of refuse within a limited area, followed by
compaction and covering with a suitable thickness of earth and other containment material.
Section 8 Rental Voucher/Certificate Program: A tenant-based rental assistance program that
subsidizes a family’s rent in a privately owned house or apartment. The program is administered
                                                   21

by local public housing authorities. Assistance payments are based on 30 percent of household
annual income. Households with incomes of 50 percent or below the area median income are
eligible to participate in the program.
Seiche: An earthquake-generated wave in an enclosed body of water such as a lake, reservoir, or
bay.
Seismic: Caused by or subject to earthquakes or earth vibrations.
Septic System: A sewage-treatment system that includes a settling tank through which liquid
sewage flows and in which solid sewage settles and is decomposed by bacteria in the absence of
oxygen. Septic systems are often used for individual-home waste disposal where an urban sewer
system is not available. (See “Sanitary Sewer.”)
Service Needs: The particular services required by special populations, typically including needs
such as transportation, personal care, housekeeping, counseling, meals, case management,
personal emergency response, and other services preventing premature institutionalization and
assisting individuals to continue living independently.
Settlement: (1) The drop in elevation of a ground surface caused by settling or compacting. (2)
The gradual downward movement of an engineered structure due to compaction. Differential
settlement is uneven settlement, where one part of a structure settles more or at a different rate
than another part.
Sanitary Sewer: A system of underground pipes designed for the collection and transportation of
wastewater from residential, commercial and industrial uses to a wastewater treatment plant.
Siltation: (1) The accumulating deposition of eroded material. (2) The gradual filling in of
streams and other bodies of water with sand, silt, and clay.
Simple Tone: Any sound which can be judged as audible as a single pitch or set of single pitches.
Small Household: Pursuant to HUD definition, a small household consists of two to four non-
elderly persons.
Smart Growth Principles: Smart growth principles recognize connections between development
and quality of life. The features that distinguish smart growth in a community vary from place to
place, but generally invest time, attention, and resources in restoring community and vitality to
center cities and older suburbs. Smart growth is town-centered, is transit and pedestrian
oriented, and has a greater mix of housing, commercial and retail uses while at the same time
preserving open space and other environmental amenities.
Solid Waste: Any unwanted or discarded material that is not a liquid or gas. Includes organic
wastes, paper products, metals, glass, plastics, cloth, brick, rock, soil, leather, rubber, yard
wastes, and wood, but does not include sewage and hazardous materials. Organic wastes and
paper products comprise about 75 percent of typical urban solid waste.
                                                 22

Special Needs Groups: Those segments of the population which have a more difficult time
finding decent affordable housing due to special circumstances. Under California Housing
Element statutes, these special needs groups consist of the elderly, handicapped, large families,
female-headed households, farmworkers and the homeless. A jurisdiction may also choose to
consider additional special needs groups in the Housing Element, such as students, military
households, other groups present in their community.
Specific Plan: A tool authorized by Government Code §65450 et seq. for the systematic
implementation of the general plan for a defined portion of a community’s planning area. A
specific plan must specify in detail the land uses, public and private facilities needed to support
the land uses, phasing of development, standards for the conservation, development, and use of
natural resources, and a program of implementation measures, including financing measures.
Sphere of Influence: The probable physical boundaries and service area of a local agency, as
determined by the Local Agency Formation Commission of the County.
Standards: (1) A rule or measure establishing a level of quality or quantity that must be complied
with or satisfied. Government Code §65302 requires that general plans spell out the objectives,
principles, “standards,” and proposals of the general plan. Examples of standards might include
the number of acres of park land per 1,000 population that the community will attempt to acquire
and improve, or the “traffic Level of Service” (LOS) that the plan hopes to attain. (2)
Requirements in a zoning ordinance that govern building and development as distinguished from
use restrictions – for example, site-design regulations such as lot area, height limit, frontage,
landscaping, and floor area ratio.
State Responsibility Areas: Areas of the state in which the financial responsibility for preventing
and suppressing fires has been determined by the State Board of Forestry (pursuant to Public
Resources Code §4125) to be primarily the responsibility of the State.
Structure: Anything constructed or erected that requires location on the ground (excluding
swimming pools, fences, and walls used as fences).
Subdivision: The division of a lot, tract or parcel of land in accordance with the Subdivision
Map Act (California Government Code Section 66410 et seq.).
Subdivision Map Act: Section 66410 et seq. of the California Government Code, this act vests in
local legislative bodies the regulation and control of the design and improvement of subdivisions,
including the requirement for tentative and final maps.
Subsidence: The sudden sinking or gradual downward settling and compaction of soil and other
surface material with little or no horizontal motion. Subsidence may be caused by a variety of
human and natural activity, including earthquakes. (See “Settlement.”)
Subsidy: Housing subsidies refer to government assistance aimed at reducing housing sales or
rent prices to more affordable levels. For example, a project that utilizes government funding in
                                                 23

whole or in part to reduce costs of construction, reduce construction loan interest rates, or rent
reductions, etc.
Substandard Housing: Housing which does not meet the minimum standards contained in the
State Housing Code (i.e. does not provide shelter, endangers the health, safety or well-being of
occupants). Jurisdictions may adopt more stringent local definitions of substandard housing.
Substandard, Suitable for Rehabilitation: Substandard units which are structurally sound and for
which the cost of rehabilitation is considered economically warranted.
Substandard, Needs Replacement: Substandard units which are structurally unsound and for
which the cost of rehabilitation is considered infeasible, such as instances where the majority of a
unit has been damaged by fire.
Supportive Housing: Housing with a supporting environment, such as group homes or Single
Room Occupancy (SRO) housing and other housing that includes a supportive service
component such as those defined below.
Supportive Services: Services provided to residents of supportive housing for the purpose of
facilitating the independence of residents. Some examples are case management, medical or
psychological counseling and supervision, child care, transportation, and job training.
Sustainability: Community use of natural resources in a way that does not jeopardize the ability
of future generations to live and prosper.
Sustainable Development: Development that maintains or enhances economic opportunity and
community well-being while protecting and restoring the natural environment upon which
people and economies depend. Sustainable development meets the needs of the present without
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. (Source: Minnesota
State Legislature.)
Tax Increment: Additional tax revenues that result from increases in property values within a
redevelopment area. State law permits the tax increment to be earmarked for redevelopment
purposes but requires at least 20 percent to be used to increase and improve the community’s
supply of very low- and low-income housing.
Telecommuting: An arrangement in which a worker is at home or in a location other than the
primary place of work, and communicates with the workplace and conducts work via wireless or
telephone lines, using modems, fax machines, or other electronic devices in conjunction with
computers.
Tenant-Based Rental Assistance: A form of rental assistance in which the assisted tenant may
move from a dwelling unit with a right to continued assistance. The assistance is provided for
the tenant, not for the project.
                                                 24

Threshold of Hearing: The lowest sound that can be perceived by the human auditory system,
generally considered to be 0 dB for persons with perfect hearing.
Threshold of Pain: Approximately 120 dB above the threshold of hearing.
Traffic Model: A mathematical representation of traffic movement within an area or region based
on observed relationships between the kind and intensity of development in specific areas. Many
traffic models operate on the theory that trips are produced by persons living in residential areas
and are attracted by various non-residential land uses. (See “Trip.”)
Transit: The conveyance of persons or goods from one place to another by means of a local,
public transportation system.
Transit, Public: A system of regularly-scheduled buses and/or trains available to the public on a
fee-per-ride basis. Also called “Mass Transit.”
Transit-dependent: Refers to persons unable to operate automobiles or other motorized vehicles,
or those who do not own motorized vehicles. Transit-dependent citizens must rely on transit,
para-transit, or owners of private vehicles for transportation. Transit-dependent citizens include
the young, the handicapped, the elderly, the poor, and those with prior violations in motor
vehicle laws.
Transitional Housing: Transitional housing is temporary (often six months to two years) housing
for a homeless individual or family who is transitioning to permanent housing. Transitional
housing often includes a supportive services component (e.g. job skills training, rehabilitation
counseling, etc.) to allow individuals to gain necessary life skills in support of independent
living.
Transportation Demand Management (TDM): A strategy for reducing demand on the road system
by reducing the number of vehicles using the roadways and/or increasing the number of persons
per vehicle. TDM attempts to reduce the number of persons who drive alone on the roadway
during the commute period and to increase the number in carpools, vanpools, buses and trains,
walking, and biking. TDM can be an element of TSM (see below).
Transportation Systems Management: A comprehensive strategy developed to address the
problems caused by additional development, increasing trips, and a shortfall in transportation
capacity. Transportation Systems Management focuses on more efficiently utilizing existing
highway and transit systems rather than expanding them. TSM measures are characterized by
their low cost and quick implementation time frame, such as computerized traffic signals,
metered freeway ramps, and one-way streets.
Trip: A one-way journey that proceeds from an origin to a destination via a single mode of
transportation; the smallest unit of movement considered in transportation studies. Each trip has
one “production end,” (or origin – often from home, but not always), and one “attraction end,”
(destination). (See “Traffic Model.”)
                                                 25

Trip Generation: The dynamics that account for people making trips in automobiles or by means
of public transportation. Trip generation is the basis for estimating the level of use for a
transportation system and the impact of additional development or transportation facilities on an
existing, local transportation system. Trip generations of households are correlated with
destinations that attract household members for specific purposes.
Truck Route: A path of circulation required for all vehicles exceeding set weight or axle limits, a
truck route follows major arterials through commercial or industrial areas and avoids sensitive
areas.
Uniform Building Code (UBC): A national, standard building code that sets forth minimum
standards for construction.
Uniform Housing Code (UHC): State housing regulations governing the condition of habitable
structures with regard to health and safety standards, and which provide for the conservation and
rehabilitation of housing in accordance with the Uniform Building Code.
Urban: Of, relating to, characteristic of, or constituting a city. Urban areas are generally
characterized by moderate and higher density residential development (i.e., three or more
dwelling units per acre), commercial development, and industrial development, and the
availability of public services required for that development, specifically central water and
sewer, an extensive road network, public transit, and other such services (e.g., safety and
emergency response). Development not providing such services may be “non-urban” or “rural.”
(See “Urban Land Use.”)
Urban Design: The attempt to give form, in terms of both beauty and function, to selected urban
areas or to whole cities. Urban design is concerned with the location, mass, and design of
various urban components and combines elements of urban planning, architecture, and landscape
architecture.
Urban Land Use: Residential, commercial, or industrial land use in areas where urban services
are available.
Urban Reserve: An area outside of an urban service area but within an urban growth boundary,
in which future development and extension of municipal services are contemplated but not
imminent.
Urban Services: Utilities (such as water, gas, electricity, and sewer) and public services (such as
police, fire, schools, parks and recreation) provided to an urbanized or urbanizing area.
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD): The cabinet level department of the
federal government responsible for housing, housing assistance, and urban development at the
national level. Housing programs administered through HUD include Community Development
Block Grant (CDBG), HOME and Section 8, among others.
                                                  26

Utility Corridors: Rights-of-way or easements for utility lines on either publicly or privately
owned property. (See “Right-of-way” or “Easement.”)
Vehicle-Miles Traveled (VMT): A key measure of overall street and highway use. Reducing VMT
is often a major objective in efforts to reduce vehicular congestion and achieve regional air
quality goals.
View Corridor: The line of sight – identified as to height, width, and distance – of an observer
looking toward an object of significance to the community (e.g., ridgeline, river, historic
building, etc.); the route that directs the viewer’s attention.
Viewshed: The area within view from a defined observation point.
Volume-to-Capacity Ratio: A measure of the operating capacity of a roadway or intersection, in
terms of the number of vehicles passing through, divided by the number of vehicles that
theoretically could pass through when the roadway or intersection is operating at its designed
capacity. Abbreviated as “V/C.” At a V/C ratio of 1.0, the roadway or intersection is operating
at capacity. If the ratio is less than 1.0, the traffic facility has additional capacity. Although
ratios slightly greater than 1.0 are possible, it is more likely that the peak hour will elongate into
a “peak period.” (See “Level of Service.”)
Water-efficient Landscaping: Landscaping designed to minimize water use and maximize energy
efficiency.
Watercourse: Natural or once natural flowing (perennially or intermittently) water including
rivers, streams, and creeks. Includes natural waterways that have been channelized, but does not
include manmade channels, ditches, and underground drainage and sewage systems.
Watershed: The total area above a given point on a watercourse that contributes water to its
flow; the entire region drained by a waterway or watercourse that drains into a lake, or reservoir.
Waterway: See “Watercourse.”
Wetlands: Transitional areas between terrestrial and aquatic systems where the water table is
usually at or near the surface, or the land is covered by shallow water. Under a “unified”
methodology now used by all federal agencies, wetlands are defined as “those areas meeting
certain criteria for hydrology, vegetation, and soils.”
Woodlands: Lands covered with woods or trees.
Zero Lot Line: A detached single family unit distinguished by the location of one exterior wall on
a side property line.
Zone, Combining: A special purpose zone that is superimposed over the regular zoning map.
Combining zones are used for a variety of purposes, such as airport compatibility, floodplain or
                                                   27

wetlands protection, historic designation, or special parking regulations. Also called “overlay
zone.”
Zone, Interim: A zoning designation that temporarily reduces or freezes allowable development
in an area until a permanent classification can be fixed; generally assigned during general plan
preparation to provide a basis for permanent zoning.
Zone, Traffic: In a mathematical traffic model the area to be studied is divided into zones, with
each zone treated as producing and attracting trips. The production of trips by a zone is based on
the number of trips to or from work or shopping, or other trips produced per dwelling unit.
Zoning: A land use regulatory measure enacted by local government. Zoning district regulations
governing lot size, building bulk, placement, and other development standards vary from district
to district, but must be uniform within the same district. Each city and county adopts a zoning
ordinance specifying these regulations.
