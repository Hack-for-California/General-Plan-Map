                                                                                and Sphere of
The City of Clearlake is located in Northern California, approximately
                                                                                Influence
80 miles north of San Francisco. It is situated in the center of Lake
County, between Lower Lake to the south and Clearlake Oaks to the            D. General Plan
north (see Figure 1.1). The City encompasses 10.8 square miles and is           Overview
situated on the southern shore of Clear Lake, the largest natural            E. Goals,
freshwater lake located entirely within California.                             Objectives,

State Route 53 provides primary access to the community from SR20
                                                                                Programs
from the north, and SR29 from the south. Originally inhabited by Pomo
Native Americans, it was settled in the early 20th century and became
known as a resort destination, along with other lakeside communities. The community was
incorporated in 1980. Clearlake is the largest city and largest population center in Lake County,
with a population of approximately 15,000 people.
Opportunities and Challenges
Neighborhoods and business areas create sufficient activity that Clearlake serves as a
sub-regional commercial hub for its home community, as well as for residents living in the
outlying parts of Lake County. As the City expands, there is optimism that Clearlake will be able
to sustain a wider variety of regional shopping resources, more convenient local services and
new industries.
The City has experienced steady growth due to a high quality of life relative to its medium-
priced housing and opportunities for a working population. It has the land and connections

                                                                                   Final
needed to expand its base. Clearlake’s downtown and regional shopping center, as well as
other local shopping and activities, present many opportunities for growth and redevelopment.
The challenge Clearlake faces is that it must bring certain parts of the City up to the standards
of its more attractive areas in order to take advantage of its opportunities. In doing so, the City
will be in a better position to compete for the type of development, redevelopment and
reinvestment that it desires.
Sustainable Growth
The residents of Clearlake value stability and sustainability. They want growth to be slow and
incremental, connected to and in character with the community’s historical development
patterns. In other words, the community wants to keep its “small town” character.
Connectivity and Universal Access
Closely related to the vision of steady, incremental, sustainable growth is the desire of the
community to improve its multi-modal connectivity. The near-downtown grid pattern should
be continued and reinforced (which will also facilitate transit). Sidewalks should be designed
for universal access and installed along all streets. The community also seeks to improve and
interconnect its park and trail system.

                                             Final
Diverse Economy
The creation of good jobs for the next generation is a critical need. The City envisions further
development of its retail and industrial economy to reduce its prevailing dependence on the
agricultural and service sectors particularly for future employment opportunities.
Downtown
The City envisions the rejuvenation of its downtown on Lakeshore Drive. The vision is to
promote infill development and redevelopment in the downtown area and eventually expand
its boundaries to create a stronger connection to the surrounding residential areas.
Housing
Much of Clearlake consists of relatively young families and older retirees. Clearlake needs
housing products to accommodate family living at a wide range of income levels. The City
envisions increasing the range of housing options that are available to its residents, including
the development of more mixed-income housing that is convenient to the downtown area. A
significant percentage of homes in the area (about 25% countywide) are “second” and/or
vacation homes, contributing to seasonal (summer) increases in residents and visitors.
Nonresidential Development
The City envisions increasing nonresidential development in a manner that better calibrates
jobs and housing, results in an influx of daily commuters and provides additional tax revenues
to support City services.
Regional Role and Coordination
The City envisions strengthening its ties to Lakeport, Ukiah and other nearby communities, with
better public transportation and intergovernmental coordination.
Environmental Quality
Residents of Clearlake value the quality of the City’s environment and want to preserve and
protect it. Farmland, stream protection and water conservation are important to the
community. Many also view the community’s commitment to environmental quality as an
economic development tool. Green building, alternative transportation, biofuels and the like
were opportunities presented as desirable industries for the community.
Demographics
According to the California Department of Finance, in 2015, the City’s estimated population was
14,997. Based on the 2010 Census, the City skews toward older residents, with an above-

average median age of 39.9 years, with nearly 44% over the age of 45. The median household
income was reported to be $28,604 (less than half of the California average), with nearly a third
of households below the poverty line.
B.       Purpose, Intent and Legal Authority
Applicable Statutes and Long Range Planning
California law requires both cities and counties to adopt a General Plan to guide future
development (Government Code Sections 65300 et seq.). The General Plan outlines goals and
policies to guide long-range planning within a city or county, and it is to “act as a ‘constitution’
for development, the foundation upon which all land use decisions are to be based” (California
Governor’s Office of Planning and Research [OPR], 2003). According to the OPR guidelines, the
General Plan “expresses community development goals and embodies public policy relative to
the distribution of future land use, both public and private” (OPR, 2003).
Clearlake’s first and current General Plan was completed in 1983 after the City originally
incorporated. This new document is an enhancement of the nearly 30-year old document
intended to replace the current General Plan.
Also, under Section 65358(b) of the Government Code, the City may not amend any of the
mandatory elements of the General Plan more than four times in any calendar year. Subject to
this limitation, the City Council may amend the plan at any time of which each amendment may
include more than one change. This requirement, however, is not applicable to amendments
requested and necessary to address affordable housing and/or any amendment to comply with
a court decision in a case involving the legal adequacy of the General Plan.
Pursuant to Section 65580, the housing element must be completed not less often than at
five-year intervals. The current Housing Element Draft was completed in 2015 and its findings
have been integrated into the other elements of this General Plan update. The complete
updated Housing Element Document can be found in the General Plan Background Report. The
Background Report is intended to be updated as necessary when new information is presented.
This will include ongoing updates to the Housing Element.
In conformance with Section 66001, financing plans (known as nexus studies) that provide
justification for mitigation fees adopted to implement the General Plan must be reviewed after
five years and annually thereafter.
Prior to the consideration and adoption of this plan, the following process steps have been
followed:
        Refer the General Plan to those with jurisdiction in the area of influence, including the
         county and any abutting cities; unified school district; local agency formation

                                                                                    Final

        commission; area wide planning agency; public water system; the California Native
        American tribes.
       Conducted consultation with California Native American tribes, as applicable.
       Held at least one noticed public hearing with the Planning Commission before approving
        a recommendation on the adoption or amendment of a general plan.
       Provided a written recommendation by the Planning Commission on the adoption or
        amendment, which was sent to the City Council.
       Held at least one noticed public hearing before the City Council.
       Adopted the general plan by resolution by an affirmative vote of not less than a majority
        of the total membership of the City Council.
       Sent electronic copies of the adopted general plan to all public entities specified in
        Public Resources Section 65352.
       Made copies of the plan available to the general public.
The adopted General Plan has been made available to the public at all times including public
copies provided at City Hall and the Redbud public library and on the City’s website
http://www.clearlake.ca.us. The complete plan, including consolidated and independent
elements, have been made available, together with all applicable plans, maps, supporting text
and tables, and any and all amendments since the last update. All components of the plan have
and continue to be made available for reproduction.
Pursuant to Section 65402, the acquisition or disposal of real property, vacation or
abandonment of streets, and construction of public buildings or structures may not occur until
and unless it has been reported on by the planning agency as to its conformity with the plan.
Furthermore, a capital improvement plan may not be carried out if it is not consistent with the
General Plan. Lastly, all private development projects must be reviewed for their consistency
and conformity with the adopted General Plan. If a project is inconsistent in any manner it
must be denied or the plan amended.
C.      Regional Context Planning Area and Sphere of Influence
The boundary of a city’s planning area encompasses incorporated and unincorporated territory
bearing a relation to a city’s borders. The planning area may extend beyond the Sphere of
Influence (OPR, 2003). In Clearlake’s case, the lake plays a significant role in planning for the
City; therefore, it is included in the planning area as illustrated in Figure 1.2.
                                                            Clearlake General Plan Update   6

A city’s Sphere of Influence (SOI) is determined by the Local Agency Formation Commission
(LAFCO), and includes both incorporated and unincorporated territory for which the City can
adequately provide services and potentially annex in the near future. (OPR, 2003). In 1987,
Lake LAFCO adopted an SOI for Clearlake to include approximately 7,310 acres of
unincorporated land (Lake LAFCO, 1987). In 1989, this area was amended to include properties
owned by the Clearlake Hotel and Resort Co. located within the Clearlake Oaks Fire Protection
District.

                                                                               Final

              Figure 1.3. Planning Area and 2040 Sphere of Influence, Clearlake
Clearlake’s SOI, shown in Figure 1.2, follows logical divisions between communities and centers
of growth extending eastward (Lake LAFCO, 1987). Land uses within the unincorporated area
of the current SOI are predominately undeveloped, vacant and open space lands (Lake LAFCO,
1987). Based on the most recent LAFCO Municipal Service Review, however, the City’s SOI
should be contracted to be the same as the City’s current jurisdictional boundaries. In this case
the proposed SOI under the 2040 General Plan is shown in Figure 1.3. The previous SOI
expansion area is now referenced as an “Area of Concern”, whereby the City is involved in any
planning proposed in this area subject to Lake County review.
Regional Coordination
The City of Clearlake is part of Lake County and a member of the Lake County/City Area
Planning Council (APC). The APC is the Regional Transportation Planning Agency (RTPA) for the
Lake County region. Primarily, the RTPA ensures that appropriate local transportation planning
is administered in accordance with the Transportation Development Act (TDA), the State
Transportation Improvement Program (STIP), and the Service Authority for Freeway
Emergencies (SAFE) program. The City of Clearlake works with Lake County and the APC to
develop policies and plans to address land use, economic development, infrastructure systems
and natural resource quality to meet the needs of current and future residents of the City.

D.      General Plan Overview
Objectives of the General Plan Update
The objective of the plan is, therefore, to provide guidance for decisions relating to the future
use of land, community character and design, housing and neighborhoods, economic
development, circulation and mobility, open space and recreation, resource conservation and
management, and public facilities and services. The horizon of this plan is the Year 2040. Over
this period, Clearlake will be facing many challenges in achieving its development goals. It is
the intent of this plan that the policies and associated goals, objectives and recommended
implementation strategies serve as a framework for community decision-making. To ensure
growth that is both wise and sustainable, decisions must be based on a formulation of sound
policy and founded by a comprehensive and integrated approach to analyzing community
issues and identifying realistic solutions, as set forth in this plan.
Value of the Plan Development Process
Undertaking this planning process was highly valuable for both leaders and citizens of the
community alike since it provided an opportunity to think beyond the normal day-to-day issues.
This process allowed the community to think grand in scale by examining its historical, current
and projected growth and development within the City and its Sphere of Influence. The nature
of the planning process also required the community to consider the interrelationships among a
variety of long-range planning issues. For instance, there was evaluation of how the City’s
future land use and growth patterns will affect the requirements to widen streets and improve
major intersections.
Further, to encourage broad, long-term and integrated thinking, the planning process provided
a means for members of the public to identify the community they want now, and more
importantly, in five, ten and twenty years, and beyond. It was an important step in this process
to allow citizens opportunities to identify their vision and to encourage their participation in
planning for the future. The ability to successfully implement this plan is directly correlated to
the amount of citizen participation and the sense of ownership derived from the plan
development process:
Benefits of the Plan
The General Plan provides long-term policy direction. In so doing, the plan offers community
leaders and residents the following benefits:
       Establishes policy direction for future development and redevelopment, providing
        decision-making guidance to members of the Planning Commission, City Council, City
        staff, as well as the community at-large.

      Identifies recommendations contributing to future work programs for the City.
      Sets out basic principles for maintaining and enhancing the character of existing and
       future neighborhoods, leading to the formation of new land use regulations.
      Identifies improvement needs and priorities for use by City management to guide
       budgeting and capital programming decisions.
      States the municipality’s intentions regarding the physical development and
       infrastructure investment, ultimately creating an improved level of certainty for
       landowners and developers.
      Communicates to citizens the type, pattern and density of future development, thereby
       flagging the impact of development on private property.
      Coordinates transportation and infrastructure improvements with development,
       creating an integrated development framework.
      Lays out the future economic and physical development of the community, which is
       useful to other local, State and Federal agencies engaged in the provision of programs,
       services and facilities.
Envisioning the Future
A clear vision of what the community aspires to achieve is the first step in charting a path to
address the complex decisions facing it in the short- and long-term. A vision describes the
community’s preferred future, offering direction for the goals, objectives and policies that
provide a framework for future planning, development and programmatic decisions.
Elements of the General Plan
Government Code Section 65302 mandates seven elements to be addressed in a city’s general
plan: land use, circulation, housing, conservation, open space, noise and safety. The City of
Clearlake’s General Plan document includes these required elements and four additional
optional elements: economic development, public facilities, community design and health.
These elements are briefly summarized below:
Land Use
The Land Use Element designates the type, intensity and distribution of public and private land
uses. Housing, commercial, industrial and open space are some of the land uses considered
under this element. A land use map illustrates planned location and density of these uses in the
City.

Circulation
The Circulation Element is interconnected with the Land Use Element to address future
transportation needs of proposed land uses and users. Major thoroughfares, transportation
routes, hubs and other infrastructural utilities and facilities, existing and proposed, are
identified and planned under this element.
Housing
The Housing Element is a comprehensive assessment of current and projected housing needs.
It includes policies and programs for providing adequate housing for all economic segments of
the community. The housing element must be updated periodically by state mandate. The
2014-19 Housing Element was adopted by the City in March 2015, and is incorporated into this
2040 General Plan by reference.
Conservation
The Conservation Element addresses the conservation, development and use of natural
resources. The condition and future of air, water, soils, minerals and biological resources are
assessed under this element.
Open Space
The Open Space Element provides plans and guidelines for the long-term preservation of open-
space lands. The intent of this element is to ensure public health and safety through the
conservation of natural resources, management of resource production (including agricultural
lands), and maintenance of outdoor recreational facilities.
Noise and Vibration
The Noise Element sets goals to minimize community exposure to excessive noise and vibration
by identifying existing and future noise and vibration quantities and sources through data
gathering or modeling.
Housing Element
The Housing Element provides an assessment of current and projected housing needs. It
includes policies and programs for providing adequate housing for all economic segments of the
community. The housing element must be updated periodically by state mandate. The 2014-19
Housing Element was adopted by the City in March 2015. Additional minor changes have been
made to the Housing Element in this General Plan document to assure consistency with all
other elements.

Safety
The Safety Element includes strategies to prepare the community for risks associated with fire,
flood, seismicity, geologic activity, hazardous materials and crime.
Economic Development
The Economic Development Element guides the economic character of the community while
providing for a stable annual budget. A stable economy is achieved through the development
of policies and strategies related to retaining existing businesses, attracting new businesses and
industries, creating jobs and expanding the City’s tax base.
Public Facilities
The Public Facilities Element addresses existing capacity and future demand of water, power,
waste management, telecommunications, health, educational and emergency protection
facilities in the City.
Community Design
The Community Design Element guides public and private development to create a city that is
functional and aesthetically appealing. The element brings several elements together to
enhance the natural and built environment.
Health
The Health Element provides policies to address community health issues and needs and
promote healthy living solutions.
Contents of Each Element
Beginning in September 2012, the City conducted a comprehensive assessment of existing
conditions within the City of Clearlake and compiled a formal background report. The
information was collected from community members, field research, planning documents and
other sources, including the U.S. Census and relevant state and federal laws. Based on this
diverse set of informational resources, a series of goals, objectives, policies and programs was
identified for each element.
E.       Goals, Objectives, Policies and Programs
Following the OPR General Plan Guidelines, the format for the goals, objectives, policies and
programs is as follows:
                                                          Clearlake General Plan Update     12
                                                                                    Final

Goal
A goal is a general direction-setter. It is an ideal future end related to the public health, safety,
or general welfare. A goal is a general expression of community values and, therefore, may be
abstract in nature. Consequently, a goal is generally not quantifiable or time-dependent.
Objective
An objective is a specified end, condition, or state that is an intermediate step toward attaining
a goal. It should be achievable and, when possible, measurable and time- specific. An objective
may pertain to one particular aspect of a goal or it may be one of several successive steps
toward goal achievement.
Policy
A policy is a specific statement that guides decision-making. It indicates a commitment of the
local legislative body to a particular course of action. A policy is based on and helps implement
a General Plan’s objectives.
Program
A program implements a general plan policy. Jurisdictions draft programs to be specific in
order to carry out policies, meet objectives and work towards goals.
F.      Other Terms
Shall, Should and Encouraged/Discouraged
Throughout the document terms should, shall, encourage and discourage are used extensively
and should be defined as follows:
Shall
As used herein, are mandatory and must be included in the project’s design.
Should
As used herein, signifies a directive and to be applied as stated. However, an alternative
measure may be considered if it meets or exceeds the intent of the guideline.

Encourage/Discouraged
As used herein, are desirable but not mandatory. It is expected that the next logical step will be
to invest in an implementation effort to set the vision and recommendations of this plan into
motion.
G.       Environmental Justice
As referenced in Chapter 2 of this document and Chapter 14 of the General Plan Background
Report, this General Plan was developed through a fair and equitable public participation
program that engaged all of the community regardless of race, color, national origin or income
(environmental justice). All goals, objectives, policies, programs and implementation of the
General Plan consider this environmental justice approach. Chapter 3 of the General Plan also
includes a number of environmental justice policies and programs to assure that decisions
made in implementing the General Plan respect the fair treatment and meaningful involvement
of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income.
H.       Implementation
It is expected that the next logical step will be to invest in an implementation effort to set the
vision and recommendations of this plan into motion. Such implementation process will
include revision of existing ordinances and crafting new standards and regulations, consistent
with the vision expressed by this adopted public document. Subsequent to this step, the above
plan elements and their corresponding implementation will follow.

series of land use alternatives was developed through this public
participation program. After reviewing background data, an economic and circulation capacity
analysis was conducted by the professional consultant team, and a preferred growth scenario
was developed, which essentially became the basis for the General Plan.

B.      Background Report
The General Plan Background Report, a companion document to this General Plan, serves as
the foundational informational basis to the General Plan. It incorporates an overall community
profile of the demographic, socioeconomic, ecological and physical conditions, both past and
present, that characterize the City of Clearlake. The Background Report encompasses fourteen
chapters covering:
       Introduction (Chapter 1)
       The Planning and Public Participation Process (Chapter 2)
       Demographic Trends (Chapter 3)
       Land Use (Chapter 4)
       Circulation (Chapter 5)
       Housing (Chapter 6)
       Conservation (Chapter 7)
       Open Space (Chapter 8)
       Noise (Chapter 9)
       Safety (Chapter 10)
       Economic Development (Chapter 11)
       Public Facilities (Chapter 12)
       Community Design (Chapter 13)
       Public Health (Chapter 14)
C.      References/Methodology
Supporting references to this Plan are based on readily available, public information through
the City of Clearlake and its consultant studies/plans, Lake County, U.S. Census Bureau,
California Department of Finance, Natural Resource Conservation Service and many other local,
state and federal agencies. A complete list of references to the General Plan is provided in
Chapter 15 of the General Plan Background Report. In addition to data used from these
references, information taken from the series of public workshops was analyzed for community
preferences and then checked for practical applicability to develop a preferred vision for the
future (refer to Section E of this chapter regarding public participation). The Consultant Team,
supported by Economic Planning Systems, Inc., then reviewed demographic and economic
information, and confirmed practical application of the land use distributions for realistic build
out capacity for a sustainable jobs-to-housing ratio. For the purposes of developing the
circulation plan, the land use distributions developed in the General Plan Land Use Map were
converted to traffic generation rates by various traffic area zones, developed by Omni Means,
Transportation Consultants. Traffic modeling was then conducted, in accordance with the
                                                        Clearlake General Plan Update       16

California Department of Transportation criteria to develop planned roadway standards and
evaluated for proper traffic capacity at build out (to 2040). The Circulation Map was then
developed from this level of analysis. Finally, goals, objectives, policies and programs were
developed from community preferences developed during the public outreach workshops,
checked for practical economic applications, and then supported by background data.
D.      Glossary of Terms
Technical terms used throughout this and the General Plan Background Report documents are
defined in Chapter 14, Glossary of Terms.
E.      Planning and Public Participation
The CalPoly General Plan Update Team conducted a series of public workshops for about
eighteen months, beginning in 2013, to help develop the community’s vision for future
community development to the year 2040. This was followed up with two public workshops
with the Planning Commission conducted by Price Consulting Services on December 1, 2015
and January 5, 2016, to solidify the land use and circulation plans that became the backbone of
the General Plan Update. A more complete discussion of this program is also presented in
Chapter 2 of the General Plan Background Report.
The Public Participation Program has served as a foundation for developing this Plan; a plan to
assist decision-making by identifying opportunities and constraints for growth and
development, which has trickle-down impacts on the overall community system. Ranging from
transportation infrastructure and public utility systems to parks and recreation facilities, the
information feeds into a spectrum of short- and long-term planning goals that are associated
with recommendations and action items of this Plan.
This Plan, as an overall big picture perspective, should help shape how the City operates on a
day-to-day basis and serve as a resource for advanced planning. It should guide community
development in an environmentally and fiscally sustainable manner.
F.      Growth Projections for 2040
Much of the General Plan Policy Document’s foundation is based on projections for population
growth and job targets as described in this section. The projections in this section were used to
develop three Alternative Growth Scenarios: Business as Usual, Infill, Redevelopment and
Clustered Growth Development. From these three alternative scenarios was developed the
proposed Preferred Growth Scenario. The Preferred Scenario uses attributes from all three
alternatives. The Preferred Scenario is the basis of this General Plan.

Population Projections
The 1983 General Plan indicated that the City had over 7,500 vacant residentially zoned lots.
Projected growth in this current plan was more aggressive than reality with projections of over
13,000 people by 1990 (about a 21 percent increase over a ten-year span). In actuality,
population grew by about 1,300 people at a rate of about 11 percent for that ten-year period.
The City’s biggest growth period was between 2000 and 2010 with a growth of 16 percent
during this ten-year period. However, due to the overall economic decline in recent years, the
City has actually lost population over the five-year period between 2010 and 2015. However,
more recent economic improvements will tend to result in increased population growth over
the next five years and beyond. In the long term, population is expected to increase over the
2040 General Plan horizon by about 1.4 percent annually. Based on current birth, death and
immigration rates, the population in Clearlake will exceed an estimated 21,000 residents by
2040 as illustrated in Table 2.1.

Economic Projections
Based on the 2015 General Plan Land Use Analysis, conducted by Economic Planning Systems
(EPS) and Price Consulting Services, there is a potential future development within the City of
over 682,000 more square feet of commercial development. This would approximately double
the amount of commercial building in Clearlake. Clearlake experienced a 23 percent increase in
job growth between 2002 and 2010. However, this job growth trend is expected to be slightly
reduced over the next twenty-five years. Based on the General Plan Preferred Growth
Scenario, EPS projected job growth to be reduced over the long term from 2.85% annually to
about 1.1% annually. Realized job growth between 2010 and 2014 is projected to increase
from 2,675 jobs to 3,724 jobs by 2040, an increase of 1,049 jobs. This growth rate does
consider both development of existing vacant land and redevelopment of existing underutilized
properties.

Growth Accommodations
EPS conducted an analysis of the land use mix developed from the 2040 Land Use Map. Based
on projected growth rates to the 2040 General Plan Buildout Time Horizon, it is estimated that
an additional 2,314 housing units will be developed, 682,944 square feet of commercial
building area will be developed, and 1,049 more jobs will be created. EPS concluded that the
2040 Land Use Map provides sufficient land use and acreage to accommodate this growth and
that the land use mix identified in the Land Use Map adequately provides for additional
economic development opportunities beyond 2040 (for more details see Chapter 11 of the
General Plan Background Report).
G.      Preferred Growth Scenario for 2040
The Preferred Growth Scenario for 2040 reflects a combination of all of the proposed growth
alternatives identified in Chapter 2 of the General Plan Background Report regarding the
planning and public participation process. This scenario emphasizes design concepts from the
Infill and Redevelopment Alternative and the Clustered Growth Development Alternative.
It focuses specific development characteristics into nine key growth areas (as referenced in
Figure 2.1):
       Austin Park
       Olympic Drive Corridor (from Austin Park to State Route 53)
       Lakeshore Drive Corridor (from Old Highway 53 to Austin Park)
       Gateway at State Route 53 intersection with Lakeshore Drive
       The Avenues
       Regional Shopping Center (Wal-Mart/Airport Area)
       Ogulin Canyon Industrial Center (northeastern corner of the City)
       Agricultural Areas
       Southeast Clearlake Specific Plan
The Preferred Scenario directly influences future land use allocation with specific proposed
circulation improvements and recommendations for distribution of future employment needs
in each area of focused growth. Each key growth area is designed to meet future community
needs and is proposed to act as one piece of a comprehensive plan, which, when combined, can
work to achieve the community’s desired long-term vision.
Details of the Preferred Scenario, including how each Key Growth Area is envisioned to develop
is presented in Chapter 3, Land Use Element.

H.      Environmental Review
An Environmental Impact Report (EIR) was prepared for this General Plan Update project
pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The EIR assesses the
environmental effects associated with implementation of the proposed Preferred Growth
Scenario and related supporting documents in the General Plan. It also addresses related
anticipated future discretionary actions and approvals, such as the amendment to the Sphere
of Influence. The six main objectives of this document as established by CEQA are:
       To disclose to decision-makers and the public the significant environmental effects of
        proposed activities.
       To identify ways to avoid or reduce environmental damage.
       To prevent environmental damage by requiring implementation of feasible alternatives
        or mitigation measures.
       To disclose to the public reasons for agency approval of projects with significant
        environmental effects.
       To foster interagency coordination in the review of projects.
       To enhance public participation in the planning process.
Under CEQA, a significant impact on the environment is defined as a substantial, or potentially
substantial, adverse change in any of the physical conditions within the area affected by the
project, including land, air, water, minerals, flora, fauna, ambient noise and objects of historic
and aesthetic significance. Implementation of the General Plan Update, in combination with
long-term, region-wide growth and development, has the potential to generate environmental
impacts in a number of areas. The Plan has been developed to be self-mitigating, and, as a
result, there are very few significant impacts that would occur solely on the basis of
implementation of the proposed Plan.

provisions for increased services and the corresponding facilities and
personnel (police, fire, EMS, code enforcement, etc.), and heightened
demands for civic spaces and quality of life amenities (parks, trails, community and recreation
centers, cultural and entertainment venues). All these will be expected while also protecting
and improving the value and integrity of existing neighborhoods and aiming to preserve the
community’s identity and small town atmosphere.
The forthcoming growth also provides a great opportunity for the City and its residents to cast a
vision through this General Plan, and then put in place the policies, practices, and regulatory
instruments to facilitate its successful implementation. In this context, this chapter assumes
essential importance. The policies and strategies outlined here, together with the revision of
the zoning ordinance (and subsequent, warranted revisions to the land development
regulations), will guide the type, pattern, and character of future development. The decisions
that are made through this plan will have long-lasting and significant effects on the quality and
sustainability of the community and its development.

Land Use Element Purpose
The Land Use Element serves as the long-range planning guide for development in the City by
indicating the location and extent of development to be allowed.
More than any other element, the Land Use Element will have a major impact on the form and
character of Clearlake over the next twenty-five years. Through the implementation of the
Land Use Element, the City seeks to accomplish the following:
       Establish and maintain an orderly pattern of development in the City;
       Establish a land use classification system that embraces and implements land use
        policies;
       Identify acceptable land uses and their general location; and
       Establish standards for residential density and non-residential building intensity for
        existing and future development.
Compliance with State Law
California Government Code Section 65302 (a) requires “land use” among the mandatory
general plan elements. The law requires a land use element that designates the general
distribution, location, and extent of the uses of land for housing, business, industry, open space
(including agriculture, natural resources, recreation, and enjoyment of scenic beauty),
education, public buildings and grounds, solid and liquid waste disposal facilities, and other
public and private uses.
Background Information
Complete background information on land use as it pertains to the General Plan is referenced in
Chapter 4 of the General Plan Background Report. Given the above, the Land Use Element
establishes the necessary policy guidance that will enable the City to plan effectively for future
growth and development, while keeping in mind the existing land use context. Continuous and
sound planning is essential to ensure that Clearlake is not only prepared for serving the
anticipated infrastructure needs, but also prepared to preserve and enhance its community
character.
Goals/Policies
The policies and guidance of this chapter, together with the Future Land Use and Growth Plan,
will aid the decisions of the Planning Commission and City Council. To ensure the outcomes
envisioned and expressed by this General Plan, it is important to follow the guiding principles
and policies set forth in this and the remaining elements of the plan. Significant land use

decisions may include those that affect the City’s corporate boundaries (also the City’s Sphere
of Influence), such as a determination of consistency of zone change requests with the land use
plan (and corresponding zoning map), requests for service or infrastructure extensions outside
of the City limits or in an area not contemplated for development by this plan (such as the Area
of Concern), review of tentative maps, or amendments to the implementing regulations, among
many others (refer to Figure 3.1).
B.      Context
It is important to first understand the community context before establishing a plan for the
future. This section recognizes Clearlake’s place and role in the larger region, together with the
assets and constraints of its natural and built environments. These are described in further
detail below.
                Figure 3.1. Planning Area and 2040 Sphere of Influence, Clearlake
Clearlake was developed as an unincorporated residential community of Lake County until
incorporated in November, 1980. It was essentially developed to provide affordable housing to
support the resort economy of the Lake in the 1960s and 1970s. The community can be
characterized as a resort service community along the west side of Highway 53, where there is
a mix of commercial and residential. The east side of Highway 53, prior to the development of
the Clearlake Shopping Center, is characterized as more rural consisting of primarily small
                                                        Clearlake General Plan Update       25
                                                                                   Final

residential homes, including a large number of mobile homes and manufactured houses,
sporadically built along primarily dirt roads. Almost half of the City’s circulation system is
composed of unimproved streets. Also, over half the City is encumbered with vacant land.
These two factors contribute to the City’s rural character. It is evident that during the Clearlake
community’s initial planning, that the County felt that strict zoning and building requirements
were not needed or appropriate. As a result, the backbone of a public services system, such as
paved streets, public water and sewer systems, is absent in many areas of the City. Since its
incorporation, the City continues to struggle with making needed infrastructure improvements
and expanding public services to create its own identity.
Prior to the 1970s, new residents were drawn to Clearlake because of its tranquility and its slow
pace of life. The natural setting, between the lake to the west and the lava and oak and pine
covered hills to the east, creates a natural setting that is extremely attractive. Because of the
varied topography, many sites in Clearlake command mountain or lake views. Although much
of the City has been subdivided (allowing for lots as narrow as 25 feet), the actual built density
is about four units per acre, with most of the lots remaining undeveloped. This low density has
helped preserve vegetation and vistas and contributes to the City’s rural flavor.
C.       Enhancing Community Character
Through community dialogue, residents voiced the importance of preserving the character and
integrity of existing neighborhoods, while also providing for quality, livable neighborhood
environments. In particular, the uniqueness of the original town neighborhoods warrants
standards that permit new investment and reinvestment in ways that embrace its genuine,
traditional character. In other words, building additions or infill construction must be cohesive
in their scale and design so as not to disrupt the neighborhood fabric. At the same time, the
vitality of the established areas must be stabilized and strengthened to sustain their economic
and cultural values. In the same way, structural alterations and use conversions must occur in a
sensitive, compatible manner, or not occur at all. This may be handled through the
development of applicable standards and then effective administration and enforcement.
There are notable differences in the character of the traditional and more contemporary
neighborhoods. Both provide nice, livable environments that offer choice in neighborhood
settings and home styles, sizes, prices, and amenities. With the impending growth that has the
potential to greatly affect, if not transform, the future community character, the City has a
window of opportunity to determine the type and quality of new development. This may be
achieved through the general plan policies and more specifically, by new or revised standards
of the zoning code and related development standards and guidelines. Without a proactive
stance the quality of development will be left to market decisions that may not mirror the City’s
expectations.

As articulated during the public participation program, there is an emphasis to focus growth
into nine key growth areas, which became the Preferred Growth Scenario described as follows
(refer to Figure 3.2):
       Austin Park
       Olympic Drive Corridor (from Austin Park to State Route 53)
       Lakeshore Drive Corridor (from Old Highway 53 to Austin Park)
       Gateway at State Route 53 intersect with Lakeshore Drive
       The Avenues
       Regional Shopping Center (Wal-Mart/Airport Area)
       Ogulin Canyon Industrial Center (northeastern corner of the City)
       Agricultural Area
       Southeast Clearlake Specific Plan
The Zoning Code and Design Standards, prepared subsequent to the General Plan Update, will
be developed around specific directions identified for each of these key growth areas more fully
described in Chapter 15 of the General Plan Background Report.

Among the considerations in the design of new neighborhoods and infill of existing
neighborhoods is the following:
•       Their location relative to existing development. This relates to the continuity of the
        street and pedestrian system as a means for achieving a walkable community, as well as
        the character transition and the means of compatibility within and between
        developments.
•       The style and form of development, meaning the patterns and arrangement of streets
        and lots, the amount and treatment of open space, the mixture of uses and housing
        types, and the sizes and variations in lots and home sites.
•       The layout of individual lots (widths and depths) and block frontages with respect to the
        placement and patterns of driveways, the location(s) of garages (front/side loaded,
        attached/detached, and street/alley access), handling of on- and off-street parking, and
        the setbacks and spacing between homes.
•       The design of individual homes concerning their heights, rooflines, façade treatments,
        and mixture of material types.
•       The aesthetic treatments relating to the street and pedestrian environments, common
        and private landscaping, design and materials, fences and screening walls, and the
        integration of amenities (parks, civic and open spaces, wetlands, trails and greenways,
        lakes, etc.).
       Maintaining views and access to the lake and surrounding open space.
While each of these contribute to the character and appearance of neighborhoods, the
standards for realizing them must be cognizant of market conditions and, therefore, be both
suitable and reasonable for Clearlake. It is the purpose of this plan to emphasize the
community’s consensus for realizing quality development, with the appropriate standards to be
determined during the plan implementation phase.
D.      Defining Land Uses
The Future Land Use and Growth Plan is an important planning tool for the City to manage the
type, pattern, and scale of future development. The plan is to be used to guide decisions
relating to zone change requests. The plan will also be used to determine the requisite
transportation improvements and capacity requirements for the water and wastewater systems
and other public facility and service provisions.
                                                          Clearlake General Plan Update    29
                                                                                   Final

                                                                    Final
The land use designations reflected on the plan directly correspond with the districts of the
future new zoning code. In this way, the intended character of development that is expressed
by this plan will be directly implemented by the zoning ordinance. This assures quality,
sustainable development that is compatible with the existing adjacent uses. The Preferred
Land Use Scenario is represented in the General Plan Land Use Map (refer to Figure 3.3).
E.       Character Based Land Use and Zoning System
The current 1983 General Plan and Zoning Code is primarily use-based, meaning that, together
with the zoning ordinance, they rely heavily on the use of land. Use-based land use and zoning
systems are constructed on the premise that uses can be arranged into a hierarchy, with the
“highest and best” use being single-family residential and the “lowest and worst” use being
heavy industry. These systems tend to separate residential uses by lot size, to “protect” large-
lot neighborhoods from neighborhoods with small lots. This system is relatively easy to
administer but can be inflexible. For example, minimum lot size requirements create incentive
to “pave over” undeveloped parcels in order to maximize development. Under this approach
use lists tend to get highly specific / complicated over time in order to carve out exceptions to
accommodate proposed developments. Use-based approaches are useful for controlling uses
that have essentially unavoidable impacts on abutting properties, such as heavy industry, waste
disposal, scrap yards, and intensive agriculture (e.g., concentrated animal feed operations).
On the other hand, a primarily character-based land use system, as proposed under this 2040
General Plan focuses on the relative relationship among the land areas that are used for
buildings, landscaping, and vehicular use. Rather than emphasizing the separation of uses into
different land use designations or zoning districts, a character-based system relies upon a mix
of open space and intensity controls to ensure that development within each district has a
predictable character. From a zoning perspective, the list of uses in character-based systems is
simplified compared to use-based systems.
Under the character-based land use system, development yield is driven by density or intensity
controls, open space, landscaping, design, and resource protection requirements. In the case of
Clearlake, the resource protection requirements, for example, may be used for the purpose of
storm drainage. Still relatively easy to administer because it provides the most flexibility with
respect to site design and development types and enhances opportunities for resource
protection (e.g. storm detention), due to as-of-right clustering and open space requirements.
A character-based land use system works well in “greenfields” and in built environments, where
flexibility is desired (e.g., to preserve natural resources and/or allow for variations in lot sizes
and housing types as-of-right) and acceptable levels of compatibility can be achieved primarily
through building scale and landscaping.
Under this approach, specific general plan land use designations become less important, relying
on the Zoning Code and Design Review criteria that establish development performance
standards based on the character of the use to address potential land use conflicts. For the
                                                          Clearlake General Plan Update      31
                                                                                    Final

Preferred Scenario, as referenced in the General Plan Land Use Map, the following land use
designations are provided:
Residential (3,902 acres)
Low Density (0-4 units per acre): 1,618 acres.
Medium Density (0-15 units per acre): 2,149 acres. The Zoning Code will establish some
maximum density standards in this category depending on specific neighborhood
characteristics and environmental constraints for various properties in this land use
designation.
High Density Residential (10-25 units per acre): 134 acres. The Zoning Map provides for a
minimum density of 16 units per acre on no more than 70 acres in accordance with State Law.
Mixed-Use (260 acres)
Allows a combination of residential and commercial uses.
Commercial (333 acres)
Allows primarily commercial and office uses.
Industrial (249 acres)
Allows primarily industrial and heavy commercial uses.
Specific Plan (1,018 acres)
Provides for a specified allocation of land uses in an integrated community plan.
Open Space (232 acres)
Provides for parks and recreation facilities, agriculture and open space.
In accordance with California Government Code Section 65960, the Zoning Code shall be
consistent with the General Plan. For the Land Use Element, this means that the base zoning
Districts, referenced in the Zoning Map, need to be consistent with the General Plan Land Use
Map. For example, a commercial zoning district needs to be located within areas designated in
the General Plan Land Use Map as being in a Commercial Land Use Designation. The
Government Code also indicates that the Zoning Map must be revised for consistency with the
General Plan following adoption of a new general plan.
                                                          Clearlake General Plan Update  32

The Zoning Code is expected to be updated in 2016-17, following adoption of the 2040 General
Plan. This amendment will involve a complete replacement of all base zoning districts that
currently exist so a new table will be created in the new Zoning Code that will define what
zoning districts will be considered consistent with the various General Plan Land Use
designations as referenced in the 2040 General Plan Land Use Map. In the meantime, however,
Table 3.1 provides a land use/zoning consistency matrix for the current Zoning Code:

The vision for the future recognizes population and economic growth that requires changes in
land use patterns, such as the establishment of mixed-use areas and concentration of growth
along Lakeshore Drive, Olympic Drive, Austin Park, Ogulin Canyon Industrial Center, the
Avenues, Regional Shopping Center, and a Gateway at Lakeshore Drive and State Route 53.
The vision calls for commensurate changes in the circulation system to enable the City to
maintain a high quality of life for its residents while promoting strategic residential and
commercial growth along transit corridors and key growth areas.
The following chapter presents a plan with goals, objectives, policies and programs developed
to address a multi-modal circulation network designed to establish connectivity throughout the
City, to promote auto independency, to promote safety for all users of the right-of-way, and
ultimately to increase the quality of road infrastructure. These policies link transportation
planning and land use planning to support effective multi-modal transportation networks that

connect people (not just automobiles) with desired destinations. The formulation of this
element was based primarily on existing best management practices and standards, community
input from outreach, and fieldwork.
Circulation Element Purpose
The Circulation Element addresses the movement of people, goods, and services within and
around the City. This Element contains goals, policies and programs that establish the City’s
circulation system to accommodate pedestrians, bicycles, motor vehicles, public transit, and
other means of travel. The Circulation Element is a framework for the development of the
City’s circulation improvement program. It becomes the foundation to enable the creation of a
Street Master Plan, Capital Improvement Program, and Developer Fee program.
Compliance with State Law
The Circulation Element is one of the seven mandatory elements of the General Plan, according
to Government Code §65302. State statute requires the Element to address major
thoroughfares, transportation routes, terminals, and other local public utilities and facilities.
Additionally, the statute requires the Circulation element to plan for a balanced, multi-modal
transportation network that meets the needs of all users of streets, roads, and highways. The
statute defines all users of streets, roads, and highways as “bicyclists, children, persons with
disabilities, motorists, movers of commercial goods, pedestrians, users of public transportation,
and seniors.” A multi-modal circulation network is critical for a city as it directly affects a
community’s social interaction, health, safety, economic environment, and physical
development patterns. These networks allow for all modes of travel including walking,
bicycling, and transit to be used to reach key destinations in a community and region safely and
directly. Furthermore, the Circulation Element must specifically provide the framework for
planning, designing, and building of complete streets, as mandated by the California Complete
Streets Act (AB1358) of 2008. To further comply with various planning provisions of State law,
the Circulation Element needs to provide a Circulation Plan for various levels of transportation,
including vehicular travel (including specifically truck routes), public transit, bicycles and
pedestrians. The proposed Circulation Element is limited to presenting general goals,
objectives, policies and programs.
Internal Consistency
The Circulation Element has been designed to be consistent with and directly related to other
elements of the General Plan. In particular, the Future Land Use Plan, presented in Chapter 3,
Land Use Element. This Chapter describes the improvements that will be needed to
accommodate growth and land uses depicted in the Land Use Element. Since traffic levels on
the circulation system are one of the major generators of noise, the Circulation Element is also
related to the Noise Element of the General Plan. Traffic safety is an important concern of the
Circulation Element as are the policies in the Safety and Public Facilities Elements: Chapters 9
                                                         Clearlake General Plan Update     50

and 12 of the General Plan, respectively. Factors of safety and seismic safety affect the location
and design of circulation infrastructure, both in terms of structural safety and the need for
evacuation and emergency routes.
Background Information
Complete background information on circulation as it pertains to the General Plan is referenced
in Chapter 5 of the General Plan Background Report. Given the above, this Circulation Element
establishes the necessary policy guidance that will enable the City to plan effectively for future
growth and development, while keeping in mind the existing land use and circulation context.
Goals/Policies
The policies and guidance of this chapter, together with the Future Land Use and Growth Plan,
will aid the decisions of the Planning Commission and City Council. To ensure the outcomes
envisioned and expressed by this General Plan, it is important to follow the guiding principles
and policies set forth in this and the remaining elements of the plan.
B.      Context
Multi-Modal Strategy
This Circulation Element includes all the State required topics that must be included in a
Circulation Element, in addition to identification of circulation challenges and potential
solutions to address them include the primary circulation system, the secondary circulation
system, and goals, policies, and programs. Clearlake’s’ circulation system in this General Plan is
designed to accommodate multiple methods of travel including automobile, pedestrian, bicycle,
and public transit. Such a strategy is often called “multi-modal.”
The City’s transportation planning will, therefore, encourage pedestrian and bicycle use.
Consequently, the City will not design roads simply to accommodate vehicular traffic during
peak demand periods. The City will design its circulation infrastructure to facilitate a more
sustainable proportion of vehicular and non-vehicular trip. The City will emphasize pedestrian
and bicycle safety over vehicular traffic flow and speed in the downtown area and residential
neighborhoods where higher pedestrian activity is expected.
Circulation Mapping
A series of Circulation Element maps are presented here that incorporate the City’s multi-modal
approach to circulation needs as follows:

Roadways
Functional classification designates all streets and highways within the City Limits and Sphere of
Influence (SOI). These categories include Expressway, Arterial, Collector, Minor Collector, and
Local streets. Each classification has specific standards and criteria through which design and
routes are developed. These criteria include:
       Existing and potential development and land use intensities as provided under the
        General Plan Land Use Map;
       Expected peak traffic loads;
       Potential physical improvements such as road widening; and
       Special designations such as scenic routes.
The Circulation Element and Map identifies all streets according to a classification system that is
consistent with national standards. This system also provides a framework for the planning of a
city-wide/area-wide transportation system. The Freeways and Expressways fall under the
jurisdiction of Caltrans and, hence, their construction standards are dictated by the policies and
standards of Caltrans. Additional definitions for the City’s Street Classification System are
summarized below: Expressways and/or Major Arterials: Have four lanes with restricted
driveway access, but with a mix of grade-separated interchanges and at-grade intersections.
Highway 53 is an Expressway (controlled and maintained by Caltrans)                 .
       Minor Arterials: Have two lanes that may be upgraded to an arterial in the future and
        usually limit on-street parking to maintain smooth flow. These include Lakeshore Drive,
        Olympic Drive, and Dam Road.
       Major Collectors: Have two lanes for carrying relatively low capacity at slower speeds
        and are used to connect neighborhoods, as well as arterials.
       Local Streets: Have two lanes that provide access for smaller residential subdivisions
        which are characteristic of low speed, low capacity roads that provide direct access to
        adjacent land uses and are typically meant only for local, as opposed to through traffic.
        Most of the Streets in Clearlake would qualify for this designation.

C.      Roadway Improvements
Levels of Service Standard
Level of Service (LOS) is a qualitative measure of traffic operating conditions, whereby a letter
grade “A” through “F” is assigned to an intersection or roadway segment representing
progressively worsening traffic conditions. Table 4.1 describes traffic characteristics for each
grade. In accordance with City Council Resolution 2009-25, the City maintains a LOS D or
better as the standard the City will strive to maintain for roadways and intersections.
Exceptions to the LOS D standard may be considered by the City Council where reducing level of
service would result in clear public benefit. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to:
circumstances where improvements necessary to achieve the LOS standard result in impact to a
unique historic resource; highly sensitive environmental area; infeasible right-of-way
acquisition; where an unusual physical constraint exists; and/or overriding economic or social
circumstances (refer to Circulation Element Policy CI 1.3.4).

                                F             Forced or Breakdown Flow
Actual methodology and criteria for determining the Level of Service Threshold will be made
through the development of Traffic Impact Study Guidelines (refer to Circulation Element
Program CI 1.3.4.1).
A 2040 General Plan Update Transportation Study was conducted for the General Plan Update
in October 2016 (with a supplemental study addressing impacts on the Olympic Drive corridor
in January 2017), concluding all City roadway sections and intersections currently operate at
acceptable levels (refer to Background Report which incorporates the city-wide transportation
study). Most roadways in the City can remain without significant upgrade. However, the
circulation improvements are identified as needed during the 2040 General Plan time horizon
to mitigate traffic impacts to an acceptable level of service:
       Roundabout at Dam Road and Damn Road Extension
       Extension of Airport Road to 18th Avenue (subject to further review by Caltrans)
       Capacity improvements to SR 53/18 th Avenue Intersection (subject to further review by
        Caltrans)
       Spruce Avenue Extensions
       Dam Road Extension
       Miscellaneous capacity improvements to SR53 as follows:
        o      SR 53/18th Avenue: Install eastbound left turn pocket
        o      SR 53/18th Avenue: Restripe westbound left-through to a left turn pocket
        o      SR 53/18th Avenue: Restripe westbound right turn pocket to a through-right
        o      SR 53/Old Highway53/Dam Road: Install westbound right turn pocket
D.      Truck Routes
Trucks play an important role in the movement of goods and the delivery of services. The
California Vehicle Code, Section 35701 grants local agencies the authority (by ordinance) to
establish Truck Routes. Many communities have established truck routes as a means of
reducing conflicts between incompatible uses. By prohibiting or restricting trucks from some
                                                          Clearlake General Plan Update  55
                                                                                   Final

residential streets, the noise, safety, and structural pavement deterioration problems caused by
trucks can be eliminated or minimized. At the same time, it is essential to ensure adequate
truck access to all commercial and industrial locations.
The federal Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 (STAA) has designated certain truck
routes through the State of California. Terminal Access (TA) routes are portions of State routes
or local roads that can accommodate STAA trucks (defined as truck tractor-semitrailer or
double) that conform to the requirements of the STAA.
Regulations establishing truck routes must not be so strict that they prohibit efficient
movement of trucks within and through the City. On the other hand, as the City and
neighboring communities continue to grow, the need for regulations prohibiting trucks from
interfering with residential livability will also continue to grow. Designated truck routes within
and through the City could include Highway 53, Lakeshore Drive, Olympic Drive, and Dam Road.
Figure 4.2 consists of a map of the City’s designated truck routes.

E.       Bicycle and Pedestrian Circulation
Providing a safe and convenient system for bicycle and pedestrian circulation is an important
concern of the Circulation Element. Clearlake’s neighborhoods and business districts are, and
will continue to be, served by a system of on and off-street pedestrian and bicycle routes. The
bicycle and pedestrian path system is intended to connect all areas of the community to all
major destinations.
Future development of sidewalks, bicycle/pedestrian paths, and/or bicycle lanes should be
included in the Revised Circulation Element. Paths should be used in areas where there are
opportunities in the same corridor to circulate pedestrians and cyclists.
Senate Bill 277 (Statutes of 1975) established the California Bikeways Act. The Act includes
provisions requiring Caltrans to establish “recommended minimum general design criteria for
the development, planning, and construction of bikeways …“ Also, Assembly Bill 1358 (Statutes
of 2008), the California Complete Streets Act, requires the City to incorporate new provisions
for multi-modal transportation, such as bicycle and pedestrian facilities, into the Circulation
Element.
Bicycle Travel
Unlike pedestrian travel, bicycle travel is linked directly to roadways, often with limited or no
separation from vehicular travel. Safety is, therefore, one of the most important aspects to
consider when planning bicycle facilities. Most bikeway-related accidents occur because of
unsafe or illegal practices by bicyclists, which are usually compounded by poor road conditions,
and motorists who are not aware of bicyclists. The leading violations of bicyclists are 1) riding
on the wrong side of the road; 2) failure to yield when entering the roadway; 3) failure to obey
traffic signs and signals; and 4) riding at night without lights.
Bikeway Designations
The term “Bikeway” is used to define all facilities that explicitly provide for bicycle travel. The
Department of Transportation has developed different definitions that are used to
systematically categorize different types of bicycle facilities. Bikeways, then, can be anything
from fully grade-separated facilities to, simply, signed streets. The three classes of bikeways
are Bike Paths (Class I), Bike Lanes (Class II), and Bike Routes (Class III). Please also refer to
Figure 4.3, which cross references cross section designs of each of these types of bike paths.
        Bike Paths (Class I): Class I Bike Paths are completely separated rights-of-way
         designated for the exclusive use of bicycles. Cross-flows by pedestrians and motorized
         vehicles are minimized. Currently, there are no designated Class I bike paths in
         Clearlake.
                                                            Clearlake General Plan Update    58
                                                                                     Final

 Bike Lanes (Class II): Class II Bike Lanes are restricted rights-of-way designated for the
  exclusive or semi-exclusive use of bicycles. Travel by motor vehicles or pedestrians is
  not allowed; however, vehicle parking may be allowed if there is sufficient space
  available for both the bicycle lane and the parking lane. Cross flows by motorists are
  allowed, for example, to gain access to parking facilities or adjacent land uses. In most
  cases, Class II Bikeways require a lane of at least four feet of well-maintained pavement
  for the cyclist to ride on.
 Bike Routes (Class III): Class III Bike Routes are shared rights-of-way either on the street
  or on the sidewalk, and are designated by signs placed on vertical posts or markings
  stenciled on the pavement. Any bikeway which shares a through-traffic right-of-way
  with motor vehicles and pedestrians is considered a Class III bikeway.
 Bike Routes (Class IV): Class IV Bike Routes are separated from the vehicular travel area
  of the street. They are identified in the Caltrans Highway Design Manual (but not
  included in details of the General Plan).

Pedestrian Orientation
Sidewalks provide a relatively safe area for pedestrian movement because they are separated
from most other forms of transportation. According to the CalPoly Team sidewalk survey,
conducted in 2012, only one percent of the City’s properties include sidewalk improvements.
The majority of residential neighborhoods lack sidewalks, and major arterials are missing
sidewalks as well. The majority of sidewalks are present along roads in front of public parks and
schools. Recent large-scale commercial centers have sidewalk infrastructure, as well. Without
adequate sidewalks, pedestrians are forced to move onto the street, potentially placing the
pedestrian in harm’s way and at risk of collision with a motor vehicle or bicycle. Therefore,
there is a drastic need to install sidewalks throughout the City to safely link neighborhoods and
community centers.
Consistent with recent legislation under the American Disabilities Act (ADA), all existing and
planned pedestrian improvements should allow access to all people and comply with the design
guidelines as set forth within the Act. The first priority access for sidewalk improvements
should be near schools and school bus stops. Sidewalk improvements should be constructed in
these areas first if capital improvement projects are undertaken by the City or if assessment
districts are formed. Assessment districts and capital improvement projects for other purposes,
such as street widening, may include the installation of curbs, gutters, and sidewalks. The
second priority areas for sidewalk improvements shall be in commercial districts. A
considerable network of sidewalks exists in commercial areas of the City. To further encourage
and enhance pedestrian circulation, conditional approval of any development proposal by the
Planning Commission and City Council needs to include a requirement that the applicant install
curbs, gutters, and sidewalks where they do not currently exist. To provide easier access for
wheelchairs, city standards, consistent with ADA requirements, call for ramps at all street
corners. In combination with needed sidewalks, there is a need to provide trail connections
between neighborhoods and regional trails.

Lake County and the City have an interconnected trail system that links neighborhoods to larger
walking trails. The Konocti Regional Trails Plan (KRTP), adopted by Lake County in 2010,
provides a long-range plan to establish a network of trails throughout the county, including
Clearlake, that serves a range of users such as road bicyclists, mountain bicyclists, hikers,
pedestrians, individuals in wheelchairs and strollers, skaters, dog walkers, horseback riders,
kayakers, canoeists, and rowers. As referenced in this General Plan, the KRTP has been used as
a guide to interconnect the regional trails systems to the City’s through the General Plan Trails
Plan. Figure 4.5 consists of the City’s Trails Map that includes linkages to schools and the
greater regional trails system.
F.       Transit Bus Service
The main transit system in Clearlake is the public bus system operated by Lake Transit Authority
(LTA). The objective of LTA is to provide public transit services throughout Lake County. The
City is served by two local bus routes 5 and 6. LTA offers Clearlake Dial-A-Ride, which provides
curb-to-curb service. LTA also offers “Flex Stop” service for passengers eligible for American
Disabilities Act (ADA) paratransit service who reside in areas that are not served by Dial-A-Ride.
Flex Stop services accommodate these travelers by traveling up to one mile off the regular bus
route.
Route 5-Clearlake City, North Loop Route 5 had annual ridership of 89,480 in the 2011/12
period, an increase of 16.2 percent from the previous year. Route 5 provides local hourly
service in Clearlake in a figure-eight configuration, running along Woodland Community
College, Clearlake Shopping Center, Redbud Hospital, Austin Park, Clearlake Park, and Burns
Valley Mall.
Route 6-Clearlake City, South Loop Route 6 had annual ridership of 64,750 in 2011/12, an
increase of 16.5 percent from the previous year. Route 6 also operates locally in the opposite
direction as Route 5 and runs by Woodland Community College, Burn Valley Mall, Redbud
Hospital, Social Services, and Lower Lake High School.
Dial-A-Ride (DAR) Lake Transit offers Clearlake and Lower Lake Dial-A-Ride service during the
same days and hours as the local bus routes. DAR provides curb-to-curb service for the general
public, but prioritizes service for elderly and disabled persons. DAR service is provided based
on demand.
Flex Stop Flex Stop is available for passengers eligible for ADA paratransit in areas that are not
covered by Dial-A-Ride. The bus will travel up to one mile off its regular route to provide Flex
Stop service at the curb.
Public transit improvements, including bus stops and pullouts, should be focused in the
downtown and the Clearlake Shopping Center areas. Details of these routes are described as
follows and as referenced in the Transit Map (refer to Figure 4.6).

G.      Complete Streets
“Complete streets” are those designed to support safe, attractive, and comfortable access and
travel for all users, whether in motor vehicles, on foot, on bicycle, or using the public transit.
The City will require complete streets in all new neighborhoods and will improve existing
streets to be more complete in accommodating bicycle and pedestrian movements, as funding
is available. Improvements required for complete streets depend on the type of street. While
all streets will be required to have sidewalks for pedestrians, the required bicycle
improvements will vary.
H.      Street Patterns
A community’s street and block pattern defines the usefulness of its transportation network for
multi-modal mobility. The 2040 General Plan requires that development within new growth
areas be served by a well-connected street pattern with small blocks and few or no cul-de-sacs.
As future development occurs, the layout of Clearlake’s’ new streets and blocks will significantly
improve the efficiency of the City’s circulation system for all modes of travel.
The traditional grid street pattern is one approach for ensuring a highly connected
neighborhood. However, modifications to the grid pattern could also provide a highly
connected transportation network. In general, highly connected street patterns characterized
by:
       A dense system of parallel routes, both east-west and north-south, with many streets
        providing through connections;
       Minimal use of cul-de-sacs;
       Frequent intersections; and,
       Frequent points of access

5.      CONSERVATION                                                          Programs
A.      Introduction
Conservation Element
The Conservation Element describes water, forests, soils, rivers, harbors, fisheries, wildlife,
minerals, cultural resources, and other natural resources. This element provides direction
regarding the protection, management, and careful utilization of natural resources within a
community and surrounding area.
Compliance with State Law
California state law does not mandate the implementation of a Conservation Element as a
chapter within the General Plan. Therefore, this element is considered an optional element.
Stipulated by California Government Code Section 65303, a city or county may adopt “any
elements or address any other subjects, which, in the judgment of the legislative body, relate to
the physical development of the county or city.”
Purpose of the Element
The Conservation Element addresses the natural and cultural resources of Clearlake and the
region in consideration of future community development. Specific measures and programs
have been developed in this element to address challenges and conservation of geologic,
minerals, soils, water, air and cultural.
                                                       Clearlake General Plan Update       79
                                                                                 Final

Background Information
Complete background information on conservation as it pertains to the General Plan is
referenced in Chapter 7 of the General Plan Background Report. Given the above, this
Conservation Element establishes the necessary policy guidance that will enable the City to plan
effectively for future growth and development, while conserving important environmental
resources.
B.      Context
Geology and Minerals
Contamination from the sulfur mercury mine and other mining activities have left long lasting
contamination problems in Clearlake’s waterways, water resources, and the ecosystems that
depend on them. The community should consider both the costs and benefits of continued
mining activities, and continue to focus efforts on cleaning up contaminated areas. Geologic
characteristics should also be considered when determining appropriate places for
development while attention should be given to seismic activity and areas within proximity to
other hazards.
Soils
Soils are a critical component to the ecological function of a habitat, providing nutrients to
plants and wildlife, and the foundation for future growth and development. The City of
Clearlake should pay particular attention to the condition of soils and manage erosion and lake
sedimentation. Issues of concern include septic tank ground water infiltration, sediment
erosion, ambient air quality due to excess dust, and soil stability. All future development
should consider soil capacity to manage and mitigate potential risks.
Water
Issues of water quality due to nutrient contamination and storm water runoff remain a problem
in Clearlake and Lake County. The City should continue to focus efforts on regional watershed
management, as the health of Clear Lake is affected by activities outside of the City. A regional
approach to watershed management will help coordinate local efforts to manage runoff,
address inadequate wastewater disposal, and continue to measure and monitor nutrient levels
contributing to algae growth. As the City decides the future of growth and development, water
supply will also be a topic of concern. Landscaping, road paving, and new development put
stress on water resources. The supply of water is sufficient, but as population grows and land
use patterns shift, it will be necessary to consider the added stress that new development will
put on water demand and quality.
                                                         Clearlake General Plan Update     80
                                                                                  Final

Air Quality
While air quality is not a problem for the City presently, good air quality is one of the
community’s favorite aspects of living in Clearlake. This high standard of air quality should be
maintained and the City should continue to provide air quality warnings during periods of
wildfire to ensure that individuals avoid exposure to harmful particulate matter. As climate
change regulations are developing within the state, the City will need to consider performing a
greenhouse gas emissions inventory and adopting a greenhouse gas emissions reduction target.
This will place the City on par with state efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help
mitigate the human impact on climate change.
Biological Resources
The City is fortunate to have such an abundant source of biodiversity within its city limits and
nearby surrounding areas. Being within close proximity to the Anderson Marsh State Historical
Park and McVicar Wildlife Sanctuary, the City should explore ways in which to complement
these wildlife protection areas and increase public awareness of the surrounding ecosystem.
Several community members mentioned the need for eco-tourism and environmental
education centers which would act as a source of informational recreation for residents and
visitors. Urban development can pose a threat to habitat and wildlife health. The City should
work with local residents and business owners to address health issues affecting the
community and to develop strategies to maintain a healthy ecosystem into the future.
Cultural Resources
Recognizing the importance of cultural resources in the region, the City entered into a
Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the Koi Nation of Northern California (KNNC) on
August 28, 2014. The MOA memorializes the City’s policy of respecting the City’s rich cultural
heritage and provides a pro-active approach to preserving these resources by formalizing a
collaborative effort between the City and KNNC for consultation on development projects
received by the City for processing. In addition, the MOA provides for additional collaborative
preservation work, such as developing a cultural resources management plan among other
things. The City has also established Tribal Consultation Procedures within the City’s
Environmental Guidelines to provide the opportunity for tribes, including the KOI, Elem and
Middletown Rancheria, to consult with the City over projects to evaluate impacts on tribal
cultural resources in accordance with Assembly Bill 52.

A.      Introduction
The most attractive attribute of the City is the visual open space of the lake, surrounding hills
and mountains. Other open space includes active space for recreation, passive open space for
visual enhancement and related connections, such as trails and sidewalks. In combination,
open spaces throughout the City and surrounding areas serve to help define Clearlake’s rural
character. For the purposes of the Open Space Element, specific open space features
addressed are:
       Open space for the preservation of natural resources, such as the lake, Borax Lake and
        Anderson Marsh.
       Open space for outdoor recreation such as parks, beaches, and trail head access.
       Open space for public health and safety including wildland fire fuel break areas.
Active open space for recreation and parks in Clearlake includes three neighborhood parks:
Austin Park, Highlands Park, and Redbud Park. These parks total approximately 40 acres, which
equates to 2.60 acres per 1,000 people (refer to Figure 6.1). The National Recreation and Park
Association (NRPA) standard for providing active parks is 3 acres per 1,000 population for
neighborhood parks and 2 acres per 1,000 for community parks, resulting in an overall standard
of 5 acres per 1,000 population. This standard was developed on a nationwide basis looking at
the number of people living within a given area and the park and recreation facilities offered.

Passive open space for the management of natural resources includes scenic places, agricultural
lands, and wilderness. Scenic places in the City are identified as city parks, vistas from the
parks, State Route 53 and Lakeshore Drive scenic drives, view corridors from Lakeshore Drive,
“glimpses” of the lake, Clear Lake, Borax Lake, and Anderson Marsh Historic State Park.
The active agricultural lands consist of 466 acres, clustered on the northeast side of Clearlake.
Wilderness areas in Clearlake are predominantly located outside the City boundary to the east,
which consists of hills, vegetation, and wildlife habitats.
Compliance with State Law
The Open Space Element is one of the seven mandatory elements of the General Plan,
according to Government Code §65302.
Purpose of the Element
The Open Space Element guides the comprehensive and long-range preservation and
conservation of open space in the City. This element provides direction regarding the
management of the City’s open space programs.
Background Information
Complete background information on open space as it pertains to the General Plan is
referenced in Chapter 8 of the General Plan Background Report. Given the above, this Open
Space Element establishes the necessary policy guidance that will enable the City to plan
effectively for future growth and development, while conserving and preserving essential open
space features of Clearlake.
B.      Context
Clear Lake is valued as the most important landscape feature of the City of Clearlake. The City
is particularly concerned with its quality and odor. As part of the passive open space
management program for the City, Clear Lake is a focal point for natural resource
enhancement. It is important to maintain the quality of life for the community and to attract
tourism through measures to clean up the lake. Through the development of an Integrated
Regional Water Management Plan, as well as the Lake County Water Management Program,
practices and community education and outreach regarding water issues will need to be
addressed and coordinated. Maintaining public access to Clear Lake is also important.
Although many of the properties adjacent to the lake are private, the desire for both residents
and visitors to enjoy the lake is critical. Protection of the lake’s view through the placement of
buildings, land use, and other standards, is also an important community priority. Other
consideration has been the geographic location of the City’s parks to serve residents. All of the
City’s parks are located on the west side of town oriented to the lake. Areas to the east are

underserved by parks with much of the City’s residents having to travel across Highway 53 for
park access.
Based on a review of the City’s 2003-13 Parks Master Plan and considering the NRPA standard,
the General Plan goal is to strive to develop between four and five acres of parks per 1,000
residents. This equates to the City providing an additional between 63.69 and 106.15 acres of
park land by 2040 (see Table 6.1).

Figure 6.2 consists of the City’s Parks Map that identifies three community parks (active open
space parks of between 10 and 30 acres each park), providing between 50 and 65 acres of
active open space needed to achieve this General Plan Goal. In addition, a number of
neighborhood parks (generally less than 10 acres each) need to be provided over the 2040
General Plan time horizon. These additional neighborhood level parks need to be provided
based on an updated Parks Master Plan to coincide with the 2040 General Plan.

The Open Space Element addresses both passive and active uses of trails. The trails addressed
in this section fall into both of these categories and can be developed as earthen, paved, or
water trails, which are unique to Clearlake and Lake County. The facilities and support
structure for trail types differ greatly and are evaluated for both opportunities and constraints
in this section. Figure 6.3 presents the City’s trails plan that incorporates trail plans from the
Konocti Regional Trails Master Plan, Regional Transportation Plan and City’s Circulation
Element.

7.      NOISE AND VIBRATION
A.      Introduction
Noise Element
Noise is defined as unwanted sound. There is a consideration of actual noise and the
community’s perception of noise. Noise can be subdivided into two main categories: noise
receptors and noise producers. The key definitions in Table 7.1 are compiled from federal and
state legislation and standards.
 Table 7.1. Key Noise Definitions
                A unit of measure describing the amplitude of sound, equal to 20 times the logarithm
 Decibel, dB    to the base 10 of the ratio of the pressure of the sound measures to the reference
                pressure, which is 20 micropascals (20 micronewtons per square meter).
                The “A-weighted” scale for measuring sound in decibels weighs or reduces the effects
                of low and high frequencies in order to simulate human hearing. Every increase of
 dBA
                10 dBA doubles the perceived loudness though the noise is actually ten times more
                intense.
                Community Noise Equivalent Level. The average equivalent A-weighted sound level
                during a 24-hour day, obtained after addition of five decibels to sound levels in the
 CNEL
                evening from 7 p.m. to 10 a.m. and after addition of 10 decibels to sound levels in the
                night from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m.
                Day-Night Average Level. The average equivalent A-weighted sound level during a 24
 Ldn
                – hour day, obtained after the addition of 10 decibels to sound levels in the night after
                                                            Clearlake General Plan Update         111
                                                                                         Final

 Table 7.1. Key Noise Definitions
                10 p.m. and before 7 a.m. (CNEL and Ldn represent daily levels of noise exposure
                averaged on an annual or daily basis, while Leq represents the equivalent energy noise
                exposure for a shorter time period, typically one hour.)
                The sound level in decibels as measures on a sound level meter using the A-weighting
 A-Weighted     filter network. The A-weighting filter de-emphasizes the very low and very high
 Level          frequency components of the sound in a manner similar to the response of the human
                ear and gives good correlation with subjective reactions to noise.

  “General Plan Guidelines,” by Governor’s Office and Planning and Research, p. 244. The State of
 California, 2003
Compliance with State Law
The requirements in the California Government Code for this element are to identify and
appraise noise problems in the community as set out in the guidelines established by the Office
of Noise Control in the State Department of Health Services. As required by law, this chapter
will analyze and quantify current and projected noise levels for the following sources:
       Transportation Sources;
       Highways and freeways;
       Primary arterial and major local streets;
       Passenger and freight railroad operations;
       Non-Transportation Sources;
       Airports;
       Local industrial plants; and
       Other ground stationary sources identified by local agencies as contributing to the
        community noise environment.
The requirements for this element, while technical, serve as a guide for establishing a pattern of
land use that minimizes the exposure of community residents to excessive noise. Policies,
implementation measures, and mitigation options are presented in this chapter to address
existing and foreseeable problems.
Noise Element Purpose
The purpose of this general plan element is to provide a basis for comprehensive local policies
to control and abate environmental noise and to protect the citizens of Clearlake from
excessive noise exposure.
                                                             Clearlake General Plan Update       112
                                                                                        Final

       Provide sufficient information concerning the community noise environment so that
        noise may be effectively considered in the land use planning process.
       Develop strategies for abating excessive noise exposure through cost-effective
        mitigation measures, in combination with appropriate zoning, to avoid incompatible
        land uses.
       Protect those existing regions of the planning area whose noise environments are
        deemed acceptable, and also those locations throughout the community deemed
        “noise-sensitive.”
       Protect existing noise-producing commercial and industrial uses in the City of Clearlake
        from encroachment by noise-sensitive land uses.
       Protect the existing and future citizens of Clearlake from the harmful effects of exposure
        to excessive noise. More specifically, the goal is to protect existing noise-sensitive land
        uses from new uses that would generate noise levels that are incompatible with those
        uses, and to discourage new noise-sensitive land uses from being developed near
        sources of high noise levels.
       Protect the economic base of Clearlake by preventing the encroachment of noise-
        sensitive land uses into areas affected by existing noise-producing uses. More
        specifically, the goal is to recognize that noise is an inherent by-product of many land
        uses, including agriculture, and to prevent new noise-sensitive land uses from being
        developed in areas affected by existing noise-producing uses.
       Provide the City flexibility in the development of infill properties, which may be located
        in elevated noise environments.
       Provide sufficient noise exposure information so that existing and potential future noise
        impacts may be effectively addressed in the City’s land use planning and project review
        process.
Background Information
Complete background information on community noise as it pertains to the General Plan is
referenced in Chapter 9 of the General Plan Background Report. This section of the Background
Report also provides noise contour maps that show noise levels from mobile sources (primarily
vehicular traffic) measured by J.C. Brennan, Associates, a professional noise consultant take in
May 2016 and maps that project noise levels based on General Plan growth projections to the
year 2040. This section also identifies major stationary noise sources and sensitive receptors in
the City. Given the above, this Noise Element establishes the necessary policy guidance that
will enable the City to plan effectively around existing and anticipated noise.

Goals and Policies
The policies and guidance of this chapter, together with the Future Land Use and Growth Plan,
will aid the decisions of the Planning Commission and City Council.
B.       Context
Existing conditions identify a variety of main noise sources: traffic, animal nuisances, and lake
activity. Future development plans should reflect the careful consideration of land use choices
and sensitivity demands of such choices. The compatibility of land uses is important to plan for
current and future noise issues. Appropriate land uses should be located adjacent to the main
traffic corridors of SR 53 and Lakeshore Drive. By grouping commercial uses together, noise
levels can be contained to corridors and specific areas. Specific noise issues for the City include:
• Noise generated in Clearlake Shopping Center and the Safeway commercial centers.
• Noise impacts from increased traffic on Highway 53.
• Noise from animals, radios, and dirt bikes on residential areas.

C.       Goals, Objectives, Policies and Programs
Goal NO 1
A community with minimal exposure to excessive noise and/or vibration.
Objective NO 1.1
Separate land uses that are sensitive to noise and/or vibration from land uses that traditionally
produce high levels of noise
Policy NO 1.1.1
The City shall avoid placing noise and vibration generators next to sensitive land uses such as
residences, churches, schools, parks and hospitals.
Program NO 1.1.1.1
The City shall review noise impacts from projects that generate potentially excessive noises
through discretionary review procedures such as environmental review, design review and
conditional use permits. Noise mitigation measures may be required for projects that impact
new noise sensitive uses.
                                                        Clearlake General Plan Update         114
                                                                                    Final

Program NO 1.1.1.2
The City hereby establishes noise standards for new noise-producing uses or sensitive uses
affected by existing noise-producing uses. These standards are shown in Tables 9.2 (residential,
non-transportation noise) and Table 9.3 (all noise sources and sensitive land uses, as outlined).
The Table 9.2 standards are specifically applied to residential uses whereas the Table 9.3
standards apply to the various uses shown in Table 9.3.
Program NO 1.1.1.3
Where noise mitigation measures are required to satisfy the noise level standards of this Noise
Element, development standards for new commercial sites shall require the use of setbacks and
site design, and thereby keep the use of noise barriers at a minimum.
Program NO 1.1.1.4
When siting a new public park, the City shall consider separating the park from a noise-sensitive
area if intense activities are to occur in the park.
Program NO 1.1.1.5
For multifamily developments, exterior noise level standards can be applied for common
outdoor areas, such as a clubhouse, pool area, etc.
Program NO 1.1.1.6
The City shall require vibration analysis for uses that potentially generate substantial long-term
vibration. Appropriate mitigation as feasible, shall be provided to achieve vibration velocity
levels below the threshold of normal human perception, as experienced at habitable structures
of vibration-sensitive land uses. This standard does not apply to short-term construction
projects.
Program NO 1.1.1.7
The City of Clearlake shall establish standards for preparation of acoustical analysis based on
threshold requirements for projects. This analysis should include the following:
        Be prepared by qualified persons experienced in the fields of environmental noise
         assessment and architectural acoustics.
        Include representative noise level measurements with sufficient sampling periods and
         locations to adequately describe local conditions.
        Estimate projected future (twenty-year) noise levels, and compare those levels to the
         adopted policies of this general plan and adopted ordinance standards.

      Recommend appropriate mitigation to achieve compliance with the adopted policies
       and standards of this general plan and ordinance standards.
      Estimate interior and exterior noise exposure after the prescribed mitigation measures
       have been implemented. The City of Clearlake shall adopt a local amendment to the
       Building Code to address interior noise standards.
Program NO 1.1.1.8
Any noise regulations that are adopted or related requirements shall specifically exempt the
following (these shall serve as interim requirements until such time that the noise ordinance is
updated):
      Emergency warning devices and equipment operated in conjunction with emergency
       situations, such as sirens and generators which are activated during power outages. The
       routine testing of such warning devices and equipment shall also be exempt provided
       such testing occurs during daytime hours and does not occur for periods of more than
       one hour per week.
      Public events, such as school sporting events, festivals, and other similar community and
       temporary events.
      In the event of an emergency which requires prompt action to protect the public, or
       agricultural production, the City can exempt noise generated by such action from the
       provisions of this Element.
      Construction between the hours of 7 am and 7 pm Monday through Friday, and 8 am
       through 7 pm on Saturday. No construction on Sunday or legal holidays without prior
       approval from the Building Department. The City may allow construction between 7 pm
       and 7 am on any day if it can be demonstrated that noise will not adversely impact the
       neighborhood, or in the event of necessity as determined by the Building Official.
Program NO 1.1.1.9
Noise analyses prepared for multi-family residential projects, town homes, mixed-use projects,
condominiums, or other residential projects where floor/ceiling assemblies or party-walls are
common to different owners/occupants, shall address the State of California Noise Insulation
standards.

 Exterior noise level standard to be applied at the property line of the receiving land use or at a
 designated outdoor activity area (at the discretion of the Planning Director) of the new development.
 For mixed-use type projects, the exterior noise level standard may be waived (at the discretion of the
 Planning Director) if the project does not include a designated activity area and mitigation of property
 line noise is not practical. In this case, the interior standard would still apply.
 Interior noise level standards are applied within noise-sensitive areas of residential land uses, with
 windows and doors in the closed positions.
 Each of the exterior noise levels specified above shall be lowered by five dB for simple tone noises,
 noises consisting primarily of speech or music, or for recurring impulsive noises (e.g., humming
 sounds, outdoor speaker systems). These noise level standards do not apply to residential units
 established in conjunction with industrial or commercial uses (e.g., caretaker dwellings).
 The City can impose noise level standards that are more restrictive than those specified above based
 upon determination of existing low ambient noise levels. In situations where the existing ambient
 noise level exceeds the noise levels indicated in the above table, any new noise source must include
 mitigation that reduces the noise level of the noise source to the existing level plus 3 dB.
 Notes: Fixed noise sources which are typically of concern include, but are not limited to the following:
 Air Compressors                                        HVAC Systems                   Outdoor Speakers

  Outdoor activity areas for residential developments are considered to be the backyard patios or
decks of single-family dwellings, and the patios or common areas where people generally
congregate for multi-family development. The exterior noise standards shall not apply to small
individual patios of multi-family uses.
Outdoor activity areas for non-residential developments are considered to be those common areas
where people generally congregate, including pedestrian plazas, seating areas and outside lunch
facilities.
Where the location of outdoor activity areas is unknown, the exterior noise level standard shall be
applied to the property line of the receiving land use or at a distance of 100 feet from an existing or
proposed building envelope.

  Where it is not possible to reduce noise in outdoor activity areas to 60 dB L dn/CNEL or less using a
practical application of the best-available noise reduction measures, an exterior noise level of up to
65 dB Ldn/CNEL may be allowed provided that available exterior noise level reduction measures have
been implemented and interior noise levels are in compliance with this table.

  In the case of hotel/motel facilities or other transient lodging, outdoor activity areas such as pool
areas may not be included in the project design. In these cases, only the interior noise level criterion
will apply.
5
  Hospitals are often noise-generating uses. The exterior noise level standards for hospitals are
applicable only at clearly identified areas designated for outdoor relaxation by either hospital staff
or patients.
Note: Where a proposed use is not specifically listed on this table, the use shall comply with the
noise exposure standards for the nearest similar use as determined by the Planning Department.
Commercial and industrial uses have not been listed because such uses are not considered to be
sensitive to noise exposure.

Policy NO 1.1.2
The City should have the flexibility in its ordinance and policies to consider the application of
less restrictive exterior noise standards than those prescribed in Tables 7.2 or Table 7.3, in
cases where it is impractical or infeasible to reduce exterior noise levels within infill projects to
a state of compliance with their standards. In such cases, the rationale for such consideration
should be clearly presented and disclosure statements and noise easements should be included
as conditions of project approval.
Policy NO 1.1.4
The City should prevent encroachment of noise-sensitive uses.
Program NO 1.1.4.1
The City should establish sound wall regulations that address new residential developments
that are proposed adjacent to existing or proposed highways or major roads.
Program NO 1.1.4.2
Where noise mitigation measures are required to satisfy the noise level standards of this Noise
Element, development standards for new residential subdivisions, additional setbacks shall be
considered in addition to the sound barrier wall to further protect future residents.
Objective NO 1.2
Minimize impact of traffic noise along main transportation corridors.
Policy NO 1.2.1
The City shall adopt regulations that encourage the enforcement of state vehicle code
regulations limiting public exposure to noise from automobiles, trucks and motorcycles.
Program NO 1.2.1.1
The City shall designate specific truck routes to avoid interaction with sensitive land uses.
Program NO 1.2.1.2
The City shall designate reasonable commercial activity loading/unloading hours.
Program NO 1.2.1.3
The City shall establish and enforce noise regulations which set limits on intensity and hours of
truck routes within the City.

Policy NO 1.2.2
For City projects that involve capacity enhancing roadways, or the construction of new
roadways, an acoustical analysis shall be prepared. If the project would result in a significant
noise level increase, or if the project would cause noise levels to exceed the City’s noise
standards shown in Table 7.2, noise mitigation measures shall be considered to reduce traffic
noise levels.
Policy NO 1.2.3
The City shall consider use of noise-reducing pavement as mitigation for projects involving new
or expanded roadway projects.
Objective NO 1.3
Reduce noise related to construction activities.
Policy NO 1.3.1
The City shall update the Noise Ordinance. The new regulations should incorporate the
following provisions:
       Restrictions on construction hours of operation and deliveries so as not to disturb
        neighboring uses, particularly retail/mixed use and residential.
       Require construction projects that may generate excessive noise impacts to implement
        the following types of standard best management practices, as applicable, to reduce
        construction noise impacts to the extent feasible:
        Noise-generating construction activities, including truck traffic coming to and from the
        construction site for any purpose, shall be limited as specified in the Noise Ordinance.
        All equipment driven by internal combustion engines shall be equipped with mufflers,
        which are in good condition and appropriate for the equipment. The construction
        contractor shall utilize “quiet” models of air compressors and other stationary noise
        sources where technology exists. At all times during project grading and construction,
        stationary noise-generating equipment shall be located as far as practicable from
        sensitive receptors and placed so that emitted noise is directed away from residences.
        Unnecessary idling of internal combustion engines shall be prohibited. Construction
        staging areas shall be established at locations that will create the greatest distance
        between the construction-related noise sources and noise-sensitive receptors nearest
        the project site during all project construction activities, to the extent feasible.
        Neighbors located adjacent to the construction site shall be notified of the construction
        schedule in writing. The construction contractor shall designate a “noise disturbance
        coordinator” who will be responsible for responding to any local complaints about
                                                         Clearlake General Plan Update     120

        construction noise. The disturbance coordinator shall be responsible for determining
        the cause of the noise complaint (e.g., starting too early, poor muffler, etc.) and
        instituting reasonable measures as warranted to correct the problem. A telephone
        number for the disturbance coordinator shall be conspicuously posted at the
        construction site. Require new development to minimize vibration impacts to adjacent
        uses during demolition and construction. For sensitive historic structures, a vibration
        limit of 0.08 in/sec PPV (peak particle velocity) will be used to minimize the potential for
        cosmetic damage to the building. A vibration limit of 0.30 in/sec PPV will be used to
        minimize the potential for cosmetic damage at buildings of normal conventional
        construction
Objective NO 1.4
Keep noise levels below state and federal thresholds.
Policy NO 1.4.1
The City shall work with Caltrans to ensure that adequate noise studies are prepared and
locally-appropriate noise mitigation measures are implemented in State transportation projects
that may result in increased noise levels in Clearlake.
Program NO 1.4.1.1
Support noise‐compatible land uses along existing and future roadways, including County, State
and Federal routes.
Objective NO 1.5
Policy NO 1.5.1
Regulate long-term increases in ambient noise levels during review of development proposals.
For projects that are required by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) to analyze
noise impacts, the following criteria shall be used to determine the significance of those
impacts:
Stationary and Non-Transportation Noise Sources
       A significant impact may occur if the project results in an exceedance of the noise level
        standards contained in this element, or the project will result in an increase in ambient
        noise levels by more than 3 dB, whichever is greater. This does not apply to
        construction activities which are conducted according to City regulations for
        construction activities. Compliance with the City’s construction requirements shall be
        sufficient to reduce construction-related noise impacts to a less than significant level.

Transportation Noise Sources
     Where existing traffic noise levels are less than 60 dB Ldn at the outdoor activity areas
      of noise-sensitive uses, a +5 dB Ldn increase in roadway noise levels will be considered
      significant; and
     Where existing traffic noise levels range between 60 and 65 dB Ldn at the outdoor
      activity areas of noise-sensitive uses, a +3 dB Ldn increase in roadway noise levels will
      be considered significant; and
     Where existing traffic noise levels are greater than 65 dB Ldn at the outdoor activity
      areas of noise-sensitive uses, a + 1.5 dB Ldn increase in roadway noise levels will be
      considered significant.

The Housing Element serves as a planning guide addressing the long-term, comprehensive
housing needs for residents of various income levels. The process of creating or updating a
Housing Element includes the identification and analysis of current and projected housing
needs, followed by the development of goals, policies, and programs that aim to preserve,
improve, and increase supply of housing in the community for all income levels.
Compliance with State Law
The Housing Element is one of the seven required elements in the General Plan, and is
mandated through Article 10.6 of the State of California Government Code Section 65580
through 65590 (California Department of Housing and Community Development [HCD], 1969a).
The Housing Element must remain consistent and compatible with other General Plan elements
and State Law.
According to the California Statewide Housing Plan Update, it is the goal of the State to “ensure
to all Californians the opportunity to obtain safe, adequate housing in a suitable living
environment.” In addition, the State Department of Housing and Community Development
                                                     Clearlake General Plan Update         123
                                                                                  Final

(HCD) has established the following four primary goals that are addressed in the Housing
Element:
        Provision of new housing;
        Preservation of existing housing and neighborhoods;
        Reduction of housing costs;
        Improvement of housing conditions for special needs groups;
Recent legislation (after 2010) pertinent to the preparation of the housing element and housing
element law includes the following:
        AB 1233 (Provision of Adequate Sites for RHNP)
        AB 1866 (Second Units)
        AB 2348 (Land Inventory Requirements)
        AB 2511 (promotes the development of affordable housing
        SB 2 (Local Planning and Approval for Emergency Shelters)
        SB 1087 (Water and Sewer Service Priority for Affordable Housing)
Unlike other elements of the General Plan, the Housing Element is required to be updated
periodically; generally, every five years. For the purposes of formatting and consistency with
this General Plan document, this chapter summarizes the goals, objectives, policies and
programs that are found in the comprehensive, State approved 2014-19 Housing Element
document (see Background Information section below).
Purpose of Element
The purpose of the Housing Element is to provide the City with a long-range housing program
that addresses, not only the City’s housing needs, but also includes mandated statewide
housing needs.
Background Information
The complete 2014-19 Housing Element document that is subject to approval by the California
Department of Housing and Community Development, consists of Chapter 6 of the General Plan
Background Report. In this single case, Chapter 6 is the complete Housing Element for the
General Plan.
Goals and Policies
The policies and guidance of this chapter, together with the Future Land Use and Growth Plan,
will aid the decisions of the Planning Commission and City Council.

                                                                                 Final

B.      Context
According to the 2010 U.S. Census data, Clearlake has approximately 8,487 housing units. More
than half of these units are single-family homes, while over one-third are mobile homes. The
housing stock is in need of improvements; about half of the housing units are considered
“good” quality. Additionally, about 25 percent of Clearlake’s housing stock is vacant, which is
extremely high. About 75 percent of homeowners with mortgages are considered cost-
burdened, while 59 percent of Clearlake’s renters are cost-burdened. The Regional Housing
Needs Allocation calls for 51 percent of new housing units to be built for above-moderate
income owners. While a majority of Clearlake’s population is considered cost-burdened, the
housing stock is already being sold at below market rate prices. The goals, objectives, policies,
and programs of this chapter aim to balance the need for market rate and affordable housing,
renovation and rehabilitation of existing housing stock, and providing and adequate supply of
housing options for all current and future residents.
C.      Goals, Objectives, Policies and Programs
Goal HO 1

Program HO 1.1.2.1 - Public/Private Partnerships
The City will continue to work closely with the business and development communities toward
achieving the City’s affordable housing goal. The City has identified the following outreach
programs in this partnership to provide affordable housing:
City of Clearlake: The City will review potential funding opportunities available through
existing state, federal, and local programs for its affordable housing program.
Development Community: The City will work with private developers and property owners to
cooperate in financing water and sewer facilities expansion as a means of facilitating
development.

development corporations specializing in housing for various special needs groups to
accommodate housing that meets the needs of these groups.
The City will ensure that residential development projects are consistent with the goals and
policies of the General Plan. To the extent that the City has financial resources, an annual
evaluation of the General Plan will comprise the City’s monitoring program for the Housing
Element. This will include a review of progress toward achieving Housing Element objectives by
the City and other responsible agencies and departments while meeting timing and funding
commitments for implementing actions, as well as the number of housing units provided or
other measurable indicators achieved for each established measure. This will include statutory
reporting to the Department of Housing and Community Development regarding annual
housing element reporting.

federal building standards for handicapped accessibility. The Community Development
Department will continue to provide brochures and assistance to residents about accessibility
                                                          Clearlake General Plan Update   126
                                                                                   Final

for persons with disabilities. The City will administer the Reasonable Accommodation
regulations to make sure necessary modifications can be made to housing in a timely and cost-
effective manner to address the needs of disabled and developmentally disabled persons.
Program HO 2.2.1.2 - Congregate Care and Group Housing for Elderly and Disabled Persons
The City will continue to obtain comments from the public, developers and other agencies
about the need for, and development of, congregate care and group-assisted housing. The City
will review potential funding sources and, if need and feasibility are established, will pursue
grants and financing to aid in the development of congregate care and group-assisted housing.
Program HO 2.2.1.3 - Assistance for Transitional and Supportive Housing
Meet periodically with local non-profit service providers upon request to assess the transitional
and supportive housing needs of the community and work with nonprofit organizations to
identify suitable sites for the placement of facilities. Pending available resources, the City will
assist developers in finding sites for the creation of transitional and supportive housing
facilities, provide support in accessing state or federal funds, such as supporting requests on
behalf of a nonprofit provider, expedited permit approvals in support of a non-profit
application, and/or contributing information to an application to support the need for the
proposed project or activity.

requests on behalf of a nonprofit provider, expedited permit approvals in support of a non-
profit application, and/or contributing information to an application to support the need for the
proposed project or activity.
The City will consider exempting on a case by case basis planning entitlement fees, such as
general plan/zoning amendment, variances, design review (if applicable) and environmental
applications for emergency shelter projects proposed by non-profit service providers.
Program HO 2.2.1.5 - Support Services for Elderly and Disabled Persons
To the extent the City has financial capability, continue to support Lake Transit Authority, Dial-
A-Ride, the Senior Center and other programs providing supportive services for seniors or
persons with disabilities. Support shall include promotion of these services through the
placement of informational materials at City offices and/or assistance in accessing state or
federal funding for such services.
                                                         Clearlake General Plan Update     127
                                                                                  Final
Program HO 2.2.1.6 - Americans with Disabilities Act
The City will continue to ensure that all construction projects requiring building permits comply
with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) as provided by the CA Building Code. The City
will assist property owners and contractors in complying with ADA requirements when retrofit
or rehabilitation projects for public, residential or commercial structures.
Program HO 2.2.1.7 - Residential Infill Study
To address concentrated higher density and mixed-use housing strategies in the 2040 General
Plan there is a need to identify potential opportunities within existing buildings for conversion
to housing units, particularly in the upper floors in three of the identified growth areas: Cluster
1 (Austin Park), Cluster 2 (the Avenues), and Cluster 4 (Lower Lakeshore). This would lead to
more building renovations, create live/work studios and improve affordable housing
opportunities in the focused growth areas. The presence of additional residents in these areas
will also improve the City’s economic vitality. The City will prepare (contingent upon grant
funding) a residential infill study that identifies these opportunities, working with property
owners to evaluate the economic potential for creating more housing within existing buildings
and identify funding sources to develop this housing.
Objective HO 2.3
Encourage development of new housing for a broader range of income groups.
Policy HO 2.3.1
Ensure a regulatory environment conducive to housing production and maintenance.
Program HO 2.3.1.1 - Monitor Policies and Programs
Continue to monitor and review housing related policies and programs to minimize constraints
to housing production and maintenance. This will include developing new design review
programs from the 2040 General Plan that results in ministerial reviews of multi-family housing
and facilitated processing of affordable housing projects.
Program HO 2.3.1.2 - Zoning Ordinance Review and Implementation
To implement the 2040 General Plan and to achieve housing and other City objectives, the City
will conduct a complete update of the Zoning Code. Revisions will be made to the Zoning Code
to promote flexibility in densities and uses, to improve incentives for affordable housing
production and to bring applicable regulations into compliance with State Law. The Zoning
Code will then be reviewed periodically for consistency and compliance and amended as
needed.

Program HO 2.3.1.3 - Design Review
As part of the 2015 Zoning Code update, per implementation of the 2040 General Plan, new
regulations will be created for Design Review. This new program will include Design Guidelines
for the development of multi-family housing. Particular attention should be paid to avoiding
architectural barriers that could adversely affect disabled persons and persons with
developmental disabilities. In addition, the Design Review provisions of the Zoning Code will
address the need to minimize constraints to the development of multi-family housing and
provide for ministerial (staff review) and facilitated development review for these types of
development applications.
Program HO 2.3.1.4 - Affordable Housing Water/Sewer Priority
In accordance with Government Code Section 6558.7, the City will monitor Lake County
Sanitation District Resolution No. 2014-45), Highlands Water Company (Resolution No. 014-30)
and Konocti County Water District (Resolution No. 14-01) to assure sufficient priority
sewer/water capacities are reserved for future low income housing development per the City’s
Regional Housing Needs Allocation for the 2014-19 period; 175 equivalent dwelling unit
services for lower-income households.
Policy HO 2.3.2:
Support the provision of housing for extremely low, low and very low-income households (see Program HO
2.2.1.4, Assistance for Emergency Shelters).
Program HO 2.3.2.1 - Tax Exempt Bonds
The City does not have the capacity to issue bonds. The City is, however, a member of the
California Statewide Communities Development Authority JPA who issues federal tax credits for
low-income housing projects.
The City will continue to be a member of the Committee for pooling resources to issue tax
exempt bonds for financing the construction of affordable housing or providing financial
assistance to low and moderate-income homebuyer assistance.
Program HO 2.3.2.2 - Preservation of At-Risk Housing
The City has identified 99 affordable rental units being at risk of converting to market rate
housing over the next twenty years. These units are consist of the Autumn Village Apartments
(32 affordable rental units), Highlands Village (40 affordable rental units) and Olympic Villa (27
affordable units). The City will work with property owners, other public agencies, and non-
profit housing organizations to preserve existing subsidized rental housing in which the owner
could potentially increase rents to market rates within the next twenty years. The City will
encourage existing owners to maintain the affordability of such rental housing. Furthermore,
pending available resources, the City will help owners of at risk units to obtain funding for
                                                              Clearlake General Plan Update      129
                                                                                          Final

improvements to these units to extend affordable housing contracts. Also, to the extent the
City has available resources, the City will provide ongoing preservation technical assistance and
education to affected tenants and the community at-large, regarding the need to preserve the
existing affordable housing stock. The City will also notify tenants of the pending possible loss
of rental subsidies.
Program HO 2.3.2.3 - Rental Assistance
The City shall continue to cooperate with the Lake County Housing Commission in its
administration of the federal Section 8, Housing Choice Voucher rental assistance program to
maintain the availability of housing vouchers in Clearlake.
The City’s role will be to:
        Provide necessary documentation to the Housing Commission to apply for annual
         commitments from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
        Provide information on the rental assistance program at the Community Development
         Department’s public counter.
Program HO 2.3.2.4 - Community Reinvestment Act
The City will work with financial institutions, serving Clearlake as requested to identify low and
moderate-income housing projects as part of their responsibility under the federal Community
Reinvestment Act.
Program HO 2.3.2.5 - Encourage Development of Market Rate Ownership and Rental Housing
The City will encourage the production of market-rate rental and ownership housing for
moderate and above moderate-income households through its land development policies.
All of the multi-family rental housing developed in Clearlake over the past twenty years has
been subsidized housing for lower-income households. To provide a wider variety of housing
for all income levels, the City should encourage the development of market-rate rental housing.
Objective H0 2.4
Enhance Clearlake’s residential neighborhoods.
Policy HO 2.4.1
Improve the quality of the existing housing stock within the City.
Program HO 2.4.1 - Housing Rehabilitation Loans for Low-Income Households

The City will continue to operate the Housing Rehabilitation Loan Program to promote housing
rehabilitation for low, very low, and extremely low-income households. To improve the quality
of rental housing, the City shall expand the program to include rental housing. The City will
update their CDBG and HOME Housing Rehabilitation Guidelines to include rental housing.
The City has maintained a Housing Rehabilitation Loan Program to provide financing for the
rehabilitation of dwelling units owned or occupied by lower-income households (including
rental housing). The City provides financial assistance in the form of low-interest loans,
deferred when necessary to maintain the affordability of rehabilitated housing. This program is
a valuable resource for community residents and will be continued into the future.
The City and the County offer housing rehabilitation and homeowner assistance programs to
Clearlake residents. The City shall review the feasibility of joining the County in developing
more extensive and efficient housing programs that have more funding opportunities. The City
objective is to provide rehabilitation funding through these programs for between 20 and 30
housing units during this five-year planning cycle.
Program HO 2.4.2 -     Housing Conditions Survey
The City has a large number of housing units in need of rehabilitation, and particularly vacant
units that need to be re-occupied. However, there are some data discrepancies between the
2012 survey conducted for the 2040 General Plan Update and the 2009 housing conditions
survey conducted for the Redevelopment Agency. A more detailed housing conditions survey
needs to be conducted to determine actual housing conditions in Clearlake. An accurate survey
will provide the needed data tools to obtain grant funding to further expand the Housing
Rehabilitation Program.
Program HO 2.4.2.3 - Public Awareness Program
The City will disseminate informational brochures to the public on its Housing Rehabilitation
and Housing Assistance programs and provide copies at the public counter of the Senior
Resource Directory maintained by the Community Care and the Area on Aging in Lake and
Mendocino Counties. The Directory provides important information on housing needs that
include, not only housing rehabilitation, but also, homeless and transitional housing, housing
support agencies, subsidized housing complexes, senior housing, and residential care facilities.
Program HO 2.4.2.3 - Utilize Code Enforcement to Minimize Nuisances and                  Protect
Neighborhood Integrity
The City will continue to operate its code enforcement program, with the goals of abating
dangerous structures and addressing nuisance concerns related to housing and neighborhood
quality.
                                                       Clearlake General Plan Update     131
                                                                                Final
The City Council placed “Measure R” on the ballot for November 4, 2014, for a specific
transaction and use sales tax to support citywide clean up and improvement. As the Measure
did not pass, the City has allocated over $300,000 of Community Development Block Grant
(CDBG) funding towards an enhanced code enforcement program. This program will improve
efforts by the City to address abating dangerous structures. In addition, the City will seek other
grant funding to further improve this program.
The Rental Housing Inspection Program began in 2001 to address ongoing safety and sanitary
concerns with rental units in Clearlake. The program was discontinued in 2007 due to various
reasons. The City will look at the feasibility of resurrecting this program based on current
funding. Also, the City will seek additional grant funding to further enhance this program once
it has been re-established.
Program HO 2.4.2.4 - Preservation and Replacement of Mobile Homes and Mobile Home Parks
Many of the mobile home parks in Clearlake are substandard and do not provide safe
affordable housing. The City will meet with mobile home park owners (as requested and to the
extent that the City has financial capacity) to discuss long-term goals for their properties and
the condition of park infrastructure and buildings, the condition of mobile homes located in the
park, parcel size, accessibility to services, and surrounding land uses. For those parks that are
feasible to preserve, the City will consider (1) providing information to park owners on state
and federal programs, and/or (2) providing referrals to nonprofit organizations who can assist
in preparing funding requests.
The City will also encourage the mobile home parks with serious problems to convert to
another use. The City shall require the owners to provide relocation or other assistance to
mitigate the displacement of park residents in accordance with Government Code Section
65863.7.
Objective HO 2.5
Promote fair housing opportunities for all persons regardless of age, race, sex, marital status,
ethnic background, source of income, or other arbitrary factors.
Policy HO 2.5.1
The City will continue to distribute information on fair housing laws to residents, and refer
discrimination complaints to appropriate agencies.
Program HO 2.5.1.1 - Assistance to the Public Regarding Discrimination in Housing
The City will continue to serve as liaison between the public and appropriate agencies in
matters concerning housing discrimination. The City will promote equal housing opportunities
through the posting of information and distribution of literature at City buildings. The City will

Policy HO 2.6.1
The City shall promote energy conservation in existing homes and neighborhoods.
Program HO 2.6.1.1 - Support of Existing Energy Conservation Programs
The City will continue to support residential energy conservation programs offered by Pacific
Gas and Electric Company, North Coast Energy Services, and others. This support will include
referrals to these programs for homeowners expressing interest in energy conservation, as well
as placement of brochures (if available) for such programs at City offices.
The City will also review the feasibility of joining the County in developing a stronger housing
rehabilitation program that includes energy conservation measures.
Program HO 2.6.1.2 - Implementation of Energy Conservation Standards
The City will continue to implement the energy conservation standards under Title 24 of the
California Code of Regulations, as required by State law. The City will continue to provide
information at the permit counter from the California Energy Commission on compliance with
Title 24 and other energy conservation techniques.

9.      SAFETY
A.      Introduction
Safety Element
The Safety Element identifies hazards that pose potential risks of injury, death, and property
damage from natural and man-made and nature environmental conditions. The greatest risks
in Clearlake are likely to result from flood or fire hazards. Areas planned for development along
the Lake and in the one hundred-year flood zone should either be moved outside of the flood
hazard zone or constructed with proper mitigation measures. Future development in the
foothills surrounding the City should implement fire mitigation measures. Other hazards of
lesser risk are also addressed in this element to formulate an approach that encompasses a
range of safety issues. The application of prevention and mitigation measures that address
each hazard can reduce the impact on property, health and safety.
Compliance with State Law
The Safety Space Element is one of the seven mandatory elements of the General Plan,
according to Government Code §65302.
Purpose of Element
The Safety Element is a plan that addresses the reduction of potential public safety and
property damage risks resulting from fires, floods, earthquakes, landslides, and other hazards.
Other locally relevant safety issues, such as emergency response, hazardous materials spills,
and crime reduction, are also considered in this element.
                                                           Clearlake General Plan Update     135
                                                                                     Final

Background Information
Complete background information on community safety as it pertains to the General Plan is
referenced in Chapter 10 of the General Plan Background Report. Given the above, this Safety
Element establishes the necessary policy guidance that will enable the City to plan effectively
for future growth and development, while reducing safety risks.
Goals and Policies
The policies and guidance of this chapter, together with the Future Land Use and Growth Plan,
will aid the decisions of the Planning and City Council.
B.       Context
Safe and neighborly feel is one of Clearlake’s top traits that is cherished and maintained by the
community. Addressing safety risks are essential to maintain this condition. The production,
selling, and use of drugs that result in criminal activities in Clearlake is a major safety issue.
Also, animal control and code enforcement are primary community safety concerns. Also, with
the recent wildfire incident of 2015, addressing fire safety is an important aspect that the City,
the Fire District and other support agencies need to consider in planning for future growth.
During the General Plan public participation workshops, it was stated that Austin Park and areas
surrounding Olympic Drive were the safest areas within the City, and the area surrounding the
Clearlake Shopping Center and scattered neighborhoods throughout the City were unsafe and
needed to be considered in terms of prioritizing police resources. A few key safety themes are
addressed in the Safety Element as follows:
        Drug use, violence, and animal control.
        Flood, fire, and other natural hazards.
        Neighborhood safety mitigation.

10. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
A.       Introduction
Economic Development Element
The Economic Development element is an essential component for the future of Clearlake’s
employment growth and business opportunity.
Compliance with State Law
There are no requirements to have an Economic Development Element as part of the General
Plan. It is considered an optional element under Government Code Section 65303 that the City
may adopt “any elements or address any other subjects, which, in the judgment of the
legislative body, relate to the physical development of the county or city.” In accordance with
Government Code Section 65300.5, the Economic Development Element, along with other
optional elements of the General Plan, such as the Community Design, Public Facilities, and
Health Elements, must be internally consistent with all other elements of the General Plan.
Purpose of Element
This element seeks to focus on building and sustaining a business climate that supports and
nurtures diversified business opportunities, promotes fiscal responsibility and stability, and
develops a vibrant downtown that is a welcoming and visitor-serving destination.
                                                        Clearlake General Plan Update     147
                                                                                  Final

Background Information
Complete background information on economic development as it pertains to the General Plan
is referenced in Chapter 11 of the General Plan Background Report. Given the above, this
Economic Development Element establishes the necessary policy guidance that will enable the
City to plan effectively for future growth and development, while enhancing the City’s business
climate.
B.       Context
The City of Clearlake will need to maintain a focus on improving the economic conditions for
residents over the next twenty to thirty years. City officials will need to continue to maintain
fiscal stability through a balanced budget, and look for opportunities to finance new programs
in accordance with the General Plan. The City will need to be careful to not overspend limited
financial resources, and dedicate effort to finding grant and other funding sources to keep the
momentum going and local residents engaged in the planning process. The City needs to
prioritize business development as a quick remedy of the current economic and employment
situation. There are several vacant parcels and commercial units within the City which can
accommodate new businesses, and are located in the main commercial areas. The City should
concentrate development in these existing commercial areas to help attract customers to
existing businesses as well. Economic development opportunities include:
Potential Economic Development from Future Development
Based on the 2015 General Plan Land Use Analysis, conducted by Economic Planning Systems
(EPS) and Price Consulting Services, there is a potential future development within the City of
over four million more square feet of commercial development. However, this would be at
theoretical build out of all remaining non-residential land use designated land in the Land Use
Map. For the purposes of build out within the time horizon of this General Plan, EPS has
estimated that over 682,000 square feet of non-residential building would be constructed by
2040. Figure 10.1 shows a map of vacant land within the City according to the Preferred Growth
Scenario; the 2040 General Plan Land Use Map (for more details see Chapter 11 of the General
Plan Background Report).
Employment Growth
Based on the U.S. Census, there were 2,675 jobs located in Clearlake in 2010. Clearlake
experienced a 23 percent increase in job growth between 2002 and 2010. However, this job
growth trend is expected to be slightly reduced over the next twenty-five years. Based on the
General Plan Preferred Growth Scenario, Economic Planning Systems, projected job growth to
be reduced over the long term from 2.85% annually to about 1.1% annually. Realized job
growth between 2010 and 2040 is projected to increase by 1,049 jobs from 2,675 to 3,724 jobs
to 2040. This growth rate does consider both development of existing vacant land and
                                                        Clearlake General Plan Update    148

Economic Realities from the 2040 General Plan Preferred Growth Scenario Land
Use Map
EPS conducted an analysis of the land use mix developed from the 2040 Land Use Map. The
Map, shown in the Land Use Element, shows an arrangement of residential and commercial
land uses broken down by acreage. Economic Planning Systems (EPS) analyzed the mix of land
use from the 2040 Preferred Growth Scenario in relation to the 2040 Land Use Map. Based on
projected growth rates to the 2040 General Plan Build Out Time Horizon, from this land use
mix, EPS estimates that an additional 2,314 housing units will be developed 682,000 square feet
of commercial building area will be developed, and 1,049 more jobs will be created. EPS
concluded that the 2040 Land Use Map provides sufficient land use and acres to accommodate
this growth and that the land use mix identified in the Land Use Map adequately provides for
additional economic development opportunities beyond 2040 (for more details see Chapter 11
of the General Plan Background Report).
Viticulture and Winemaking
The City of Clearlake and surrounding areas contain open land that is underutilized or vacant,
which could be used for harvesting grapes and wine production. With prime soils for
viticulture, the Clearlake area has an advantageous environment and climate to grow premium
grapes that can rival nearby Napa, Sonoma, and Mendocino Counties. Existing resources for
viticulture and wine production are already available, and the City should utilize these
resources to obtain an economic advantage in the County. It will be essential for the City to
develop and work cohesively with key organizations and regional groups to promote wine
production and tourist-related services and experiences. The City could collaborate with
surrounding Lake County communities, including Kelseyville, Lakeport, Lower Lake,
Middletown, and Clearlake Oaks, which have vineyards and tasting rooms, and develop a
county wine trail. Wineries that offer tastings and hospitality are a magnet for tourism and,
therefore, sales tax revenue and local employment opportunities for the City.
Outdoor Recreation and Activities
One of the prevalent assets for the City of Clearlake is its lakefront location on the largest
freshwater lake in California, Clear Lake. However, the lake is plagued with environmental
issues such as rotten algae and mercury contamination, making it difficult to enhance lakefront
commercial opportunities and water-related activities for tourists and locals. In order to
increase tourism and optimize the City’s lakefront access, the City needs to develop policies and
collaborate with other related agencies to clean the lake and prevent any additional
environmental damage. With a clean and uncontaminated lake, lakefront businesses can work
together and optimize services for water-related activities such as fishing, boating, and
                                                       Clearlake General Plan Update      149
                                                                                  Final

recreational use. As these services enhance lake usage and attract additional tourism, nearby
commercial activity may also benefit from incoming tourists looking for shops, restaurants, and
accommodations. In order to take advantage of its picturesque location and economic
opportunity, it is important for the City to keep the lake clean and pollution free.
Arts and Entertainment
Clearlake has the opportunity to build off existing Lake County arts and entertainment activities
to attract regional visitors and business. The only performing arts center is located in Lakeport,
on the northwest side of Clear Lake. With availability of land and vacant commercial space, the
City could build a theater for performing arts and live entertainment, and attract visitors from
nearby Kelseyville and Clearlake Oaks which must drive to Lakeport for performances. This
additional visitor activity could act as a supplement to outdoor recreation and tourism, which
tend to decrease during the cold, winter months. By establishing a venue for year-round
activity, the City would have a constant source of revenue. Additionally, Clearlake is home to
several locally owned businesses, restaurants, and lodging facilities. The additional business
activity resulting from incoming visitors to a performing arts center would increase revenue for
local businesses, and would contribute to an increase in the overall economy. Many of the
locally owned shops along Lakeshore Drive are closed in the early evening as business slows.
These businesses could re-open at night and act as a venue for acoustic musical performances
or small art galleries displaying local artists’ work, similar to the ‘First Friday Fling’ which takes
place monthly in Lakeport.

Regional Shopping
Shopping opportunities in Lake County are limited and consist of mostly small boutiques with
an assortment of products from local merchants. While this type of retail shop contributes to
the small town charm of the County and provides a unique shopping experience for visitors and
tourists, the shopping needs of local residents are unmet. Clearlake has the Clearlake Shopping
Center which has a Walmart Store, as well as a few chain restaurant dining options; however,
the surrounding land is vacant. The adjacent area along SR 53, Old Highway 53, and Dam Road
could be developed as a regional shopping center to serve the daily needs of Lake County
residents. New commercial development could benefit from the business generated from the
Walmart, and provide the retail shopping needs suited to locals instead of tourists. While
Lakeshore Drive can be developed as a tourist serving commercial corridor focused on dining,
lodging, and unique locally owned businesses, the area along SR 53 could serve a different
purpose. Providing the regular shopping needs of locals could provide sales tax revenue for the
City and attract business from other unincorporated Lake County communities.

11. PUBLIC FACILITIES
A.      Introduction
Public Facilities Element
Public facilities create healthy communities by providing such essential services as the supply of
clean water, the distribution of energy and power, waste management, and emergency
assistance. Additional public services enhance the quality of community life, such as education,
health, and recreational facilities.
Compliance with State Law
California, state law does not mandate the implementation of a Public Facilities Element as a
chapter within the General Plan. Therefore, this element is considered an optional element.
Stipulated by California Government Code Section 65303, a city or county may adopt “any
elements or address any other subjects, which, in the judgment of the legislative body, relate to
the physical development of the county or city.” However, the Office of Planning and Research
(OPR) suggests that such an element be implemented in a city’s General Plan to provide the
policy basis for short-term documents, such as the City’s capital improvements program and
the annual capital budget as well as provide long-term guidance
Purpose of Element
The purpose of this Public Facilities Element is to provide a basis for short and long term plans
for the development of additional facilities to support the community’s development.
                                                        Clearlake General Plan Update       159
                                                                                   Final

The Element can be used as a foundation to develop growth supporting infrastructure, such as
a capital improvement program.
Background Information
Complete background information on public facilities that pertains to the General Plan is
included in Chapter 12 of the General Plan Background Report. Given the above, this Public
Facilities Element establishes the necessary policy guidance that will enable the City to plan for
development of new and/or expanded public facilities for future growth and development.
B.       Context
The City is somewhat limited in determining and financing public facilities. Prior to becoming
an incorporated City, the County planned and allocated resources to develop public facilities.
The water systems were developed by water agencies and districts. The wastewater system
was developed through an independent public service district. The City can influence
development and improvement to these facilities through coordination with these agencies.
The City does have full discretion over the planning and development of parks and police
services. In reviewing information on public facilities and listening to the community through
the General Plan Update public participation process the following planning directions were
made:
Child Services
Additional facilities and programs are needed for improved academic performance for children
and programs that engage teenage youth. The City’s population under the age of 19 is
expected to increase 36 percent by 2040. Providing increased activities for this demographic
will be important. One emerging solution is the development of a teen activity center or
community center that supports after school programs.
Employment Development
An apparent disconnect exists between the availability and creation of good jobs, the number
of community members qualified to perform these jobs, and the job training opportunities
available to community members. A vocational training center for adults would be a good
addition to the community.
Solid Waste Capacity
While the County faces the issue of maintaining financial stability of the landfill, the City is
struggling with illegal dumping of solid waste, hazardous waste, oversized items, and
undisposed trash on residential property. Code enforcement is a major issue in the City. An
improved waste management system is needed to encourage greater reuse and recycling.
                                                        Clearlake General Plan Update      160
                                                                                  Final

Fire and Police Services
Providing better facilities for fire or police, in addition to increased resources, could increase
the performance of these public services. There is potential for wildland fires to become more
frequent in the future and having more safety facilities would help protect the community.
Storm Water Facilities
Without a connected system of infrastructure to manage, divert and store storm water, the
continual deposit of material into Clear Lake will continue to add to its degradation.
Additionally, infrastructure such as roads will always demand attention and improvement if
storm water is not managed in a way that preserves their structural integrity.
Water System
Aging infrastructure to deliver water to the City contributes to a deficiency in delivery of quality
potable water. There are four different water agencies that provide water to citizens in
Clearlake. A comprehensive and collaborative analysis of the entire delivery system may be
needed to identify priorities and coordinate water supply delivery to the growing community.
Waste Water System
Although the Lake County Sanitation District’s Southeast (SE) Regional System, which collects
and treats wastewater in the City of Clearlake, has undergone significant improvements to
increase volume and capacity, the City needs to develop cooperative solutions to further
reduce discharge quantity and quality into the system. Water conservation programs and Fats,
Oils, and Grease (FOG) reduction programs for residential and non-residential are needed. The
City also needs to support the District in expanding the system’s volume and capacity, such as
the development of a Pipe Bursting program. Pipe bursting is a process that involves
replacement of aging and leaking lines with expanded lines that does not involve any
excavation.
C.      Goals, Objectives, Policies and Programs

12. COMMUNITY DESIGN
A.      Introduction
Community Design Element
Attractive and functional design of the built environment will help meet the community’s goal
of preserving the City’s small-town character while enhancing the built and natural
environments. Design guidelines, as promoted in this element, can provide a framework for
community development, new construction, and improvements to Clearlake’s neighborhoods,
streetscapes, and buildings.
Compliance with State Law
California, state law does not mandate the implementation of a Community Design Element as
a chapter within the General Plan. Therefore, this element is considered an optional element.
Stipulated by California Government Code Section 65303, a city or county may adopt “any
elements or address any other subjects, which, in the judgment of the legislative body, relate to
the physical development of the county or city.”
Purpose of the Element
The Community Design Element is intended to provide a basis for aesthetic regulation of all
development and offers specific guidelines to enhance the sense of place and quality of life for
residents. This element is developed closely with the prescriptive Land Use, Circulation, and
Housing policies and programs.
                                                       Clearlake General Plan Update      169
                                                                                 Final

Background Information
Complete background information on design as it pertains to the General Plan is referenced in
Chapter 13 of the General Plan Background Report. Given the above, this Design Element
establishes the necessary policy guidance that will enable the City to plan effectively for future
growth and development, while enhancing building design outcomes.
B.      Context
In the 19th century, American pioneers and European families began to settle in the Clearlake
area and assemble and development land for agricultural and mining purposes. Towards the
end of the 19th century, luxury resorts and hot springs around the lake became a destination
for wealthy vacationers.
The majority of Clearlake buildings are residential homes, with some built (mostly during the
1960s and 1970s) on subdivisions established in the 1920s. The City flourished as a destination
resort getaway from nearby cities in the 1960’s, with many lakefront motels and tourist
businesses located along Lakeshore Drive. A majority of the housing stock and commercial
buildings are more than thirty years old. Older homes are typically modular and many are in
need of improvements. The recent economic downturn increased building vacancy,
foreclosures, and abandonment. A variety of California Ranch and Mission style architecture is
mixed in with 60’s style Block commercial and some Art Deco can be found in the mix of
somewhat non-descript architecture.
As the City evolves into a more regional center-place for Lake County, creating design criteria
will be crucial to attracting stronger investment in Clearlake. As most of the City consists of
vacant land that has urban level services, such as water and sewer, the City has a great
opportunity to create a unique identity beyond that of an affordable housing area for the
County. Establishing a vision and design criteria and implementing design controls for future
development is a major priority of the City. The Design Element, therefore, becomes a
foundation of future design programs that need to be developed for the City of Clearlake.

13. HEALTH
A.      Introduction
Health Element
Population in Clearlake is projected to grow by about 40 percent by 2040. The biggest
projected growth will be in the senior population, especially those ages 85 and above, which
will almost double. The percent of the younger population is also projected to increase,
especially those ages 19 and below. These increases will place additional demand on health
care services, social amenities, the transportation system, housing and public facilities, such as
schools and hospitals. Also, motivated by the dramatic increase in national obesity rates and
obesity-related illnesses over the past two decades, public health professionals and urban
planners have identified city planning as an avenue for fostering physical activity and increasing
access to healthy foods. The City of Clearlake, through the General Plan, and this Health
Element, demonstrate a City commitment to promote healthy lifestyles within Clearlake.
Compliance with State Law
California, state law does not mandate the inclusion of a Health Element as a chapter within the
General Plan. Therefore, this element is considered an optional element. Stipulated by
California Government Code Section 65303, a city or county may adopt “any elements or
address any other subjects, which, in the judgment of the legislative body, relate to the physical
development of the county or city.”
                                                        Clearlake General Plan Update       179
                                                                                   Final

Purpose of the Element
This element is intended to provide direction towards improving access to healthy food, to
opportunities for enhanced community physical activity, to improved air quality, and better
access to quality health care. The Health Element relates to other elements in the General Plan.
For example, land use decisions (Land Use Element) helps shape the pattern of community
development and can either promote or discourage alternative modes of transportation, such
as walking or biking. Also, land use can influence the provision of community amenities,
including access to healthy food, outdoor recreation opportunities, and civic services. A city
with access to alternative modes of transportation can have significant impacts on increasing
physical activity and decreasing obesity rates. The Open Space and Safety Elements are also
closely related to the Health Element. For example, better defining parks and recreation spaces
and their locations can encourage physical activity, contribute positively to mental health, and
improve air quality. The Health Element is also intended to align with the priorities indicated in
the 2016 Lake County Community Health Needs Assessment and the issues prioritized in the
Healthy California 2020 framework, enabling the City to plan for healthy lifestyles in Clearlake’s
future.
There are large number of goals, objectives, policies and programs included within other
Elements of the General Plan that address creating a healthier and safer Clearlake. Refer to
Objective LU 3.2 and Policy 3.2.1 of the Land Use Element regarding compatible land uses
addressing air and noise impacts on sensitive receptors. Also refer to various policies and
programs associates with the Circulation Element, including Objective CI 3.5, Multi-Modal
Circulation Systems, Objective CI 4.1 regarding enhanced bicycle and sidewalk facilities, and
Objective CI 3.5 regarding traffic calming. The Community Development Element incorporates a
number of policies and programs to develop a more walkable community, safe and healthy
communities. Refer to Objective CD 2.1, Walkable Community and Goal CD 5, Safe and healthy
community. The Noise Element includes a number of policies and programs that address
reducing noise levels and mitigating noise impacts on sensitive receptors, such as residential
uses. The Public Facilities Element includes a large number of community health related
policies and programs that range from expanding educational opportunities to reducing
pollution related environmental impacts. Finally, there are a large number of policies and
programs that address creating more open space and recreational facilities and access in the
Open Space Element that address creating a safer and healthier community.
Background Information
Complete background information on health as it pertains to the General Plan is referenced in
Chapter 14 of the General Plan Background Report. Given the above, this Health Element
establishes the necessary policy guidance that will enable the City to plan effectively for future
growth and development, while maintaining and/or enhancing the community’s overall health.
                                                       Clearlake General Plan Update       180
                                                                                  Final

B.      Context
A number of key health issues are summarized in Chapter 16, Health Background Report
relevant to community health issues. These are outlined as follows:
Impairment to Water Quality
Historical mining activities within the Clear Lake watershed have exposed the lake and
surrounding areas to high levels of mercury, arsenic, borax, and sulfur. Considering the high
level of contamination in the local water system, there may be a health threat to some
residents and the local aquatic food chain. Residents get some of their water supply from the
lake. Local orchards and vineyards irrigate with water drawn from the lake. Latent mercury
concentration can threaten the health of residents, especially in younger children or pregnant
women. The lake also suffers from frequent algae blooms, resulting in odors particularly on
windy days. Since Clear Lake is a major recreation and tourist attraction, unpleasant lake
conditions and contamination threats jeopardize both local health and the tourism industry.
Inefficient Waste Management System
Many residential properties have illegal dumping of solid waste, hazardous waste, oversized
items, and undisposed trash. The planning team observed some homes littered with old,
rusting automobiles with potential hazardous chemical leaching into the properties.
Unhygienic living environments with possibly hazardous contamination can expose residents,
especially young children, to various health risks.
Proximity to Roadways
Particulate matter from automobiles, particularly traveling on dirt roads or along major streets,
can exacerbate existing respiratory diseases or adversely affect sensitive or vulnerable
segments of the population such as children and the elderly. The CalPoly Team estimates that
approximately 11.4% of Clearlake residents are directly impacted by the proximity of these
major roadways and are exposed to vehicular air pollutants on a daily basis. Within these
impact areas, there are a high number of occupied residential parcels and local business
operations.
Limited Health Care Facilities
The City and surrounding region has limited health care facilities. For example, the community
has outgrown the services and facilities provided by St. Helena Hospital. Consequently, St
Helena is reviewing options for developing a larger hospital elsewhere in Clearlake. The
Healthy Clearlake Collaborative (HCC) is referenced throughout policies and programs within
this Element. HCC is an important organization that initiates a number of programs promoting
healthy lifestyles in Clearlake. The Collaborative is a part of Hope Rising Lake and is aligned with
                                                          Clearlake General Plan Update       181
                                                                                    Final
the priorities of the 2016 Lake County Community Health Needs Assessment and the Healthy
California 2020 Framework. More details of HCC, Hope Rising Lake, and the Community Needs
Assessment are presented in the Background Report of the General Plan.
