                    A. Environmental Impact Report
      Section 1. Findings of Adequacy. The City Council HEREBY FINDS
 and DETERMINES, after review and considering the information in the Draft
 Environmental Impact Report, that:
 a. The Draft Environmental Impact Report (DEIR) prepared for the
     Comprehensive General Plan has been completed in accordance with
     the California Environmental Quality Act. It contains a complete and
     accurate accounting of all environmental impacts which may be expected;
     considers a reasonable range of alternatives; and identifies significant
     cumulative and long-term impacts which may be best addressed with
     the policies of the proposed general plan document; and
 b. Of those alternative considered, the environmentally superior alternative
     is the adoption of the Proposed General Plan discussed in Section 6 of the
     Draft Environmental Impact Report presented before t h e Planning
     Commission and City Council, at public hearings on August 12,1998,
     August 26, 1998, September 9, 1998, and December 7, 1998;
c. The mitigation measures contained in the Draft Environmental Impact
    Report represent a reasonable effort to eliminate the environmental
    consequences associated with implementation of the General Plan, and
    all the mitigation measures shall be incorporated in the General Plan by
    this reference.
    Section 2. Certification of Final Environmental Impact Report.
The city Council HEREBY CERTIFIES approval of the Environmental Impact
Report, Case No. 86-97EIR, as amended to incorporate all changes resulting
from the public hearing process; and HEREBY ORDERS that a Notice of

     Section 3. Findings.         The City Council HEREBY FINDS AND
DETERMINES that:
a. Com~letenessand Adecruacy. The revised General Plan contains a
    thorough and adequate treatment of land use, environmental, economic
    and development issues that have been updated to reflect current and
    future conditions. The revised plan also incorporates policies addressing
    both state and local laws, regional plans and other documents enacted or
    adopted during the past decade.
b. Promotion of Public Health, Safetv and Welfare. The revised General Plan
    continues to provide a wide variety of techniques to enhance the public
    health safety, and welfare incorporating defensive space strategies, new
    fire hazard policies, airport land use policies, noise, transportation, and
    emergency planning. The plan continues to support housing opportunities
    through the continuation of neighborhood housing development, and
    specialized zoning controls for targeted housing and social service needs.
    The plan continues to protect the public health by limiting development
    to those areas capable of sustaining it without irreversible or unmitigated
    damage to the environment. Finally, the plan incorporates regional policies
    within the text, drawn from a variety of plans adopted for the region and
    East San Gabriel Valley subregion.
c. Good Citv Planninq Practices. The revised General plan represents
    a continuation of the City's good planning practices by limiting
    development intensity in those areas which cannot be served by
    critical public facilities and by reducing environmental damage by
    strengthening design and environmental controls.
d. Relationshir, to Environmental I m ~ a c Re~ort.

    Council that the General Plan and Environmental Impact Report be
    construed as integrally related documents. The City Council FINDS that

    concerns and mitigation measures of the Draft Environmental Impact
    Report into the General Plan, and vice versa. In the event that by error or
    omission some issue, policy, mitigation measure or action has not been
    incorporated from the report into the General Plan, the mitigation measure
    shall be incorporated into the General Plan by this reference.

'En volumes are estimated maximum daily capacity for respective arterial classifications. Arterial
capacity is affected by such factors as intersections (spacing,configuration,and control features),
degree of access control, roadway grades, design geometries (horizontaland vertical alignment
standards),sight distance, vehicle mix (truck and bus traffic),and pedestrian and bicycle traffic.

TABLE N-1 illustrates guidelines for land-
use compatibility with noise levels as
established by the State Office of
Noise Control.
The standards for noise and land use
vary considerably,depending on their
type and nature. TABLE 1-1 categorizes
noise levels accordng to whether a
particular noise level is acceptable.
Noise exposure is "normally accept-
able" if the level of exposure does not
require any special noise insulation
or special construction techniques to
reduce interior noise levels. The
maximum noise level considered to
be normally acceptable for singlefam-
 ily residential development is 60 dBA
 and for multiple-family development,
 65 dBA.
 The state also provides additional
 standards through the implementa-
 tion of the State Noise Insulation Stan-
 dards. These standards apply to new
 multiple-family residential develop-
 ment located in areas exposed to
 ambient noise levels that exceed 60
 dB (CNEL or Ldn.) New multiple-fam-
 ily development in these areas must
 reduce exterior to interior noise lev-
 els through insulation, construction,
 or design.

LINED STREEIS,MURALS,AND ARCHEOLOGICAL SEES ARE IRREPLACEABLE ASSETS THAT CONTRIBUTE
TO OUR COMMUNITY'S RICH TEXTURE.    THEYPROVIDE A SENSE OF CONTINUITYAND STABILEY IN
A FASTCHANGING WORLD.     AS NON-RENEWABLE RESOURCES, ONCE DESTROYED, THEY ARE GONE
FOREVER.
LA VERNE'SLEADERS HAVE       LONG RECOGNIZED THIS.  WE HAVE BEEN         ABLE    TO RETAIN AND
W A N D CULTURAL RESOURCES BY ADOPTING REGULATIONS THAT FAVOR PRESERVATION, AND HAVE
FOSTERED AN ATMOSPHERE THAT ENABLES PRESERVATION TO BE BROUGHT TO THE TABLE IN DAILY
DECISION-MAKING.    SUCHACTIONS AND ATTITUDES   HAVE PROVIDED A GOOD FOUNDATION FOR
PRESERVATION IN LA VERNE.
EXPERIENCE    HAS SHOWN THAT   WITHOUT CONSCIENTIOUS PRESERVATION EFFORTS, CITIES LOSE
CULTURAL RESOURCES THROUGH NEGLECT, DEMOLITION, HARMF'UL ALTERATIONS, OR AS AN
UNINTENDED RESULT OF LAND USE POLICIES THAT ARE DRWEN SOLELY BY ECONOMICS, ESPECIALLY
IN TIMES OF RAPID GROWTH.   IGNORANCE OF THEIR VALUE COMBINED WITH DETERIORATION OVER
TIME USUALLY SPELL DOOM FOR CULTURALRESOURCES. THEY      ARE LOST BIT BY BIT. THERESULT
IS A SENSE OF PLACELESSNESS THAT OCCURS WHEN REAL PHYSICAL LINKS WITH THE PAST HAVE
BEEN REMOVED.
BYADOPTING PRESERVATION MEASURES, WE AVOID THE DESTRUCTNE SIDE EFFECTS OF GROWTH
AND RETfCN CULTURAL RESOURCES THAT ARE INCREASINGLY VALUABLE COMMUNEY ASSETS.

HOUSING      CONSUMES      MORE ACRES THAN ANY OTHER KIND OF LAND USE IN OUR CITY.               THE
MAINTENANCE AND UPKEEP OF HOUSING AND NEIGHBORHOODS IS A MATTER OF PRIMARY
IMPORTANCE TO US.         IN ADDITION TO OUR OWN CONCERNS ABOUT HOUSWG STOCK AND HOUSING
QUALITY, THE       STATE   REQUIRES CITIES TO ADDRESS THE SPECIFIC HOUSING NEEDS OF PEOPLE
WHOSE REQUIREMENTS ARE OFTEN OVERLOOKED BY CONVENTIONAL RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT
- THE ELDERLY, THE HANDICAPPED, LOW AND MODERATE INCOME FAMILIES AND OVERCROWDED
HOUSMOLDS.
THISCHAPTER IS          THEREFORE PARTICULARLY CONCERNED WITH HOUSING FOR FAMILIES WHOSE
NEEDS ARE HARDEST TO FULFILL.         IT IDENTIFES THE NUMBER AND TYPE OF HOUSEHOLDS IN NEED
AND DISCUSSES WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN ASSIST THEM.
